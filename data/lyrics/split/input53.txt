Tell-Tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet, wet

[Verse 3]
Where you goin'?
Whatcha say?
I'm why her river flowin' to another lake
Another ocean, another ocean
On the beach, on the beach
Let-Let me dip my feet and get wet

[Chorus]
Tell me baby are you wet
I'm wanna get you wet
Tell-Tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet, wet
Tell me baby are you wet
I'm wanna get you wet
Tell-Tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet, wet

[Outro]
Tell me baby are you wet, wet, wet
(Bounce
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce)

I can't believe that every day and every night (Bounce)
It's gettin' better with you out of my life (Bounce)
It's like I flicked a switch and now I'm feeling good (Bounce)
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could (Bounce)

When the waking comes I know I feel alive (Bounce)
You will be the last thing on my mind (Bounce)
No regrets, do you know what that means?

Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild, we bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back

I can love again tonight, we bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
(Bounce
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce)

Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild, we bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
I don't care what anybody thinks about that
I'll be the one to show you the way
You'll be the one to always complain
Three in the morning, come a-bang-bang-bang
All out of fags and I just can't wait

Cancel the thing that I said I'd do
I don't feel comfortable talking to you
Unless you got the zipper fixed on my shoe
Then I'll be in the lobby drinking for two

Eighteen, balding, star
Golden, fallen heart

Look at the shakies, what's with the blush?
Fresh off the plane in my fuzzy rush
Everyone's gathered to idolize me
I hate the way you talk, your Japanese scream

It's been too long since I've left the shed
You kick the bucket, I'll swing my legs
Always remember the pact that we made
Too young to die, but old is the grave
Eighteen, balding, star
Golden, fallen heart

I'ma gonna show the way
I'ma gonna show the way
I'ma gonna show the way
I'ma gonna show the way
Eighteen, balding, star
I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees

Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
Ooo-ooo, hoo-ooo
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh yeah

I don't need no money
Fortune or fame
I got all the riches, baby
One man can claim

Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

(Talkin' 'bout my girl)
I got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
I've even got the month of May with my girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)
Talkin' bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout my girl
'Cause everybody
Is Kung Fu Fighting
Your mind becomes fast
As lightning
Although the future
Is a little bit frightening
It's the book of your life
That you're writing

You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way
Now what would it take to break
I believe that you can bend
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

'Cause everybody
Is Kung Fu Fighting
Your mind becomes fast
As lightning
Although the future
Is a little bit frightening
It's the book of your life
That you're writing
You are a natural
Why is it so hard to see
Maybe it's just because
You keep on looking at me
The journey's a lonely one
So much more than we know
But sometimes you've got to go
Go on and be your own hero

'Cause everybody
Is Kung Fu Fighting
Your mind becomes fast
As lightning
Although the future
Is a little bit frightening
It's the book of your life
That you're writing

You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way
Now what would it take to break
I believe that you can bend
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win
'Cause everybody
Is Kung Fu Fighting
Your mind becomes fast
As lightning
Although the future
Is a little bit frightening
It's the book of your life
That you're writing
Purple haze, all in my brain
Lately things they don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
Excuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple haze, all around
Don't know if I'm comin' up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
What ever it is, that girl put a spell on me

Help me
Help me
Oh, no, no

Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh, yeah!

Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowin', blowin' my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?
Ooo
Help me
Ahh, yea-yeah, purple haze
Oh, no, oh
Oh, help me
Tell me, tell me, purple haze
I can't go on like this
Purple haze
You're makin' me blow my mind
Purple haze, n-no, nooo
Purple haze
For so long I was out in the cold
And I taught myself to believe every story I told
It was fun hanging onto the moon, heading into the sun;
But it's been too long
Now I want to come home

Came so close to the edge of defeat
But I made my way in the shade keeping out of the heat
It was fun shooting out at the stars, looking into the sun;
But it's been too long
Now I want to come home

Home, where there's nothing but sweet surrender
To the memories from afar
Home, to the place where the truth lies waiting
We remember who we are

For too long I was out on my own
Everyday I spent trying to prove I could make it alone
It was fun hanging onto the moon, heading into the sun;
But it's been too long
Now I want to come home
Home
For so long I was out in the cold
But I taught myself to believe every story I told
It was fun hanging onto the moon, heading into the sun;
But it's been too long
Now I want to come home

Yeah, it's been too long
And now I want to come home

Been too long
Now I want to come home
These days, with the world getting colder
She spends more time sleeping over
Than I'd planned

Tonight we're gonna order in
Drinking wine and watchin CNN
It's dark I know, but then again
It's the brightest thing I got

When I'm covered in rain
Now, I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain

From fireworks to fireplaces
Summer stole what fall replaces
And now we're people watching
All the people, people watching us right back
Standing by the missing signs
At the CVS, by the checkout line
She puts her quiet hands in mine
Cause she's the brightest thing I've got
When I'm covered in rain
Cause I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain
Cause I'm covered in rain
No I'm covered in rain

And come December, Lydia left
She mentioned something 'bout it being for the best
And I can't say I disagree, and it's killing me
And now I'm standing facing west
Tracing my fingers round a silhouette
I haven't gotten used to yet
But it's the brightest thing I've got

When I'm covered in rain
Now, I'm covered in rain, rain
No, I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain
I'm covered in, covered in, covered in rain
Oh Oh Mary
Oh Oh Mary

Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned?
Oh, Mary, don't you weep

Well, Satan got mad and he knows I'm glad
Missed that soul that he thought he had
Now, didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned?
Oh, Mary, don't you weep

Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned?
Oh, Mary, don't you weep

Well, one of these nights around twelve o'clock
This old town's gonna really rock
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned?
Oh, Mary, don't you weep
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned?
Oh, Mary, don't you weep

Cheer up, sisters and don't you cry
There'll be good times bye and bye
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned?
Oh, Mary, don't you weep

Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned?
Oh, Mary, don't you weep

Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned?
Oh, Mary, don't you weep
I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
I can't believe that is real
The way that you made me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide
I know it's you and me baby, yeah

That makes the world go round
And it's keeping me here loving you baby
Laying all my troubles down
Here I am baby come and take me
Here I am baby come and take me

Take me by the hand
Oh, show me here I am baby, take me
Oh.. it always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
From love that I cannot hide
You broke my heart into half
I know it's you and me
Baby yeah...
That makes the world go round
And it's keeping me here loving you baby
Laying all my troubles down
Here I am baby come and take me
Here I am baby come and take me

[Intro]
(Crowd screams)
Well love was kind, for a time
But now just aches and it makes me blind
This mirror holds my eyes too bright
I can't see the others in my life

[Verse 1]
Were we too young?
Our heads too strong?
To bear the weight of these lover's eyes
'Cause I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Beneath the curse of these lover's eyes

[Chorus]
But do not ask the price I pay
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord, forget all of my sins
Oh, let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lover's eyes

[Verse 2]
There's no drink nor drug I tried
To rid the curse of these lover's eyes
And I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Your strength just makes me feel less strong

[Chorus]
But do not ask the price I pay
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord, forget all of my sins
Oh, let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lover's eyes

[Bridge]
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, I'll be on my way

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
Hello everyone, so much for the show
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you
Once upon most every morning
I woke up to her flying there
Hummingbird was making blows of
Blowing rings of purple in the air

All the while
I was trying to keep her there
Now I'm man enough to leave
Man enough to always care
Hummingbird
Hummingbird

That's all I heard
That's my hummingbird

Just because I said I didn't want her
Doesn't mean I want her to go
In fact, I quite depended on her
But that I didn't want her to know
Now that's she's gone I know
All the while
I was trying to keep her there, ya
Now man enough to leave
Man enough to always care
Hummingbird
Hummingbird
That's all I heard
That's my Hummingbird
Hummingbird
Hummingbird

Is it too late
Too late, hummingbird?
Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight

I am gonna love you till the end
I will love you till I reach the end
I will love you till I die
I will see you in the sky
Tonight
What'll it be now mister mole
Whispers sloth in curls of smoke
Take a back seat, or play pharaoh
Dance with me and shake your bones
Slow down
It's a science
He's been waiting to
Bring you down
Snake eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you child
Leopards laze each on plush pillows
Slender capes of red and chrome
Paperback dreams in their deep doze
Twitch their toes to black mambo
Slow down
It's a science
He's been waiting to
Bring you down
Snake eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you child
Wanna play cheat now says the sloth
A domino flush to his nose
Tickle that cheek and take your throne
Pump your veins with gushing gold
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you

It's alright!

Round round, get around, I get around (it's alright)
Downtown, boogie down, I get around (it's alright)
Round round, get around, I get around (it's alright)
Downtown, boogie down, I get around

Round round we go when we lookin' for hoes
We line 'em up and knock 'em down, it's like tic tac toe
We on a roll spittin' flows every day of the week
We might not got a lotta dough but we get paid by the freak
We movin' east, different cities, different girls, different titties
And we get 'em by the dozens, call 'em groupie committees
We gettin' busy like Bone all up in college dorms
If you ain't takin' us home then you can leave us alone!
Everywhere that I go, people know me by the way I flow
I keep it movin' in the right direction
And everyday you know that's how I'm livin'
It's alright!

Round round, get around, I get around (it's alright)
Downtown, boogie down, I get around (it's alright)
Round round, get around, I get around
We go round, round, round, round

Two kids at the ocean shore diggin' for change
Savin' up to buy an aeroplane and take us away
My crew has been around the block so all the girls know my game
Plus my milk money is s-s-sour, way past the date
So if you know where we can grow a pound of grow we can roll
Rock a show in Tokyo and kick a foot, OHIO!
Put the O wit' Oreo we go, the power of soul
Round and round we go but where we stop nobody knows!

It's alright!
Round, round, get around, I get around (it's alright)
Downtown, boogie down, I get around (it's alright)
Round, round, get around, I get around (it's alright)
Downtown, boogie down, I get it around

Yo, come and get it, come and check it, see what we got
We about to set it, 'bout to wreck, it makin' you hop
Out ya shoes out ya socks, gettin' hot off the pot
So stay in tune, please don't move and keep the station on lock
Cause we fly around the world so hold it down while we gone
Haven't been home in a minute and my hair's gettin' low
I'll be back, but gone tomorrow, with the wind in the blows
I'm gonna rock the microphone 'til I'm a hundred years old!
Everywhere that I go, people know me by the way I flow
I keep it movin' in the right direction
And everyday you know that's how I'm livin'
It's alright!

Round round, get around, I get around (it's alright)
Downtown, boogie down, I get around (it's alright)
Round round, get around, I get around
We go round, round, round, round

It's alright! (it's alright)
It's alright! (it's alright)
It's alright! (it's alright)
It's alright! (it's alright)
You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
I'm so en-captured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it, got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
I'm latching on to you

[Verse One]
I hate to see you cry
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen

[Chorus]
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good

[Verse Two]
You know, it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
But then, the circle of your friends
Will defend the silver lining

[Chorus]
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
But I know that the heart of my life is good
Of your life is good

[Outro]
We're in repair
We're not together but we're getting there
Yeah, oh yeah, no!
Cold ground was my bed last night
And rock was my pillow too
Cold ground was my bed last night
And rock was my pillow too, yeah

I'm sayin talkin' blues, talkin' blues
They say your feet is just too big for your shoes
Talkin' blues, talkin' blues
Your feet is just too big for your shoes

I've been down on the rock so long
I seem to wear a permanent screw, yeah
I've been down on the rock so long
I seem to wear a permanent screw
But I'm, i'm gonna stare in the sun
Let the rays shine in my eyes
I'm a gonna take a just a one step more
Cause I feel like bombing a church, now
Now that you know that the preacher is lying
So who's gonna stay at home
When, when the freedom fighters are fighting
Talkin' blues, talkin' blues
They say your feet is just too big for your shoes, whoa
Talkin' blues, keep on, talkin' blues
They say, you hear what they say, didn't you hear?

Cold ground was my bed last night
Rock stone, rock stone, rock stone was my pillow
Cold ground was my bed last night
And rock was my pillow too

Sayin talkin' blues, talkin' blues
I seem to wear a permanent, permanent screw
Talkin' blues, talkin' blues
They say your feet is just too big for your shoes
I pulled into Nazareth just a feelin' 'bout a half past dead
I just need to find a place where I can lay my head
Mister can you tell me where a man might find a bed?
He just grinned and shook my hand and "No" was all he said
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me
I picked up my bag and went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw old Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side
And I said, "Hey Carmen, come on will you go downtown?"
She said, "Well I gotta go but my friend can stick around anyhow"
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me
Go down Miss Moses, ain't nothin' that you can say
'Cause is just old Luke and Luke's waitin' on the judgment day
Well now Luke my friend, what about young Anna Lee?
He said, "Do me a favor son
Won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company?"
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me
Crazy Chester followed me yeah, and he caught me in the fog
He said, "I would fix your rack, oh yeah if you'll just take Jack, my dog"
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I am a peaceful man"
He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can?"
Won't ya take a load off Fanny?
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me
Catch a cannon ball now, to take me down the line
'Cause my bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone
I want you to take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Welcome one and all to the show
We're wired up, fired up, fucking ready to go
In the back of the parking lot, outside of the bar
Twenty deep, twenty feet from the boulevard

Black hoodies, black caps, black label in glasses
Previewing the new shit before all the masses
'Cause the first thing I need when I've got a new beat
Is to see how it sounds, echoing off the street

I just take it for a spin, pop the CD in
Slide it up to ten and get that rear view shaking
Then play it again so there's no mistaking
San Andreas the block, get this bitch earthquaking

Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You love the things I say I do
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you
You take away, when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and (Mike Shinoda)]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned
You like to think you're never wrong (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Intro: Meek Mill]
M-m-m-m-a
No, no, no, no, no, no
These hoes, they like niggas that spend money, not talk about it
If you ain't gonna get the money then watcha gonna do?
Hey!

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed pedico with baking soda
I made a million on that corner
Going Donald Trump numbers on the corner
I made a million on that corner
Graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I made a million on that, I made a million on that
I made a million on that corner

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Young rich nigga, I flex, look at my neck
Look at my bitch, look at my wrist, got these niggas upset
Who you know blow a mill? Don't even think twice, no sweat
And these hoes around me?
You don't fuck, you don't give them no check
Cause ya'll niggas lame as fuck, none of these chumps can't hang with us
All these chains getting tangled up
And my clique armed and dangerous, and we'll flame you up
You get smoked mothafucker like angel dust
Start the Rolls Royce with the angel up
All these niggas on angels bruh, but I got stripes like a bengal does
And my wrist look like the flash on
Come that ho and bring that ass on
So I can beat it up like you stole something
Might pop a purple, go mad long like skrrt
Been through your hood in a wraith, niggas is jealous, just look at your face
3-57 get put in your place, follow my lead all you niggas is late
Like hold up, hold up, I done made a million on that corner
I bought some coke but couldn't deal with Arizona
Them yellow diamonds looking clearer than Corona
And if they act like they ain't with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm on the corner gettin' cake
I'm talkin' like it's 88
Givenchy all I really play
Kingpin status when I swerve up on the block
A nigga like you, you wouldn't even get the cock
Get my money dolo, I just need some help to count it
I'm the richest nigga outta Dayton-Broward County
Feds know my game, they keep it raw, we all at odds
Repossess my Lambo cause they wanna build a charge
When they got my Chevy, got it runnin' like it's 'sposed to
Hit up on my niggas, let 'em know my shop reopened
We rockin' everything, till I'm right back on the top
Nasdaq hustle bitch, come get your ass in stocks

[Hook]

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Ugh, Double M, bang!
Birds flying high you know how I feel Sun in the sky you know how I feel Breeze driftin' on by you know how I feel
It's a new dawn It's a new day It's a new life For me And I'm feeling good
Fish in the sea you know how I feel River running free you know how I feel Blossom on the tree you know how I feel
It's a new dawn It's a new day It's a new life For me And I'm feeling good
Stars when you shine you know how I feel Scent of the pine you know how I feel Oh freedom is mine And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn It's a new day It's a new life For me And I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good

[Intro: Beyoncé]
Alright ladies and gentlemen, i want y'all to scream loud and proud for Ed Ed Sheeran

[Verse 1: Ed Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé]
Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

[Chorus: Ed Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

[Verse 2: Ed Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé]
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
Because we've only just begun

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé]
Didn't know that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on
Blah! (SCATTING)

**HIGHER GROUND**

[Intro: Beyoncé]
All the way from Texas i want y'all to get up on your feet, give it up for Gary Clark Jr

[Verse 1: Beyoncé & Gary Clark Jr.]
People keep on learning
Soldiers keep on warring
World keep on turning
Because it won't be too long

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Powers keep on lying
While your people keep on dying
World keep on turning
Because it won't be too long

[Chorus: Beyoncé, Gary Clark Jr. & Ed Sheeran]
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
Until I reach my highest ground

[Guitar Break: Beyoncé, Gary Clark Jr. & Ed Sheeran]
Come on play that thing Gary
Play that thing, play that thing, play that thing

[Chorus: Beyoncé, Gary Clark Jr. & Ed Sheeran]
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin

Going to keep on trying
Until I reach my highest ground

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on
Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on
We Love You Stevie!
I'm so alive
I'm so enlightened
I can barely survive
A night in my mind
I've got a plan
I'm gonna find out just how boring I am
And have a good time

Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine
I've been cool
With my new golden rule

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

Is there a God?
Why is he waiting?
Don't you think of it odd
When he knows my address?
And look at the stars
Don't it remind you just how feeble we are?
Well it used to, I guess
Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine
I've been cool
With my new golden rule

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

I'm a new man
I wear a new cologne and
You wouldn't know me if your eyes were closed
I know what you'll say
'This won't last longer than the rest of the day'
But you're wrong this time

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
I'm over the analyzing
Tonight

Stop trying to figure it out
Deep will only bring you down
You know, I used to be the back porch poet with a book of rhymes
Always open knowing all the time I'm probably
Never gonna find the perfect rhyme
For 'heavier things'
I worry, I weigh three times my body
I worry, I throw my fear around
But this morning
There's a calm I can't explain
The rock candy's melted, only diamonds now remain, oh
By the time I recognize this moment
This moment will be gone
But I will bend the light pretending
That it somehow lingered on, well I got is oh
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will pay no mind
When it won't and it won't because it can't
It just can't (It's not supposed to)
Was there a second of time I looked around?
Did I sail through or drop my anchor down?
Was anything enough to kiss the ground
And say I'm here now?
And she is here now, oh
So much wasted in the afternoon
So much sacred in the month of June
How 'bout you?
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever (yeah)
And I will wait to find
That it won't, and it won't and it won't
And I will pay no mind
Worried 'bout no rainy weather (yeah)
And I will waste no time
Remaining in our lives together
This is for you ms. ann
Who is now with our heavenly father
Who made the real commandments

A ma zing gra a a a ace
How sweet (how ow sweet sweet)
The sound (the sound)
Souououound
That saved (saaaaved)
Saved a wretch (a wretch)
Like meeee
I once was lo o ost (lo o ost)
Lo o o o ost (lo o o ost)
But now but now
I'm found
What you say girl?
But now i'm found
They still can't feel you
But now (ad-libs)
I'm found
Was blind
But now
I seeeeeeeeee
Oooooooooh, ooooooooh
(to the melody of amazing grace w/ ad-libs from beyonce)

Twas grace hath taught my heart to fear
And the grace my fears relieved(my fears relieved)
How precious did that grace appear(w/ad-libs)
The hour i first believed (w/ad-libs)

Destiny's
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Get sleazy
We started out so cute in our baby pictures
That mommy shot for our daddy so that he wouldn't forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day hell remember
If not hes human, Im human, you human, well forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can't see how momma hates him
Hes such a cool a-s guy, then wonder why she date him
Im only 8, Im not old enough, guess its complicated
Two parent dwellings, expelling have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it dont get negated
I was gon save it for later but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and through through, but its the 19802s
But now that we are cool cool, she sippin Irish Baileys
She say Stacks, youre true blue?
I said Nah, Im Navy
I call her Kesha, she like it, because its hood to her
She call me Andre 6000 cause Im good to her
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you or your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
You can't imagine the immensity of the f*ck Im not giving
About your money and man servant at the mansion you live in
And I dont wanna go places where all my ladies can't get in
Just grab a bottle, some boys, and lets take it back to my basement
And get sleazy, sick of all your lines, so cheesy
Sorry daddy, but Im not that easy
Im not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it and work it
Imma take it back to where my man and my girls is
Sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, cause imma get
Sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, cause imma get
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat, gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
I dont mean to critique on your seduction technique
But your moneys not impressing me, its kinda weak
That you really think youre gonna get my rocks off
Get my top and socks off, by showing me the dollars in your drop box
Me and all my friends, we dont buy bottles, we bring em
We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave em
And I dont care if you stare and you call us scummy
Cause we ain't after your affection, and sure as hell not your money, honey
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boujee friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat, gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beats so fat, gonna make me come
Um, um, um, over to your place!
Ah yeah!
There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong, lord, have mercy
This key won't unlock this door
Something's goin' on here
I have a bad bad feeling
That my baby don't live here no more
Well, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back up on the hill
That's something to do
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back yonder cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Ain't no love, baby, like my baby's love
It's like burnin' fire, mm, shut up in my bones, I got to say it
Ain't no lonely days (Lonely days), mm, mm
Ain't no lonely nights (Lonely nights)
And everything that she does
You know the girl's alright (You know the girl's alright), I said

[Chorus]
I ain't never, never found me a girl (I wouldn't lie about it, baby)
Never, never found me a girl (To squeeze me tight at night)
Never, never found me a girl (Hey, hey)
Nobody to love me like you do (I ain't lying about it, baby)
Love me like you do (Sweet baby)

[Verse 2]
Ain't no man got a sweet woman like me
She's everything in the world
One man could claim, let me say that
She's every poor boy's dream (Every poor boy's dream), uh-huh
And she's every very rich man's prayer (Every rich man's prayer)
I don't need no money, honey, because, you know
She's always there, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
Never, never found me a girl (Somebody to keep me walking in my shoes)
Never, never found me a girl (She always brings me good news)
Never, never found me a girl, hey (I never found a girl)
To love me like you do, oh, baby
Love me like you do, baby, hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And here I stand with tears in my eyes (Never, never found me a girl)
And I'm caught by total surprise (Never, never found me a girl)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Never, never found me a girl)
To love me like you do (Oh, sweet baby)
Love me like you do (I ain't never found a girl, hey, hey, baby)

[Outro]
You do (You squeeze me tight, love me right, oh, baby)
You do (Got me walking in my shoes, uh-huh, yeah)
You do (Make me feel good, oh)
You do (You make me feel good, hey, hey, baby)
You do (I never, never, never, never, never)
You do (Never found a girl, hey, love me like you do)
Well the first days are the hardest days, don't you worry any more
'Cause when life looks like easy street, there is danger at your door
Think this through with me, let me know your mind
Wo, oh, what I want to know, is are you kind
It's a buck dancer's choice my friend better take my advice
You know all the rules by now and the fire from the ice
Will you come with me won't you come with me
Wo, oh, what I want to know, will you come with me
Goddamn, well I declare, have you seen the like
Their wall are built of cannonballs, their motto is don't tread on me
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come with me, or go alone, he's come to take his children home
It's the same story the crow told me; it's the only one he knows
Like the morning sun you come and like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate, barely time to wait
Wo, oh, what I want to know, where does the time go
I live in a silver mine and I call it beggar's tomb
I got me a violin and I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice, I can hear your voice
Wo, oh, what I want to know, how does the song go
Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about, here beside the rising tide
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come on along, or go alone, he's come to take his children home
Wo, oh, what I want to know, how does the song go
Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about, here beside the rising tide
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come on along, or go alone, he's come to take his children home
Hold me like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee, you are my friend
Carry me like you are my brother
Love me like a mother, will you be there?

Yeah, hold on, yeah
Hold on, oh, yeah

When weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost, will you find me?
But they told me, a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end but I'm only human

Yeah, oh, hold on
Yeah, oh, yeah

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show to me
You'll be there for me and care enough to bear me?
(Hold me) Show me
(Lay your head lowly) Told me
(Softly then boldly) Yeah
(Carry me there) I'm only human

(Lift me) Hold me
(Love me and feed me) Yeah, I can
(Kiss me and free me) Yeah
(I will feel blessed) I'm only human

(Carry) Carry
(Carry me boldly) Carry me
(Lift me up slowly) Yeah
(Carry me there) I'm only human

(Save me) Lift me
(Heal me and bathe me) Give me up, give me up
(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there) I will be there

(Lift me) Told me
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly) Yeah
(Show me you care) Yeah

(Hold me) Hoo
(Lay your head lowly) Get lonely sometimes
(Softly then boldly) I get lonely, yeah yeah
(Carry me there) Yeah
(Need me) Hoo
(Love me and feed me) Give me up, hold me up, give me up sometimes
(Kiss me and free me) oh, sometimes
(I will feel blessed) Yeah

In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care? Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence

Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part for you're always in my heart
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
(2x)

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you

Some of them want to be abused
Sweet dreams are made of this (3x)
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused (2x)
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo woo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo woo doo

Walk, little walk, small talk, big thoughts
Gonna tell 'em all just what I want
That street, two streets, I see you and me
Hanging on the empty swings

Count high low, don't worry, my eyes are closed
I'm the Superman and it's my show
One shoe, two, gonna kick with my new shoes
I'm gonna kick until I need new shoes

Yeah, yeah
I said-ah don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things

Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo woo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo woo doo
(These are one of those times when we're gonna have a lot of fun)
I run, they run, everybody run run
And we're all just having fun
Sleigh ride, boat ride, piggyback a-ride
I'm going to show them all how I can ride

One two three, close your eyes and count to four
I'm gonna hide behind my bedroom door
Crayons on walls, I'll color on 'em all
Draw until I've broken every law

Yeah, yeah
I said-ah don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop

Don't stop
Don't stop

I said-ah don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things

Ha, ha, ha
Ah, ha ha ha
Ahh
I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
Whatcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, mean, big and bad, Lord
Pointin' that gun at me
"Oh, wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble wit' chu
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"

"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
For sure
Well, the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son, well it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
Show me the back door
Can you lie next to her
And give her your heart, your heart
As well as your body
And can you lie next to her
And confess your love, your love
As well as your folly
And can you kneel before the king
And say I'm clean, I'm clean

[Chorus]
Tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart
Oh tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart
A white blank page and a swelling rage, rage
You did not think when you sent me to the brink, to the brink
You desired my attention but denied my affections, my affections

[Chorus]
Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life
Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life
"Welcome to the real world", she said to me
Condescendingly
"Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white"
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you "stay inside the lines"
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take
The so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits, and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't
Find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies
They love to tell you "stay inside the lines"
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above

I am invincible as long as I'm alive

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait 'til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for

[Verse 1]
You were cold
As the blood through your bones
And the light which led us
From our chosen homes
Well, I was lost
And now I sleep
Sleep the hours that I can't weep
When all I knew was steeped in blackened holes
I was lost, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm, hmm

[Chorus]
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn

[Verse 2]
And I was still
But I was under your spell
When I was told by Jesus, all was well
So all must be well
Just give me time
You know your desires and mine
So wrap my flesh in ivy and in twine
For I must be well

[Chorus]
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Oh, keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn (Hey!)

[Bridge]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

[Chorus]
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn

[Outro]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Cheers, thank you very much!

[Verse 1]
I know where you went, but I don't know how you got there
I know where you went, but I don't know how you got there
Silver tongue hill, where you talk up what I'd play down
I would speak up, but I wouldn't know what to say
(Say)

[Chorus]
Lucidity, come back to me (Put)
Lucidity, come back to tell
Lucidity, come back to me (Put)
Lucidity, come back to me (Come back to me)

[Verse 2]
Silver tongue hill, where you talk up what I'd play down
I would speak up, but I wouldn't know what to say
Wandering around like spare time never knew it
I might suck, fizzle or I might just float away

[Bridge]
Ah-ah-ahh-ah
Ah-ah-ahh-ah
Ah-ah-ahh-ah
Ah-ah-ahh-ah

[Chorus]
Lucidity, come back to me (Put)
Lucidity, come back to tell
Lucidity, come back to me (Put)
Lucidity, come back to me (Come back to me)
Lucidity, come back to me (Put)
Lucidity, come back to tell
Lucidity, come back to me (Put)
Lucidity, come back to me (Come back to me)

I'll be giving up, oh
Home is where the heart is
And I gave it to you in a paper bag
Even though it's tarnished
You told me it's the best you ever had
You got my secret combination
And I don't be giving that out easily
With my deep dedication
You can tell that you were brought the same for me
So please don't let go
'Cause you know
Exactly what we found
So please don't let go
My darling
You keep me hooked up underground
It's gonna be you
And me
It's gonna be everything you've ever dreamed
It's gonna be who
And me
It's gonna be everything and everything, we're meant to be
We're meant to be
Rolling with the punches
So they won't get inside our happiness
Love is always hunted
But you're white rose is soaring through my tear
'Cause you know you give me something
Yeah you give me exactly what I need
Got my blood pumping
You know you always draw more blood, I bleed
So please don't let go
'Cause you know
Exactly what we found
So please don't let go
My darling
You keep me hooked up underground
It's gonna be you
And me
It's gonna be everything you've ever dreamed
It's gonna be who
And me
It's gonna be everything and everything, we're meant to be
In you're big house on the hills
Where you keep your dollar bills
And you stashed my heart somewhere in the dark
Keep it safe I know you will
Know you will, know you will, know you will
I know you will

[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don’t touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity’s too much
And I’ll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I’d be smart to walk away
But you’re quicksand

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I, like it

[Verse 2]
I can’t decide if it’s a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you’re friction

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I, like it

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should
Think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home

[Chorus]
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I

[Breakdown]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should
Think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home
I’ll follow you, follow you home

[Outro]
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I, like it
Well, I travel at a speed
Of a reborn man
I got a lot of love to give
From the mirrors of my hand
I said a message of love
Don't you run away
Look at your heart
Come along with me today

Well I am what I am thank you
Some people just don't understand
Find yourself first
And then your tool
Find yourself first
Don't you be no fool

Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chains
Messin' with that fool babe
Your life is pain
If you want to be free
Come along with me
Don't mess with the man
He'll never understand
I said find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
So if you come alive
You better prove to the man
You're as strong as him
Everybody come alive
Everybody love alive
Everybody love alive
Everybody hear my message

[Verse 1]
Remembering the days when our love began
Thinkin' of a million ways to escape and be with you
But reality wasn't just you and I
It was long drawn out days and lonely nights

[Pre-Chorus]
Dreamin' 'bout you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
And I'm dreamin' 'bout
When you would say

[Chorus]
Let me take you to another place
When nothing ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you, ooh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, but destiny didn't have such a simple plan
I was just a girl and you a young man
How could age define something so divine?
Can this even be real or just exist in my mind?

[Pre-Chorus]
Dreamin' 'bout you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
And I'm dreamin' 'bout
When you would say

[Chorus]
Let me take you to another place
When nothing ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you, ooh

[Bridge]
Yeah, dreamin' 'bout you
I keep dreamin' 'bout you
And I'm dreamin' and praying for the day
When no one and nothing else takes up our time
Finally you're only mine
Each and every day
I'd walk with you right by my side
But instead we have to hide
Sneak around and lie just to spend time alone
If lovin' is a crime, I'd rather do the time
And leave the world behind

[Chorus]
Let me take you to another place
Where nothing ever seems to matter
It's just you and me
We can take flight like a thief in the night
Stolen moments with you, ooh

[Outro]
Let's get away
Let's get away, oh
We can get away
We can get away, oh
Let's get away
Let's get away, oh
We can get away
We can get away, oh
Talking loud, talking crazy
Love me outside
Pray for the rain to come
Don't dry again
Guess it's true what they say
I'm always late
Say you need a little space
I'm in your way

It hurts, but I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part

I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up, then I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love

What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love

I'm a fool for your games
But I always play
Can't admit it was a waste
It's too much escape

It hurts, but I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part

I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up, then I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love

What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
I can't believe what I did for love

[Verse 1]
I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

[Chorus 1]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I never would have thought
She was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
And when I held her near
She would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me

[Chorus 2]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She's lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (Look who's lovin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (She's lovin' me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Look who's lovin' me)

[Chorus 3]
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me but she was still your wife (She's wantin' me)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was lovin' me)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can (She was wantin' me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she had a family, family, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Why? Ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I’m in love

[Verse 3]
I didn't know she was already spoken for
‘Cause I’m not that kind of man
I swear that I would've never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that
I’m holdin' her to blame

[Chorus 2]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (Holdin' her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (Holdin' her to blame)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (Holdin' her to blame)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Holdin' her to blame)
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me but she was still your wife (Holdin' her to blame)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah
People never change
They seem to stay the same
They wear different clothes
But play the same games

Many different ways
To say the same thing
Searchin for the right words
The ones that would make you stay

Exchanging the way things were
For they way that they should be
Yeah
And choosing theses words
Is saying to her
The things that she never heard
But always deserved

I figured what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
Your everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry
Oh I'm not even really sure
Who made this mess
And who threw what punch
But I could not care less
All I know is that I'm here
And you are not, Ohhh
Once I put this wasted pride aside
Nothin's all I got, Ohhh

Exchanging the way things were
For they way that they should be
Yeah
And choosing theses words
Is saying to her

The things that she never heard
But always deserved

I figured what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
Your everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry
Ohh
Somebody make it stop
Yeahh
And pick me up
And just dust me off, Ohh
The rainy day flood
Will drowned all this love
Trapped at the bottom now
Please dig me up

I figured what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
Your everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry

I figured what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
Your everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry
I wanna meet Santa Claus, the real real Santa
I wanna meet Santa Claus, the real real Santa
I wanna see Santa Claus, the real real Santa
He wants to meet ol' Santa Claus
I took my brother to the department store
He wanted to show Santa his Christmas list
He stood in line and he shook like a leaf
He's only five and a half goin' on six
He said, "Is that really Santa Claus, really really Santa Claus?
(That Santa)
(The real Santa)
Is that really Santa Claus, really really Santa?
(That Santa)
(I hope he doesn't pull Santa's beard)
Is that really Santa Claus, really really Santa?"
(That Santa)
(The real Santa)
Hope he thinks that's Santa Claus
I picked him up and put him on Santa's lap
And then he pulled the pillow out of his shirt
He yanked the beard right on off of his chin
And in his eyes I could see he was hurt
He said, "You're not really Santa Claus, you're really not Santa Claus
(Not Santa)
(The real Santa)
You're not really Santa Claus, you're really not Santa
(Not Santa)
(He shouldn'ta pulled Santa's beard)
You're not Santa Claus, you're really not Santa"
(Not Santa)
(The real Santa)
He's just helpin' Santa Claus
He's just helpin' Santa Claus, the real real Santa
(Helpin' Santa)
(The real Santa)
He's helpin' Santa Claus, the real real Santa
(Helpin' Santa)
(The real Santa)
He's just helpin' Santa Claus, the real real Santa
(Helpin' Santa)
(The real Santa)
He's just helpin' Santa Claus
He's just helpin' Santa Claus, the real real Santa
(Helpin' Santa)
(The real Santa)
He's just helpin' Santa Claus, the real real Santa
(Helpin' Santa)
(He shouldn'ta pulled Santa's beard)
He's just helpin' Santa Claus, the real real Santa
(Helpin' Santa)
(The real Santa)
He's just helpin' Santa Claus
Shall I tell you about my life
They say I'm a man of the world
I've flown across every tide
And I've seen lots of pretty girls

I guess I've got everything I need
I would't ask for more
And there's no one I'd rather be
But I just wish that I'd never been born

Break:
And I need a good woman
To make me feel like a good man should
I don't say I'm a good man
Oh, but I would be if I could

I could tell you about my life
And keep you amused I'm sure
About all the times I've cried
And how I don't want to be sad anymore
And how I wish I was in love

[Intro]
Animal
I'm an animal
Animal

[Hook]
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa)
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa-animal)
The world is filled with pimps and hoes
I'm an animal inside my skin and bones

[Verse 1: Prohgress]
I'm an animal, a freak without warning
Hustling from dusk to dawn and
I give high mileage and great performance
Take a ride you can feel the horses
Proh is all business, bounty hunter
Welcome to the jungle, bust ya
Get attached, nah I ain't your man
I swing like the new tarzan
And I'm out for my next prey, can't delay
Lioness thru the glass of the mandalay
I get that play then I'm on my way
Don't love them hoes, just love the chase

[Hook]
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa)
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa-animal)
The world is filled with pimps and hoes
I'm an animal inside my skin and bones

[Verse 2: J-Splif]
I'm a beast with no leash and I reign supreme
Keep it fresh, keep it clean in the place to be
Only dream, makin cream and inhaling green
Got my team on the scene and we make you scream
Midnight at the zoo and the lights are flashing
Girls are dancing with their butt cheeks flapping
I smell reefer, somebody better pass it
To the left and I'm next to get plastered
Now that's better, back to the action
We going to play around and always keep it cracking
So let's boogie, boogie on down
I'm an animal, I'm about to get wild

[Hook]
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa)
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa-animal)
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa)
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa-animal)
I'm an animal, I, I
I'm an animal, I, I
I'm an animal, I, I
I, I, animal

[Verse 3: Kev Nish]
What's the sound, time for chow
I'll eat your insides pound for pound
Animal instincts, I'm on the prowl
Looking for a girl with a freaky style
Bare back pussy cat in the pocket
Type in the password to unlock it
After dark is when the is dogs barking
Animal house and I came to party
So I'm gonna rock right now
I'm Kev Nish and i came to get down
I'm not internationally known
But I'm here to rock the microphone so let's go

[Hook]
The world is filled with pimps and hoes
I'm an animal inside my skin and bones
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa)
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa-animal)
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa)
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa-animal)
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa)
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa-animal)
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa)
I'm an animal (a-aa-a-a-a-a-a-aa-animal)

[Chorus]
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine
The Blue Gangsta

[Verse 1]
What you gonna do?
Cause I'm gonna get to you
Nowhere ta run, nowhere ta hide
All the things you said
And the things you done to me
You can no longer make me cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you done to me, baby
I can no longer smile baby
And I've waited so long, just to carry on
I'm the Blue Gangsta

[Chorus]
What you gonna do?

The Blue Gangsta

[Verse 2]
You tricked me nine to five, lovin' you's a crime
People tellin' me, you've got another guy
I've been abused, watch me light the fuse
Said you'd be my wife, nothin' but big lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know what I've done, everything they've done
Things you've done to me, are comin' back to you
You know just what I've done, the things you've done to me
I'm the Blue Gangsta

[Chorus]
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine (oh no)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta (I'm the Blue Gangsta)

You ain't a friend of mine
(I can never fall in love)
The Blue Gangsta

[Bridge]
I am so unused to the things you said
And the things you done done to me
There is nothin' in this world to make me change

Na-aah-aaaah
Na-aah-aaaah
Na-aah-aaaah
The Blue Gangsta

[Chorus]
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine (what you gonna do?)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta (look what you put me through, baby!)
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine
(An' I just wanna fall in love)
The Blue Gangsta

Yeah!
His guitar slung across his back
His dusty boots, and as his Cadillac
A-flamin hair just a-blowin' in the wind
Ain't see a bed in so long it's a sin

He left home when he was seventeen
The rest of the world he had longed to see-ah
And everybody who knows, boss
A rolling stone gathers no moss!

Now you'd probably call him a tramp
But it goes a little deeper than that!
He's a highway chile, yeah!

Now some people say he had a girl back home
Who messed him around and did him pretty wrong
They me tell it kind of hurt him bad
Kinda made him feel pretty sad

I couldn't say what went through his mind
Anyway, he left the world behind-ah
And everybody knows the same old story
In love and war you can't lose with glory
Now you'd probably, uh, call him a tramp, but uh
I know it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile!

Walk on, brother
Yeah! Whoa, yeah
Walk on down the highway

His old guitar slung across his back
His dusty boots as his Cadillac
Flamin' hair just a-blowin' in the wind
Ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sin

Now you probably call him a tramp
But I know it goes a little deeper than that!
He's a highway chile!

Walk on brother
Don't let no one stop you
Highway chile
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Highway chile
Rolling stone
Go on down the highway, go ahead on
Highway chile
Yeah, yeah
Highway chile
Yeah, hey
Ow!

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaika's ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Intro]
'Cause it's summer time baby!
And I take myself seriously in the fall
Oh yeah!
Uh-huh!

[Verse 1]
Jump back, what's that sound?
Here she comes, full blast and top down
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
A Model citizen with zero discipline

[Chorus]
Don't you know she's coming home with me
You'll lose her in that turn
I'll get her
Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the movin' parts clean
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
Got an on-ramp comin' through my bedroom

[Chorus]
Don't you know she's coming home with me
You'll lose her in that turn
I'll get her
(Uh-oh!)
Panama
Panama (ow!)
Panama
Panama (ah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Woo!

[Verse 3]
Yeah, we're runnin' a little bit hot tonight
I can barely see the road from the heat comin' off
(You know what I'm sayin')
Ah, reach down between my legs and...ease the seat back
She's runnin', I'm flyin'
Right behind in the rearview mirror now
Got the fearin', power steerin'
Pistons poppin', ain't no stoppin' now

[Outro]
Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama (ah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Panama
Panama (ah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Panama!
When I was a little bitty boy
Just up off the floor
We used to go down to grandma's house
Ev'ry month end or so

We'd have chicken pie and country ham
And homemade butter on the bread
But the best darn thing about Grandma's house
Was a great big feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick

It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On grandma's feather bed

After supper we'd sit around the fire
The old folks'd spit and chew
Pa would talk about the farm and the war
And granny'd sing a ballad or two
I'd sit and listen and watch the fire
'Till the cobwebs filled my head
Next thing I'd know I'd wake up in the morning
In the middle of the old feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick

It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On grandma's feather bed

Well I love my ma, I love my pa
I love granny and grandpa too
I've been fishin' with my uncle, I wrestled with my cousin
I even kissed Aunt Lou, eww!
But if I ever had to make a choice
I guess it ought to be said
That I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road
For grandma's feather bed
I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road
(Well I guess... mumbling 'bout the gal down the road)
It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On grandma's feather bed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On grandma's feather bed
Get out you bum, we don't want your kind in here anymore!

Laying in the alleyway
Maybe some rich fool will come my way
And throw me a dime
Tthat's all I need to give me more wine
All I got is to my name
Is a beat up guitar with three broken strings
And I sure know I'm just ain't taking care of no business
Lookie here

Hey kitty cat! Where you going?
This part of the alley is my home
Walking all over outside my wall
Boy you sure got a whole lotta dogs
I had a sandwich in a paper bag
But a rat stole it, ain't that some drag?
Lord, I know, I know I sure ain't taking care of no business
Play the horn

Now try to give me a job
Feeding chickens and washing down hogs
But that meant standing up all the time
And standing up to me is just like dying
I'm so lazy that I, I could cry
But tears are just too lazy to fall out my eyes
Lord, lord, lord, lord, I'm so messed up, can't even take care of no business
Play it one more time
Yeah!
Oh, woe is me
I sure wish I had me a sandwich
Anything
I'm so broke I can't even pay attention
Uh, I'm so poor I couldn't even give you the time

[Verse 1]
Are you lost in your lies?
Do you tell yourself I don't realize
Your crusade's a disguise?
Replaced freedom with fear
You trade money for lives
I'm aware of what you've done

[Chorus 1]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

[Verse 2]
I see pain, I see need
I see liars and thieves
Abuse power with greed
I had hope, I believed
But I'm beginning to think that we've been deceived
You will pay for what you've done!

[Chorus 2]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be erased!

[Bridge]
Thieves and hypocrites!
Thieves and hypocrites!
Thieves and hypocrites!

[Chorus 1]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

No more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

[Outro]
Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be erased!
Well, I took some speed I thought it was what I'd need
Yeah, I took some speed I thought it was what I'd need
Well, step inside my shoes
I got the walking talking Johnny Cash Blues
Yeah, I'm dressed in black there ain't no looking back
Yeah, I'm dressed in black there ain't no looking back
Well, come on and hear the news
I got the walking talking Johnny Cash Blues, dig it
I phoned Marie Marie
I said why don't you talk to me
I got fifty thousand questions
Can't you answer just one please?
She said all you need to know is darling I'll be true
And if you call me in the morning maybe I will talk to you
She said I know what's wrong with you
You got the walking talking Johnny Cash Blues, kick it
Well, I took some speed I thought it was what I'd need
Yeah, I took some speed I thought it was what I'd need
Well, step inside my shoes
I got the walking talking Johnny Cash Blues
We are traveling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
But we'll all be reunited (but if we stand reunited)
On a new and sunlit shore (then a new world is in store)

Oh when the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the moon turns red with blood
When the moon turns red with blood
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

On that hallelujah day
On that hallelujah day
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
Oh when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Some say this world of trouble
Is the only one we need
But I'm waiting for that morning
When the new world is revealed

When the revelation (revolution) comes
When the revelation (revolution) comes
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the rich go out and work
When the rich go out and work
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When the air is pure and clean
When the air is pure and clean
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in

When we all have food to eat
When we all have food to eat
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
When our leaders learn to cry
When our leaders learn to cry
Oh lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
Like a face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too and
Your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can but
Everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you too
Right inside your skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Verse 1]
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues

[Refrain]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Verse 2]
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor  and guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said girl you better have fun
No matter what you do
But he's a fool

[Refrain]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Verse 3]
All the flowers that you planted, mama
In the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

[Refrain]
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
While the blood is running warm in your veins
While the blood is running oh so warm in your veins
You had better get religion, you betta try, try and serve the Lord
While the blood, the blood is running warm in your veins
Mmmmm now don't forget about your savoir while traveling thru this ole sinful land, for he always willing to help you and he'll lend you a helping hand, for he bore, he bore the pain of death oooh while he rocked you oh yes he did upon his breast....hey, while the blood. while the blood is running warm so warm in your vein
Ohhh Father, while the blood, while the blood is running warm so warm in your veins, on Friday mornings, would you believe that I, I got religion and I'm go stay right here and serve the Lord until my dying day, heyeyey while the blood, the blood is running warm, yes so warm in your veins
Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say
But trying to be genuine was harder than it seemed
And somehow I got caught up in between
Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say
But trying to be someone else was harder than it seemed
And somehow I got caught up in between
Between my pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is none
Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say
But trying to regain your trust was harder than it seemed
And somehow I got caught up in between
Between my pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is none
The only thing that's worse than one is none
And I cannot explain to you
In anything I say or do or plan
Fear is not afraid of you
Guilt's a language you can understand
I cannot explain to you
In anything I say or do
I hope the actions speak the words they can
For my pride and my promise
For my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is
Pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is none
The only thing that's worse than one is none
The only thing that's worse than one is none
Can you stay up for the weekend?
And blame god for looking too old
Can you find all that you stand for?
Has been replaced with mountains of gold
You can untrain yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend 'til next year
God I can't do this anymore
Oh I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone
(Instrumental)
If I see a light flashin'
Could this mean that I'm comin' home?
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone?
(x2)
(Instrumental)
If I see a light flashin
Could this mean that I'm comin home?
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone?
(x2)
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

So I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you
Boy a fool, wonder what's cool
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran cryin' to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to dial
If you're lookin' for an answer, you're probably gonna find it now
And to the man in the hat standing lookin' at his watch
Motherfucker, well the time is now
Go clap your hands, let me hear you say, "that's the jam"
See I wouldn't be shit if I ain't have no fans
Can't sit down kids you have to stand
Just put your hands up, you don't have to dance
Here, we get it poppin' like it's Pakistan
Iraq, Iran, and have them sayin' Mac's the man
The maximum, coming through to pass you bums
So if you ain't got no money better ask for some
Hey, we came to get down, have a good time
Bring the champagne out and the good wine
We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips
Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis
Comin' in the back door yellin' fuck a list
Fans takin' pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss
We came to party, didn't come to give a shit
Now sing this part, it goes like this

[Hook] (2x)
All my people in the front
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
Everybody in the back
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
If you're feeling that funk
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
If you like it like that
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
H-h-h-h-hold up
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up
I show up cause fans will go nuts
Tell the girls it's cool, look but don't touch
I'll be home as soon as I can, I don't rush
Cause girl, you're baby girl, you're good just don't fuss
I wanna hear y'all clap, just like that
Keep it goin' I'mma bring it all back
H-h-h-h-hold up
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up
I show up cause fans will go nuts
Tell the girls it's cool, look but don't touch
I'll be home as soon as I can, I don't rush
Baby, you're baby girl, you're good just don't fuss
I hear these couples fighting all the time, not us
We have a good time, like to get fucked up
What, what, goin' hard tonight
Under 21, but find me at the bar tonight
Hey, driving round in my car tonight
Making music that ain't hard to like, I got the heart to write
A couple bars I might go do
Something crazy or maybe lazy, love me or hate me
You know it's the same me
And it goes a little something like this

[Hook] (2x)
All my people in the front
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
Everybody in the back
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
If you're feeling that funk
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands
If you like it like that
Go and clap your hands
Go and clap your hands

A flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love
And I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on
A flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned
And rise following them up
Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on
So fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
They fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I come fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on
"Happy new year first of all. I hope we'll have million or two million more of them... if we can get over this summer, he he he. Right I'd like to dedicate this one to the draggin' scene that's goin' on all the soldiers that are fightin' in Chicago, Milwaukee and New York... Oh yeas, and all the soldiers fightin' in Vietnam. Like to do a thing called 'Machine Gun'"

Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

Evil man make me kill ya
Evil man make you kill me
Evil man make me kill you
Even though we're only families apart

Well I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
(You know what I mean)
Hey and your bullets keep knocking me down

Hey I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer now
Yeah but you still blast me down to the ground

The same way you shoot me down baby
You'll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey machine gun
Oooooooooo

I ain't afraid of your mess no more, babe
I ain't afraid no more
After a while your your cheap talk don't even cause me pain
So let your bullets fly like rain
'Cause I know all the time you're wrong baby
And you'll be goin' just the same
Yeah machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah yeah alright
Tearing my family apart

Don't you shoot him down
He's about to leave here
Don't you shoot him down
He's got to stay here
He ain't going nowhere
He's been shot down to the ground
Oh where he can't survive no no

Yeah that's what we don't wanna hear any more, alright
No bullets
At least here, huh huh
No guns, no bombs
Huh huh
No nothin', just let's all live and live
You know instead of killin'
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

I know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
But I hear it inside my head all day
When I realize I'm just holding onto the hope that maybe
Your feelings don't show

It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says, "go ahead"
Then I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
'Cause I decided long ago
But that's the way it seems to go
When trying so hard to get to something real
To feel
It feels like I only go backwards darling
Every part of me says, "go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says, "go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says, "go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
What shall we use to fill the empty
Spaces where she used to walk
How shall we fill the final places
How shall we complete the wall?

[leads to Backs to The Wall]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be

Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love
But most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they got to get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me, you got to play your hand
Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is, ain't it a shame

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin': you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

Truckin', I'm a-goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on

[ZOSER]
Don't come on so cocksure boy
You can't escape your genes
No point in feeling pure boy
Your background intervenes
Listen good and listen straight
You're not the master of your fate
To this you must be reconciled
You'll always be your father's child
At times acclaimed, at times reviled
You'll wind up doing just what I've done
Like father, like son

[RADAMES]
Don't assume your vices
Get handed down the line
That a parent's blood suffices
To condemn the child's design
I've done wrong, I can't deny
But at least I know that I
Shouldn't blame that on my stock
This may come as quite a shock
I'm no chip off any block
I wouldn't wish those words on anyone
Like father, like son

[ZOSER]
Son you're nervous, take my hand
All is settled, all is planned
You've got the world at your command
I don't think you understand

[RADAMES]
I appreciate too well
The squalor at which you excel
It isn't very hard to tell
Evil's a distinctive smell

(RADAMES storms off, leaving ZOSER horrified.)

[ZOSER]
He's lost all sense of reason, and why?
Some foreign slut
Not only is that treason
Some doors are slamming shut
Just like me he's found that flesh
Can excite but will enmesh
Once we rid him of this blight
Once that harlot's out of sight
Then I think he'll see the light
He won't walk back to daddy
He will run
Like father, like son

[ZOSER, MINISTERS]
Like Father, like son
Like Father, like son
Like Father, like -

[ZOSER]
Son
Waking in a sweat again
Another day's been laid to waste
In my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place
There's no escape
I'm my own worst enemy
I've given up
I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I'm suffocating!
Tell me what the fuck is
Wrong with me?
I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused but I'm scared
I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help somehow somewhere
And no one cares
I'm my own worst enemy
I've given up
I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I'm suffocating!
Tell me what the fuck is
Wrong with me?
God!
Put me out of my misery
Put me out of my misery
Put me out of my
Put me out of my fucking misery!
I've given up
I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I'm suffocating!
Tell me what the fuck is
Wrong with me?
Uggh!
Pull, pull
Yeah

Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list
All live, never on a floppy disk
Inka, inka, bottle of ink
Paintings of rebellion
Drawn up by the thoughts I think

Come on

Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall
Playin' tic-tac-toe?
Yo, check the diagonal
Three brothers gone
Come on
Doesn't that make it three in a row?

Anger is a gift
Hey
Yes, aw yeah
Ugh!
Check that!
Ugh!
Come on
Yeah
Ugh
Drop it

Brotha, did ya forget ya name?
Did ya lose it on the wall
Playin' tic-tac-toe?
Yo, check the diagonal
Three brothers gone
Come on
Doesn't it make three in a row
Environment
The environment exceeding on the level
Of our unconsciousness
For example
What does the billboard say
Come and play, come and play
Forget about the movement

Anger is a gift
Ugh!
Hey
Bring that shit in
Ugh!
Hey!
Freedom, yeah
Freedom yeah right
Freedom yeah!

Freedom!
Yeah!
Freedom!
Yeah right!
Freedom!
Yeah!
Freedom!
Yeah!
Right!

[Spoken Intro: Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
There is something
I have to say to you
If you promise you'll
Understand
I cannot contain myself
When in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me
Don't hide our love
Woman to man

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
She's just a lover
Who's doing me by
It's worth the giving
It's worth the try
You cannot cleave it
Or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it
You cannot burn it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
It's just a feeling
You have to soothe it
You can't neglect it
You can't abuse it
It's just desire
You cannot waste it
Then, if you want it
Then, won't you taste it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust, woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move
Set me free

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we will be making a vow, to just
Keep it in the closet

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson + Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
If you can get it
It is worth a try
I really want it
I can't deny
It's just desire
I really love it
'Cause if it's aching
You have to rub it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)

[Verse 4: Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me you'll never tell
Touch me there
Make the move
Cast the spell

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or do to each other
For now we'll make a vow, to just
Keep it in the closet

Because there's something about you baby

That makes me want to give it to you
There's something about you baby
That makes me want

Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

Baby I've made a mistake here and there
I wasn't always right
That don't mean, that don't mean
You gotta treat me wrong
Pass it on!
I climbed a lot of mountains baby
A lot of mountains fell down on me
That don't mean, that don't mean
I ain't as weak like I used to be
Pass it on, pass it on

Or you might walk in (respect, just a little bit)
And find out I'm gone (just a little bit)
I got to have (just a little bit)
A little respect (just a little bit)
You could be my silver spring
Blue green colors flashing

I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn
Ocean crashing

And did you say she was pretty?
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby I don't want to know

I'll begin not to love you
Turn around
See me running

I said I loved you years ago
I tell myself
You never loved me, no

And did you say she was pretty?
And did you say that she loves you?
Baby I don't want to know
Oh, no

And can you tell me was it worth it?
Really I don't want to know

Time casts its spell on you
But you won't forget me

I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

Time casts its spell on you
But you won't forget me

I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

I'll follow you down
'Til the sound of my voice
Will haunt you

You'll never get away
From the sound
Of the woman that loves you

I'll follow you down
'Till the sound of my voice
Will haunt you
You'll never get away
From the sound
Of the woman that loves you

I'll follow you down
'Till the sound of my voice
Will haunt you

You'll never get away
From the sound
Of the woman that loves you

You could be my silver spring
Blue green colors flashing
Now baby (baby)
I've got alot of love to give
And i've been over
Over-subscribed with relationships
See you've got (you've got)
A little thing i haven't seen before

[Intro]
This song's called, "I Gave You All"

[Verse 1]
Rip the earth in two with your mind
Seal the urge which ensues with brass wires
I never meant you any harm
But your tears feel warm as they fall on my forearms
But close my eyes for a while
Force from the world a patient smile

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
How can you say that your truth is better than ours?
Shoulder to shoulder, now brother, we carry no arms
And the blind man sleeps in the doorway, his home
If only I had an enemy bigger than my apathy I could have won

[Chorus]
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Close my eyes for a while
Force from the world a patient smile
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all

[Bridge]
And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I had
Just to say that you've won
And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I had
Just to say that you've won
Well, now you've won
Well, now you've won

[Outro]
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all
I don't know who to trust, no surprise
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies
Trying not to break
But I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself
Get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this
All the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you
Just takes so much out of me
Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
Tension is building inside, steadily
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me
Trying not to break
But I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself
Get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this
All the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you
Just takes so much out of me
Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
I won't waste myself on you
You, you
Waste myself on you
You, you
I'll take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
Everything from the inside
And just throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
You, you
Memories consume like opening the wounds
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight
Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than any time before
I have no options left again
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight
I'll paint it on the walls
'cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Verse 1]
Everybody makes mistakes
I feel alright when it come undone
You are not making me wait
But it seems alright as long as something's happening
And I try to making you wait
But you fighting me off like a fire does
Everybody makes mistakes
But they're always mine that seem to keep on stinging

[Chorus]
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

[Verse 2]
You try to make me wait
You come around when it's come undone
Everybody makes mistakes
But they're always mine that seem to keep on stinging
And I try making you wait
But you give me some like you give it good
Everybody makes mistakes
But they're always mine that seem to keep on stinging

[Chorus]
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

[Verse 3]
You try making me wait
But you come undone when you come undone
Everybody makes you late
But it's always mine that seem to keep on sticking

[Chorus]
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong, lord, have mercy
This key won't unlock this door
Something's goin' on here
I have a bad bad feeling
That my baby don't live her no more
Well, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back up on the hill
That's something to do
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back yonder cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will
Yeah
Hold me like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee, you are my friend
Carry me like you are my brother
Love me like a mother, will you be there?

Yeah, hold on, yeah
Hold on, oh, yeah

When weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost, will you find me?
But they told me, a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end but I'm only human

Yeah, oh, hold on
Yeah, oh, yeah

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show to me
You'll be there for me and care enough to bear me?
(Hold me) Show me
(Lay your head lowly) Told me
(Softly then boldly) Yeah
(Carry me there) I'm only human

(Lift me) Hold me
(Love me and feed me) Yeah, I can
(Kiss me and free me) Yeah

(Carry me there) Yeah
(Need me) Hoo
(Love me and feed me) Give me up, hold me up, give me up sometimes
(Kiss me and free me) oh, sometimes
(I will feel blessed) Yeah

In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care? Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence

Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part for you're always in my heart

(Wonderland winter wonderland wonderland)
Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight oh we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He's singing a song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

Well in the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married we say no man
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid of the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

(In the meadow we can build a snowman)
And pretend he's a circus clown
We have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down
Oh when it snows ain't it filling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

(Wonderland wonderland)
Somethin' new

Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll

Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll

Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why, niggas wanna die
All I know is pain
All I feel is rain
How can I maintain, with madd shit on my brain
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is
New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is wit' it
You want it? come and get it
Took it then we split it
You fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gonna do, when we run up on you
Fuckin' wit' the wrong crew, don't know what we goin' thru
I'ma have ta show niggas how easily we blow niggas
When you find out there's some more niggas, that's runnin with your niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle, light it up like a candle just cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes, like you bussin' grapes
Think you holdin weight? Then you haven't met the Apes
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll

Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll

Is ya'll niggas crazy?
I'll buss you and be swazy
Stop actin' like a baby, mind your business lady
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' ta get rid of you
Ya I know it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down
Watch my niggas spit round
Make ya'll niggas kiss ground, just for talkin' shit clown
Oh you think it's funny then you don't know me money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it dog I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Five niggas or a fiend, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
And yo I'ma slave til' my home is the grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches talkin' paper then how they wanna rape us
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll

Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll

Look what you dun started
Asked for it, you got it
Had it, should have shot it
Now your dearly departed
Get at me dog, did I rip shit with this one here I flip shit
Niggas know when I kick shit
It's gonna be some slick shit
What was that look for, when I walked in the door
Oh you thought you was raw, boom not anymore
Cause now you on the floor, wishin you never saw me walk through that door, with that 4 4
Now it's time for bed
Two more to the head, got the floor red
Yea that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, It's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me
Bitch ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make the move, got a point to prove
Got a make'em grove, got'em all like ooh
So to the next time, you hear this nigga rhyme
Try to keep your mind, on gettin pussy and crime
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop
Oh, no
That's how Ruff Ryders roll

A lot of fools is holding me but that's just the way it's supposed to be
Never win, against the grain, always playing 20 games
Stand for something dawg or you gonna fall for anything but later for that
Yeah, I got my swag back, I'm with the Soulja Boy, that nigga bad, back

[Verse 1]
Cold is the water
It freezes your already cold mind
Already cold, cold mind
And death is at your doorstep
And it will steal your innocence
But it will not steal your substance

[Chorus]
But you are not alone in this
And you are not alone in this
As brothers, we will stand and we'll hold your hand
Hold your hand

[Verse 2]
And you are the mother
The mother of your baby child
The one to whom you gave life
And you have your choices
And these are what make man great
His ladder to the stars

[Chorus]
But you are not alone in this
And you are not alone in this
As brothers, we will stand and we'll hold your hand
Hold your hand
But I will tell the night
And whisper, "Lose your sight"
But I can't move the mountains for you

[Bridge]
And I will tell the night
Whisper, "Lose your sight"
But I can't move the mountains for you

[Outro]
Thank you very much, cheers

That's what I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
I believe there is nothing more manly one can do than take a shower with five other guys. It's true, it's not a joke its early cavemen, you know. Cromagnum wandering through the fog, you know, scrubbing five other sapiens, no homo

I wanna do a poem for you, some poems for you, right now. I've got the chimes:
*Chime plays*
Ooh, a genie just came! Alright, um...

Now that we're a little halfway through the show I'd sorta like to take the pressure off you, the audience, and just read some serious poetry, then we'll kinda go back to the giggles. This is from my book, "Egghead", that some of you may already have, or, something, so I won't keep it too long, in case, you know, some of you have heard this stuff, but, uh... Just sit back and enjoy, uh, this, uh, poetry

"Roses are gray
Violets are a different shade of gray
Let's go chase cars."
That's by a dog
*Chimes play*

This is a poem about women's bodies, and the ability to transform your body issues, transcend them:
"Martha was ugly like a shaven baboon
So she wrapped herself up in a curtain cocoon
And after a week, she finally emerged
She smelled like shit. What a psycho."
*Chimes play*
You can't transcend them, I guess that's the moral
"Me, with my strange choice of adjectives
You, with your muscular teeth
And clockwise vagina."
*Chimes play*

"You're incomparable, like a...
Yeah, that's the word"
*Chimes play*

"I wanna beat you to death with a blunt object
I wanna grab one of those high-end fashion mannequins by the ankles and bash your ribcage in
I wanna sharpen 50 pencils, bind them with a rubber band, stick the lead end in your mouth and punch the erasers
I wanna strap you to a bed of nails, then strap that bed of nails to the hood of my car so I can watch you suffer as we drive over speed bumps in a mall parking lot during an earthquake
I want you to somehow survive a terrible car crash and somehow not survive a small fender-bender on the way back from the hospital.﻿"
*Chimes play*
That's called "Dad"

"If I had a million dollars, I'd pay your mother to have sex with me
Afterwards, probably I'd invest in the remaining $999,990"
*Chimes play*
$10 for sex with your mother! Comedy!

I can see the light in your face, bitch! Stop texting! Um, it's just a comment for someone in the crowd... It's your time, do what you want. And the texting won't show on the CD, so, that's okay. Now look what I've done

And finally...
"Mid-October, with leaves spilled like colored pencil shavings
The streets dicing our town into neat, unfair portions
And me, eatin' that pussy, baby"
*Chimes play*
Thank you so mu—
Oh, man, thank you guys so much, thank you for being a part of this, coming to the show, uh...
*Audience member cheers*
I just need one person's enthusiasm, that's all I need to carry me
*Audience member cheers*
"Oh, ow! I'm turned on and hurt!"
Um, I, so, I am so grateful to you coming here, I know I keep saying that, it sounds redundant, but, uh, my gratefulness is redundant, so, um, but, uh...
Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow

And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side"

Sure enough, this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel, she said unto me
"Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man
You're gonna rise"
And then she took me high over yonder

And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on, my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side"

There's no use of a moonlight glow
Or the peaks where winter snows
Whats the use of the waves that break in the cool of the evening
What is the evening without you
Its nothing

It may be you will never come
If you never come to me
Whats the use of my wonderful dreams
And why would they need me
Where would they lead me without you
To nowhere

Whats the use of my wonderful dreams
And why would they need me
Where would they lead me without you
To nowhere

I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm tryna fuck (I'm tryna fuck)
I'm tryna fuck (I'm tryna fuck)
Shots
Patrones on the rocks and I'm ready for some shots
The women come around everytime I'm pourin' shots
Their panties hit the ground everytime I give em shots
So cups in the air, everybody let's take shots
I fucked up
La dad a da
La dad a dad a da 

[x8]
I know there's nothing to say
Someone has taken my place
When times go bad, when times go rough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass and let me do my stuff?

I know I got nothing on you
I know there's nothing to do
When times go bad and you can't get enough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass and let me do my stuff?

One thing I think you should know
I ain't gonna miss you when you go
Been down so long, I've been tossed around enough
Oh, won't you just let me go down and do my stuff?

I know you're hoping to find
Someone who's gonna give you peace of mind
When times go bad, when times go rough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass and let me do my stuff?

Do it, do it, do it
I'm just second hand news, I'm just second hand news, yeah
I'm just second hand news, I'm just second hand news, yeah
I'm just second hand news, I'm just second hand news, yeah
I'm just second hand news, I'm just second hand news, yeah

I'll be coming home soon baby please be waiting outside your door
I'll be coming home soon baby please be waiting outside your door
When I get back with you baby you know I ain't going to leave any more

When I get on that train baby you'll know it won't be long
When I get on that train baby you'll know it won't be long
I'll give you all the love little darling I've had in store for you since I've been gone

I ain't going to leave no more little girl this time I'm coming home to stay
I ain't going to leave no more little girl this time I'm coming home to stay
I'm going to give you a no good mother every night and every day

[Intro]
Hee!

[Verse 1]
Live and sin
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning
I promised I would never, ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning
Hee! Hee!
As we walked into the room
There were faces staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said, "Welcome to your doom"
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me

[Chorus]
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
Someone stop my heart (Heartbreak hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! (Heartbreak hotel)
Ten years ago today (Heartbreak hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! (Heartbreak hotel)

[Bridge]
We came to this place where the vicious dwell
Found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through

[Smooth Criminal Outro]
OW!
(Annie, are you okay?)
(Are you okay, Annie?)
I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all

I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you

I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on Silver Girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way

See how they shine
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind

[Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide
El que no es consejo, no llega el viejo
So listen up

If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go (la la la la)
If your girl wanna play, let her go

(Intro: T.I.)
Yo, ayyyyyy, huh-ayyyy
I gotta love my man here engineerin (okay)
It don't take me too long to write it (uh, huh-ayyyyy)
How long it take you to record me baby? HEY! (huh-ayyyyy)
Hey ya ain't live, you don't ride, you don't do it like I do it
(It's all good man, we gon' ride on these fuck niggas anyway though)
Ya ain't real, you don't wanna get into it
Don't play with yourself nigga (okay)
Play a lotto nigga (okay)
Hey - let's get it! (Yeah fuck nigga, AY!)

(Chorus: T.I.)
Hey ya ain't live, you don't ride, you don't do it like I do it
I keep it real - ya ain't real, you don't wanna get into it
Ya ain't crunk, ya ain't buck, ya ain't hard, ya ain't G
You ain't got what I got pumpin in your heart, you ain't me
You do all that yellin, holla, ya ain't real and ya ain't bout it
Ya ain't serious, ya ain't crazy, you know you don't wanna die
Ya ain't hustle from the bottom, you don't got it like I got it
You can hate and you can lie but pussy nigga I'm the hottest
(T.I.)
I'm the realer nigga in this shit, aside from all the business shit
I'm the nigga sucka niggas best to keep it pimpin with
People say I start a lot of shit, I say I finish it
Thank God it wasn't no witnesses, I'd still be servin sentences
Rap shit way more stressful that I love my other businesses
Thank God I'm a professional and scared I don't begin to get
Whether in a Phantom or the truck with all the kids in it
Still tote a hammer try me, man I hope you listenin
Your death gon' be elaborate, real fuckin' extravagant
I'm down to die myself to show you niggas I ain't havin it
Had to kill your son and a few your mama had to get
And they were playin dumb, we run in and ask where daddy at

(Chorus w/ ad libs)
(Mac Boney)
I carry niggas on my back like a bookbag
Put the pistol in his hand and tell him shoot his ass
I pull a little file faster than them credit people
Yo' ass dead, that's why you probably seein dead people
The weapon with me's really lethal, yeah it scare people (oh my God)
I know off top that I'm gon' bust, that's why I dare people
And I won't dare cheat you, I fair-and-square beat you
Same time, same time's why I'm on that Grey Goose
Don't make me spray and let loose, cause I won't hesitate to
I heard one shot then heard two, jumped up out the truck like what it do
I got a fo'-5 on me and got a nine too
A nigga sayin "Mac Boney, we ain't shoot at you"
I say you sucker ass niggas better keep it movin
'Fore y'all boys be the ones I end up doin
(Chorus w/ ad libs)
Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
How can I when you won't take it from me?

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way

Tell me why everything turned around
Packing up, shacking up's all you want to do
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you

You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
Another lonely day
You can go your own way
Go your own way
You can call it another lonely day

You can go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
You telling lies thinking I can't see
You don't cry 'cos you're laughing at me
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down
Man buys ring woman throws it away
Same damn thing happens everyday
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down
We're all alone and there's nobody else
You still moan: "Keep your hands to yourself!"
I'm down (I'm really down)
I'm down (Down on the ground)
I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)
Down on the ground (I'm really down)
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)
Down, down, down
That's all for everyone
That's all for me
Last call for everyone
Must be just exactly what I need
I call for everyone
I cry for more
That's all for everyone
Must be just exactly what I need
That's all

I need somewhere to go
That's all
Must be what I need
That's all
I need someone to know
Last call
Exactly what I need

I can't stay
I can't deceive
That's all for everyone
Must be just exactly what I need
So that's all for everyone
That's all for me
Last call for everyone
Must be just exactly what I need
That's all
I need somewhere to go
That's all
Must be what I need
That's all
I need someone to know
Last call
Exactly what I need
That's all for everyone
That's all, that's all, that's all, that's all

[Verse 1]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 2]
Millions of miles from home
In the swirling swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 3]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 1]
You staggered away from those desperate days
Leaving of a trail of fear and degradation
Went downtown, he loitered around
In front of the flea pit by the railway station
Deep down next to his heart
In the inside pocket of his cheap leather jacket
He secretly fingers
A dog-eared card that read

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

[Verse 2]
A beautiful girl looked down from the wall
In a grimy frame beside the next attraction
He hid in the queue with his tongue hanging out
Staring up in silent admiration
Deep down near my heart
In the early hours from the lost world in the silver screen
And the silent scream
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

[Verse 1]
You staggered away from those desperate days
Leaving of a trail of fear and degradation
Went downtown, he loitered around
In front of the flea pit by the railway station
Deep down next to his heart
In the inside pocket of his cheap leather jacket
He secretly fingers
A dog-eared card that read

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl
I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn’t notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They’d seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I’d love to turn you on
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
All we are saying is give peace a chance
All we are saying is give peace a chance
All we are saying is give peace a chance
All we are saying is give peace a chance
Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
Fore we see it you take it

Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'

Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die

Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
Oh honey that I can't pay my taxes

Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'

Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading

Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
This is the Fugees, Outsiders up in here:

Everyone wants to be a cowboy
Grab your guns boy
Forty-five by my side
No the n***er dies

[Pacewon:]
Zen, zen zen zen zen zen zen
You shot your bullet, but the bullet when ****
Desperado, do work for new boy
I pull out my gun and plug two like Trugoy

[Wyclef:] Wyclef

[Pacewon:] Pacewon

[Wyclef:] Yo this was how the West was won

[Pacewon:] Our motto, a true Desperado

[Wyclef:]
Rappers want to be actors
So they play the Jesse James Character

[Pacewon:] And get they bones fractured

[Pacewon:]
You ain't got no guns, you off to the precinct
Inside tuff guys are feminine like Sheena Easton

[Wyclef:]
Woman cry, woman cry, Son still dies

Thrown off the building like the Fall guy
Caved in the grave cause you didn't know how to behave
Playin' cowboy now you sleep with the slaves

[Pacewon:]
Who's the desperado, sellin' bottles in the alley
On some villain shit, wearin' a mask like Jim Carrey
With his gat cocked, stinkin' up the crack spot
Pace 1 dies with both eyes on the jackpot

[Wyclef:]
The town that I'm from beggars eat cat chowder
Sundance Kid is the everyday purse snatcher
If you see him coming, you better start running
Like a terrorist I guarantee you he'll be humming

[Pacewon:] Dynamite, dynamite, Clef I got the cash

[Wyclef:] Yo let's skip town like Harlem nights

[Lauryn Hill:]
We make moves in stage coaches
Rah Digga likes the roaches
If anyone approaches
We be like noches, buenos
And I compose a poem for the many gun-slingers
R & B singers, perpetrating guns with two fingers

[Rah Digga:]
My style is perhaps one of the foulest
I inhale large clouds of smoke through my chalice
(Buckin' at stars) and write rhymes for hours
The ghetto missy, drinkin' whiskey sours

[Lauryn Hill:]
Bust this scenario, can't no other n***ers in the barrio
(From Newark to Ontario), bust us when we in stereo
Cause me and Rashida rock the battles
It's apparent, you're no talent, cause your blazin' in your saddle

[Rah Digga:]
Watch these rap b***hes get all up in your pockets
Then bounce with accountants that give me good stock tips
Cause props is up, Digga's through the roof
Burnin' n***ers like I'm 90 proof

[Lauryn Hill:]
And for all you head beaters
The lead eaters, the cheaters soon to be retreaters
While mamasitas carry real heaters

[Rah Digga:]
I rock the Dooby and
L rocks the Nubian twists
96
Muthaf***as gettin' dissed

Everyone wants to be a cowboy
Grab your guns boy
Forty-five by my side
No the n***er dies

[Young Zee:]
Yeah, when the OUT's hooked up with the Refugees
It be more n***as than the NAACP
Comin' up on weed of all type
Smokin' home-grown out tobacco pipes

[Pras:]
(You've got to know when to hold them
Know when to fold them)
I can take the sunshine, piss in your wine
Steal your concubine, walk away with your goldmine
Young Zee: So ooh aaah achiga, Mamase Mamasa Mama Makusa

[Pras:]
F*** the sheriff, I shot John Wayne
Push him off the runaway train in the movie Shane
Yeah me and that kid, um "What's his name?"

[Young Zee:]
That would be me, Young Zee from No Brain
Smokin' pure from the health fodd store
While my whore slaps cops like Zsa Zsa Gabor
F**k with OUT's it's like those Islam brothers
We march through your hood with a million muthaf***as
So let's get high off the Fu-Gee-La
When the east is in the house, like I'm Blahzay-blah

[John Forte:]
When pandemonium strikes, at midnight
Full moon splits soft niggas in a lunatic
On some absurd s**t
You talk back, hustlin' crack don't make you bigger
N***as who take your measurements quick, don't make it quicker
Stick and slide with vigor
City streets hot like liquor
21 gun salutin, shootin' niggas from the roof and
Got nerve to mouth about it and the weight you claim you movin'
Your whole style is loose and we gon' sew it like it's cotton
You fail to recognize that everybody could get gotten
The bounty on your head, says your dead by manana
Pop babies whisperin' that there's a body dropped, behind the lot
Police blew up the spot and locked the whole block
Medina is the east side of town lounge never till we yawnin'
Gun players regular front page is the bonus
Life will keep existing while I'm s***tin' on the corners
Life will keep existing while I'm s***tin' on the corners

Everyone wants to be a cowboy
Grab your guns boy
Forty-five by my side
No the n***er dies

[Hook:]
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

[Intro:]
Y'all didn't know Refugees was up in here
One time, Refugees up in here
We gon' do it like this
One time
We in the house

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him and listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

[Can It Be All So Simple sample]
I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on...

[CLEF:]
Yo L-Boogie, take it to the bridge

[Fading:]
Strumming my pain
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
No I'm not colorblind
I know the world is black and white
I try to keep an open mind
But I just can't sleep on this tonight

Stop this train
I want to get off
And go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?

Don't know how else to say it
I don't want to see my parents go
One generation's length away
From finding life out on my own

Stop this train
I want to get off
And go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?
So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
To find a way to say that life has just begun

Had a talk with my old man
Said "Help me understand"
He said "turn sixty-eight"
"You'll re-negotiate"

"Don't stop this train
Don't for a minute change the place you're in
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John, honestly we'll never stop this train"

Once in a while, when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And you're still safe and sound

And you don't miss a thing
Till you cry when you're driving away in the dark
Singing
Stop this train
I want to get off
And go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
'Cause now I see I'll never stop this train

[Verse 1]
Live in sin
Ten years ago on this day
My heart was yearning
I promised I would never ever be returning
When my baby broke my heart and left me yearning, woo
As we walked into the room
There were faces staring
Glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me, hoo

[Pre-Chorus]
We walked up the stairs
Still concealing gloom
There were two girls
Sitting in my room
She walked up to my face
Said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon

[Chorus]
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Evil Heartbreak Hotel

[Verse 2]
Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I'm undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other
Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's a trial thought
In beguile to hurt me
Then the man next door had told
She's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scaring me, woo

[Pre-Chorus]
We came to this place
Where the vicious dwel'
Found that wicked women
Run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through

[Chorus]
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil Heartbreak Hotel
Evil Heartbreak Hotel
Someone's stabbin' my heart
(Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hoo
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Ten years ago today
(Heartbreak Hotel)
That you broke my baby's heart, woo
(Heartbreak Hotel)

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Someone's stabbin' my heart
(Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Ten years ago today
(Heartbreak Hotel)
That you broke my baby's heart
(Heartbreak Hotel)
OW, hee-hee
(Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Hoo
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Heartbreak Hotel
(Heartbreak Hotel)
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out
She was a day tripper
One way ticket, yeah
But it took me so long to find out
And I found out

She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there
She's a big teaser
She took me half the way there, now
She was a day tripper
One way ticket, yeah
It took me so long to find out
And I found out

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah
Tried to please her
She only plays one-night stands
Tried to please her
She only plays one-night stands, now
She was a day tripper
Sunday driver, yeah
It took me so long to find out
And I found out

Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah

Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah

Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah
What'll it be now mister mole
Whispers sloth in curls of smoke
Take a back seat, or play pharaoh
Dance with me and shake your bones
Slow down
It's a science
He's been waiting to
Bring you down
Snake eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you child
Leopards laze each on plush pillows
Slender capes of red and chrome
Paperback dreams in their deep doze
Twitch their toes to black mambo
Slow down
It's a science
He's been waiting to
Bring you down
Snake eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you child
Wanna play cheat now says the sloth
A domino flush to his nose
Tickle that cheek and take your throne
Pump your veins with gushing gold
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
First sight of rays of light I hear the birds sing
It's a sign he's giving me, everything will be okay
Sometimes when I wake up, and I'm wondering
How my life would have been if I didn't sing
I get a little stressed out, every now and then
But problems come and problems go when I'm around him
Blessed in the morning
Blessed in the evening
And again I realize the reason why I sing

♫ Instrumentals ♫

First sight of rays of light I hear the birds sing
It's a sign he's giving me, everything will be okay
Sometimes when I wake up, and I'm wondering
How my life would have been if I didn't sing
I get a little stressed out, every now and then
But problems come and problems go when I'm around him
Blessed in the morning
Blessed in the evening
And again I realize the reason why I sing
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
I need you
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
Oh yeah
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
Every time
Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
Oh hey
I'm blessed… Oh hey
I'm blessed… I'm blessed
I'm blessed… So blessed
I'm blessed… So blessed
Well, I travel at a speed
Of a reborn man
I got a lot of love to give
From the mirrors of my hand
I said a message of love
Don't you run away
Look at your heart
Come along with me today

Well I am what I am thank you
Some people just don't understand
Find yourself first
And then your tool
Find yourself first
Don't you be no fool

Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chains
Messin' with that fool babe
Your life is pain
If you want to be free
Come along with me
Don't mess with the man
He'll never understand
I said find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
So if you come alive
You better prove to the man
You're as strong as him
Everybody come alive
Everybody love alive
Everybody love alive
Everybody hear my message
People have the right to fly
And will when it gets compromised
Their hearts say "Move along"
Their minds say "Gotcha heart"
Let's move it along
Let's move it along
And airports
See it all the time
Where someone's last goodbye
Blends in with someone's sigh
'Cause someone's coming home
In hand a single rose
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And I won't be the last
No I won't be the last
To love her
You can't build a house of leaves
And live like it's an evergreen
It's just a season thing
It's just this thing that seasons do
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And you won't be the first
No you won't be the first
To love me
You can find me, if you ever want again
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around
I'll be around
And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
You just might find if you give it time
You will wave hello again
You just might wave hello again
And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
I believe (You can't love too much, one part of it)

That my life's gonna see (You can't love too much, one part of it)

The love I give (You can't love too much, one part of it)

Return to me (You can't love too much, one part of it)

I believe (You can't love too much, one part of it)

That my life's gonna see (You can't love too much, one part of it)
The love I give, return to me
I believe, that my life's gonna see
The love I give
Return to me

My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah yeah
There is a blue one who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one trying to be a skinny one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

We are basically the same whatever we do
You love me, you hate me you know me and then

Sister and brothe let's be cool with each other, ooh

And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee
Oh sha sha-we got to live together
There is a yellow one
That ain't into the red one, who don't like the black one
What about white one y'all?

And different strokes for different folks
Ev'ry night I just wanna go out

Ev'ry day I lean on a lamp post
I'm wasting my time
Ev'ry night I lay on a pillow
I'm resting my mind
Ev'ry morning brings a new day
And ev'ry night that day is through
But tonight I just wanna stay in
And be with you
And be with you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

My love for you is never dead
You better go back to where you began
Until you go back to when

[Intro]
Shh, be quiet
What you don't know won't hurt you anyway
Shh, be quiet
What you don't love can't love you anyway

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about a love that you don't have, yeah
Love will tell us that it's good when it's all bad, uh-huh
And Love will tell us we are cool when we're not cool
And love will call you a fool but that be rude

[Pre-Chorus]
Love like that, love's likes that sometimes
Don't you stress, don't even strain your mind
Love's like that, love's likes that sometimes
Seems so bad when you got it
But good love's hard to find

[Chorus]
Would it be better draped in pounds of gold?
Would it seems better if roses paved the road?
Would it feel better if it's never cold?
Love is like the California sun when it's ready to rain
We just say no
Would we be better if we shop at the dollar store?
Would it be better to take less when we can have more?
Would I feel better sharing the money I make?
Twenty to the man on the corner
Now he around the corner gettin' blazed
Now I feel bad

[Verse 2]
Love will tell you about a love that you don't have, yeah
And love will tell us that it's good when it's all bad
(All bad), uh-huh
And Love will tell us we are cool, when we not cool (Not cool)
And love will call you a fool but that be rude

[Pre-Chorus]
Love like that, love's likes that sometimes
Don't you stress, don't even strain your mind
Love's like that, love's likes that sometimes
Seems so bad when you got it
But good love's hard to find

[Chorus]
Would I look better If I was cover in diamonds?
Would you love it better If I left when I should be crying?
Now would you hear me better if I served you sweets with no salt?
Love is like an uncle with a fifth of gin
Know he should stop but he just keeps going, uh
Maybe it'd be better to give up these designer things, yeah
Would it feel better to give you what you want
Even if it's something I need?
Would it feels better if I gave my family a little more time
I gave my auntie a watch for Christmas
Now her son's at the pawn shop waiting in line
Now I feel bad

[Bridge]
See, love will tell you about a love that you don't have
(Love that you don't have, yeah)
Love will tell us that it's good when it's all bad
(All bad)
And Love will tell us we are cool, when we not cool (Not cool)
And love will call you a fool but that be rude

Love like that, love's likes that sometimes
Don't you stress, don't even strain your mind, no no no
Love's like that, love's likes that sometimes
It seems so bad when you got it
But good love's hard to find, oh oh oh

[Outro]
Oh, loves like that sometimes
Don't let it strain your mind
Don't stress, yes
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright
Tell you why
Love's like that, love's like that sometimes
Hat face, that face, that wonderful face!
It shines, it glows all over the place
And how I love to watch it change expressions
Each look becomes the pride of my possessions
I love that face, that face, it just isn't fair
You must forgive the way that I stare
But never will these eyes behold a sight that could replace
That face, that face, that face
I love those eyes, those lips, that fabulous smile
She laughs and spring goes right out of style
Oh never will these eyes behold a sight that could replace
That face, that face, that face, that face
That face, that face, that face
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me
For I must be travelin' on now
There's too many places I got to see
If I stay here with you girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows, I can't change
Bye and bye baby, it's been sweet love, yeah yeah
Though this feelin' I can't change
Please don't take it so badly
'Cause Lord knows, I'm to blame
And if I stay here with you girl
Things just couldn't even be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows, I can't change
Lord help me, I can't change
Lord I can't change
Won't you fly high free bird yeah
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama done rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home

It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home

Let me tell you now well, I got me in a fix
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickitey splits
I had to walk a long, long way to town

I came upon a nice old man well, he had a hat on
Wait a minute, mister, can you give me some directions?
I'm gonna want to be right off for home

When I was a little bitty baby
My mama done rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home

It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
Don't care if them cotton balls get rotten
When I got you, baby, who needs cotton?
In them old cotton fields back home

Brother, only one thing more that's gonna warm you
A summer's day out in California
It's gonna be those cotton fields back home

It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
Give me them cotton fields (It was back in Louisiana)
Let me hear it for the cotton fields (Just about a mile from Texarkana)
You know that there's just no place like home

Oh, boy, it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
You shoulda seen their faces when they seen how I grown
In them old cotton fields back home
Cold is the water
It freezes your already cold mind
Already cold, cold mind
And death is at your doorstep
And it will steal your innocence
But it will not steal your substance
But you are not alone in this
And you are not alone in this
As brothers we will stand and we'll hold your hand
Hold your hand
And you are the mother
The mother of your baby child
The one to whom you gave life
And you have your choices
And these are what make man great
His ladder to the stars
But you are not alone in this
And you are not alone in this
As brothers we will stand and we'll hold your hand
Hold your hand
But I will tell the night
And whisper, "Lose your sight"
But I can't move the mountains for you

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Let all the heat pour down
I'm good as long as he's around
He lets me wear the crown
I do my best to make him proud

[Pre-Chorus]
Now all my super ladies, I got my baby
If you got your baby, baby (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air (Oh, oh, oh)
Move your body, move your body
Rock your body, rock your body
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care

[Verse 2]
My rock is shining bright
Even if he ain't by my side
He makes sure that I glow
I make sure everybody knows

[Bridge]
Step up, step up, let your hair down
Pop, drop, and lock it, go all out
If, if he rocks, tear up the crowd
Dance for your papi
Step up, step up, let your hair down
Pop, drop, and lock it, go all out
If, if he rocks, tear up the crowd
Dance for your papi

[Pre-Chorus]
Now all my super ladies, I got my baby
If you got your baby, baby (Mo-move)

[Chorus]
Move your body, move your body

Put your hands up in the air, air, air (Oh, oh, oh)
Move your body

Suéltate el pelo
Levántate, cae y asegúralo
Ve con todo
Si él es lo máximo, azota baldosa
Baila para tu papi

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh)

The babe with the power (What power?)
The power of voodoo (Who do?)

I saw my baby
Crying hard as babe could cry
What could I do?
My baby's love had gone
And left my baby blue
Nobody knew

[Pre-Chorus]
What kind of magic spell to use?
(Slime and snails?)
Or puppy dog tails?
(Thunder or lightning?)
Then baby said

Puppy dogs' tails?

Then baby said

[Chorus]

Thunder or lightning?
Something frightening?

Say...
Can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?

Whose broad stripes & bright stars
Through the perilous fight, oh Lord
Oh, the fight

O'er the ramparts we watched were so galantly, yeah
Streaming
& the rockets red glare!
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof
Through the night
That our flag
Was still there

Oh, say
Does thy star-spangled banner
Yet wave
For the land
Of the free!
& the home
Of the...
Home of the brave
Oh, Lord
Whooo!

Well boy it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
You should have seen their faces when they seen how I grown
In them old cotton fields back home

[Verse 1]
Walkin' by myself
On my way home
Put me on the shelf
Leave me at home

[Chorus]
I said I don't care much what we talk about
When you hold me real tight I don't have a doubt
I talk a lot of noise because I think too much
Don't look down it's old enough to grow
So please hold on

[Verse 2]
Talkin' to myself
Lookin' for a home
Left out on the shelf
Won't you come home

[Chorus]
I said I don't care much what we talk about
When you hold me real tight I don't have a doubt
I talk a lot of noise because I think too much
Don't look down it's old enough to grow
So please hold on
For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin it's time to sink or swim
Watch me play for ya

For you I'd be running a thousand miles
Just get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot
But for you I need, I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine

I know I won't be the first one
Giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

I just need somebody to love

Just somebody to love

Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody

I need somebody
I, I need somebody to love

Everyday I'd bring sun around
I'll sweep away the clouds
Smile for me

I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime
Step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot
But for you I need, I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine

I know I won't be the first one
Giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

I need somebody
I, I need somebody

I need somebody
I need somebody
I need somebody
I need somebody
I need somebody to love

Is she out there? Is she out there?
Is she out there? Is she out there?
I just need somebody to love

[Chorus]
Oh, your love's like those trains, those trains
My heart's like that cargo
I just happen to be attached
Hey!
My addiction to that train
Am I insane
To think something different's coming 'cross that track?

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel so lost
But they say love is blind
Sometimes I need you here
To help me face my fears
Standing in this fire
Seduced by the flames
How can't you be my joy
And also be my pain? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Some nights I wish I didn't love ya
Some days I wish I didn't care
Sometimes I just hold on
Can't stand the idea of sleeping by myself

[Chorus]
Oh, your love's like those trains, those trains
My heart's like that cargo, I just happen to be attached
Hey!
My addiction to those trains
Am I insane
To think something different's coming down that track?
Nothing's coming 'cross those tracks

[Bridge]
Because of you I am better and I'm worse
Sometimes the reality of that can really hurt
(Even more)
Because of you I take the sweet with a grain of salt
(Grain of salt)
Because of you I feel everything, and feel nothing at all

[Outro]
(Some nights) Some nights I wish I didn't love ya
(Some days) Some days I wish I didn't care
(Oh oh) Sometimes I just hold on
Can't stand the idea of sleeping by myself
(Oh, your love's like those trains)
Some nights I wish I didn't love ya
Some days I wish I didn't care
(My heart's like that cargo)
Sometimes I just hold on
(I just happen to be attached)
Can't stand the idea of sleeping by myself
My addiction to that train
Am I insane
To think something different's coming down that track?
Nothing's coming 'cross those tracks, yeah
Am I insane
To think something different's coming cross that track?
Nothing's coming 'cross those tracks

Some nights I wish I didn't love ya
Some days I wish I didn't care
Sometimes I just hold on
(Nothing's coming 'cross those tracks)
Can't stand the idea of sleeping by myself
(Nothing's coming 'cross those tracks)
Some nights I wish I didn't love ya
Some days I wish I didn't care
Sometimes I just hold on
Can't stand the idea of sleeping by myself

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be

[Verse 2]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She's lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 3]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'm goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Well now, baby used to stay out all night long
Made me cry, Lord, she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, baby, that's no lie
Tables turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now
Yes, and I used to love her, but it's all over now

[Verse 2]
Listen, she used to wake up in the morning, give me breakfast in bed
When I got worried, Lord, she eased my achin' head
But now she's here and there with every man in town
Still tryin' to take me for that same old clown

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now
Yes, and I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Well, she used to run around with every man in town
Spend all my money, Lord, out playing her high class game
Put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Table's turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Said it's over, over now)
Yes, and I used to love her (Used to love her), but it's all over now

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Well now, baby used to stay out all night long
Made me cry, Lord, she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, baby, that's no lie
Tables turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)
Yes, and I used to love her, but it's all over now (Said it's over, over now)
Yes, and I used to love her (Used to love her), but it's all over now (Over now)

[Instrumental]
I’ve been watching you, I like those little moves you make…
Said I’m feeling you, Tell me are you feeling me too
I’d like to know your name but I'm so scared
Afraid of what you might say…
But if I don't ever see you again, can’t let you just walk away…

Now you’re approaching me, excuse me can I know your name?
Took the opportunity, and now we’re standing here face to face

It’s amazing that your so beautiful tell me are you really real
And you say you wanna see me again you have been watchin me too
I’m so excited excited excited excited!
And when I go away
I know my heart can stay with my love
It's understood
It's in the hands of my love
And my love does it good
Whoa whoa-whoa whoa, whoa whoa-whoa whoa
My love does it good

And when the cupboard's bare
I'll still find something there with my love
It's understood
It's everywhere with my love
And my love does it good
Whoa whoa-whoa whoa, whoa whoa-whoa whoa
My love does it good

Whoa-whoa, I love, oh-whoa, my love
Only my love holds the other key to me
Oh-whoa, my love, oh-oh, my love
Only my love does it good to me
Whoa whoa-whoa whoa, whoa whoa-whoa whoa
My love does it good

Don't ever ask me why
I never say goodbye to my love
It's understood
It's everywhere with my love
And my love does it good, whoa
Whoa whoa-whoa whoa, whoa whoa-whoa whoa
My love does it good

Whoa-whoa, I love, oh-whoa, my love
Only my love does it good to me
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa whoa

[Tyga:] Introducing Amber Melody

[Amber Melody:]
I was rolling out today
And the day seemed hazed
From the tobacco and the zig zag
That I made

And I'm really trying to wake myself
So many things I had to do before you came today
I can't blame no one else
It's not your fault but

What else can I do
When I'm home with you
You brighten up my day
Smoke, smoke, smoke dro

What else can I do
When I'm home with you
You brighten up my day
Smoke, smoke, smoke dro
People tell me I'm a fool
Because I'm loving you
But they don't know the way you make me feel inside

Today I should've passed you on
But I crave too strong
And even though it's wrong at least I said I tried

Oh I remember
Hydro, My dro
Forgot the words to say
But I don't care now

What else can I do
When I'm home with you
You brighten up my day
Smoke, smoke, smoke dro

What else can I do
When I'm home with you
You brighten up my day
Smoke, smoke, smoke dro

Wrap it, light it, take a hit
And I'm feeling kinda high
Maybe chill out that's the shit
And pass it on
Wrap it, light it, take a hit
And I know you wanna try
Lay back, chill out, that's the shit
And pass it on

[Tyga:]
Love love, I know you miss me
The way I do your memory
You always forgetting
Forgive me, without you
I feel so empty
Endless resentment
I need you sitting next to me
Peachy, cream, blueberries in between
I can make your eyes appear Chinese
You know what I mean
Whatever the case seem to be
You can always depend on marijuana
Pick out become farmers
Let the earth grow upon us
We'll make millions, become stars
The world is ours, so let's cherish these two hours
But damn what about tomorrow?
I mean

What else can I do
When I'm home with you
You brighten up my day
Smoke, smoke, smoke dro
What else can I do
When I'm home with you
You brighten up my day
Smoke, smoke, smoke dro
For you, there'll be no more crying
For you, the sun will be shining
And I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright
I know it's right

To you I'll give the world
To you I'll never be cold
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright
I know it's right

And the songbirds are singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before

And I wish you all the love in the world
But most of all, I wish it from myself

And the songbirds keep singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before
Like never before
Like never before

[Intro]
One, two, three, go!

[Verse 1]
Weep for yourself, my man
You'll never be what is in your heart
And weep, little lion man
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Or rate yourself and rake yourself
Take all the courage you have left
And wasted on fixing all the problems that you made in your own head

[Chorus]
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I...

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Tremble for yourself, my man
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble, little lion man
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother or else spend your days biting your own neck

[Chorus]
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?

[Chorus]
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah, one, two

[Chorus]
It was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?

[Chorus]
But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my dear?

[Outro]
Hey!
You show your sympathy to every bird and bee
But when it comes to me, dear, you laugh at every plea
Sweetheart, I need the bliss, the bliss of your sweet kiss
You show your sympathy to every bird and bee
But when it comes to me, dear, you laugh at every plea
Sweetheart, I need the bliss, the bliss of your sweet kiss
What can the answer be, dear, I can't go on like this

Like a beggar, what can I do?
Hungry kisses and starvin' for you
Press your lips to my lips, Lord, have pity on me

Cravin' for affection, my cravin' is strong
Put your arms around me where they belong
Press me, cares me, oh, have pity on me

One kiss and I'll know, I'll go riding on a rainbow
Straight up to heaven, I will fly right to the sky
Can't you hear me cryin' for sweet sympathy?
No love like your love can answer my plea
Press your lips to my lips, Lord, have pity on me
One kiss and I'll know, I'll go riding on a rainbow
Straight up to heaven, I will fly right to the sky
Can't you hear me cryin' for sweet sympathy?
No love like your love can answer my plea
Press your lips to my lips, Lord, have pity on me

[Chorus - B.o.B]
We got them going down for the count
Looking at the ground
That's why we got haters, that's why we got haters
Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go
Haters everywhere we go, where we go
Haters going down for the count
Looking at the ground
I think you're a hater, I think you're a hater
Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go
Haters everywhere we go, where we go
Haters going down for the count

[Verse 1 - B.o.B]
Yes sir it's the beast from Decatur
Can't see enemies and the haters
Real sharp on my thing like a razor
Blade, come clean like a shape up
So guess I got a game of tape up
But everybody going to feel the need to say something
But can't speak up whenever you face them
That's what you call microphone gangsters
Yeah, I got them okie-doke, yeah I'm raw, you know my flow
Because folk be acting hard, like a Viagra overdose
Talking that noise on all them songs
A bunch of little boys but you all look grown
Those niggas there, and these niggas here
It really don't matter because they all just clones
Go to school, read a book, be a lawyer
Hell yeah man I'm all for the cause
Ain't trying to get involved with the law sir
But a nigga will get caught with the Mossberg
And that just ain't a threat on the song
Don't get it wrong because this track is my own
Because niggas that slip they don't last long

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Wes Fif]
Hey, what the lick read homie? Me I'm doing what I always do
Grinding, if you wasn't steady hating you'd be balling too
I know you seen us falling through
All the rich niggas is on my crew
Fuck it, they can't touch us, if stuck up is what you call it cool
Oh!
You should of seen when I came down in that
Black on black, custom gator, haters face down on the mat
Splat!
Yeah I can make a green nigga mad
Quick, fast, flash like ten cash on his bitch ass

[B.o.B]
You can tell I'm a G by the walk and the stance
How I play the game make them talk in the stands
Watch how you talk when you talk to the man
If it ain't about bread you can talk to the hand
I, I, show you how to get rich
You got a weak arm I'll show you how to pitch
Made it so play I'll show you how to hit
And tell the police I don't know about shit
Aye guy, I'm fly, something like the air
Ain't that something?
When it's stunting man there's nothing like air
Homie hold it right there, homeboy hold it down
Spent five at the mall and had the haters going down

[Chorus]

[Asher Roth:]
My aura takes the form of the aurora borealis
Or a floral pattern, more or less a forest to your salad
The neural path I've traveled has immediate reaction
Can't you see that I am beaming? I'll be leaving in a second
Sipping magic from a chalice, detached from the distractions
At last, I can relax, looking past all of the action
A fraction or a fragment of me actually is present
The rest of me is heavenly, the seventh house's zenith
Yes, the fence intimidates, it's meant to keep you out (But)
Let your senses resonate and leap it in a bound ('Cause)
Freedom isn't found inside a visa or a crown
And even the voice of reason couldn't speak it out loud (But)
Mortals are immortal when their soul has been imported
To a source that is more sovereign, important to the whole (Whole)
This is the warmest moment of a poet turned heroic
As he slowly comes to focus, go ahead and watch me glow

[Charles Hamilton:]
Rey Mysterio flow, stayin' clear
Of makeup-smeared hatin' queers, makin' clear this is spiritual
Though a spirit you owe, church final
Your funeral in an arena, you searchin' for fire
Or titles, or tidal waves
Tie the game like a shot from outside when it's 95 to 98
To throw slid into you left-side broke (Niggas!) (Beam!)
Boa constrictor, chokin' (Niggas!), the grown man (Beam!)
Pawns mean, your controllers get broken (Nigga!) (Beam!)
Anarchy in the Ford, you need to focus (Nigga!) (Beam!)
Love, I get none, like sayin' no to niggas
Hamiltonian's loneliness, so I hold my (Beams!) (Niggas!)
I logged on to see a c-section, a gross display
Sleep never, and Rolaids, deep lessons won't go away
I keep pressin' like my phone is afraid
To be the star, so I end it and pound it, see what the code can say

[Lupe Fiasco:]
Calling all the good rappers, had to get my crew together
Fire like the fire flower, flyer than the super feather
Superman with two propellers, enter that, ninja rap
You can call it Super Shredder, boss scene, Ross theme
You can call it super better, new to this, Ludacris
Foolishness, Lu been doin' this since super letters
So I can't spell and can't mail it out
If you can't feel, it's too full, you can't peel it out
Showboatin' at the show, but you can't sell it out
I'm on the sea shepherd deck, helpin' the whales out
All my egos in the mirror, checkin' themselves out
The speakers on bump, the rappers on acne
This track is what would happen if the rastas meet the mathletes
Yes, sir, then the Chess Club got dressed up
And went and took all the bitches of the athletes

[Mikey Rocks:]
Big up to what's been up, nigga
Pin-ups from when we clicked up and posed for these pictures, good
And the kids connected up, and they clicked snap
Hollerin', "Yeah, we weighed on the iPhone scale app!"
Without fail, the best to ever do it just will
Haven't done it all, but we got copy wheelwell, though
But it ain't no sweat, I got a whole outfit
And a new fitted cap that I ain't wore out yet
(Check, check, check) And I'm beamin'
Yeah, and I seen it, like a twenty-seven inch Zenith
Projected widescreen, now they got it 3D
Now we NBA'd up from development leagues

[Chuck Inglish:]
Ay, yo, they pale in comparison to stories we tell
Man, he see me on the hovercraft and he got a sail
Bubble-ass Brenda, stacked up in the window
Of whatever 'Lac truck pick her up, retail
Nigga, what? It just hit me like a Mack truck semi
On my last trip to Sydney in the Sheraton lobby
Grab my coattails and get a grip (Grab 'em)
You want the truth? Well, the truth is
This is it, pointin' out the differences
This is exquisite shit, riveting, isn't it?
Lizard king loafers on swole when I'm kickin' it
Joe, the live nigga, real rig-a-marole
You a handshake away, and them fingers is cold

[Blu:]
Touch art, lush heart, brush my niggas' shoulder off
Now that blessed soldier know that protocol, show me y'all's
Maybe not, play me not, say we not remote at all
Roger that, scholars back, solid black, go God
Gobble Gats, go hard, condom snapped, so raw
Pompous asshole, flash flow, turn your soul on
So gone, strode strong through your lawn 'til the dawn
Tell you mom, name another real as John, kill a song
'Cause when you feel it, and it make yo' ass chill and calm
Payin' more than just attention for that glass I'm sippin' on
Dog, I would travel half the globe to kiss a broad
Kiddin', ma? Scratch backs, bringin' out them kitten paws
And pull a bottle out that cabinet while that kitchen's warm
Back to attendin' business, do not lay them digits wrong
Dippin' all gangsta, but a renegade, no Crip or John
This is Blu, shit is true, pyramid, period

[Diggy Simmons:]
I know what you're thinkin', thinkin' I do not belong
Tell me Diggy ain't beamin', 'course I should be on this song
Yeah, I'm a child of God, my reflection is on
Yeah, I'm only 15 and, but my sixteens is strong
Didn't want me to shine, now we sharin' the stage
Twice as good as you rhyme, only half of your age
So the remains, and it ain't even how
That Verizon flow, are you hearin' me now?
Word to Wasalu, they was sayin' my future was dark
I had the fame, but my name was missin' the art
So I'm drawin' the line, and I'm crossin' the Ts
And I'm dottin' my Is, barely catchin' my Zs
But I'll be good by the mornin', on my global grind like JoJo
They be lookin' at what I'm puttin' on and, so fly, so fresh at the SoHo
Most niggas don't know though, they can catch me on the first flight
Been workin' on a new mixtape, I got a call from Lupe
But I did it for the love, no check, mate

[Dosage:]
When people said I couldn't, I wouldn't, I made 'em believers
I come from the school of hard knocks and overachievers
From the City of Brotherly Love, they sayin' we need you
To be the voice of the people and go against all this evil
Some people hate it, but I made it, so I'm never concerned
About what they be talkin' about, I've lived and I've learned
With my dream and my drive, I determined my turn
In this business, because I'm in control, meetin' adjourned
I said, "It's Third Degree, y'all heard of we?
I'm Dosage, have you heard of me?"
I come from the bottom, so the top where I deserve to be
Where people say it doesn't matter to be much
I was on the Steppin' Lasers tour, and man, I shooked it up
That was random, but so what? Life is a war, better load up
If you against me, come correct, I am the bomb, watch me blow up (Boom!)
Right before your eyes, forget about the dividends
I just want to say I remember when

[B.o.B:]
Well, it's B to the O, O to the B
You know it's the flow, you know that it's me, I flow to this beat
As easy as goin' to the store and holdin' receipts
And foldin' 'em neat, I'm focused as focused can be
You know I got phobias, please, approach me with peace
Or things could get heated and you'll get ferociously beat
Speakin' of ferociously beat, you know that girl 'Nique?
You know she's a freak, but anyway, back to what I'm supposed to be
Sayin' all over this beat, you know that we Gs
You see all the crowns, you know that we kings, you notice the rings
Everywhere we go, we roll with the team, yeah
And you know that we lasers, so you know that we beam
It's the All City varsity, hard-headed squad
We played y'all spades, y'all handle y'all cards
But we ain't all odds, we just blaze, man
Y'all playin' checkers in this game, this is chess, y'all pawns

[Zack de la Rocha]
The classroom's the last room to get the truth
I said the classroom's the last room to get the truth
Yeah, the classroom's the last room to get the truth
Yeah, bring that shit in!
Yeah, check this out ya'll
As I kick it like wicked style, uh

[Verse 1]
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
So called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their God
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time
Ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back!
Bam! Here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless, we need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change  and to counteract
We gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

[Verse 2]
The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causin' tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior of the system
Who cares about only one culture
And that is why we gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

[Interlude]
Break it down like this
Uh!
Like this!
Come on!

[Verse 3]
The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit and listen to some of that
Bullshit that he learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it, yet I hang from it
Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' weathermen
To expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
We gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

[Bridge]
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies

[Outro]
Yeah! Yeah!
Take it back y'all
Take it back, a-take it back
A-take it back y'all, come on!
Take it back y'all
Take it back, a-take it back
A-take it back y'all, come on!
Yeah!
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5
When I kick it, I kick it as if the beat was my enemy
You have thought it was tender me on point like a widow P
Got that leverly give them dearies that do what it do
Payin a picture like duderline, you ain't shit but do do
In the city where see me get pointed that damn it you
You can hide, you get it if you want to
I do karate moves but the crushing tiger just might get broken down by a writer
Yeah the passenger hopped out
But you got shot by the driver
There's a killer like everywhere
So why would you take it there
Neighborhood terrorist got the terror when this people scared
That's why my intelligence tell me to keep a banker you
Tell me f*ck you I'll tell you f*ck you back with my index finger
I can flip on some killershit but I'd rather keep cool
Keep it sober minded try not to be a p**sy like you
Nigga that kale cold attack, Cali on my back till my torso break nigga
This is where it's at that's gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5
I'm so malicious I blow your wicked
Make em close as stigiuos, hells kitchen I'm blowing dishes
This is spoken wisdom as I journey a poe and mission
I'ma lift it, my flow is gift it
She cold with a bow and ribbon the role of riches
Low the bisquits let's go to distance
I'm blow and listen my car how why you with a broken mission
They so suspicious, low and vicious with no convictions
Juries making their own decisions they want us to go to prison
Call adrenaline I got this soul like a poe living
And.like I'm co-existent to prohibition
I'm a dressin critics who say these widows the best as spit it
Mother of statistics they rap with metaphysics
And they yeah simplistic, they stay out as repetition
Show some recognition hold your .my pessimistic
Best that ever did it, Papoose is the definition
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5
So long sitting here
Didn't hear the warning
Waiting for the tape to run
We've been moving around in different situations
Knowing that the time would come
Just to see you torn apart
Witness to your empty heart
I need it
I need it
I need it

Soon they fill the hall
Just to watch, everything you do
Transmitters, kept in the walls
So they know, everything you say is true
Turn it off
Turn it off
No love lost
No love lost

You've been seeing things
In darkness, not in learning
Hoping that the truth will pass
No life underground, wasting never changing
Wishing that this day won't last
To never see you show your age
To watch until the beauty fades
I need it
I need it
I need it
5 foot 9, she's got legs for days
Green eyes that cut like a knife
And her own little sexy sway
No, she don't waste no time
Moving to the floor
And when she starts to move she had me
Calling your mama saying you wanna go home
Baby, tell me
Why can't I have you?
Why you running, girl?
I just wanted to love you
I love you, baby, I love you
I love you, baby, I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby, I want you
I want you, baby, I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no
It's okay to be scared
'Cause this girl is super bad
She will probably be
The best thing that you never had
Don't waste no time
Trying to make her your own
'Cause what she says goes
And life points to miss
And this is the end of the road
Baby, tell me
Why can't I have you?
Why you running, girl?
I just wanted to love you
I love you, baby, I love you
I love you, baby, I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby, I want you
I want you, baby, I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no
Baby, you said you loved me
But you lead me on
And the feeling's so strong about you
But I can't take it no more
So I'm gone, leave you alone
Girl, I'm gone, girl, I'm gone, oh
What's it gonna take
To get you to love me, baby?
'Cause I can't take it anymore
You're gonna be mine for sure, you know
What's it gonna take
To get you to love me, baby?
'Cause I can't take it anymore
You're gonna be mine for sure, you know
I love you, baby, I love you
I love you, baby, I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby, I want you
I want you, baby, I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no
I love you, baby, I love you
I love you, baby, I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby, I want you
I want you, baby, I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no
I love you, baby, I love you
I love you, baby, I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby, I want you
I want you, baby, I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no
I love you, baby, I love you
I love you, baby, I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby, I want you
You know what? Screw you
But I guess love don't love me, no
They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to
They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do
And be careful when you're walking in the view
Just be careful when you're walking in the view
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on
They got one eye watching you
And one eye on what you do
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true
D-don't believe a word, it's us against the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard
Hear the crocodiles ticking round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking round the world
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and
You could hear them climbing the stairs
I got my right side fighting while
My left hides under the chairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
I love Fisha and Price

Oh, seven years of hard luck comin' down on me
From the Florida border, yes, up in Nashville, Tennessee
I worked in every joint you can name, yes-a, every honky tonk
Along come Mister Yankee slicker sayin "baby, you're what I want"

Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Want to give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA

Oh, nine thousand dollar just sowed the wind
But we smiled at the Yankee slicker with a big old southern grin
They gonna take me out to California, gonna make me a super star
Just pay me all my money, mister, maybe you won't get a scar

Want you to sign the contract
Want you to sign today
Wanna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA

Oh, Slickers steal my money since I was seventeen
If it ain't no pencil pusher then it got to be a honky tonk queen
But I signed my contract, baby, and I want you people to know
That every penny that I make, I want to see where my money goes
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA

Little girl, little Girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, In the pines
Where the sun never shine
I shivered the whole night through

Little girl, little girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, In the pines
Where the sun never shine
I will shiver the whole night through

Little girl, Little Girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, In the pines
Where the sun never shine
I shivered the whole night through

My Husband was a Railroad man
Killed a mile and a half from here
His head, was found, In a drivers wheel
And his body hasn't never been found
Little girl, little girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
You called me weak, and you called me the most
You called rita, bring me back home
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real

Surfboard in high tide

My yeam blowing on that slam
Make you cough-cough tha't's Bronchitis
Put your hands up

Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double on tonkas
I know that you came here to see
If you're a freak, the ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose

Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Shamone, ah, shamone

Well, they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true

The word is out
You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get through

Aight, niggas, time to getcha weight up!
Catch up or keep up, sucka nigga!
King Back, nigga! As if I went somewhere!

[Verse]
Have you bumped your head? Is you out your mind?
Thinking I'm gon' play dead, and I won't shine
Homie I don't lose, even when I ain't tryin'
Start spreading the news, shawty, cause I ain't dying
Don't be frontin' for nothin', cousin, 'cause I ain't lyin'
I'm too far in the front, and you steady falling behind
Just a friendly reminder to you, in case you forgot
I'm at the top of the pile, whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not
You looking at a head case with a fed case
Got rid of all the AKs, they were dead weight

[Echo to fade]

It's not a silly little moment
It's not the storm before the calm
This is the deep and dying breath
Of this love that we've been working on

Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms
Nobody's gonna come and save you
We pulled too many false alarms

We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
I'll make the most of all the sadness
You'll be a bitch because you can
You'll try to hit me just hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
Cause you can't understand
We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

Go cry about it, why don't you?
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

Don't you think we oughta know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?

[Mystikal talking]
N**** you think you know me
Think you know me n****
N**** you don't know me
N**** you don't know
You don't know nothing bout me
You gon' find what you wasn't looking for
Chorus
Watch me or throw it off I ain't right

Murder I just might bring it on cause it's gon' be some s*** tonight x1

[Kane & Abel]
I heard you n****s wanna start some s***
44 caliber hollow tips in the Glock 30 clip
Got them rocks in my pocket rocks on my wrist
Ninety eight six hundred Benz copped from working the night shift
Trying to make a million fo' 22 what I'm trying to do
Little eager too to do what the f**k I gotta do
Flip optimal like an a*s crack
N**** puff puff pas that n**** pa*s the weed I pa*s back
Click clack we come strapped
It's fo' sho' n**** lay low tonight
Cause maybe you could just might hit the flow tonight
I did it I said it y'all n****s is hoes
Paramedics trying to save you cutting open your clothes
N**** you don't wanna go head to head with me
I got some n****s that will paint yo head red with me
Toe to toe with me go to war with me
You could lose yo whole family trying to roll with me
Chorus x1

[Soulja Slim]
Now I know you don't want none of them boys from uptown
Come downtown to yo area until Vietnam
A hard head make a soft a*s I thought a n**** told you
Slim speaking on behalf of that wild magnolia
My people gave me the low while I was doing time upstate
Told me a n**** from downtown caught a little uptown fame
That he ain't seen no real n**** yet
But I bet he don't want no drama
Laying with my people and don't give a f**k that somebody shot his shhh
I only f**k bomb killers dope dealers and real n****s
Ill n****s and trill n****s get it how they live n****s
And they thought they roam uptown for the doo doo brown
Better get face down on the ground when a n**** tie yo legs down
See that's the heart of New Orleans
Ask another n**** from another city about his 3rd
I bet they tell you that the water quick reserve
Leaving and stanking on the curve that's what they heard
They got a hell of a nerve to mail mack in the Calliope
All the way to the 10th left turn 13th
The third time you in the city of how to grow
Chorus x2

[Mystikal]
B**** I'll do you something
You thinkin if I cut you in yo motherf**king head it ain't gon' do s***
B**** this ain't no bluffing
Thinkin all these n****s and these weapons ain't bout no busting
Time to get wit cha we coming to get cha
If I hit you where yo d*** at it's gon' come out where you s*** at
My murder weapon knows best
If you ain't got no vest it's gon' get protest
We making noise all day
I'm trying to tell em' but these b****es got to learn the hard way
Pistol play warned from the hallway
AK spray now yo a*s all taint
B**** I'll do you something

[Silkk The Shocker]
And I gotta do em' something too
They f**ked up and f**ked around with the wrong a*s crew
Now I'm gon' come up from short in a house full of loaded tanks
Cup of canned soda for a picnic cup of canned soda for dank
See we no limit n****s so drama we bout that there
You doubt that there
That's why when I'm hanging out it's gon' be out right there
That's where n****s think our slugs at
Trying to hang where I slang my drugs at
F**k it all the n****s that make mill stay real
And how y'all f**king love that
See I'm a gangsta and plus a n**** cold wit it
Ain't scared of no n****
You left some pots and some boards and them drama boys said go get em'
Step out the project post talking bout wooh n****

If it's gold fo' sho' n****
Cook I stay high like a rocket can't stop it until I get away from yo
Pocket like a gold digger
Ain't nothing but a five o four n****
When they enter putting bodies in bags and tagging cold n****s
Better get yo mind right cause b**** this some real life

[Mystikal]
Watch me or throw it off I ain't right

Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

If I gotsta bring it to you cowards then it's gonna be quick, aight
All your mens up in the jail before, suck my dick
And all them other cats you run with, get done with, dumb quick
How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit? Aight
There go the gun click, 9-1-1 shit
All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club, cause everytime
You come around, it's like (what) I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to
But I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe
They just sayin' that, now cause they miss you
Shit a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you layin' on your back, lookin' at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin' the truth and it hurts
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind

Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool

Off the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain
'cause niggas still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fuckin' with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on that got you think that you Superman
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, "So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go"
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whinin' over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it on on the strength of the hands with them, man
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

I bring down rains so heavy it curse the head
No more talkin - put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin - lest you tryin to end up red
Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin
You know who gon' find you? (Who?) Some old man fishin
Grandma wishin your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Verse 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Verse 3]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Verse 4]
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a young man mourn today
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Verse 1]
I'm a feminine Eminem, a Slim Shady lady
But nice cause I texted Haiti
90 lady cops on the road, and I'm arrested for doing 80
Like Hamlet, all about words, words, words
Divide a whole into thirds, thirds, thirds
I'm a gay sea otter
I blow other dudes out of the water

I'm the man muffin, diving, muffin
Cold and fly like an arctic puffin
Puffin' whacky tobaccy
Hating other rappers like I'm Helga Pataki
And I've been rocking this mic before electricity
Way back in 1000 BCE
That's before the common era, era, era, era, (Era, era)

Oh I can't be stopped, flow so sick that it should be mopped up
Chick's got a dixie cup, I got a dick full of helium, I'll fuck you up
A boy, a girl, a middle-aged bitch, botox in the third person
I give the perspective a switch and Bo talks in the third person
Just relax, if you want to know me, here's two facts:

[Chorus]
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite
Hungry, hungry hypocrite
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite

[Verse 2]
Met a girl named Macy, had sex with her all day
But she was dyslexic, so I ended up doin' the YMCA
We balling, Asian, Wii bowling, prostate cancer semi-colon
Find that hole like I'm Stephen Hawking
Atticus Finch, killing, mocking

Cry, like a child would, you raped my childhood
Just stroll in, rollin' your pole into Rolie Polie Olie's colon
To relax my mind, I take a walk by the clock and I pass the time and
Rhyming, mathematical timing, syntax impacts the intact hymen
I'm an internet provider, came from the web like a horny spider
Fucked a girl in an apple orchard, then came in cider

I thought AIDS was a butt virus like conjunction junction, conjunctivitis
I spit gold bars cause I was molested by my uncle Midas
Gay dads blow pops, another sucker
Oedipus was the first mother fucker

[Chorus]
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite (Hypocrite)
Hungry, hungry hypocrite
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite (Hypocrite)

[Verse 3]
We the people of the USA
Jose, we're not talking to you, essé
We got a border in order to keep you out
It's what my NYU essay's about

Cause we're, xenophobic warrior princess
Molested by my uncle sam, is that incest?
"I WANT YOU" to smell my finger
Does my nephew's scent still linger?

South of queers, north of Hell
The queer ones suck and the brown ones smell
We guard the border and we guard it well
But some slip through the cracks of the liberty bell
Did I say liberty? I meant taco, Paco, hey you better let that rock go
Cause in real life Goliath wins
And then sells all the silk that the widow spins

One more time

[Chrous]
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite (Hypocrite)
Hungry hungry hypocrite
I hate catchy choruses and I'm a hypocrite (Hypocrite)
Yeah, break it down now, what

[Outro]
Bitches and hoes, Bo's hoes, oh
Bitches and hoes, bitches, hoes
Bitches and hoes don't exist
Because the hoes know Bo's a feminist
Bitches and hoes don't exist
Because the hoes know Bo's a feminist
Take off your bras and burn 'em
Or you can let me burn 'em
Take off your bras and burn 'em, oh
You can let Bo Burnham burn 'em
Take off your bras and burn 'em
You can let me burn 'em
Take off your bras and burn em
Or you can let Bo Burnham burn em

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes and you’re still sleeping
With all those dreams in your pretty head
I light a fire while the sun comes creeping
All across the meadow bed
The old clock has stopped, no longer ticking
No longer counting every second

[Verse 2]
Out by the car our snowman's melting
Nothing can bring him back now
His smile a twig and his nose a cucumber
His eyes two pine cones looking out
We got pictures of him like little kids laughing
In the snow we were walking hand in hand

[Bridge]
We went looking for a big surprise
And we found before our eyes
Two white elk grazing on the green
Then we heard the honkers coming
Landing on the lake of summer
Nesting there and waiting for a dream

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes and you’re still sleeping
With all those dreams in your pretty head
I'll light a fire and the sun comes creeping
All across the meadow bed
Telling me to go
But hands beg me to stay
Your lips say that you love
Your eyes say that you hate
There's truth in your lies
Doubt in your faith
What you build you lay to waste
There's truth in your lies
Doubts in your faith
All I've got's what you didn't take
So I, I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this
In pieces
And you, you will be alone
Alone with all your secrets
And regrets, don't lie
You promised me the sky
Then tossed me like a stone
You wrap me in your arms
And chill me to the bone
There's truth in your lies
Doubt in your faith
All I've got's what you didn't take
So I, I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this
In pieces
And you, you will be alone
Alone with all your secrets
And regrets, don't lie
So I, I won't be the one
Be the one to leave this
In pieces
And you, you will be alone
Alone with all your secrets
And regrets, don't lie
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watched their flock by night
And see a bright new shining star
And hear a choir sing
The music seem to come from afar

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
And find no place to borne she child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day
By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day
After tonight, there'll be no coming home soon
No tears of regret, no smell of her perfume
No more dancing feet, to the beats that go boom
While I watch the sunrise all alone in my room

[beat break]
Tonight there'll be no pouring rain
No eyes wide shut to your never ending game
After tonight there'll be no me and you
No distant memories past for me to hold on to

[beat break]
See everybody's working to hold on to what they know
So I guess I kept belive in my tonight will never go
Some spend a lifetime searchin trying to figure out
When hell stops and heaven begins

[beat break]
How soon is now? (repeats)
Xzibit: Goddamn. Hey, whassup, nigga?
Tray-Dee: Oh shit!
Xzibit: Whassup?
Dr. Dre: Hey, that muthafucker clean
Tray-Dee: Hey, who that?
Xzibit: Hey, that Dre, nigga, that the... look at that shit!
Tray-Dee: Hangin' that muthafucker, goddamn! Look at that!
Xzibit: 

[laughing] That nigga chromed out up under that muthafucker!
Tray-Dee: Hangin' on the bumper X!
Xzibit: Hey, hang that shit!
Someone else: What up, Dr. Dre?
Well, I used to wake the mornin'
Before the rooster crowed
Searchin' for soda bottles
To get myself some dough
Brought 'em down to the corner
Down to the country store
Cash 'em in, and give my money
To a man named Curtis Loew
Old Curt was a black man
With white curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine
He did not have a care
He used to own an old Dobro
Used to play it 'cross his knee
I'd give old Curt my money
He'd play all day for me
Play me a song
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well, I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues
He looked to be sixty
And maybe I was ten
Mama used to whoop me
But I'd go see him again
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feet
Try to stay in time
He'd play me a song or two
Then take another drink of wine
Play me a song
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well, I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your Dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues
Yes, sir
On the day old Curtis died
Nobody came to pray
Ol' preacher said some words
And they chunked him in the clay
Well, he lived a lifetime
Playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life
That's all he had to lose
Play me a song
Curtis Loew, hey Curtis Loew
I wish that you was here so
Everyone would know
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis you're the finest picker
To ever play the blues
But I'm down here on this track
Not a shirt upon my back
I will sell to you this island that I own
Yes I feed the mouths I took
But as down winds on the brook
Lord I'm 900 miles from my home

If my old lady she says so
I'll railroad no more
Sidetrack this engine but I still roam
Yes I've given in my call
I've gladly given it all
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my home

If I get down by the bank And the river still does run
Yes and everything I see turns to foam
Even down on the ocean side
No she don't wade in just to bang my pride
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my home

Oh Mary don't you moan
Don't you weep on the ground Oh Mary don't you weep and don't you moan
If I get myself in line
I will be there in due time
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my home
What are they seeing when they look in each other's eyes?
What are they feeling when they see each other's smile?
Is it a love I've never known or an emotion that I've outgrown?
Did I take a wrong turnin' on life's winding road?
Won't somebody help me find the, find the right way to go?
My life need some correction, alteration in direction
Won't someone come with me for a while, for a while, yes, yes I'm lost
What is the secret of this tie that binds
Two souls in communion, both body and mind
Is it special magic or just the nature of things?
Conceived of great spirit, not for beggars but kings
You who have found it, please help me along
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm not, I'm not made out of stone
My needs they are simple, I don't want many things
But I truly want to fly on them wings of love one more time
That's all I need
I wanna fly on them wings
I wanna fly on them wings of love
I'm a stranger here
Won't somebody help me now
I wake up early in the morning
You know, you know, you know my pillow gets soaking wet
All I need, all I need
That's to fly on them wings
I'm in love one more time
I'm a stranger in your town
Don't 

[Incomprehensible] on them wings
Reminiscing on when we used to smoke chronic
Now we puffing the kush and I'm like
(Thank you doctor)
For giving the West Coast CPR
Now here we are, we like to
(Thank you doctor)
We can never pay you back
All the shit you did for hip hop and gangsta rap
For that (thank you doctor)
Without further adieu
Diggy Doc, this one is for you
I remember growing up
Just a Dogg Pound pup bumping G Thang
It's that gin and juice in my cup
And all I knew was N.W.A
Eazy, Yella and Ren, Ice Cube and Dre
Big Snoop, Warren G, Nate Dogg and raised
Kurupt and RBX, the original gang
Bad ass super fly, I can go on for days
D.P.G.C., that's the way I was raised
And motherfucking 2Pac was my shit
Especially when he was rocking on the Doc shit
Killa Cali where it all started
Legacy, me, I'm just happy to be a part of it
This west shit
It's history in the making, this is the next step
California's best kept, yep
It's your own Scoe, I'm a Y.A gangsta rider
On behalf of the South Central L.A, we wanna

Diggy Doc, this one is for you

[Kendrick Lamar]

I remember when it all started
On Alondra, in that small apartment
Burgundy carpet and SEGA cartridges
Pop a flick and blunt ashes all on the garments
Momma of off wine cooler, Magic Johnson played Jordan
I was only four, but it's like I heard it before
A house party cracking off of the music the Dr. recorded
And according to my awareness I was more than coherent
A cold listener, mocking that shit like a parrot
My cousins kicking up dust Cripping
They flag, wear it 'round their hand like a mitton
Aiming, use it for leverage
Shitting on Compton sheriffs like "Fuck the Police"
Woofers and gold Rollies
Every swap meet should know me
Cause I copped every record that dropped
Dropped a dub just to hear Doc drop
A jewel for the sake of hip-hop
Who ever have thought the moment I seen you on Bullis for Cali love
Fifteen years later you'd be saving my life, what
(Thank you doctor)
Reminiscing on when we used to smoke chronic
Now we puffing the kush and I'm like
(Thank you doctor)
For giving the West Coast CPR
Now here we are, we like to

We can never pay you back

Mister Banker
Mister please, how much does money mean
Won't you reconsider mister
Won't you do this thing for me
Ain't got no house
Ain't got no car
All I got, Lord, is my guitar
But you can have that mister banker
Won't you bury my papa for me
Oh mister banker please
Listen to {the} way it sound

I would not be here on my knees
But hey mister banker
It means so much to me
Oh won't you reconsider mister
Won't you do this thing for me

I told you mister
I ain't got no house
Ain't got no car
I got me a 1950 Les Paul guitar
Won't you take it mister banker
Won't you bury my papa for me
Oh mister banker please

[Intro]
"Open up six"
"He's gone!"

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The system's in control, it's all run by the book
I gotta get away so I can free my mind
Xscape is (what I need) from the (electric eyes)

No matter where I am, I see my face around
They pin lies on my name then push from town to town
Don't have a place to run but there's no need to hide
I gotta, find a place, but I won't, hide away

[Chorus]
Xscape
Gotta get away from the system rules in the world today
Xscape
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
Xscape
(The man with the pen that writes the lies that have no end)
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

[Interlude]
Sometimes I feel like
I've gotta get away

[Verse 2]
I tried to share my life with someone I can love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, it's time to make a change

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to
When it's my personal life and I don't live for you
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
You be concerned about you, I can do what I want to

[Chorus]
Xscape (Hoo-hoo!)
Gotta get away from the system rules in the world today (I've gotta get away)
Xscape
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
Xscape
The man with the pen that writes the lies that have no end (I've gotta get away)
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me (I've gotta get away)

Xscape
Gotta get away from the system rules in the world today
Xscape (Yeah)
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
Xscape
The man with the pen that writes the lies that have no end (Hoo-hoo!) (C'mon, now)
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me (Hoooooo-hoo-hoo!) (C'mon, now)

[Bridge]
When I go
This problem world won't bother me
This problem world
This problem world, won't bother me, won't bother me, no more
Yeah! Oh! Yeah! Hooo!

Xscape

Xscape
Gotta get away from the system rules in the world today
Xscape
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away

Escape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me

Xscape
Gotta get away from the system rules in the world today

Now let's read the rays of the

Anything is possible

Anything is possible

Flyin' too much today
It's so groovy to float around sometimes
Even a jelly fish will tell you that
I said flotation is groovy
And he said
And a jelly fish will agree to that
Yeah, but that old jelly fish
Been floatin' around so long
Lord he ain't got a bone in his jelly back
Floatin' every day and every night
Ridin' high is a risk
Sometimes the wind ain't right

Anything is possible

Anything is possible
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of you
Anything you wanna do
If everybody had an ocean
Across the USA
Then everybody'd be surfin'

You'd see 'em wearing their baggies

You'll catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar (Inside, outside, USA)

In this town, television shuts off at two
Oh, what can a lonely rock and roller do?
Oh, the beds are big and the sheets are clean, and
Your girlfriend said you were nineteen
The Styrofoam ice bucket's full of ice
Come up to my motel room
And treat me nice

I don't wanna make no late night New York calls
I don't wanna stare at them ugly grass-mat walls
Chronologically, I know you're young
But when you kissed me in the club you bit my tongue
I'll write you a song and put it on my next LP
Come up to my motel room
And sleep with me

There's a Bible in the drawer, don't be afraid
I'll put up a sign; warn the clean-up maid
Oh, there's lots of soap and there's lots of towels
Never mind those desk clerk scowls
I'll buy you breakfast
They'll think you're my wife
Come up to my motel room
And save my life

[Verse 1]
You turn on the light, then you turn it back off
’Cause sleeping alone, yeah, it ain't what you thought
It's the drip of the sink, it's the click of the clock
And you're wondering if I'm sleeping
You heard from your friends that I'm doing okay
And you're thinking that maybe you made a mistake
And you want me to know, but I don't wanna know
How you're feeling

[Chorus 1]
Keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself

[Verse 2]
If you see me out and I'm standing alone
Well, it don't mean that I'm gonna need a ride home
If you walk up to me like it ain't what it is
I know that it ain't gonna end with a kiss

[Chorus 1]
So keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Yeah, keep it to yourself

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, when you're drunk, and it's late
And you're sad, and you hate going home alone
'Cause you're missing me like hell
Keep it to yourself
Yeah, keep it to yourself

[Outro]
Hmm
Yeah, keep it to yourself
Hmm

[Pharrell:]
Ladies and gentlemen
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
He's a friend of mine

[Justin:]
Yes, yes I am

[Pharrell:]
And he goes by the name...
Justin
Wowoowoooo
All the way
From Memphis, Tennessee
And he's got somethin' special for y'all tonight
He's gonna sing a song for y'all
About this girl

[Justin:]
Come in right here?

[Pharrell:]
Yea, come on
On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown
But where is it now
Mamma listen
Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...
Running fast in my mind
Girl don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown
Or hasn't it been found?
Mamma listen
Senorita, I feel for you
(Feel for you)
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(No, no)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(He don't love ya baby)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my...
Ah, ah, arms...
(Won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Mama lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Baby won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
And no longer will you ever have to cry
Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(Deal with things you don't have to)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(No, no)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my...
Ah, ah, arms...
(Whoa)
Ah, ah, arms...
(My baby)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Oooh, yea)
Ah, ah, arms...
When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
You won't ever cry
Now listen
I wanna try somethin' right now
See they don't do this anymore
I'ma sing something
And I want the guys to sing wit' me
They go
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
And then the ladies go
"I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you"
Guys sing
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
And ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Feels good don't it, come on
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Yea, ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Show the good to me
Sing it one more time
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Yea, yea..
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Gentlemen, good night
Ladies, good morning

[laughs]
That's it
My blood boils with the tropic heat
And the rhythm of my heart has a tom-tom beat
You bring out the savage in me
Primitive love cries in my ears with the pressure of a hundred million years
You bring out the savage in me
Call it madness or sin, how was I not to know
What was creeping within me
Just like Tarzan be my ape
Man, I'm getting so ferocious
That I can't escape man
You'll find out how wild I can be for you
Bring the savage in me
My blood boils with the tropic heat
And the rhythm of my heart has a tom-tom beat
You bring out the savage in me
Primitive love cries in my ears with the pressure of a hundred million years
You bring out the savage in me
Call it madness or sin, how was I not to know
What was creeping within me
Just like Tarzan be my ape
Man, I'm getting so ferocious
That I can't escape man
You'll find out how wild I can be for you
Bring the savage in me
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

You better make your face up in your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter down the door
You better run

Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

You better run all day and run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight
Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to mother in a cardboard box
You better run

[Spoken] Hey, open up! HaHaHaHaHaaaaaaaaaa!

[sound of car skidding, followed by loud scream]

[chanting] Hammer, Hammer...1
We Dem Boyz (Louis Futon Remix)

Hol up, we dem boyz
Hol up, we dem boyz
Hol up, hol up, hol up, we makin' noise
Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz

Hol up, hol up, hol up, pop a bottle
Hol up, hol up, hol up, if you suck then swallow
Smell that marijuana, they gon' follow
Throwin money on her like she won the lotto
Pussy must be serious
Scared of heights come face your fears
Do it just like Nicki gon' and bend it over
Say she never smoked I turned her to a stoner
Young nigga but I'm ready
Oh, foreign girls call me sexy
And white girls gimme becky
But first I gotta roll this joint, baby hol' up

Hol up, we dem boyz
Hol up, we dem boyz
Hol up, hol up, hol up, we makin' noise
Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz
Hol up, hol up, hol up, you drive me crazy
Number 1, bitch you can't replace me
Leave the club these hoes be tryin to chase me
You got a ass so fat lets make a baby
Damn, I'm smokin weed in my Mercedes
Hol up, these niggas broke, these niggas lazy
Man they money slim, they actin shady
Im in my brand new car, who wanna race
Ho, bitch you ain't call my phone so why you showin up
Im takin them shots all my niggas stay loaded up
Man on the low all these hoes be actin so material
Hol up, man did you see her interior
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, "Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you're hundred proof"
I asked her her name, she said, "Blah-blah-blah"
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, "How do you like the show?" She said, "I was very amused"
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, "Do ya have a man?" She tried to pretend
She said, "No I don't, I only have a friend"
Come on, I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing
You, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
So I took Blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine and Jag
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named Blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build a
Relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up and then I called again
I said, "Yo, who was that?" "Oh, he's just a friend"
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that, just bust this
You, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, got what I need, but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, got what I need, but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
Yo, could you tell me where is door three?
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
I'm not a saint but stand accused
You're with someone who thinks love's the same as being used
Now suspicious minds may say, it's over, over
Whether I live or die, you are my savior, you're my savior
It's my deja vu, sweet deja vu
Through the feast or famine I'll be with you
Sheltering arms, reach out to you
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
The silent nights, I cry your name
You're with someone who says, they can get you through your pain
These golden years keep on returning, it's hurting
Precious and few, you're my savior, you're my savior
It's my deja vu, sweet deja vu
Through the feast or famine I'll be with you
Sheltering arms reach out to you
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
Cherish what they've lost
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
When often it's too late
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
It's my deja vu
(My deja vu)
Sweet deja vu
(Keep coming through)
Through the feast or famine, I'll be with you
(All that is true)
Sheltering arms, reach out to you
(Ooh)
Oh, baby
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
Girls it's been my pleasure
To know quite a lot of you
And in the main
You're pretty sane, it's true
But there are a few who do to
Doo ti doo too beautiful a job
It isn't quite what they planned
When the man gets the upper hand
He's takin' her for a ride
I'd call it suicide

If when she tries to run away
And he calls her back, she comes
If there's a next time, he's okay
Cause she's under both his thumbs
She limps along to his side
Singing a song of ruin. I'd
Bet he says nothin' doin'
I-I-I-I I'd call it suicide

She loves to ride in big parades
But he wouldn't so she won't
She needs at least a dozen maids
But if he says no she don't
He wishes she knew his side
Soon there'll be trouble brewin' I'd
Bet he says nothin' doin'
I-I-I-I I'd call it suicide
Suicide, she's commitin' it
Suicide, he's not gettin' it
Suicide, it's a quittin' a day

She limps along to his side
Singing a song of ruin. I'd
Bet he says nothin' doin'
I-I-I-I I'd call it suicide
Oh, sometimes
I get a good feeling, yeah
And a feeling that I never
Never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Oh, sometimes
I get a good feeling, yeah
And a feeling that I never
Never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

[AMNERIS]
From deep within the tomb, a gentle light still shone
Showing me my path as I ascended to the throne
Certain in my heart that ancient wars must cease
The lovers' deaths gave birth to a reign of peace

And their story
And my journey
And the lesson they provide
Draw their strength and inspiration
From a love that never died

Then He smiled at me, pa-rum-pum-pum-pum, me and my drum

[Verse 1]
Day turns to night, when all is said and done
I guess I wanted to be the lonely one
When I wake up, I've got your thoughts on my mind
Don't dim the lights 'til I'm faded, intuition's blind

[Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 2]
Some call it strange, it's just a frame of mind
I never said that was ideal, don't mean it ain't sublime
Beneath the moon, I am a rising sun
And as the stars come out, we'll have some fun

[Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 3]
And when it's dark
Though I don't know why
Can't seem to think alright
Just wish that you'd come by-y-y-y-y
By-y-y-y
Ooh ooh
Last Saturday night I got married me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parted gonna take another stroll downtown

All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club, cause everytime
You come around, it's like (what) I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to
But I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe
They just sayin' that, now cause they miss you
Shit a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you layin' on your back, lookin' at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin' the truth and it hurts

Off the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain
'cause niggas still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fuckin' with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on that got you think that you Superman
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, "So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go"
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whinin' over puss

They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here

Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here

Up in here, up in here

No more talkin - put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin - lest you tryin to end up red
Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin
You know who gon' find you? (Who?) Some old man fishin
Grandma wishin your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool

[Verse 1]
I don't like you but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly

[Chorus]
You really got a hold on me, come on
You really got a hold on me, yeah
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me
Hold me, hold me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't want you but I need you
Don't want to kiss you but I need you
Oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now

[Chorus]
You really got a hold on me, come on
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me, yeah
(You really got a hold on me)
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me
Hold me, hold me, yeah

[Verse 3]
I want to leave you, don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Oh, I want to split now
'Cause I can't quit now

[Chorus]
You really got a hold on me, come on
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me

You got a hold, babe
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
Yeah
(You really got a hold on me)
The roses in the window box
Have tilted to one side
Everything about this house
Was born to grow and die

Oh it doesn't seem a year ago
To this very day
You said I'm sorry honey
If I don't change the pace
I can't face another day

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

I wonder if those changes
Have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire
That you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I hope you're happy now
Well if the wind of change comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

Wah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Wah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Love lies bleeding in my hands

[Verse 1]
She sits him down in a stiff chair
Rubs his back and strokes his hair
Telling him, "It's okay to cry"
But he just sits and stares
The merciless moon outside
Has nothing, now he's come to realise
Only the desolation he feels
The cold distance inside
You can get up if you want!

[Chorus]
But you and I now
We can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now
Though it's cold inside
Feel the tide turning

[Verse 2]
While the priest just sits and weeps
Lamenting the fact that he can see
Darkness and light in so much detail
He has given himself over
Refusing what he knows to be real
He turns away from every meal
Starving himself of goodness
He doesn't think he can heal

[Chorus]
But you and I now
We can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now
Though it's cold inside
Feel the tide turning
Country Winston on the banjo!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
"What if I lost all I had?"
Said the stranger to his dad
And the witness was confused
He can't tell what is bad
Instead, he runs up to the nearest girl
And he comments on her glorious curls
Says, "Darling come with me
I'll show you a whole new world"

[Chorus]
But you and I now
We can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now
Though it's cold inside
Feel the tide turning
You and I now
We can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now
Though it's cold inside
Feel the tide turning

[Outro]
Thank you so much

[Verse 1]
Sweet, wonderful you
You make me happy with the things you do
Oh, can it be so?
This feeling follows me wherever I go

[Chorus]
I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why

[Verse 2]
Don't, don't break the spell
It would be different and you know it will
You, you make loving fun
And I don't have to tell you, but you're the only one

[Outro]
You, you make loving fun (It's all I wanna do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I wanna do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I wanna do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I wanna do)

[Verse 1]
Welcome you to Cloud City
Capital of the sky
Where all the girls are so pretty
And all the boys are so high, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
Cloud City
Cloud City
Cloud City

[Verse 2]
Welcome you to Cloud City
Where there's aurora borealis power
And melting golden popsicle
And God again that you can only find in Cloud City

[Chorus]
Cloud City
Cloud City
Cloud City

[Bridge]
It's a Cloud City on a windy day
When he and they were in a Milky Way, now

[Verse 1]
Welcome you to Cloud City
Capital of the sky
Where all the girls are so pretty
And all the boys are so high, ah, ah, ah

Welcome you to Cloud City
Where there's aurora borealis power
And melting golden popsicle
And God again that you can only find in Cloud City
Baby's into runnin' around, hangin' with the crowd
Puttin' your business in the street, talkin' out loud
Sayin' you bought her this and that and how much you done spent
I swear she must believe it's all heaven sent

Hey, boy, you better bring the chick around
To the sad, sad truth, the dirty lowdown

(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Taught her how to talk like that
(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Gave her that big idea

Nothin' you can't handle, nothin' you ain't got
Put your money on the table and drive it off the lot
Turn on that old lovelight and turn a "Maybe" to a "Yes"
Same old schoolboy game got you into this mess

Hey son, better get back on to town
Face the sad old truth, the dirty lowdown
(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Put those ideas in your head
(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)

Yeah

Come on back down, little son
Dig the low, low, low, low, lowdown!

You ain't got to be so bad, got to be so cold
This dog eat dog existence sure is getting old
Got to have a Jones for this, Jones for that
This runnin' with the Joneses, boy, just ain't where it's at, no, no

You gonna come back around
To the sad, sad truth, the dirty lowdown

(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Got you thinking like that, boy
(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)

I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Said I wonder, wonder, wonder, I wonder who
Oh, look out for that lowdown (I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who)
That dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty lowdown
(Ooohooohooohooo)
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
Ooohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who

Got you thinkin' like that, got you thinkin' just like that
(Oohooohooohooo
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who) Lookin' that girl in the face is so sad
I'm ashamed of you

I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder who
(When this began)
I had nothing to say
And I get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused)
And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me)
But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose)
Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain
I've felt so long
(Erase all the pain till its gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused)
Looking everywhere only to find
That its not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I)
What do I have but negativity
Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose)
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain
I've felt so long
(Erase all the pain till its gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
I will never know
Myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel
Anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be
Anything till I break away from me
I will break away
I'll find myself today
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain
I've felt so long
(Erase all the pain till its gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm somewhere I belong
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air
Sweet blossom come on under the willow
We can have high times if you abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's my summer love for spring, fall and winter
She can make happy any man alive
Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
Or caught up in sunlight, now come on out singing
I'll walk you in the sunshine, ooh
Come on honey, come along with me
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight, yes indeed
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is half way down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander 'round, I wander 'round
Sunshine, daydream, walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes, blooming like a red rose
Now come on over sweety face
Ride our singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine, daydream, sunshine, daydream
Sleeping through your daydream
Sunshine daydream, 

[Incomprehensible] daydream
Sunshine daydream, waiting in a cold stream

[Incomprehensible]
Going, going where the wind goes
They never gonna miss us

[Incomprehensible]
I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine, daydream, sunshine, daydream
Ooh, 

[Incomprehensible]
Ooh, 

[Incomprehensible] daydream

[Incomprehensible]
Sunshine, daydream
Ooh, sunshine daydream
Ooh, sweet 

[Incomprehensible]
The way will be opening, total insubordination
Complete revolt, formal sabotage
Still it must be stressed that on this port
There is no room for compromise
Faint, all our crime is crime of physical setting
Except inside the mind, all inside the mind
How come more and more futile?
The American dream is the fertilize
Nothing at all can be expected
Except for the use of violence
Nothing at all can be changed if
Evolution turned us to silence
Confrontations clearing the way
Will be opening, will be opening
Not as end in itself but as a beginning

[Intro]
Come on, yeah
Come on, uh
I think I gotta tell y'all somethin'
Uh

[Verse 1]
Lemme tell you somethin', tell you how I feel
When he comes around, I gettin' to feelin' ill
It's a achin' feelin' inside my chest
It's like I'm goin' in to cardiac arrest

[Chorus]
I got this heartburn
I got this heartburn, ooh
Heartburn
Heartburn, ooh

[Verse 2]
Got me trippin', slippin', gettin' beside myself
I tried some medication but don't nothin' help
So I said, "Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, tell me, will I die?"
And he said, "Count to, count to, count to, count to five"
I'll be alright

[Chorus]
I got this heartburn
(Burnin' in my)
I got this heartburn, oh
Got this heartburn
(Yeah, it's out of con-)
Heartburn
(You know what? Check this out, like, uh)

[Bridge]
Adrenaline rushin' up in my body, body
(Adrenaline rushin' up in my body, body)
Somebody tell me where is the party, party
(Somebody tell me where is the party, party)
Adrenaline rushin' up in my body, body
(Adrenaline rushin' up in my body, body)
Somebody tell me where is the party, party
(Somebody tell me where is the party, party)
Ooh, oh

[Chorus]
Heartburn
(Burnin' in my)
Heartburn
(Ooh, oh)
Heartburn
(It's out of control)
Heartburn
(Yeah)
Woo

[Outro dialogue]
Yeah
Well, thank you very much
We're gonna get into it
You know, we feel so good to be here with y'all tonight, for real
It's nothing like this, you know
Nothing like this close, special, intimate feeling we got today
I'm loving it
And I wanna sing one of my favorite songs for you
'Cause you know how I feel about treating each other right
Especially for us ladies 'cause we deserve it, yeah
And my fellas, y'all deserve it, too
That's right, that's right
So let's sing it like this, come on, come on
If y'all know the words, sing it with me
Some of us, we're hardly ever here
The rest of us, we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from
Being just a number?
How will I hold my head
To keep from going under?

[Chorus]
Down to the wire
I wanted water, but
I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes
To take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do
When the world keeps
Testing me, testing me, testing me
How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding
Right outside my door
I hear them whisperin'
They're tryin' to ride it out
They've never gone this long
Without a kill before

[Chorus]
Wheels up
I got to leave this evening
Can't seem to shake these vultures
Off of my trail
Power is made by power being taken
So I keep on running
To protect my situation

[Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
What'cha gonna do about it?
What'cha gonna do about it?
What'cha gonna do about it?
Don't give up, give up, give up
Don't give up, give up, give up
Don't give up, give up, give up

[Verse 1]
Momma loves her baby
And Daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you Babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooooh Babe
Ooooh Baby blue
Ooooh Babe

[Verse 2]
If you should go skating, boy
On the thin ice of modern life
Pay attention at school ator all the rules
Take a job and the wife
But don't be surprised, when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
Sinking out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice

[Outro]
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Ooh, baby, please help me
Outside is the right side to the night sky I will go
You know it could deserve me then it owes me, oh we are, yeah
Outside is the right side to the night sky I will go
You know that it will owe me, you deserve me, oh we are don't show this (?)

You know you're gonna bring me down, we're doing this things
I'll make you stay inside

Don't say with (?)
Don't say with (?)
Don't say with (?)
Don't say with (?)
Don't say with (?)
Don't say with (?)
Don't say with (?)

You know you're gonna bring me down, we're doing this things
I'll make you stay inside

Outside is the right side to the night sky I will go
You know it could deserve me then it owes me, oh we are
Outside is the right side to the night sky I will go
You know that it will owe me, you deserve me, oh we are, yeah

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
And ooh, she had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, Lord, couldn't believe his mind
Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
She spoke so kind, God knows, talked so fair
So Samson said, "Delilah, you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength come as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his works
He was the strongest man that ever has lived on Earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like threads, yeah
When he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down (Look out)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Well now, Samson and the lion, they got in attack
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws
And he ripped that beast, God knows, he killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down (Great God Almighty, talk to me)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down (That's all)
A girl was kneeling by phone this morning mumbling out some kind of prayer
It seemed the better way to break away the day
Then getting drunk again in Peter Bibby's favourite chair

When I kneel down beside you to share in the spirit and faith
And much to my surprise your empty open eyes
And black ink running down your bloodless face

[Intro: will.i.am]
I'mma be-be-be-be, I'mma-I'mma be...

Yeah, I'mma be the upgraded new negro, oh

B-E-P we definite-

Powerful with energy

Crossed the globe, and seven seas
Take care of our families
Rockin' shows, makin' cheese
I'mma be out with my Peas
Livin' life, feelin' free
That's how it's supposed to be
Come join my festivities
Celebrate like I'mma be
I am driving up 85 in the kind of morning
That lasts all afternoon, I'm just stuck inside the gloom
Four more exits to my apartment
But I am tempted to keep the car in drive and leave it all behind
'Cause I wonder sometimes about the outcome of a still verdict less life
Am I living it right, am I living it right?
Am I living it right
Why, why Georgia, why?
I rent a room and I fill the spaces with wood in places
To make it feel like home but all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis, just a stirrin' in my soul
Either way I wonder sometimes about the outcome of a still verdict less life
Am I living it right, am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, why Georgia, why?
So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me, don't believe me when I say I've got it down
Everybody's just a stranger but that's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's a price I have to pay, still everything happens for a reason
Is no reason not to ask myself if I'm living it right
Am I living it right, am I living it right?
Why tell me, why
Why, why Georgia, why?
Holy Moses I have been removed
I have seen the spectre he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses I have been removed
Holy Moses I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness but it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses I have been deceived
I'm going back to the border
Where my affairs, my affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
Been poisoned from my head down to my shoes
Holy Moses I have been deceived
Holy Moses let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man over there
What's his colour I don't care
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace
How he makes her feel
When he look her in the eyes and tell her
I love you, yeah
He seems so for real
When he whispers and says
I'll never leave you, no
And he speaks them words to her heart
And make her feel like she on top
Of the world, yeah, oh my
Then turn around and break her heart
And make her feel like the whole world's on top of her, whoa
And now something other made me talk about it

When a man lies, he pierces the very soul of that woman
Yes he does, yeah
I'm just telling the truth
When a man lies, he kills every reason
She ever had for loving him, yeah
Mirror I'm talking to you, yeah

How he promised her things
While he's making sweet love to her mind
Selling big dreams, yeah
That's what he do, or he can paint the scene
With every word out of his mouth
Make her wanna believe, oh she believes
That everything that he says is true
Now all the dreams she bought and the tales he told
Cinderella to the old pot of gold
Broke up for a heart and stole the glory
And it let me here to tell the story

When a man lies, he pierces the very soul of that woman
Yes he does, yeah
I'm just telling the truth
When a man lies, he kills every reason
She ever had for loving him, yeah
Mirror I'm talking to you, yeah

Hey now don't ya all shoot the messenger, nah, nah
I was sent here to deliver, whoa
Y'all can go ahead and call me a lawyer
Call me... to the day I'll represent, the woman

Cause when a man lies, he pierces the very soul of that woman
Yes he does, hey
I'm just telling the truth
When a man lies, he kills every reason
She ever had for loving him, yeah
Mirror I'm talking to you, yeah
As I was walkin' 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction, she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try, might as well try

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without askin' she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls

In the thick of the evening when the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and was closing the door
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before

Well, I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way it does in this song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

Well there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
I had to learn the hard way-i had to let her pass by, let her pass by
Wind in the willow's playin' "Tea for Two";
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stoppin' strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing in the heart of gold band, heart of gold band
So ya
Thought ya
Might like to, go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
I've got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isn't well, he's at home in his bed
And they sent us along with a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand
Without a warning you broke my heart
You took it, darlin' and you tore it apart
You left me sitting in the dark, crying
You said, your love for me was dying
I'm begging you, baby, baby, please
I'm begging you baby, baby, please
Turn on the light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
Let it shine, shine, shine, let it shine
And I wanna know, 

[Incomprehensible]
I get a little lonely in the middle of the night
I need you, darlin', to make things alright
Come on, baby, come on, please
Come on, baby, baby, please
Turn on the light, let it shine on me

[Incomprehensible] on your love light, let it shine on me
A little bit higher, a little bit higher
Just a little bit higher, a little bit higher
A little bit higher
Come on, baby, come on, please
I'm begging you, baby, I'm down on my knees
Turn on the light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright, baby, let it shine
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
Well, you know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
Well, you know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow?
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
Oh, now you know I believe and how
Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you-ou
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight
Midnight, lock all the doors
And turn out the lights
Feels like the end of the world
This Sunday night
There's not a sound
Outside the snow's comin' down
Somehow I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind
Three O two
The space in this room
Has turned on me
And all my fears
Have cornered me here
Me and my TV screen
The volume's down
Blue lights are dancing around
And still I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind
Daylight is climbing the walls
Cars start and feet walk the halls
The world wakes and now I am saved
At least by the light of day
At least by the light of day

Ming: I do
Dale: I do not!

King of the impossible

[Skit 4]
(Recite after me your majesty. With this ring, I thee wed!)

[Chorus]
Flash!
Yeah, uh
In the name of Jesus (Spread the word!)
"No weapon formed against me shall prosper" (Preach!)
"And every tongue that rises against me in judgment, thou shall condemn" (Preach!)
(Lord give me a sign!) "For this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord"
(Preach!) "And their righteousness is of me," said the Lord (Preach!)
Amen, uh
Lord give me a sign

I really need talk to you Lord
Since the last time we talked, the walk has been hard
Now I know you haven't left me, but I feel like I'm alone
I'ma big boy now, but I'm still not grown
And I'm still goin' through it (What), pain and the hurt (Yeah)
Soakin' up trouble like, rain in the dirt (Yeah)
And I know, only I can stop the rain
With just the mention of my savior's name, in the name of Jesus
Devil I rebuke you, for what I go through
Been tryna make me do, what I used to (What)
But all that stops right here (Yeah)
As long as the Lord's in my life, I will have no fear
I will know no pain, from the light to the dark (Come on)

Please, show me some'n (some'n)
I'm tired talkin' to him, knowin' he frontin' (Frontin')
Cryin' 'bout, "Life ain't nothin'" (Nothin')
But you either be the one mad 'cause you trapped, or the one huntin' (Come on)
Trapped in yo' own mind, waitin' on the Lord (Yeah)
Or huntin' with the word that, cuts like a sword
The spoken word is stronger than, the strongest man
Carries the whole world like the strongest hand
Through the trials and tribulations, you never let us down
(Jesus!) I know you're here with us now
(Jesus!) I know you're still with us now
Keep it real with us now, I wanna feel show me how
(Please!) Let me take yo' hand, guide me (What)
I'll walk slow but stay right beside me
(Please!) Devil's tryna find me (Please)
Hide me, Hold up, I take that back
Protect me and give me the strength to fight back! (Lord give me a sign)
Let me know what's on yo' mind
Let me know what I'm gon' find
It's all in time, show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind, Lord give me a sign

I won't quit until I die (What)
I'm gon' make it, wrong or right (Yeah)
And make it through the darkest time (Yeah)
And when the morning comes, you'll see
That all I have is God in me (Lord give me a sign))

Let me know what's on yo' mind
Let me know what I'm gon' find
It's all in time, show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind, Lord give me a sign
Show me what I gots to do, to bring me closer to you
As I'ma go through, whatever you want me to
Just let me know what to do, Lord give me a sign
I'm headed down a highway, got my suitcase by my side
Blue skies hangin' over my head, I got five hundred miles to ride
I'm goin' down to Memphis town to play a late night show
I hope the people are ready there 'cause the boys are all ready to go

Well, I'm a whiskey rock-a-roller, that's what I am
Women, whiskey and miles of travelin is all I understand

Yes, I was born a travelin' man and my feet still burn the ground
I don't care for fancy music if your shoes can't shuffle around
I got a hundred women or more and there's no place I call home
The only time I'm satisfied is when I'm on the road, Lord

Well, I'm a whiskey rock-a-roller, that's what I am
Women, whiskey and miles of travelin' is all I understand

Sometimes I wonder where will we go
Lord, don't you take my whiskey and rock 'n' roll

Take me down to Memphis town, bus driver, get me there
I got me a queenie, she got long brown curly hair
She likes to drink Old Granddad and her shoes do shuffle around
And every time I see that gal, Lord, she wants to lay me down
Well, I'm a whiskey rock-a-roller, that's what I am
Women, whiskey and miles of travelin' is all I understand

Sometimes I wonder where will we go
Lord, don't you take my whiskey and rock 'n' roll

[Jemaine]
So you're leaving?
I can tell because I can see you're leaving
But if you're trying to break my heart
Your plan is flawed from the start
You can't break this heart, it's liquid
It melted when I met you
And as you leave, don't turn back to me
Don't turn around to see if I'm crying
I'm not crying, not crying, not crying
I'm not crying, it's just been raining on my face
And if you think you see some tear tracks down my cheeks
Please, please don't tell my mates

[Bret]
I'm not crying, no, I'm not crying
And if I am crying, it's not because of you
It's because I'm thinking about a friend of mine
You don't know who is dying, that's right, dying
These aren't tears of sadness because you're leaving me
I've just been cutting onions, I'm making a lasagna for one
Oh, I'm not crying, no

[Jemaine and Bret]
There's just a little bit of dust in my eye
That's from the path that you made when you said your goodbye
I'm not weeping 'cause you won't be here to hold my hand
For your information, there's an inflammation in my tear gland
I'm not upset because you left me this way
My eyes are just a little sweaty today
They've been looking around and are searching for you
They've been looking for you even though I told them not to
These aren't tears of sadness, they're tears of joy
I'm just laughing, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

I'm sitting at this table called love
Staring down at the irony of life
How come we've reached this fork in the road
And yet it cuts like a knife?
I'm not crying
I'm not crying
I'm not crying
Jimi:
"here he comes"
"here he comes take one"

Here he comes, i say
Here comes your lover now

[Verse 1]
What will you say when the day comes, when it's no fun
When it's all done, when it's no fun
What will you say when the time comes, there's a dry run
When it's undone and there's no one

[Chorus]
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

[Verse 2]
What will you do when you wake up, fatten you up
Fasten you up, fatten you up
No memories to get cloudy, to get cloudy
When you can't see what you can't see
It's all the same when it's morning and you're boring
Still ignoring everything
No memories to remind you of the old you
Nothing for it, just keep it up, keep it up

[Chorus]
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much

[Verse 3]
What will you say when the day comes, when it's no fun
When it's all done
When it's unfun
What will you say when the time comes
There's a dry run
When it's undone
And it's no one

[Chorus]
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

[Verse 4]
What will you do when you wake up, fatten you up
Fasten you up, fatten you up
No memories to get cloudy, to get cloudy
When you can't see what you can't see
It's all the same when it's morning and you're boring
Still ignoring everything
No memories to remind you of the old you
Nothing for it, just keep it up, keep it up

[Chorus]
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much

[Bridge]
With no memory, with no memory
With no memory to keep you up at night
With no memory, with no memory
With no memory to keep you up at night
Never Le Nkemise

I'm indestructible, gangster number one
Play now cry later
The harder they come, the harder they fall
Hoes, you can't stop me
You can try, but you won't survive
Cause I'm a muthafuckin' ninja
Zef Side Represent, you fuckin' with the best
Ninja the fed kapper
Y'all naaiers
Clit fucker
Dungeon/dungeon/dungeon
Looks like I'm gonna need my
Click click
That black lock nine millimeter
Every day's like bulletproof vest time
When you're rollin' through the muthafuckin Zef Side
And now we don't stop at the roadblocks
In the day look around three-sixty degrees
If you bustin' the muthafuckin' doughnut
I'm not even trusting a roadblock
I'll pigs bust caps in the back, of your head
Bang, now you're dead
Whatcha gonna do, huh?
Maybe go run tell Zuma? (ha ha ha)
He doesn't give a fuck
That's why we keep it muthafuckin' gangsta
I'm not scared of you
But you muthafuckin' scared of me
Yeah, the Ninja has become the enemy
I'm indestructible, gangster number one
Played-out cry later
The harder they come, the harder they fall
Os, you can't stop me
You can try, but you won't survive
Cause I'm a muthafuckin' ninja
If you don't like funerals, don't kick sand in a Ninja's face
Cold iron shackles, ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evenin' train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee Jed

Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, do you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee Jed

Tennessee, Tennessee, there ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby won't you carry me back to Tennessee

Drink all day and rock all night
The law come to get you if you don't walk right
Got a letter this morning, baby all it read
You better head back to Tennessee Jed

I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Catch a few winks, baby, under the bed
Then you head back to Tennessee Jed
Tennessee, Tennessee, there ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby won't you carry me back to Tennessee

I run into Charlie Fog
Blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My doggie turned to me and he said
Let's head back to Tennessee Jed
I woke up a feelin' mean
Went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around, and the letters read
You better head back to Tennessee Jed

Tennessee, Tennessee, there ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby won't you carry me back to Tennessee
High green chilly winds and windy vines
In loops around the twisted shafts of lavender
They're crawling to the sun
Underfoot the ground is patched
With arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita
Stark and shiny in the breeze
Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and
Droop so hungry neath the sky
William Tell has stretched his bow till it won't stretch
No furthermore and/or it may require a change that hasn't come before
No more time to tell how, this is the season of what
Now is the time of returning with our thought
Jewels polished and gleaming
Now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein
Now is the test of the boomerang tossed in the night of redeeming
Seven faced marble eyed transitory dream doll
Six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow
Five men writing with fingers of gold
Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale
Three girls waiting in a foreign dominion
Riding in the whale belly, fade away in moonlight
Sink beneath the waters to the coral sands below
When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
I'm on your side
Oh when times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

[Verse 1]
I think it's funny all the games you play
But I don't play with you
So why you choose to play with me that way?
All I do is treat you with the utmost
I need the same
So if you're looking for that ratchetness
Don't look my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'ma love you
And you ain't gotta love me back
I'll do everything I say I do for you
To show my love just can't be matched

[Chorus]
So when you're out late night throwing up them bills
The more you do that B.S., the more I keep it real
Go ahead and lose yourself, I'ma stay intact
If it's one thing men respect, it's when we dont react
That's that power back
He used to stay gone, now he's coming home
That's that power back
And when I stop calling, he's on my phone
That's that power back
And when it seems I don't care, he's right there
That's that power back
I'll just sit back and watch you do it to yourself
That's that power back

[Verse 2]
I love you too much to ever leave you, oh oh oh
I love me too much to wanna be you, oh oh no
Said the clock strikes at least two times in a day, yeah yeah
And when we're right, we're unbreakable
Just need some time to get us back in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'ma love you
And you ain't gotta love me back (Oh, oh yeah)
I'll do everything I say I do for you
To show my love just can't be matched

[Chorus]
So when you're out late night throwing up them bills
The more you do that B.S., the more I keep it real
Go ahead and lose yourself, I'ma stay intact
If it's one thing men respect, it's when we dont react
That's that power back
He used to stay gone, now he's coming home
That's that power back
And when I stop calling, he's on my phone
That's that power back
And when it seems I don't care, he's right there
That's that power back
I'll just sit back and watch you do it to yourself
That's that power back

[Bridge]
I gave you everything that you wanted
Gave everything that you could need
I won't ever ask you for nothing
But you're love is what I need

[Outro]
He used to stay gone, now he's coming home
That's that power back
And when I stop calling, he's on my phone
That's that power back
And when it seems I don't care, he's right there
That's that power back
I'll just sit back and watch you do it to yourself
That's that power back
Out, runnin' around/Seein' every crazy sight
A lady in a evenin' gown/Made from a paper kite
We asked her why/She wore such a crazy gown
She said if ya wanna fly/Ya gotta get off the ground

Don't know what we hear an' see/Hey, we gotta be...
Out of our tree
Out of our tree
Out of our tree

Ran a little ways more/And we happened to meet
A man building a door/Right in the middle of the street
We asked him why/He did such a crazy thing
He said if ya wanna get by/The doorbell ya hafta ring

Don't know what we hear an' see/Hey, we gotta be...
Out of our tree
Out of our tree
Out of our tree

[Then we saw)] a cat/Diggin' through a garbage can
Out jumped a rat/A dog an' the garbage man
Now everything we see/We don't try to figure out
We know that it just can't be/But it's happenin' without a doubt
Don't know what we hear an' see/Hey, we gotta be...
Out of our tree
Out of our tree
Out of our tree

Out of our tree X 2 over bass/drum break, then bloodcurdling scream, band
Comes back in and song ends with a bunch more Out of our tree's
You say what you want to Jack, I'm gonna get my baby back
Trouble came right away, now you say she's gone to stay
Cough it up, hit the street, left without a word to me
Oh Oh, you don't know, how that girl could touch my soul

You say what you want to Jack, I'm gonna get my baby back

Suddenly you know my name, say there's only me to blame
It's gonna rain, it's gonna shine, gotta stay between the lines
Rollin down a lonely road, you say I should let it go
Wish you would come on down, if you need I'll come around

You say what you want to Jack, I'm gonna get my baby back

Used to have a son named Joe, where he gone to I don't know
Maybe down in Mexico, livin off of Pattie's door
If you give me half a chance, I will make her sing and dance
I'm gonna give her all my soul, I'm gonna play her Rock'n Roll

You say what you want to Jack, I'm gonna get my baby back
You say what you want to jack, I'm gonna get my baby back

Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah

[Verse 1]
You saw my pain, washed out in the rain
And broken glass, saw the blood run from my veins
But you saw no fault, no cracks in my heart
And you knelt beside, my hope torn apart
But the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life

[Chorus]
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like
Just promise me we'll be all right

[Verse 2]
So lead me back
Turn south from that place
And close my eyes to my recent disgrace
Cause you know my call
And we'll share my all
And our children come and they will hear me roar

[Chorus]
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like
Just promise me we'll be all right

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
But hold me still
Bury my heart on the coals
And hold me still
Bury my heart next to yours

[Chorus]
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold on with all of my might
Just promise me we'll be all right

[Outro]
The ghosts that we knew made us black and all blue
But we'll live a long life
And the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life
Ha! Ha! Huh! Huh! What's this?
Yo, huh, huh, huh

[Verse Two]
Yo, rise up brother, raise up sister
Visualize wealth, put yourself in the picture
Very few cats gon' tell you the half, ya not see it
Cause they're really only after the cash, ya not see it
But they wind up sellin they own ass
One album, two album, they gone they don't last
So hold on a minute now, don't be so fast
Knowledge Reigns Supreme with me ya won't crash
Ha, I'm the cat that spits the raw, ya not see it
They can't believe when I hit the tour, ya not see it
I'm not ready to retire for sure, ya not see it
I'm from the 70's, I'm down by law, ya not see it
We passed fliers door to door, ya not see it
Popularity's growin more and more, ya not see it
Conscious rap where the heart is at, ya not see it
We be screamin WHERE THE PARTY AT, ya not see it
But instead of the Bacardi sack, ya not see it
Fallin out in the party in the back, ya not see it
Let me show you where the art is at, ya not see it
Put down your money I'm takin all of that, ya not see it
All the clubs they be callin me back, ya not see it
I'm never short cause I'm taller than that, ya not see it
I'm only showin you the other way out
Maybe I'm preachin but this is what love is about, ya not see it

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
KRS, I speak when I must
This that official underground rap, this you can trust
I stand outside the industry and there's many of us
Talkin mad shit but for those who not bilingual, plenty of stuff
My whole crew is why you can't get with any of us
Reason I'm not on TV cause I'm not sellin you nothin
I'm not rhymin for a Bentley or a house this plush
I spit for the conscious, what about us?
Time's up, time to open that mind up
Temple of Hip-Hop sign up, devils we bind up
When I'm up rhymin cuts your spirit hear it and shines up
Climb up before you wind up takin

[Chorus]
{*scratching*}

[Chorus - minus instrumental]
Drunk girls
Drunk girls
Drunk girls
Drunk girls

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls cause a couple of heart attacks
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are unusually mild
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys keep in pace with the pedophiles
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are boringly wild

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls get invitations from nations
(Drunk girls)
They got the patience of a million saints
(Drunk boys)
They steal, they steal from the cupboards
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls like to file complaints
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are like a night of simplicity
(Drunk girls)
They need a lover who is smarter than me
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys, we walk like pedestrians
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls wait an hour to pee

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls know that love is an astronaut
(Drunk girls)
It comes back, but it's never the same
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls can be just as insane

Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
So oh oh
That means making eyes across the room

(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause I'm shallow doesn't mean that I'm heartless
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause I'm heartless doesn't mean that I'm mean
(Drunk boys)
Sometimes love gives us too many options
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause you're hungry doesn't mean that you're lean
(Drunk girls)
I've heard lies that could curdle your heartstrings
(Drunk girls)
A couple truths, maybe burn out your eyes
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys leave their irons in the fireplace
(Drunk girls)
'Cause drunk girls give them too many tries

Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls...

Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
Oh oh oh
I believe I'm waking up, but no promises
Oh oh oh
I believe in waiting out the weather
Oh oh oh
I believe in making up

(The day becomes the night)
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
(The day becomes the night)
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
(The day becomes the night)
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
(The day becomes the night)
Be honest with me, honestly, honesty
Unless it hurts my feelings!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Oh
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away
What I've done
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've done
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)
What I've done
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na)
(Na na na na)
I dreamed I was missing
You were so scared
But no one would listen
'Cause no one else cared
After my dreaming
I woke with this fear
What am I leaving
When I'm done here?
So if you're asking me
I want you to know
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest, leave out all the rest
Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating
I've shared what I made
I'm strong on the surface
Not all the way through
I've never been perfect
But neither have you
So if you're asking me
I want you to know
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest, leave out all the rest
Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else can come
And save me from myself
I can't be who you are
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest, leave out all the rest
Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else can come
And save me from myself
I can't be who you are
I can't be who you are
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
(you know what you did
(She says he is my son
Breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
(Don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Oh, seven years of hard luck comin' down on me
From the Florida border, yes, up in Nashville, Tennessee
I worked in every joint you can name, yes-a, every honky tonk
Along come Mister Yankee slicker sayin "baby, you're what I want"

Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Want to give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA

Oh, nine thousand dollar just sowed the wind
But we smiled at the Yankee slicker with a big old southern grin
They gonna take me out to California, gonna make me a super star
Just pay me all my money, mister, maybe you won't get a scar

Want you to sign the contract
Want you to sign today
Wanna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA

Oh, Slickers steal my money since I was seventeen
If it ain't no pencil pusher then it got to be a honky tonk queen
But I signed my contract, baby, and I want you people to know
That every penny that I make, I want to see where my money goes
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA
I can't believe that it's real
The way that you make me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide

Our love is you and me, baby
That make the world go round
And if keeping you and loving you means
Layin' all my troubles down

Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Take me by the hand
Show me
Here I am, baby

It always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
A love that I cannot have
You broke my heart into half
Our love is you and me, baby
That make the world go round
Keeping you and loving you means
Laying all my troubles down

Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Take me by the hand
Show me
Here I am, baby

When I'm down I can always call you
For a helpin' hand
I know you'll do the best you can
But it don't take much for me
Before my cup runs over
All this love inside of me
I believe there's going to be an explosion

You can talk to me (oh, baby)
I'm in no hurry
Tell me all your troubles
And you won't ever have to worry (no)
(And one more thing)
You just can't trust everybody
Everybody you see (no no)
You'll find yourself lost and alone
On a darkened street
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, would you come and take me?
Take me by the hand
Show me
Take me
Show me, won't you?
Here I am, baby
Take me, won't you?
Teach me
Won't you take me by the hand?
Teach me
Here I am, baby
Big willie
Get on the floor

[Chorusx2]
OH! I'm the Party Starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
& we could dance all night to the early mornin'
OH I'm the Party Starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
& we could dance all night to the early mornin'
Dance, an aphrodisiac
Women gyrating, simulating sensual acts
To stimulating muical tracks
I thought was just gon' com out tonight & get a brew & relax
But no! Uh uh, when you're the party starter
It's like you're on call, yo're what the doctor ordered
It's like you gotta block the borer tothe door
& shock em when it's boring....
GET ON THE FLOOR!!
UH, it's the groovicide bomber, mic in my vest
Tight, strapped to my chest
Like, I'ma run up in the party hollerin'
& be like "Ohhh!", fulfillin' my callin'
Big! (Big), Will!(Will), that's my name, whoop!
Writin' rhymes, that's my game, whoop!
Ask me again and I'll tell yo the same, whoop!
Just write ya number right next to ya name, girl

[Chorusx2]
He was raised in the days when the roof was raised
Every rap occasion, new & amazing
The back of the stage amazed and gazin'
Prayin for the day they would one day praise him
Studied the was of the game & made it
Came trough the maze & the haze & played it perfect
Days any person the road blazin'
Days whn he was low, nothin' could raise him
He came to the show & somehin' uncaged in him
Like the pope, but its party crusade, I'm like braids that's never gon'
Fade ya heard
I'm like, 23's on an Escalade, throw me into the rave
Like you threw a grenade - BOOM!!

[Chorusx2]
I call for the days of the unadulterated
When the artistry was cultivated
You know, back when rap was smart and multilayered
We could rap without&Rs& ulatums damn
Now today I say the phrase I long for the good old days when the party was all about
Partyin'
I was a mini-party starter then
My mind bends when I all my pen
The big queion should I run the mind a vittle
Food for thought or dumb the rhyme a little
But Will "if you come to high that'll alienate folks & they won't buy
It"(yo),trapped in the track
& they be clappin', even when the rappin' is wack
Yo, what happened, when did we get happy wit that?
He's old-fashioned (yup), but let's be happy he's back
Ya heard me!

[Chorusx2]

[Usher:]
Peace up!
A town down!

[Lil John:]
Yeah, yeah, okay! Usher
Lil John!

[Usher:]
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

[Lil John:]
Let's go

[Usher:]
I'm in the club with my homies
Tryin' to get a little V-I
Keep it down on the low key
'Cause you know how it feels
I said shawty she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' my ear
You would think that she knew me
So we decided to chill

Conversation got heavy
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow

[Lil John:]
Watch out!
Watch out!

[Usher:]
She was sayin' "Come get me"
So I got up and followed her to the flooor
She said "Baby let's go"
When I told her I said

Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

She's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might be a good idea
To take her with me, (with me)
'Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leave now)
Now I gotta keep it real now
'Cause on a 1-to-10
She's a certified 20
But that just ain't me, hey

'Cause I don't know if I take that chance
Just where is it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Makes shorty all right with me

The way she getting low!
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She asked for one more dance and I'm like yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave?
And I said

Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah

[Ludacris:]
Watch out! My outfit's ridiculous
In the club lookin' so conspicuous
And Rowl! These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow
Forget about the game, I'm a spit the truth
I won't stop till I get 'em in they birthday suits
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes

I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put 'em on foot patrol
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand

Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris feel cups like double D's
Me and Ursh once more and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say

[Usher:]
Yeah yeah, shawty got down and said come and get me
Yeah yeah, I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah yeah, her and my girl used be the best of homies
Yeah yeah, next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeaah

[Ludacris:]
Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat to make ya booty go
Take that and rewind it back
Usher got the voice to make ya booty go
Take that and rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow to make ya booty go
Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat to make ya booty go
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile
My life's a masquerade
A world of let's pretend, yeah
Since you took your love
Pretending never ends, dear
But I can't let you know
That I still need you so, no
Darling I hide the tears that I cry
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile
I can't let you see
All the tears I'm crying
You would pity me
That would be like dying
If I can't have your love
I don't need your sympathy
Darling I hide the tears that I cry
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile
My life is a masquerade
Since you took your love away
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
I just can't let you see
How much you hurting me
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile

[Verse 1]
Poor me, floatin' out to sea
An opportunity that went bad

Poor you, now what you gonna do?
Now what you gonna do? You just cry

[Verse 2]
Poor me, so blind I couldn't see
The forest for the trees, I don't know why

Poor you, you split yourself in two
Now what you gonna do? You just cry

[Chorus]
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand

[Verse 3]
Poor me, floatin' out to sea
An opportunity that went bad
Poor you, now what you gonna do?
What you gonna do? You just cry

[Chorus]
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand

[Bridge]
I don't understand
I don't understand
Woooh...

So now, I'm going to feel it now
I'm going to feel it now
Oh
Oh, yeah

Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band

Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar

Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

Oh, yeah
Ooh

Ziggy played guitar

[Flo Rida:]
So many girls in here, where do I begin?

Talking loud, talking crazy
Love me outside
Pray for the rain to come
Don't dry again
Guess it's true what they say
I'm always late
Say you need a little space
I'm in your way

It hurts, but I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part

I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up, then I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love

What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love

I'm a fool for your games
But I always play
Can't admit it was a waste
It's too much escape

It hurts, but I remember every scar
And I've learned
But living is the hardest part

I can't believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Passionately burning to flames
Stitch myself up, then I do it again
I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love

What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
I can't believe what I did for love
The best things in live are free
You can give it to the bears and bees
I want some money
That's what I want
I want some money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want!

You love gives me the thrills
But your love pays me no bills
I want some money
That's what I want
I want some money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want!
You got my pride
Hanging outta my bed
You're messin' with my life
So I bought my lead
You even messin' with my children
And you're screamin' at my wife, baby
Get offa my back
If you wanna get outta here alive

(Freedom) Freedom, (Give it to me) that's what I want now
(Freedom) Freedom, (Give it to me) that's what I need now
(Freedom) Freedom, (Give it to me) to live

You got my heart

You got my soul
Screamin' and howlin'
You know you hook my girlfriend
You know the drugstore man
But I don't need it now
I was trying to slap it out of her hand
(Freedom) Freedom, (Give it to me) so I can live
(Freedom) Freedom, (Give it to me) so I can give
(Freedom) Freedom, (Give it to me) yeah
(Freedom) Freedom, (Give it to me) that's what I need

You don't have to say that you love me
If you don't mean it
You'd better believe
If you need me
Or you just wanna bleed me
You'd better stickin' your dagger in someone else
So I can leave
Set me free

Yeah

Right on, straight ahead
Stay up and straight ahead

Freedom, so I can have it
Freedom

Keep on pushin', straight ahead
Keep on pushin', straight ahead
Keep on pushin', straight ahead
Keep on pushin', straight ahead
A grain of love, smiling on me
And time is there beside me
The carnival and the fair, oh, is here
Oh, having fun on the rides
Love is the dimension between time and feeling
Oh, the distance from heaven to earth is close
Well, that's my understanding, haha
Lord, and I pray on, I pray on
I pray on
There's one thing I keep on looking for
My, my, my, my someone to make the grains of sand
Ah-ha, cease the thought of times
Something is on my mind
I'm standing, I'm standing in a field of some diamonds
Ah-ha, oh, my soul, my heart and my mind
I pray on
Let me say, little one, take my hand
Let us ask the Creator Man
To give us wisdom to understand, hey hey
What it feels to the be the man
And say
I want to do everything for you
That ordinary men won't do
I want to climb the highest mountain
I think it's big enough for two
Oh, come on
If you won't go with me
Listen to my melody
I can change your mind
In the right course of time, baby

You should count all your blessings and
Let known your feelings for all your friends
Lord have mercy
They may be surprised when you say
Oh, that love and the miraculous day
Oh my my

If you won't go with me
Listen to my melody
I can change your mind, your mind
In the right course of time

I wanna make a donation this evening to
All the good things in our hearts and our minds
That we know that we oughta do
Oh my my, I've got to try for higher ground
The Man said souls is coming down (Coming down)
Hey, oh, if you won't go with me
Listen to my melody
I can change your mind
In the right course of time

Hey hey, everything I resign
Still I can reach your, I can reach your mind
I can reach your mind, hey, ooh
Hey, ooh, if you don't go with me
Listen, listen to my melody, ow, ow, ow
I can change your mind
Hey, I can change your mind
I close both locks below the window
I close both blinds and turn away
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, o-o-oh

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you

In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way, o-o-oh

And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you

And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you

[Verse 1]
It's like a movement from the small place
To a bigger city
Or it's a bigger bag to strap the ego of a tiny baby
It's like a discipline without the discipline of
All of the discipline
It's like a movement
Without the bother of all of the meaning

[Hook 1]
You're history and I'm tapped
You're history and I'm tapped

[?]
And I'm tapped

[?]
I'm tapped

[Verse 2]
It's like a rock show
Without the rocking or all of the show up
Or it's a cumshot
Without the coming or the 

[?] to throw up
It's like a fat guy in a Tuxedo
Doing all the saying
Or it's a couple dads and a few friends
Trying hard to stay in

[Hook 2]
You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
You're pillaging
And I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

[Verse 3]
Here comes the report nothing to report see
It's all the same
It seems the punk rock as an experiment well
It pulled up lame
You got the fat guy in the T-Shirt
Doing all the singing
Straight to the drunk tank doing the research 'n
Doing all the blame
I dreamed I was missing
You were so scared
But no one would listen
'Cause no one else cared
After my dreaming
I woke with this fear
What am I leaving
When I'm done here?
So if you're asking me I want you to know

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating
I've shed what I made
I'm strong on the surface
Not all the way through
I've never been perfect
But neither have you
So if you're asking me I want you to know
When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Forgetting
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending
Someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest
Forgetting
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending
Someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are
I can't be who you are

I’m all about the money motherfuckin’ fame
I came out with a hustler, made myself a star
I was 20 years old with three foreign cars

Wasn’t in the rap game, in the streets grindin’

Once, once I loved
And I gave so much love to this world you were the world to me
Once I cried
At the thought I was foolish and proud and let you say goodbye

And then one day
From my infinite sadness you came and brought me love again
Now I know
That no matter what ever befalls I'll never let you go
I will hold you close
Make you stay
Because love is the saddest thing when it goes away
Love is the saddest thing when it goes away
Fat man looking into shining steel
Thin man looking at his last meal
Hollow man looking in a cottonfield
For dignity

Wise man looking in a blade of grass
Young man looking in the shadows that pass
Poor man looking through painted glass
For dignity

Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve
Somebody said dignity was the last to leave
Went into the cities, went into the towns
To the land of the midnight sun

Searching high, searching low
Searching everywhere I know
Asking the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?

Blind man breaking out of a trance
Puts both his hands into the pockets of chance
Hoping to find one circumstance
Of dignity
Stranger stares down into the light
From a platinum window in the Mexican night
Searching every bloodsucking thing in sight
For dignity

I went down where the vultures feed
Would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
It all sounded no different to me

Soul of a nation is under the knife
Death is standing in the doorway of life
In the next room a man fighting with his wife
Over dignity
Girl I must have been crazy to say that it was over
I had to be a fool to yell out we were through
And now I'm all alone and feeling down and out baby
When I never meant for this to end, it was so so crazy of me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby, bring your lovin' back to me

I can't sleep babe, I can't think babe, I can't live babe
Without you in my life I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around

Though I must admit that things got out of hand
When you told me that he was just a friend
I should of had my trust in you from the very start darlin'
'Cause I never meant for this to end
How can we get it back again?
Oh sometimes a man can say things that he really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby - bring your lovin' back to me
I can't sleep babe, I can't think babe, I can't live babe
Without you in my life I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around

Baby can we meet somewhere and talk about it
Oh baby, can we work it out
I'm not gonna let you go my baby before I let you know that I

I can't sleep babe, I can't think babe, I can't live babe
Without you in my life I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothin' if I go away baby
And I can't do nothin' if you're not around
...to fade
Turn my mic up louder, I got to say somethin'
Lightweights step it aside when we comin'
Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumpin'
People on the street they panic and start runnin'

Words on loose leaf sheet, complete comin'
I jump on my mind, I summon the rhyme I'm dumpin'
Healin' the blind, I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drummin'

Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumpin'
Fuck that, I wanna see some fists pumpin'
Risk somethin', take back what's yours
Say somethin' that you know they might attack you for

'Cause I'm sick of being treated like I had before
Like it's stupid standin' for what I'm standin' for
Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor

Like they understand you, in the back of their jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
And these fuckers are laughin' their way to the bank, and cashin' their cheque
Askin' you to have compassion and have some respect
For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watchin' at the end of the day
In the living room laughin' like, "What did he say?"

(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)

In my livin' room watchin', but I am not laughin'
'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen
The world is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react to get blown into fractions

Ten years old, it's somethin' to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought 'the next one could be me'

Do you see the soldiers they're out today
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show

My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back he hand-wrote a quote inside
"When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die"

Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watching at the end of the day
Both scared and angry, like "What did he say?"

(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you
(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you

(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) The ocean opens up to swallow you
Hey baby where are you coming from?
Well she looked at me and smiled
And looked into space and said "I'm coming from the land of the new rising sun."

Then I said "Hey baby where are you trying to go to?"
Then she said "I'm going to
Spin and spread around peace of mind and a whole lotta love to you and you

Hey girl I'd like to come along
Yes, I'd love to come along
Would you like to come along? She asked me
Yes take me along right now

Hey baby, can I step into your world for a while?
Yes you can, she said
Come on back with me for a while
We're gonna go across the Jupiter sand and see all you people one by one
We gotta help you people out right now
That's why I'm doing it all about

Hey! Yeah, may I come along?
May I come along?
May I come along? Yeah, yeah!
Please take me
Water gray
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean everywhere
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water, I do
Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
But now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water, I do
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underground, now I, now I do
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted)
(Was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away
Holdin' up holdin' holdin' holdin' up

My main bitch, her anklet
'Bout the same size of a ankle monitor
If a diva late one time I'ma put her ass on probation
I'ma give her two scratches
She's a fuckin' good woman, I'ma give her a life
I'ma walk by shinin' with a bitch
Aye, say I had enough in my life
I got 80 chains, I got 100 rings
And a nigga can't take my ice
Caught a murder charge, but I beat the shit
'Cause a nigga tried to take my life
I'm a millionaire, but I'm a country boy
And my right hand man got a Tonka toy
I sell, charge, I'm servin' boy
Major saver, I'm the golden boy
And I serve the pass like Lawyer Milloy
Poppin' and poppin' and poppin' the shit
Talkin' that shit, now you shot in the head
Brick Squad niggas don't shoot in the leg
Shouts to our fallen, I ball till I fall, and
The neighbors don't talk 'cause the neighbors are scared
A white girl, a black girl, a hell of a mix
Rollin' up kush while they suckin' my dick
On my chain is a tag team
All my niggas gettin' money
You can get tied, then tagged then me and your freak'll start fuckin'
Got two choppers, it's a tag team
Four bad bitches and it's all to me
Had to break into like ten houses to ride on these 9x17s
Oops, my fault, that's your team's line
I ain't have time, I was grindin' real hard
People goin' crazy, and my mama goin' crazy but believe it or not, bitch, I gotta thank the Lord
Ballin' so hard when I came out of jail
Now I'ma get a scene and weigh the doja up
Sippin' on lean 'til I throw up
What you want to be when you grow up?
Guwop guwop guwop, nigga
All these hoes screamin' guwop, nigga
Guwop guwop guwop, nigga
All these hoes screamin' guwop, nigga
Guwop guwop guwop, nigga
Guwop guwop guwop, nigga
Guwop guwop guwop, nigga
All these hoes screamin' guwop, nigga

Y'all scooted in my team
Flockaveli that's my shooter
R.I.P to my nigga Dunk
Think about your ass every day
Momma called, said she need some money
Sent her ten bands and it made her smile
Child nude, no shoes
Got to get him those new Trews
Mail your head to your mama
Hide your body in a restaurant
Nigga wasn't shit anyway
Playin' around with my awards
Gucci Mane is a cool dude
But a nigga might turn into a werewolf
Got a stash box and it's all hundreds
And your CEO ain't worth nothin'
Made a half a mil' in three weeks
Gucci Mane, I'm a blessed man
I'm a real man, you can't feel me, man
These fucked niggas keep tryin' to hold me back
Matter of fact, nigga slow down
When you drivin' in the 'Lac, you gon' spill my 'Gnac
Like Pinky, nigga, I'm big and black
Rock so many chains it gon hurt my neck
Guwop guwop guwop, nigga
All these hoes screamin' guwop, nigga
Guwop guwop guwop, nigga
All these hoes screamin' guwop, nigga
Guwop guwop guwop, nigga
Guwop guwop guwop, nigga
Guwop guwop guwop, nigga
All these hoes screamin' guwop, nigga

And a side bitch in the Blue Flame
Her pussy bomb as Saddam Hussein, pussy nigga
Gucci needed me for a verse
Call me up, nigga tap me in
This verse here, a tragedy
Bad bitches they after me
Only buy molly from rich hoes
'Cause these broke hoes be taxin' me

Bomb squad like "Hoorah!"
Real niggas call Gucci
But these hoes call "guwop"
Guwop guwop guwop, nigga

Trinidad and Gucci Mane
I'm dreaming tonight
Of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know
It's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents by the tree

Christmas eve will find you
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have some snow
And mistletoe
And presents by the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams
I've got a notion to live in an ocean of bad bad dreams
No consolation to mixed conversation in bad bad dreams
You know we're all alike
We can shout and scream and yell all night
It's just a bad bad dream

Feel like I'm crying
There's no use denying it's all been done
For your information we still own the nation
The war's been won
You know you're far too late
Your only hangup is you hesitate
It's just a bad bad dream

Bad bad bad dream (x4)

I'm getting it to you so you get it through you and make your choice
People start playing and back what you're saying
It's just one voice
You know you're all insane
It doesn't matter how you play the game
It's just a bad bad dream
Bad bad bad dreams (x5)

[Intro]
We're talking about true love this evening

[Verse 1]
You see, it was good enough for my mother
And I wanna thank you this evening
It was good enough for my sisters and brothers
You don't understand me

[Pre-Chorus]
I got to saying it's good - ah, you might not believe me
But I, I know true love is good, baby
Hey hey, it's good enough for me
Huh, ah, it's good enough for me
It's good enough for me, sweet baby

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' wrong with true love, sweet baby
Ain't nothin' wrong with true love, sweet baby

[Verse 2]
Now now now now, took a lot of time, yes he did
To know what I know, Lord, yeah
And many times, ah baby, I walked out the door
Oh, you don't know nothin' about that now

[Pre-Chorus]
But if that's what it takes to make a true love live
Then that's just how much, baby, I've got to give this evening

[Chorus]
Hey, ain't nothin' wrong with true love, sweet baby
Ain't nothin' wrong with true, baby
Sweet baby, ain't nothin' wrong with true love
Nothin' wrong with true love

[Outro]
Just as sure as the stars above
Ain't nothin' wrong with true love
You might walk the floor at night sometime
But ain't nothin' wrong with true love
I got to sayin' that it was good love for my sisters and brothers
I got to say it right now that it's good enough for my mother
Ain't nothin' wrong with true love
Nothin' wrong with true
Hey, nothin' wrong with true love
Nothin', ow, nothin'
Woo, baby, baby, baby, that true love
Ain't nothin' wrong with true love
Nothin' wrong with true love
Wonderful, I got to call your name, sweet baby
And I'd give a lotta distance just to call your name, sweet baby

[Verse 1]
Uh, ignorant-ass white kid
But I'm still bicycling and recycling
And I'm still eating gummy bear vitamins
All my bitches taking Vicodin, huffing nitrogen
Hyper than Williams' middle son
Since I was a little one, moms had to put me on the Ritalin
Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt
Told Chuck I had a couple raps, so we kicked the drums
All the best rappers are usually dead
But I'm the poison that left a widow Juliet
In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads
Coming up with all the coldest shit, take your Sudafed
Contagious, speaking while sedated
God shit, make 'em want to add a couple pages to the Bible
I ain't got nothing left in my will
'Cept, "Throw it all in the casket, it's mine still"
Uh, I need some backpack cast raps
Took a break just to kill the game half-assed
Set some rat traps, went and took a cat nap
Woke up, threw the dead bodies in the trash bags
Act polite, but I'm nasty on the mic
Your bitch don't want my dick, then she has to be a dyke
Slap her but she like it, tell me, "Master, feed me pipe"
I'm a scotch on the rocks, you the Appletini type, it go:

[Chorus]
Suck my dick before I slap you with it
I'm sorry, I said
S—suck my dick before I slap you with it
Wait, hold up, hold up, it goes, said

[Verse 2]
Uh, still fucking with these hoes, though
Bozo on these doppelgänger Jojos
Take a bitch to Soho for some Froyo
Tell her she gon' blow it, that's Romo
And now I'm out in Cali like Tone-Lōc
Young boy, but I'm chilling with some grown folk
Most Dope, Most Dope, you just blowin' smoke
How much coke you gotta sell to make a boat float?
Hit 'em, hit 'em 'til they tell me, "No more"
I'm a highly difficult ropes course
Pulling up to Rome on a chrome gold horse
Say "Wassup?" to the Pope, pull off in a Porsche

[?] who you kidding? Your flow's warshed
I ain't from the street but I'll grill you from the porch
I been had hoes, I played sports
Her ass out the bottom of her shorts, say

[Chorus]
Suck my dick before I slap you with it
I'm sorry, I said
S—suck my dick before I slap you with it
Woo
Suck my dick before I slap you with it
Suck my dick before I slap you with it

[Outro]
Yeah

[Intro]
They're coming through the window
They're coming through the door
They're busting down the big wall
And sounding the horn
They're coming through the window
They're coming through the door
They're busting down the big wall
And sounding the horn

Get crackin', get-get crackin'

[Verse 1]
Time to spit new shit
I'm rocking on this new bit
I'm hot now you'll see
I'll fight you just to get peace
Heavy weight wrestler
Fight me in your comforter
Let you be superior
I'm filth with the fury ya

[Verse 2]
I'll hard drive your bit
I'm battered by your sumo grip
Lucky I like feeling shit
My Stamina can take it
Gymnastics Super Fit
Muscle in the gun clip
Bite, Teeth Nose Bleed
Tied up in a scarf piece

Can I get control
Do you like me vulnerable
I'm armed and I'm equal
More fun for the people
Physical, brute force
Steel, iron you're the boss
Yeah, you're so do-able
Grind me down sugar salt

[Hook]
What you want, Bucky Done Gun
What you want, that fire done burn
What you want, Bucky Done Gun
Get crackin', get-get crackin'

I will die for you
I have cried for you, believe me girl
Don't you think it's time you made up your own mind?
All my love's for you
All I do's for you
Still I think it's time you made up your own mind

My melody, my symphony
You know it's for you, love
It's plain to see, it's meant to be
Now it's up to you, love

Still I'll wait for you
Waiting just for you, don't leave me girl
Don't you think it's time you made up your own mind?
Love is here for you
Love was made for you, believe me girl
Don't you think it's time you gave up?
You are mine

Doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know it's for you
X3
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

I've got so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
Ooh

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Yeah
I don't need no money, fortune or fame
I got all the riches baby, one man can claim
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl
I've even got the month of may
With my girl

Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl
That's all I can talk about
Is my girl
Looking up there's only sky
Rest your head I'll take you high
And we won't fade into darkness
Won't let you fade into darkness

Why worry now, you'll be safe
Hold my hand, just in case

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

This world can seem cool and grey
But you and I are here today
And we won't fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness

Nothing to fear but fear itself
We'll be okay just keep the faith
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
We took it all apart, but I’m wishing I’d stayed
In the backroom something I heard you say
We didn’t wanna call it too early, now it seems a world away
But I miss that day, are we ever gonna feel the same?

Standing in the light 'till it’s over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We’ll be coming back for you one day
We’ll be coming back for you one day

I don’t even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We’ll be coming back
We’ll be coming back for you one day

You can see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
We didn't wanna call it too early, now it seems a world away
But I miss that day, are we ever gonna feel the same?

Standing in the light 'till it’s over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We’ll be coming back for you one day
We’ll be coming back for you one day
I don’t even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We’ll be coming back for you one day
We’ll be coming back for you one day

Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts

Standing in the light 'till it’s over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We’ll be coming back for you one day
We’ll be coming back for you one day

I don’t even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind, we’ll be coming back
We’ll be coming back for you one day
We’ll be coming back for you one day
Yeah here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is you can stop and stare
Run myself out and no one cares
Dug a trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out, go, stop the show
Choppy words in a sloppy flow
Shotgun, I pull, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama help me I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new Hearse
Can't contain him he knows he works
Fuck this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out
I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
Knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
I picked up my matches
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Verse 4]
There ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias
Or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]
Uhh.. UH! .. WHOO!

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

If I gotsta bring it to you cowards then it's gonna be quick, aight
All your mens up in the jail before, suck my dick
And all them other cats you run with, get done with, dumb quick
How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit? Aight
There go the gun click, 9-1-1 shit
All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club, cause everytime
You come around, it's like (what) I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to
But I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe
They just sayin' that, now cause they miss you
Shit a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you layin' on your back, lookin' at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin' the truth and it hurts
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

Off the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain
'cause niggas still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fuckin' with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on that got you think that you Superman
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, "So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go"
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whinin' over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it on on the strength of the hands with them, man
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

I bring down rains so heavy it curse the head
No more talkin - put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin - lest you tryin to end up red
Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin
You know who gon' find you? (Who?) Some old man fishin
Grandma wishin your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

Hold up! ERRRRRRRR!

And in the middle of the night
I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine
Stretch out my life
And pick the seams out
Take what you like
But close my ears and eyes
Watch me stumble over and over
I have done wrong
You built your tower
But call me home
And I will build a throne
And wash my eyes out never again
But love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light
Skin too tight
And eyes like marbles
You spin me high
So watch me as I glide
Before I tumble homeward, homeward
I know I've tried
I was not stable
And flawed by pride
I miss my sanguine eyes
So hold my hands up -- breathe in, and breathe out
So love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light
And in the middle of the night
I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
You may not trust the promises
Of the change I'll show
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine
So love the one you hold
And I will be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light
So love the one you hold
And I will be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light
I'm on the road to Alaska
Nowhere near Nebraska
But I'm sure if I asked her she'll know

I ain't got no Honey
I'm so short of money
I really really wanna go home

I dialed Oklahoma
Made attempts to phone her
Gave up when I got no reply

I'm on the road to Alaska
Nowhere near Nebraska
But I'm sure if I don't ask her I'll die

I found Cincinnati, out there I was happy
Every single day of my life
I had me a woman, she started to running
I really couldn't make her my wife
She started to show which was she was going
Every single road she could go
I'm on the road to Alaska
Nowhere near Nebraska
But I'm sure if I asked her she'll know

I made Cincinnati
Out there I was happy
Every single day of my life
I had me a woman, she started to runnin'
I really couldn't make her my wife
She started to show which was she was going
Every single road she could go
I'm on the road to Alaska
Nowhere near Nebraska
But I'm sure if I asked her she'll know
I'm sure if I ask her she'll know
I'm sure if I ask her she'll know
Hey homeboy how come everywhere you go you have to go by limousine man

Every time I see you you are awful clean you got your rings generally
Y'know

Flash the cash is what i need

I can understand it

Oohh

The love i make superb, to doubt me is absurd, the ladies say i'm the greatest you see
Oohh oo oohh
I want to have your spot, and more than what you got, i bought the baddest house i could find
All it must be said i'm greatest in the bed and when i love a lady she's mine
I know i'm really hot, my diamonds shine a lot, check out here this 450 SE babe
I'm what's its all about
Ego Tripping Out (tripping out, tripping out, your tripping out, your tripping out)

Ahh ha hey hey

Without a doubt, I know we Ego Tripping Out, sometimes it's a shame
But it caused so much pain, don't want you baby
I know you Ego Tripping Out, 'times it's a shame but it can't do without
Without a doubt, I know your Ego Tripping Out, hey she don't know it
Ain't it a shame all the pain to come

I'm better than the rest, check out the way I dress and got a lot of money to spend
The best club in town, is where I get down, your lucky if I choose you my friend
Walk the greatest walk, I got to be the talk, I've got the greatest show in town
Woohoo rock with other men then roll over to me so I can fill your soul baby

Needless to say I'm your greatest play
Ego Tripping Out, oohh, Ego Tripping Out

Got a sweet tooth for the chick on the floor
Walking in my shoes
Walking to the beat
Still got some love inside
Some good old body heat
Aoow
Ohoh baby
Spread the news
Only here to deepen my soul
No it ain't about money
Aoow
Turn the fear into energy
'cause the toot and the smoke
Won't fulfil the need
Aoow hey hey

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Come on, oh, come on
Come on, oh, come on
Come on, oh, come on
Yeah
Oh shit

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I said
I'm posing a question: how many been empty and holdin' aggression?
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother, my mind is my weapon, I'm lettin' it go
Loaded and pointed at negative energy tellin' me stop, they tellin' me, "No"
Your aura is something you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock, praise me, I'd rather you not, 'cause
It's drivin' me crazy, the fact that you pay amaze me, that's somethin' I love
You come to the club searchin' for drugs, drunk, fuckin' these sluts
God loves me, what if he does? What does it mean?
You wastin' away doin' nothin', you frontin', why aren't you chasin' ya dreams, uh?
We wonder 'bout life but none of us willing to learn
The money we earn something to burn, why won't they give me a turn? L
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When them high rollers homes in Vegas raided with some home invasion
Contaminatin' the place with plague, we just saved the day

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
I waste away in a room spittin' out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back, 

[?]

[Chorus: 

[?]]
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Forfeitin' the war, he lays his sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store, begins to contemplate
Dealin' with death like he work in the morgue, absorbing souls forgotten
He lost his way, starin' down that barrel, thinkin', "Not today"
Life's so precious, said, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death 'til there's nobody left and you holdin' your breath 'cause you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinkin' of getting ballistic
Be specific, to those in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, intertwined
My trigger finger itchin', all I kill is time, bang
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shootin' lasers
'Cept I'm cool with Vader and blowin' up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor the youth can relate to, it's nature
If you a hater I'll deal with you later, no, thank ya
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really doe, come on, homie, we major

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
I waste away in this room spittin' out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back

[Chorus: 

[?]]
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
Of our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive

[Chant: Mac Miller & DJ ClockWork]
One, two, three, so throw your motherfucking
Hands up, your hands up, throw your motherfucking
Hands up (Hands up,) said get 'em up (Get 'em up)
So throw them hands up, said get 'em up (Get 'em up)
Get 'em up (Get 'em up,) get 'em up (Get 'em up)
So throw them hands up, said get 'em up (Get 'em up)
So throw them hands up, said get 'em up (Get 'em up)
Go (Go,) go (Go,) go (Go,) go (Go,) go (Go,)
Go (Go,) go (Go,) go
Time, he's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me, boy

Time, he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy

Time, in Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time

The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, and many other last names
Well, I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think
Oh God I'm still alive

We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time

Chimes, goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time

Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed, your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming

We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors

And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there

And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let it show
Your true colors, true colors
True colors are shining through

I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
(2x)

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?

We float before the sea and eyes
Getting heavy mixing glitter thighs
I smile because I won't do
I smile because you won't do
We sip the wind through lips alive
And added cones won't whistle lone
I smile because I won't do
I smile because you won't do
Put flowers in your hand
Wrap pretend around my chest
I smile because I won't do
I am your bore
Sink my little soul for you
And talking
I said I've been through a lot of noise
The manner that he drinks in twos, enjoys
We're utterly agreed in which to war
Down by the shore a funny foe
Who bit my wings and ate them whole
He left before I come through
You left before I come through
We took the heals into trees
I hid my hand and bit the leaves
You left before I come through
You left before I
Sink my little soul for you
And talking
I said I've been through a lot of noise
The manner that he drinks in twos, enjoys
We're utterly agreed in which to war
Drinks are stale, fell through the beat
Wrapped in life and ultra-green
Ooze teamed with tiny feet
And world of tied up memories
You left before I got to you
You left before I got to you
You left before I
You left before I
Took the flowers from your hand
Bowed to me and kissed my hand
Did before I, did before I
Sink my little soul for you
And talking
I said I've been through a lot of noise
The manner that he drinks in twos, enjoys
We're utterly agreed in which to war
Sink my little soul for you
And talking
I said I've been through a lot of noise
The manner that he drinks in twos, enjoys
We're utterly agreed in which to war
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do
I smile because I won't do
Whiskey bottles and brand new cars
Oak tree you're in my way
There's too much coke and too much smoke
Look what's going on inside you

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Angel of darkness is upon you
Stuck a needle in your arm (You fool, you)
So take another toke, have a blow for your nose
One more drink fool, would drown you (Hell, yeah)

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Now they call you Prince Charming
Can't speak a word when you're full of 'ludes
Say you'll be alright come tomorrow
But tomorrow might not be here for you (Yeah, you)
Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Aw, you fool, you
You stick them needles in your arm
I know I been there before

One little problem that confronts you
Got a monkey on your back
Just one more fix Lord, might do the trick
One hell of a price for you to get your kicks (Hell, yeah)

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Oh, you fool, you
Don't stick those needles in your arm
You're just a fool, just a fool, just a fool

[Verse 1]
OW!
As he came into the window
It was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you OK, Annie? Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you okay, are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sign in the window
That he struck you - a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by
You've been hit by a smooth criminal
OW!

[Interlude]
(Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!)

OW! WOO! WOO! WOO!

[Chorus]
Aaow!
(Annie are you okay?)
I don't know!
(Will you tell us that you're okay?)
I don't know!
(There's a sign in the window)
I don't know!
(That he struck you - a crescendo, Annie)
I don't know!
(He came into your apartment)
I don't know!
(Left the bloodstains on the carpet)
I don't know why baby!
(The you ran into the bedroom)
I don't know
(You were struck down)
(It was your doom - Annie!)
Daggonit!

[Outro]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by
You've been hit by a smooth criminal

[Timbaland sings repeat 6x]
Roll out! Roll out! Roll out! Roll out! Roll out! Roll out!

[Timbaland sings roll out! in Background]
I got my twin Glock .40s, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that
Twin Glock .40s, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that

[Ludacris Verse 1]
Now where'd you get that platinum chain with them diamonds in it?
Where'd you get that matchin' Benz with them windows tinted?
Who them girls you be with when you be ridin' through?
Man I ain't got nothin' to prove, I paid my dues
Breakin' the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin a cruise
Tell me who's your weed man, how do you smoke so good?
You's a superstar boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that bag, what you got in that bag?
A couple a cans a whoop ass, you did a good ass job of just
Eyein' me, spyin' me

[Timbaland sings roll out! in background]

[Ludacris Verse 2]
Man, that car don't come out until next year
Where in the fuck did you get it?
That's eighty-thousand bucks gone!
Where in the fuck did you spend it?
You must have eyes on your back, 'cause you got money to the ceiling
And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin
The better I'm feelin, the more that I'm chillin
Willin, drillin and killin the feelin
Now who's that bucked' naked cook fixin three-course meals?
Gettin goosebumps when her body tap the six inch heels
What in the world is in that room, what you got in that room?
A couple a gats, a couple a knives
A couple of rats, a couple of wives
Now it's time to choose

[Timbaland sings roll out! in background]

[Ludacris Verse 3]
Are you custom-made, custom-paid, or you just custom-fitted?
Playstation 2 up in the ride and is that Lorenzo-kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend, or just your MAIN bitch?
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin the hips
Touchin lips to the top of the dick, and then woo!
Now tell me who's your housekeeper and what you keep in your house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?
What in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate
Wait to take place at a similar pace
So shake, shake it

[Timbaland sings roll out! in background]

[Timbaland sings for outro]
Get out my business, my biznass
Stay the fuck up out my biznass, ah
'Cause these niggas all up in my shit and it's my business
My biznass
Stay the fuck up out my biznass, 'cause it's mine, oh mine
(Ludacris Talk)
Ah ah
Timberland
Ludacris
Disturbin da peace
Distant lover, lover
So many miles away
Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night
And sometimes I yearn
Through the day
Distant lover
You should think about me
And say a prayer for me
Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here
Here in misery, misery
As I reminisce, oh baby
Through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters
Then, all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now, I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road
Distant lover
Sugar, how can you treat my heart
So mean and cruel?
Sugar, sugar
That every moment when I spent with you
I treasure it like it was
A precious jewel, oh baby
Lord have mercy
Oh baby, don't go
Please, come back baby
Somethin' I wanna say
When you left you took all of me with you
My Lord I wonder
Do you wanna hear me scream, plead
And please, please, oh please baby
Come back and hold me, girl
Baby please, please
Down in the jungle, living in a tent
You don't use money, you don't pay rent
You don't ever know the time
But you don't mind
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
When your light is on the blink
You never think of worrying
What's the use of worrying?
When your bus has left the stop
You'd better drop your hurrying
What's the use of hurrying?
Leave me alone Mrs. Vandebilt
I've got plenty of time of my own
What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of hurrying?
What's the use of anything?
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of hurrying?
What's the use of anything?
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
When your pile is on the wane
You don't complain of robbery
Run away don't bother me
What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of anything?
Leave me alone Mrs. Washington
I've done plenty of time on my own
What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of hurrying?
What's the use of anything?
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
...
I'm not alone, I wish I was
'Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now, they do right now
I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pains
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate
Something's missing and I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing and I don't know what it is
No, I don't know what it is at all
When Autumn comes, it doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart
Something's missing and I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing and I don't know what it is
No, I don't know what it is at all
I can't be sure that this state of mind
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over the counter test
For loneliness, for loneliness like this
Something's missing and I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing and I don't know what it is
No, I don't know what it is
Something's different and I don't know what it is
No, I don't know what it is
Friends, check
Money, check
Well-slept, check
Opposite sex, check
Guitar, check
Microphone, check
Messages waiting on me
When I come home, check
How come everything I think I need
Always comes with batteries?
What do you think it means?
How come everything I think I need

[Chorus]
Girl, let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Hey, let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl

[Verse 1]
All of my life
I've wondered when love would be
I like to spend my time
In your company, you and me

[Chorus]
Let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Hey, let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl

[Verse 2]
Everybody needs someone to love
Darling, it's you I've been dreamin' of
And I wanna be the one you love
The story's been told for me
By the stars above, stars above

[Chorus]
Fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Fall in love, think it over, girl
Come closer, girl

[Bridge]
Whenever you're near
Good feelings come over me, over me, baby
Now that I found your love
Life is so complete, so complete

[Chorus]
Girl, let's fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Hey, let's fall in love, think it over
Get a little closer, girl

[Verse 2 repeated]
Everybody needs someone to love
Darling, it's you I've been dreamin' of
And I wanna be the one you love
The story's been told to me
By the stars above, stars above

[Chorus]
Fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Fall in love, think it over, girl
Come a little closer, girl
Fall in love

[Verse 1]
Let me see the sign
I want to know the treasure you hide
Each and every night, I wonder about you
Love, open the door

[Chorus]
Can’t you hear me cryin’?
I’m losing my mind
Can’t you hear me pleading?
Please hear me this time

[Verse 2]
Let yourself be mine
Let me see your little light shine
You know I want you to welcome me home
Love, open the door

[Chorus]
Can’t you hear me cryin’?
I’m losing my mind
Can’t you hear me pleading?
Please hear me this time

[Outro]
Each and every night, I wonder about you
Love, open the door
Love, open the door
Love, open the door
It's very far away
It takes about half a day
To get there, if we travel by my a.....dragonfly

No, it's not in Spain
But all the same
You know
It's a groovy name
And the wind's just right

Hang on, my darling
Hang on if you want to go
You know it's a really groovy place
And it's just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic

The clouds are really low
And they overflow
With cotton candy
And battle grounds
Red and brown
But it's all in your mind
Don't think your time
On bad things
Just float your little mind around
Look out

Hang on, my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic
Just a little bit of daydream here and there

Hang on, my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic
Just a little bit of daydream here and there

[Hook: Wyclef Jean]
How many mics do we rip on the daily?

[Lauryn Hill:]
You crossed the line; now there’s no coming back
MCs are getting sucked into my intergalactical pull
I’m the article don’ya on your arse
If you get the microphone, nigga, you better say pass that
Need no questions, and I'm telling you no lies
If you lookin' at me wrong, this goes under for your eyes
Realize you can't knock this, cuz my style's obnoxious
It's gaseous, I'm turning all ya'll wack patients to ashes
This thing's created, debated, from here to Asia
Mind of rhyme, must find your vocabulary kind of
Ordinary, my guitar shit is scary, maybe we're legendary
We roll blunts like Bob Marley, and
You didn't know but Sugar Hill, it was a band
My man, know your history before you try to sham, or
Shimmy coco pop, fronting niggas need to stop
Until the T.O.P.'s where you find the Refugees
Free like Jamaicans when they're feeling irie
So, Wyclef, won't you touch it?

[Wyclef Jean:]
For your rhymers
You ain't a rapper
Your vocab can't extend
Access, freestyle, need no practice
Ask the methodist, ask the methodist

[Pras:]
Too many MC's but they didn't get the picture
So you say you see me like Line the Reacher
Body executed right on the
I don't take it as an insult

[Lauryn Hill:]
See these dimensions and extensions will secure my future pension
When I mention corporate lynchin's like the cowboys did to Indians
The intentions of the devil is to cause me hypertension
So stay gold like Stevie Wonder, don't blunder like OJ Simpson

Wyclef Jean:
Don't blunder like OJ Simpson, thsi is a freestyle
Wyclefm so let me freak you for a while
I eat pork from a fork
Add an extra bar
Oh lord, what you yellin', nigga?
Penthouse nights, fresh out the cellar, nigga
All that white, like what you sellin', nigga?
My chain look like a Coogi with all these colors, nigga
I've been on money since 19, 20
Or maybe 21, I had 'bout 300
And I ain't talkin' 'bout Chief Keef or Lil Reese
But all my niggas keep heat, a lil' piece
I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass it's Saturday
Sticky, icky, icky, icky 

[Ooh, ooh!]
Sticky, icky, icky, icky 

[Ooh, ooh!]
System on blast, cops just pass
Just seen a big ol' ass its Saturday
Sticky, icky, icky, icky

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Grease don't pop on the stove no more, moved on up
Double shot Hennesey fill my cup
Luda choke smoke in a big black truck
Should I whyle out, WHAT THE FUCK
Act like my rims ain't clean
How you gonna ack like my neck don't bling?
Haters get sprayed like aftro-sheen
But they don't never really wanna pop them thangs
Cane, cane sugar man Luda don't go
And I stop at a light, pull off so slow
But I'm out for the night, so pass that dro
So, daddy come home in a Cadillac broom, cadillac broom?
Now don't it sound absurd
Claim College Park where they flip them birds
Trick car alarms, then bend them curves
Chop chop, chunk it up fat man HERB
I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It's illegal but the plants in my backyard grow, that's my buds
Smoke 'til ya drop out, that's my luck
Keep a couple rolled and I hit the club in the back door, nigga WHAT?!
Act like I don't make cloud, how you gonna act like I don't get loud?
How you gonna act like I don't rock crowds?
And leave a lot of people with a gap tooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
But, I guess what you really don't know don't hurt
With a vest, and a pump hear the shotgun squirt
My folks on the block, man, they got that word (they got that word)
Don't it smell so good, in Southwest where they rep that hood
Protect your chest, they up to no good
And come through flossin, they wish y'all would

I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass it's Saturday
Sticky, icky, icky, icky

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Worldwide hustlers get that dough
Work that tip, get rid of evidence, move that brick
Keep a D eagle with an extra clip
Think it ain't so, sucka trip!
Act like I just do rap
How you gonna act like I just ain't strapped?
How you gonna act like I don't push lacs?
Black Eldorado, fifth wheel on BACK!
Ichy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze
With a bag on tha block I'ma make 'em say please
In the back, on block so the cops they freeze
And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed, (you gotta nose bleed?)
Don't it smell so sweet?
In DECATUR, where they pack that heat
And rob NEIGHBORS in the night creep, creep
I'll see you LATER we'll be in them streets...

I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass it's Saturday

We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discoverin' you, oh
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue, uh uh uh
And if you want love
(Then make it)
Swim in a deep sea
(Of blankets)
Take all your big plans

(And break 'em)
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
Something 'bout the way
The hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take
When crawlin' towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it
You want love? We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
Take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
Damn baby, you frustrate me
I know you're mine, all mine, all mine
But you look so good, it hurts sometimes
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonderland, oh no
You want a love to last forever
One that will never fade away
I want to help you with your problem
Stick around, I say

Coming up
Coming up, yeah
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, I say

You want a friend you can rely on
One who will never fade away
And if you're searching for an answer
Stick around, I say

Coming up
Coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, yeah

You want some peace and understanding
So everybody can be free
I know that we can get together
We can make it, stick with me
It's coming up
Coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up for you and me

Coming up

Coming up
Coming up, I say
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, I feel it in my bones
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

Stick around, we're nearly there

Coming up
Coming up everywhere
Coming up like a flower
Coming up for all to share

Coming up, yeah
Coming up, anyway
Coming up like a flower
Coming up
Tenure
I plant my feet and venture in a strange world
I reach and grasp onto a branch
And lay and sigh and breathe
Oh I know
A little space to breathe
Tenure
I open up my eyes and see a strange girl
She gasps inside a dream within the world
We sigh and sleep
Oh I know
A little space to be
I don't know who to trust, no surprise
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies
Trying not to break
But I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself
Get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this
All the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you
Just takes so much out of me
Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
Tension is building inside, steadily
Everyone feels so far away from me
Heavy thoughts forcing their way out of me
Trying not to break
But I'm so tired of this deceit
Every time I try to make myself
Get back up on my feet
All I ever think about is this
All the tiring time between
And how trying to put my trust in you
Just takes so much out of me
Take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
I won't waste myself on you
You, you
Waste myself on you
You, you
I'll take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
Everything from the inside
And just throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you
You, you
Uhh.. UH! .. WHOO!

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

If I gotsta bring it to you cowards then it's gonna be quick, aight
All your mens up in the jail before, suck my dick
And all them other cats you run with, get done with, dumb quick
How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit? Aight
There go the gun click, 9-1-1 shit
All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club, cause everytime
You come around, it's like (what) I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to
But I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe
They just sayin' that, now cause they miss you
Shit a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you layin' on your back, lookin' at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin' the truth and it hurts
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

Off the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain
'cause niggas still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fuckin' with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on that got you think that you Superman
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, "So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go"
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whinin' over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it on on the strength of the hands with them, man
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

I bring down rains so heavy it curse the head
No more talkin - put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin - lest you tryin to end up red
Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin
You know who gon' find you? (Who?) Some old man fishin
Grandma wishin your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

Hold up! ERRRRRRRR!

Oh Oh Mary

Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned?
Oh, Mary, don't you weep

Well, Satan got mad and he knows I'm glad
Missed that soul that he thought he had
Now, didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned?
Oh, Mary, don't you weep

Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you mourn
Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned?

Didn't Pharaoh's army get drowned?
Oh, Mary, don't you weep

Alright come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinning round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky smooth perfume
Right my little pooh bear
Wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air
Kick it in the sand?
I'll say I told you so but
You just gonna cry
You just wanna know those
Peanut butter vibes
My my simple sir
This ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and
Tipsy topsy slurs
I can't take this place
No I can't take this place
I just wanna go where
I can get some space
Truth be told
I been there I done this all before
I take your gloom
I curl it up and puff it into plumes
Hold my hand and float back to the summer time
Tangled in the willows now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you, how can I be nice
Tripping round tree stumps in your summer smile
I can feel it now that you've gone
I have made you all that I want
I know you're keeping to your own sound
You're running out of sight when the light goes down
Said you'll be waiting 'till the night's done but there's no one
And the world went on but I always knew you'd come

Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling

I can feel it coming so clear
I can feel you already there
And I can see you with my eyes shut
You're running in my head and I can't keep up
Said you'll be waiting for the next one
But I always knew, I always knew you'd come
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling

Our love was long so long
And then forgotten like an old song
You said your life went on
But I always knew I always knew you'd come

Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up in the Heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Written fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
'Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight'
Uh uh hey, Saturday night
Hey uh uh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night
Now everybody's dancin' down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
Temperature keeps risin', everybody gettin' high
Come the rockin' stroke of midnight, the place is gonna fly
Uh uh hey, Saturday night
Hey uh uh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night
Turn on channel six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues"
His wife say, "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, put on your rockin' shoes"
Uh uh hey, Saturday night
Hey uh uh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night
Then God way up in Heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought He'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and roll music meets the risin' Planet Sun
Uh uh hey, Saturday night
Hey uh uh, one more Saturday night
Ohh, Saturday night
Hey, another Saturday night
Hey, another Saturday night
Everybody's get high
Hey, another Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
...
Sunday morning, woke up yawning, filled the pool for a swim
Pulled down the head and looked in the glass just to see if I was in
Went up the stairs and kissed my woman to make her come alive
'cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive

That's how they are, so I grabbed out the car, convertible fifty-nine
Headed to the freeway, tried to find the Pasadena sign
Ten miles and three quarters, I wasn't feeling any more alive
'cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive

I used to be a minstrel free
With a whole lot of bread in my bag
I used to feel that my life was real, but the good Lord threw me a snag
Now I'm gonna be the same as me, no matter how I try
'Cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Turned 'round the car and headed for home
I guess I realized my fate
Ten miles and three quarters more, I pulled up outside the gate
Twenty more kids were stood inside and that made thirty-five
'Cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive

Sunday morning woke up yawning, filled the pool for a swim
Pulled down the glass and looked in the mirror just to see if I was in
Went up the stairs and kissed my woman to make her come alive
'cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
I'm in a battle with my heartbeat
The more I struggle, the more I get deep
I go full throttle down the dark streets
And there is trouble ahead, I get weak
It's like I'm running through a red light
Girl you know you make me weak
I should be hittin' all the brakes like
Hold up, hold up, oh
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
It isn't like me to get caught up
But when you running you're never quite free
I wasn't really out to find love
But now you found me and got me all weak
It's like I'm running through a red light
Girl you know you make me weak
I should be hittin' all the brakes like
Hold up, hold up, oh
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
Oh ooh whoa, oh ooh whoa
I'll drive you like a fast car
I'm in a battle with my heartbeat
The more I struggle the more I get deep
I go full throttle down the dark streets
And there is trouble ahead
I can't, I get weak, I get weak
I can't, I get weak, I get weak
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
Girl you really turn me on, on, on, on
You know you make my engine run, run, run, run
And there's no turning back us
We've gone too far, I'll drive you like a fast car
Oh ooh whoa, oh ooh whoa
I'll drive you like a fast car, yeah

Dancing in the space of... time
She can surely know the answer Standing in the steps of... mine Will I need her
Will I wonder
Will I fall down to the ground
Is it love that is the answer
Will she lift me to the sound Must I stay a minute longer
Eyes bewitching me does more
Tries to keep me from my wonder
Knowing her, now I must go Will I need her
Will I wonder

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

To put through the shredder
In front of my friends
Ooooh babe

When you know how I need you1
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
Ooooh babe
Don't leave me now

How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooooh babe2
Why are you running away?
Ooooooh babe
Ooooooh babe

(Spoken) (Sound of many TVs coming on, all on different channels)
The Bulls are already out there...
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrgh!
This Roman Meal bakery thought you'd like to know.3
Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah

[Verse 1]
You wanted a hit
But maybe we don't do hits
I try and try
It ends up feeling kind of wrong

You wanted it tough
But is it ever tough enough?
No, nothing's ever tough enough
Until we hit the road

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you wanted it lush
But honestly, you must hush
No, honestly, you know too much
So leave us, leave us on our own

And so you wanted a hit
Well this is how we do hits
You wanted a hit
But that's not what we do

[Verse 3]
You wanted it real
But can you tell me what's real?
There's lights and sounds and stories
Music's just a part

Yeah, you wanted the truth
And then you said you want proof
I guess you're used to liars
Saying what they want

[Chorus]
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home
No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 'til you take us home

[Verse 4]
Yeah you wanted it smart
But honestly, I'm not smart
No, honestly, we're never smart
We fake it, fake it all the time

Yeah you wanted the time
But maybe I can't do time
Oh we both know that's an awful line
But it doesn't make it wrong

[Verse 5]
You wanted it right
No out of mine and out of sight
No dirty bus and early flight
No seven days and forty nights

Yeah you wanted a hit
But tell me, where's the point in it?
You wanted a hit
But that's not what we do

[Chorus]
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home
No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 'til you take us home

[Chorus]
And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies 'til you take us home
No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 'til you take us home
So this is who I am
And this is all I know
And I must choose to live
For all that I can give
The spark that makes the power grow

But I will stand for one dream if I can
Symbol of my faith in who I am
But you are my only

And I must follow on the road that lies ahead
I won't let my heart control my head
But you are my only

And we don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
And I know what I've got to be...

Immortality
I make my journey through eternity
I keep the memory of you and me
Inside
Fulfill your destiny
It's there within the child
My storm will never end
My fate is on the wind
The King of Hearts
The Joker's wild

We don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
I'll make them all remember me

Cause I have found the dream that must come true
Every ounce of me must see it through
But you are my only

I'm sorry I don't have the role for love to play
Hand over my heart I'll find my way
I will make them give to me...

Immortality
There is a vision and a fire in me
I keep the memory of you and me
Inside

And we don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
In all my love for you
And what else we may do

We don't say goodbye...
I should of quit you a long time ago
I should of quit you baby a long time ago
But you got me messin' round with you baby
You got me cryin' on a killin' floor, yeah

If I don't fallow, yeah my first mind
If I don't fallow pretty baby my first mind
I would have been gone since my second time
Yeah

Lord knows, right now I should've been gone
Lord knows, I should've been gone
You got me messin' round with you baby you got me cryin' on a killin' floor
Yeah, that's all
Ooh, you got me cryin' baby
Ohh, you got me cryin'
W e were burning up like a summer love
Now you're telling me that what we got ain't good enough
You dont want me, you dont need me
Too bad, so sad, enough of that
Ain't it funny you were telling me you'd never leave
Now you're telling me that you're on to better things
I guess this is farewell, I guess this is goodbye
I'll do just fine, I'll be alright
When you show up, asking me to come back
I'll be telling you
We could've had love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
But you're the one that walked away
So let me give it to you straight
Girl we could've had love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
What we had was hard to find
But you wanted to leave it all behind
And thats okay
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Girl you never miss a good thing till its gone
Now this good thing is moving on
I don't want you
I don't need you
So long, so done
You're not the one
And I hope you don't take it too personal
When you sing along to this on the radio
Every lyric
Can you hear it
These words are mine
We had our time
When you show up, asking me to come back
I'll be telling you
Girl we could've had love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
But you're the one that walked away
So let me give it to you straight
We could've had love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
What we had was hard to find
But you wanted to leave it all behind
And thats okay
You can do whatever makes you happy
We'll tell you to stay
We'll stand in the way
I'll tell you you'll be okay
The future is right in front of you
In front of you, yeah
In front of you
Girl we could've had love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
But you're the one that walked away
So let me give it to you straight
We could've had love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
What we had was hard to find
But you wanted to leave it all behind
We could've had love, love, love, love osv

All of you
Can we break through?
And start anew?

I want your superlove
I wanna be inside your superlove
I need the spirit with the sexual
I'm gonna be inside your superlove

We both know
The way to go
Let's take a chance
It's our last dance
Oh, sometimes
I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, sometimes
I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
I don't wanna be another one
Ok, this shit is so random
And when I'm with you
Its like our heart beats, are in tandem
And when our lips lock
I just wanna hold your face for ransom
You're beautiful and I'm handsome
That'll be good for the babies
If ever we go there maybe!
It's crazy, no titles but your my baby
When I'm idle that's your time
Show time, and for you, I wish I had more time
Red wine, chocolate
Baby you could be my Valentine
More than just sex exchanged, baby you my Boo Thang

Hey, girl, so glad that I've found ya!
Uh huh! Tell your friends, they're leaving without ya!
Got a hotel room with a view of the city that I know you gonna like
Got the candles leading to the bathtub baby, let's hop inside!
Ride in the two door with the roof gone
My oh my, baby it's been too long
So grab your coat and your purse
I'll walk out of here first
Wait about five and I'll be parked outside!
I know we ain't got no strings attached
But this could be a perfect match!
And girl, we ain't no cuddie buddies
Cause this is way more than that!

You're my boo thang
Can't get enough, I love yo stuff!
Let's turn it up, you get what you want
Cause you're my boo thang

[Intro]
Woo!
Woo!
S—somebody do somethin', please
Can somebody do somethin', please?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin', please
Can somebody do somethin', please?
Whoa—oh—oh—oh
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, yeah, I said

[Verse 1]
Uh, I close my eyes before I cross the street
If a car about to hit me, then he oughta beep
Watching Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm underwater in my dreams
Said, I'm in awe, this jigsaw puzzle's not complete
I'm just an idea, nothing con-cer-ete
I came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change with us, but come to the same difference
So shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hating on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
Said, I'm no God
I don't think that I'm a human, though, 'cause I'm so odd
If people selling drugs, they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off selling the cross
Okay, let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan

[Chorus]
Somebody do somethin'
Said, somebody do somethin', somebody, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin', please
Said, somebody do somethin', somebody, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody, ayy

[Verse 2]
I'm sippin' Jameson like I was majored in whiskey flavourin'
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off, leave it danglin'
FlyLo's still tryna put me onto Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me, said
I ain't nobody, and neither are you
Been contemplating if I even still believe in the truth, I'm so stubborn
I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
Hell nah, all your songs are 16's and a hook
We here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
Dyin' for the movement, tryin' not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist consuming the views of Christianity
I wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo
I hear the fish bitin' nice right now
I can't figure out life and feel right right now
Boo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down
Spit the shit that leave a diaper brown

[Outro]
Can somebody do somethin', please?
Can somebody do somethin', please? Somebody, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin', please
Said, somebody do somethin'
Somebody, yeah, yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody do somethin'
Wassup London?
Somebody
Yeah

[Intro]
It's breakfast time!

[Chorus]
Pancakes and syrup, pancakes and syrup
Pancakes and syrup, it's breakfast time
Pancakes and syrup, pancakes and syrup
Pancakes and syrup, it's breakfast time

[Verse 1]
Y'all know me, it's Biz with the beats
Guaranteed to rock out just like the E
Leave the M-A-R-K-I-E
Ain't know why there's a ZAY-Y-P
Every time I rock from here to Europe
You know I be makin' pancakes an syrup
Yup, uh-huh, I rub my tummy, yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum, yummy

[Chorus]
Pancakes and syrup, pancakes and syrup
Pancakes and syrup, it's breakfast time
Pancakes and syrup, pancakes and syrup
Pancakes and syrup, it's breakfast time

[Verse 2]
Eat 'em up, eat 'em up, eat 'em up, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, eat 'em up
Eat 'em up, eat 'em up, eat 'em up, yum, yum, eat 'em up, eat 'em up
Yum, pancakes, pancakes, syrup
Yum, yum, eat 'em up, eat 'em up, eat 'em up
Yum, pancakes, pancakes, syrup, eat 'em up

[Chorus]
Pancakes and syrup, pancakes and syrup
Pancakes and syrup, it's breakfast time
Pancakes and syrup, pancakes and syrup
Pancakes and syrup, it's breakfast time

[Outro]
Hey, what's that y'all doin'?
That's it right there, I ain't wanna hear nothin'
Give it up to this time full of strife
Get down, you might be fucking with the song of life
Extend your deeper senses, there will be no fight
At the never ending ocean of perfect insights
'Round your molecule beam with a halo of light
The animated aura will give delight
Soon, your every single worry will be out of sight

With the power of It, we are about to astound
All your preconceptions, they will come unbound
Listen very close, my inner voice expounds
We are the human race, and we groove to the sound
Yes, we deliver the truth to our musical birth
A soul shocking sound with electrify the earth
People have to know that it's not about money
Cash is not the way to make your life sunny
There is no need if you got the soul seed
Love, life and peace, it can only begin
When you know in your heart that the change is within
Love all your brothers and love all your sisters
Love all the missus and love all the misses
And don't be shy when you're sharing your kisses
Greed, jealousy gets boos and hisses
What it is, what it is, so much to be found
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong

Balance your life with the right kind of foods
To eat a sad cow is to eat another you
Well, that's an unfair rap, it's unforgivably rude
It'll put your Karma in the worst of moods
Someone's drinking booze and taking too many ludes
'Cause when you cop, don't you cop an attitude
And that's an ugly thing, it's not the real you
So please y'all, take some sound advice
Be yourself, clear your mind, make a sacrifice
The always sober you is especialy nice

Don't loot, don't shout, give comet the boot
I love it kickin' back and playin' my bamboo flute
Refuse to fight wars for political whores
Unsurpassed peace lines the salt water shores
It is my notion that the perfect peace potion
Can be found in the wake of the green sea ocean
The long rocky swells of the mighty blue ocean
Is the cradle of peace, it's the perfect peace potion
There you will find it, with sweet sea creatures
The smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature
We will learn much peace will the whale as your teacher
Good morning class, how very nice to meet you
What it is, what it is, so much to be found
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong

Open up your hearts to the planets; to the stars
With your spirit take a trip from Venus to Mars
You know, Einstein did while Hitler hid
Now, Albert lives forever in every single kid
But, with Adolph Hitler, we are permanently rid
Picasso, Mister Dali and my man, Jimi Hendrix
These cool brothers make the world go 'round
Yeah, they do it with art, and Jimy did it with sound
But, by all these men, it was found
Each and every person can be just as renowned
Don't let the world's racist creeds give your pretty face a frown
Stand up for equal rights, I mean buckle down
Go spread the word from town to town
We are the human race and we groove to the sounds

Now that you've heard what it is in a song
From here on in, you can do no wrong
Blame it on the goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

She said, she usually don't
But I know that she front
'Cause shawty know what she wan't
She don't wanna to seem like she's easy

I ain't saying what you won't do
But you know what we're probably gon' do
What you been feenin' deep inside

Let it out now, girl what you drinkin', gon' let it sink in
Here for a weekend, thinkin', we can
See where we could be if we press fast forward
Just one more round and you're down I'd know it

Fill another cup up, feelin' on your butt what
You don't even care now, I was unaware
How fine you was before
My buzz set in, my buzz set in
Blame it on the goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

Ooh see, she spilled some drink on me
And now I'm knowin' she tipsy
She put her body on me
And she keeps staring me right in my eyes

No tellin' what I'm gon' do
Baby, I would rather show you
What you been missin' in your life
When I get inside

Girl, what you drinkin'? Don't let it sink in
Here for the weekend, thinkin', we can
See where we could be if we press fast forward
Just one more round if your down, I'm fallin'

Fill another cup up, feelin' on your butt what
You don't even care now, I was unaware
How fine you was before
My buzz set in, my buzz set in
Blame it on the goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

T-Pain
Girl, I know you feel good
Just like you look, couple more shots
You open up like a book, I ain't trippin 'cause I'ma read ya
Shawty, I ain't trippin', I jus' wanna please ya

I'ma take a shot of Nuvo, shawty, then you know
It's going down, we can go kick it like Judo
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream
So I made her say I, I

Now she got her hand on my leg
Got my seats all wet in my ride
All over my ride
She look me dead in the eye
Then my pants got bigga
She already knew what to figga
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, "Fuck dat nigga"

Blame it on the juice, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the henny
Blame it on a blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

Now to the ballas poppin' bottles
With they henny in they cups screamin'
Money ain't a thing, if it ain't throwin' it up in the sky
Hold your drinks up high

And to my independent ballas
Who can buy they own bottles
If you lookin' like a model
When them broke fellas holla, tell 'em, bye
Hold your drinks up high

You can blame it on the goose, gotcha feeling loose
Blame it on the 'tron, catch me in a zone
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

Blame it on the vodka, blame it on the henny
Blame it on the blue tap, got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-alcohol

[Verse 1]
The news is out all over town
That you've been seen a-runnin' 'round
I know that I should leave, but then
I just can't go, you win again

[Verse 2]
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
What can I do you win again

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry for your victim now
'Cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain
And someday say you win again

[Verse 4]
You have no heart you have no shame
You take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain
I love you still you win again
Well, he feels like an elephant
Shakin' his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you're dreaming about
Being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim

And it’s not like Mister Shook to get shy
When they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down
In the dark down there
He’s not too easily scared

He’s got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now
Coming down the stairs

(Here he comes)

He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac
‘Cause he doesn’t like it looking
Like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one remembered a thing
When they saw him again
That’s how it is 'til the end (yeah)
Ooooooooooooooooooh

Did did did did you see the frightened ones
Did did did did you hear the falling bombs
Did did did did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky

Ooooooooooooooooooh

Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye

How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
M y weakness I feel I must finally show
Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
Lend me your eyes I can change what you see
But your soul you must keep, totally free
Har har, har har, har har, har har
Awake my soul, awake my soul
Awake my soul
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Har har, har har, har har, har har
In these bodies we will live, in these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love, you invest your life
In these bodies we will live, in these bodies we will die
And where you invest your love, you invest your life
Awake my soul, awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker
Awake my soul, awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker
You were made to meet your maker
St. Stephen
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes the people all complain
Stephen prospered in his time
Well he may and he may decline
Did it matter, does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to hell
Hell halfway twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again
Lady finger, dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters, dawn with answer
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrapped the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills
Saint Stephen will remain, all he's lost he shall regain
Seashore walk by the suds and the foam
Been there so long, he's got to calling it home
Fortune comes a calling, calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer, "Yes I can"?
But what would be the answer to the answer-man?
High green chilly winds and windy vines
In loops around the twisted shafts of lavender, they're crawling to the
Sun
Underfoot the ground is patched
With arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita, stark and shiny in the
Breeze
Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and droop so hungry neath
The sky
William Tell has stretched his bow til it won't stretch
No furthermore and/or it may require a change that hasn't come before

[Verse 1]
Home, home in the late night
And away, away in the half life
Except Saturday, crushed by the boring
Until plagued, plagued by the tourists
When once you have believed it
Now you see it's sucking you in

To string you along with the pretense
And pave the way for the coming release

[Verse 2]
Alone, prone in the half light
And late, late to the real life
If you find a way into the gold rush
You will stay until the morning comes

[Refrain]
You can normalize
Don't it make you feel alive?

Don't it make you feel alive?

Get Innocuous
Making love underneath the bed
Shooting stars from a purple sky
I don't care how I do it
I'm the man on the flaming pie
I stick my tongue out and lick my nose
Tuck my shirt in and zip my fly
Well, go ahead, I have a vision
I'm the man on the flaming pie
Everything I do has a simple explanation
When I'm with you, you could do with a vacation
I took my brains out and stretched 'em on the rack
Now I'm not so sure I'm ever gonna get 'em back
Cut my toes off to spite my feet
I don't know whether to laugh or cry
But never mind just check my rhythm
I'm the man on the flaming pie
I'm the man on the flaming pie
Everything I do has a simple explanation
When I'm with you, you could do with a vacation
I took my brains out and stretched 'em on the rack
Now I'm not so sure I'm ever gonna get 'em back
I'm the man on the flaming pie
Yes, I'm the man on the flaming pie
Well, I'm the man on the flaming pie

I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

(Everything falls apart even the people who never frown)

(Eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end youll soon find)
(Were out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away?
Why I played myself this way?
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away?
Why I played myself this way?
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
I've tried like you
To do everything you wanted too
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart even the people who never frown)

(Eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end youll soon find)
(Were out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away?
Why I played myself this way?
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away?
Why I played myself this way?
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
(We're all out of time, this is how we learn how it all unwinds)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(We're all out of time, this is how we learn how it all unwinds)
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away?
Why I played myself this way?
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away?
Why I played myself this way?
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away, pushes me away

They paved paradise and put up a parking lot

[Verse 2]
They took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

[Verse 3]
Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

[Verse 4]
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in the air's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(It watches everything)
So I know now when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too
Your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can but
Everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(It watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you too
Right inside your skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
Alright
Now dig this, baby

You don't care for me
I don't-a care about that
You got a new fool, ha!
I like to laugh at

I have only one a-burnin' desire
Let me stand next to your fire

(Let me stand next to your fire)
Hey, let me stand next to your fire
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Whoa, let me stand, baby
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Let me stand
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Yeah, baby

Listen here, baby
And stop acting so crazy
You say your mom ain't home, it ain't my concern
Just a-play with me, and you won't get burned
I have only one a-itchin' desire
Let me stand next to your fire

(Let me stand next to your fire)
Yeah, let me stand, baby
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Let me stand
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Oh, let me stand
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Ow!

Oh! Move over, Rover
And let Jimi take over

Yeah, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeah, get on with it, baby
Ow!
Yeah!

That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Now, dig this!
Ha!
Now listen, baby
You try to gimme your money
You better save it, babe
Save it for your rainy day
I have only one a-burnin' desire
Let me stand next to your fire, ha

(Let me stand next to your fire)
Ow! A-let me stand
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Oh! Let me stand, baby
(Let me stand next to your fire)
I ain't gonna do you no harm
(Let me stand next to your fire)

I ain't gonna hurt you, baby
Oh, I ain't talkin' 'bout your old lady
Ow!
Oh yeah, this is Jimi talkin' to you
Yeah, baby
Everyone's feelin' pretty
Its hotter than July
Tho' the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us
Even if they tried

From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonite there'll be a party
On the corner, at the end of the block

(chorus)
Didn't know you
Would be jammin it
'Til the break of dawn
See nobody ever told me
That you would be jammin' it
'Til the break of dawn
We'll be jammin' it
Jammin' it, jammin' it
Jam on
They want us to join the fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze, through our fingers slip away

Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the One
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun

(chorus)
*add refrain;
We're in the middle
Of the making of the master blaster, jammin

You ask me; "Am I happy?"
Well, as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we've all just made a pact

We've agreed to get together
And join as children in JAH
When you're movin' in the positve
Your destination is the brightest star

Chorus
I bet you if someone approached you yesterday
To tell you that you would be jammin'
You would not believe it
Cause you never thougt that you would be jammin'

Fade out
OOOOOOO MMM MMM MMMMMMM

We don't have no plastic L.A. friends
Ain't on the edge of no popular trend
Ain't never seen the inside of that magazine GQ
We don't care if your a lawyer or a Texas oil man
Or some waitress busting ass at some liquor stand
If you got soul we hang out with people just like you

Well my hairs turning white
My necks always been red
My collars still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say we've always been Red White and Blue

Ride our own bikes to Sturgis pay are own dues
Smokin camels and drinking domestic brews
If you want to know where i've been just look at my hands
Yeah i've driven by the white house and spent some time in jail
Mama cried but she still wouldn't pay my bail
I ain't been no angel but even god he understands
My hairs turning white
My necks always been red
My collars still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say
We've always been red white and blue

Yeah that's right.....

My daddy worked hard and so have I
We paid our taxes and gave our lives to serve this great country
So what are they complaining about
Yeah we love our families
We love our kids
You know it's love that makes us all so rich
That's where were at
If they don't like it they can just...get the hell out! Yeah!

My hairs turning white
My necks always been red
My collars still blue
We've always been here
Just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say
We've always been red white and blue
OooOoOO RED WHITE AND BLUE

YA KNOW YA KNOW YA KNOW

RED WHITE AND BLUE

YEAH

OoooOOOO RED WHITE AND BLUUUUUUUE.....
Verse1-
Baby we were like flowers to water
No better yet coke to a snorter
We were like Martin and Gina
Never let nothing come between us
See baby were like a dream,dream of a land far away,away
Had to go and throw it all away
I hope it was worth it
Through with the hurting
Girl its for certain..
Chorus-
Baby its sad to say
I know that it was you that
Made me feel this way
Never thought it'd be a day that I
I don't love you anymore,baby its a shame to see
Being without you ain't a thing to me
Never thought it'd come a day that I
I don't love you anymore
Verse2-
I never thought that this would be
A one true fantasy
Turned to a tragedy
But all in reality
It was you to be the cause of my doom(yeah)
Since that day I changed the game,thoughts of you done left
My brain,girl I just don't love you anymore,no
Chorus(2x)-
Baby its sad to say
I know that it was you that
Made me feel this way
Never thought it'd be a day that I

Never thought it'd come a time that I
I don't love you anymore
Bridge-

When you threw it away
Oh yeah,huh and girl I just don't love you anymore,all I can say
Chorus(2x)-
Baby its sad to say
I know that it was you that
Made me feel this way
Never thought it'd be a day that I
I don't love you anymore
Baby it's a shame to see
That being without you ain't a thing to me
Never thought it'd come a time that I
I don't love you anymore

[MEREB]
I grew up in your hometown, at least began to grow
I hadn't got to my first shave before the body blow
Egyptians in the courtyard, my family in chains
You witnessed our abduction, which possibly explains
How I know you
How I know you

Before that fateful morning, my family enjoyed
A privileged existence, for my father was employed
As advisor to the King, no less, which surely rings a bell
For as you are his daughter, you probably can tell
How I know you
Yes, I know you

[AIDA]
You know too much, and what you say is better left unknown
And now I'm just a slave like you, our lives our not our own

[MEREB]
I never have abandoned, and nor I think could you
That spark of hope for freedom no terror can subdue

[AIDA]
My only hope is silence, you've never seen my face

[MEREB]
No, you remain a princess in any time or place

[AIDA]
You don't know me

[MEREB]
Yes, I know you

[AIDA]
You don't know me

[MEREB]
How I know you
How I know you

[Chorus]
Round round get around
I get around
Yeah
Get around round round I get around
I get around
Get around round round I get around
From town to town
Get around round round I get around
I'm a real cool head
Get around round round I get around
I'm makin real good bread

[Verse 1]
I'm gettin' bugged driving up and down the same old strip
I gotta find a new place where the kids are hip
My buddies and me are getting real well known
Yeah, the bad guys know us and they leave us alone

[Verse 2]
I get around
Get around round round I get around
From town to town
Get around round round I get around
I'm a real cool head
Get around round round I get around
I'm makin real good bread
Get around round round I get around

Round
Get around round round oooo
Wah wa ooo
Wah wa ooo
Wah wa ooo

[Verse 2]
We always take my car cause it's never been beat
And we've never missed yet with the girls we meet
None of the guys go steady cause it wouldn't be right
To leave their best girl home now on Saturday night

[Chorus]
I get around
Get around round round I get around
From town to town
Get around round round I get around
I'm a real cool head
Get around round round I get around
I'm makin real good bread
Get around round round I get around

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

[Chorus]
Round round get around

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
This is just the start of your story
If you got guts you get glory
Anyone can make it, even you
(In New York City)

And now's the time you gotta stand tough
Cause if you work hard you can rise up
Anyone can make it even you
(In New York City)

[Pre-Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Look at me I'm just blood pumpin
You and me are two hearts thumpin
We are two souls giving the same feed

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
So take it all, the city's yours
It's worth fighting for, it's all yours
So take it all, the city's yours
It's worth fighting for, it's all mine
It's all yours
(In New York City)
(In New York City)
(In New York City)

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
So put your gloves start trainin
You gotta get wet when it's rainin
If you got heart you can make it too
(In New York City)

You see what I see look harder
You know we're the same when we start off
Four walks, two heads, one heart paired

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
So take it all, the city's yours
Ask it for more, when you arrange a tour
So take it all, the city's yours
It's worth fighting for, it's all mine
It's all yours
(In New York City)
(In New York City)

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (Quvenzhane Wallis)]
So take it all
(So take it all)
The city's yours
(The city's mine)
It's worth fighting for
(It's worth fighting for)
It's all mine
(It's all mine)
So take it all
(So take it all)
The city's yours
(The city's mine)
It's worth fighting for
(It's worth fighting for)
And all mine
(It's all mine)
It's all yours
In New York City
Life, love, like time don’t end
Left right, they spin within
Come to me, I come your friend
Those hopes, they're growing old
Love waits for you to bond
Come to me, I'll rest your soul

Oh lord, like earth and sand
Why wait for my command?
Come for me, I'll come for man

[Spoken]
You behind the bench stand, stand still laddy!

When we grew up and went to school
There was a certain teacher who would
Hurt the children any way they could

By pouring this derision
Upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids

But in the town it was well known
When he got home at night
His psychopathic wife would crush him
Within inches of his life
I cannot take this anymore
I'm saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway
(Just like before)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)

(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)

(I'm about to break)
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
(Just like before)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)

(I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)

(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)

(And I'm about to break)
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)

(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)

(I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)

(And I'm about to break)

[Verse 1]
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo

[​​Interlude]​​
Go home

[Chorus]
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo

All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta

Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get back home, Loretta

Get back to where you once belonged
Oh, get back, get back
Get back, oh yeah

[Intro: Mac Miller & Tay Walker]
Alright, you ready?

Check these raps out baby
You wanna see some raps
Do that shit
Okay, (laughs hysterically)
Oh my goodness
Alright let's go

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Okay, chilling for an hour, smoking weed, watching Worldstar
Benz in the garage, probably gotta drive your girl car
You ain't a rapper if my homies never heard y'all
I just spit a punchline, smile then they bird call
Hit your sister in the face with a Nerf Ball
I'm dealing with some shit that really don't concern y'all
Punch a fan if you get a fucking word wrong
I'm wavy, giving you some shit that you can surf on
Finding me a bitch I can swerve on
Frank Thomas homie, 'bout to put the hurt on
Your bitch a night light in bed, she turned on
Roll some weed, tell her burn one

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Okay, I used to give a fuck about success
Now I just want to see Mila Kunis undress
Hope she down for buttsex, it will be a cum fest
FUCK! Sorry that's some shit I had to confess
Crazy-ass bitch doing 911 threats
Came in the game smoking Newport Hundreds
Now I'm at the top and the crown fit, gold on my outfit
Surrounded by this pussy, I'mma drown in it
Got that wet pack, bitch come and give me that
You know we want to know where them titties at
Got 'em gassed, they be asking what I'm cooking with
Have your little brother ask your moms what a pussy is?
Corruption, stunting at the function
Your girl pussy smell like Sour Cream & Onion, woo
Pay attention, you'll learn something
Roll that weed up, burn one

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one
Burn one, burn one, burn one, burn one

Like a blue bird with his heart removed, lonely as a train
I've run just as far as I can run
If I never see the good old days shinin' in the sun
I'll be doin' fine and then some

How long, how long
Woman will you weep
How long, how long
Rock yourself to sleep

Well I been doin' time in lonesome prison, where the sun don't shine
Just outside, the freedom river runs
Out there in that shiny night, with blood hounds on your mind
Don't you know it's the same sad situation?

How long, how long
Woman will you weep
How long, how long
Rock yourself to sleep

Everybody feels alright you know, I heard some poor fool say (Somebody-eeee)
Everyone is out there on the loose
Well I wish I lived in the land of fools, no one knew my name
But what you get is not quite what you choose
Tell me, how long, how long
Woman will you weep
How long, how long
Rock yourself to sleep

How long, how long (long and drawn out)
Muddy River runs so deep
How long, how long (long and drawn out)
Good night baby, rock yourself to sleep
Sleep tight baby, rock yourself to sleep
B-B-B Bye bye baby, Rock yourself to sleep

[Intro: Slim Thug & (Pharrell)]
Say P, man the other day foolin' at the club
Mane with this broad or whateva
I walk in see her talkin' talkin' to some dude or whatever
You know what I'm sayin, so I holla at her I say
"Ay man check this out, man I seen you over there
Hollin at ol' boy, I ain't hatin on that
You know what I'm sayin, but I got a friend coming through too
So when you see her, don't trip, you know what I'm sayin
Keep it playa man, you know what I'm sayin"
So my broad show up or whatever man (word)
This girl wanna try and take a swing at her man (turn that shit up)
(That ain't right, this my man favorite record right here)
(Haha, yessir, beat that shit)

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Before you say, it's cheaper to keep her, we consider and read her
Man she might be the type that won't pea you the feeder
She wants a little cheeba, a little margarita
Man them draws coming off, when she see the two-seater
So put your Porsche up, get your divorce up
I'm sure she'll sign it when she see me pull my doors up
Man them mansions on the water, motherfuck a hill
She threw her heels in the ocean, so she stuck to chill
The truck is steel, hoping somethin' between ya
And now she laughing how she took your ass to the cleaners
Man I'm on your side, not trying to inconvenience ya
Just now we get them million keys, and them plastic Ninas
So keep it playa dog, don't make me say it all
Do something drastic, know that plastic's everywhere dog
If it ain't music, all this money, I don't play at all
And she ain't either, so that mean she doesn't weigh it all

[Hook]
Now we can both post sip, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Now we can both pull the misses, keep it playa mayne (uh huh)
Or we could both right our wrists, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Or you could scram cock sucker, if you'se a hater mayne

Uh, uh, uh (uh)
Uh, uh, uh (haha)
Uh, uh, uh (yup)
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I'm a grown man, Thug ain't the one that play no games witchu
Thug the one to call, to come get off the chain witchu
And hang witchu, when you full of Patrón
And oh yeah, brain wanna get two partners alone (that's right)
Because I'm only 25, and still going live
Got the estate by the pool, by the lake outside
I wake up, and gotta pick which car I'mma drive
The Double R 760, or the 645
I'm, having things mayne check out the chain
Money ain't never been a thing, you see the watch and the ring
Rocks the nicest, never seen none like this
I'm aboss, I don't ask what it cost, my life priceless
Baby girl you might just, get the share this shine
Long as you not selfish, and learn to share some times
And of course I'm still yours, and you're still mine
But you can't be a hater mayne, gotta keep it playa mayne

[Hook]
Now we can both post sip, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Now we can both pull the misses, keep it playa mayne (uh huh)
Or we could both right our wrists, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Or you could scram cock sucker, if you'se a hater mayne

Uh, uh, uh (yup)
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
You don't stop, they say J.Lo just to show her ass and all
Knowing the worst thing could happen, is a nigga could palm
Now my agent saying the only way that he could be calm
I put a hundred mil' on each song, like my name was LeBron
What, not the ice, my beats is worth more
The track is like a whole damn Jacob Store
See niggas hate you more, when they take they broad
But his girl looked at my hands, seen a "Matrix" door
Dudes is foolish, the hues is the truest
I mean the smurfs look green, the rocks are so bluish
You can't out bling me, or BBC jean me
You ain't got no vibe, you can go and ask Me-Me
I think and relay it (uh), I blink and PJ it (uh)
You wanna make fast bucks, take this and e-Bay it
And all you Phantom owners know you can't stand me
Got one in Virgina, 'nother one in Miami, yessir

[Hook]
Now we can both post sip, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Now we can both pull the misses, keep it playa mayne (uh huh)
Or we could both right our wrists, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Or you could scram cock sucker, if you'se a hater mayne
I keep them ladies going
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong

How optimism led me astray
Two hundred things I took the wrong way
But I saw her love gauge running low
I tried to fill but it overflowed

Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong

She remembers my name
Could be blown way out
It's all going to change
She remembers my name

But she was only messing around
Please, no more playing with my heart
Ooh, go with Mr. Right just for once
Ooh, no more mischief with my mind
Then it all just came out
Guess I'll hold it in next time

No more getting it wrong
I'll be frozen here on
If forever we'll see
But no more guessing for me

Oh, I was just so sure of everything
Ooh, that's what you get for dreaming aloud

Then it all just came out
Guess I'll hold in now on
If forever we'll see
But no more guessing for me
It's very far away
It takes about half a day
To get there, if we travel by my a.....dragonfly

No, it's not in Spain
But all the same
You know
It's a groovy name
And the wind's just right

Hang on, my darling
Hang on if you want to go
You know it's a really groovy place
And it's just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic

The clouds are really low
And they overflow
With cotton candy
And battle grounds
Red and brown
But it's all in your mind
Don't think your time
On bad things
Just float your little mind around
Look out

Hang on, my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic
Just a little bit of daydream here and there

Hang on, my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go
It puts everything else on the shelf
With just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic
Just a little bit of daydream here and there

Still is the life
Of your room when you're not inside
And all of your things
Tell the sweetest storyline
Your tears on these sheets
And your footsteps are down the hall
So tell me what I did
I can't find where the moment went wrong at all
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
C'mon back to bed
What will this fix?
You know you're not a quick forgive
And I won't sleep through this
I survive on the breath you are finished with
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
You can be mad in the morning
Or the afternoon instead
But don't leave me
98 and 6 degrees of separation from you, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Why don't you come back to bed?
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love
Will I live tomorrow?
Well I just can't say
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say

But I know for sure
I don't live today

No sun coming through my windows
Feel like I'm sitting at the bottom of a grave
No sun coming through my windows
Feel like I'm sitting at the bottom of a grave

I wish you'd hurry up 'n' rescue me
So I can be on my mis'rable way

I don't live today;
It's such a shame to waste your time away like this

Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
I know for sure
I don't live today
Do you think about me when you’re all alone?
The things we used to do we used to be
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

Do you think about me when the crowd is gone?
It used to be so easy, you and me
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

When you need a way to beat the pressure down
When you need to find a way to breathe
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

If you need to see me when the crowd is gone
It used to be so easy can’t you see?
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free…
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
Start from the beginning
Feels like it was yesterday
The best of my friends stay
The rest of em' fade away
Now there's nothing but green lights
The reason we stand in place
So time doesn't miss me
I move at a faster pace

And no one can blame us (Underdogs)
'Cause when you're the underdog
They never get down

You're still just pretending
Then you'll be right back
On track, on track
When you fall down, get up
You're just a beginning
You're still just pretending
Then you'll be right back
On track, on track
Well, I stand up next to a mountain

What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
Oh what peace we often forfeit
Oh what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer

Are we weak and heavy laden
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In his arms he'll take and shield thee
Thou wilt find a solace there

[Rap: MC Lyte]
Yeah, I'm ecstatic for love
Fanatic of love
And if I'm not around
It's you I'm thinkin' of
I gotta make it real for you
Whenever I deal wit you
I do do do do anything

[Verse 1]
I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find the love within
So I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see, yeah
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go
Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of

[Chorus]
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything
But you won't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do

Do for love
You tried everything
Won't give up

[Verse 2]
My friends wonder what is wrong with me, yeah
'Cause I'm in a daze from your love, you see
So I came back to let you know
Oh, I got a thing for you
And I can't let go

Although I only want the best, it's true
I can't believe the things I do for you

[Chorus]
What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything
But you don't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do

[Rap: MC Lyte]
Yeah, come on now, listen
Through the ghetto in the projects of Queens
I gotta get to you 'cause you do them things to me
My love shows
Nobody knows how my adrenaline flows and to the heights it goes
And ayo, see, 'cause when you're filling me up
You're enough, when you're ready for that nut
Babe, I'll be that buttercup
And I catch every drop
You got a chick on lock for you
I'll go through the storm and skip to the road blocks
We can rumble in cuss
We can fight and we can fuss
But know that I'm never giving up
It's nothing I won't do
Nothing I won't go through
You're worth the joy and the pain
I'ma keep it true

[Chorus]
What you won't do
Do for love
You tried everything
But you won't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do
Do for love
You tried everything
Won't give up
Do for love
You tried everything
Won't give up
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand

Well, rock, rock, rock, rock
Let's rock, rock, rock, rock
We're gonna rock all our blues away

[Verse 1]
Whenever I say your name, whenever I call to mind your face
Whatever bread's in my mouth, whatever the sweetest wine that I taste
Whenever your memory feeds my soul, whatever got broken becomes whole
Whenever I'm filled with doubts that we will be together
Wherever I lay me down, wherever I put my head to sleep
Whenever I hurt and cry, whenever I got to lie awake and weep
Whenever I kneel to pray, whenever I need to find a way
I'm calling out your name
Whenever those dark clouds hide the moon
Whenever this world has gotten so strange
I know that something's going to change
Something's going to change

[Chorus]
Whenever I say your name, Whenever I say your name
I'm already praying, I'm already praying
I'm already filled with a joy that I can't explain
Wherever I lay me down, wherever I rest my weary head to sleep
Whenever I hurt and cry, whenever I got to lie awake and weep
Whenever I'm on the floor
Whatever it was that I believed before
Whenever I say your name, whenever I say it loud, I'm already praying

[Verse 2]
Whenever this world has got me down, whenever I shed a tear
Whenever the TV makes me mad, whenever I'm paralyzed with fear
Whenever those dark clouds fill the sky, whenever I lose the reason why
Whenever I'm filled with doubts that we will be together
Whenever the sun refuse to shine, whenever the skies are pouring rain
Whatever I lost I thought was mine
Whenever I close my eyes in pain
Whenever I kneel to pray, whenever I need to find a way
I'm calling out your name
Whenever this dark begins to fall
Whenever I'm vulnerable and small
Whenever I feel like I could die
(Whenever I feel like I could die)
Whenever I'm holding back the tears that I cry

[Chorus]
Whenever I say your name, whenever I call to mind your face
I'm already praying
Whatever bread's in my mouth
Whatever the sweetest wine that I taste
Wherever I lay me down
Wherever I rest my weary head to sleep
Whenever I hurt and cry
Whenever I'm forced to lie awake and have to weep
Whenever I'm on the floor
Whatever it was that I believed before
Whenever I say your name
Whenever I say it loud
I'm already praying

[Outro]
Whenever I say your name
(uuuuuuuuuuuu)
No matter how long it takes
One day we'll be together
(We will be together)
Whenever I say your name
I say when I hurt and cry
Let there be no mistake
That day will last forever

[?]
Whenever I say your name
(Whenever I say your name)
(Jeah)
No matter how long it takes
One day we'll be together
(One day we'll be together)
Whenever I say your name
Whenever
Whenever I say it loud
Let there be no mistake
No metter

[?]
That day will last forever
Whenever I say your name
Whenever I say your name
No matter

[?]
No matter how long it takes
One day we'll be together
(We will be together)
Whenever I say your name
Whenever
Whenever I say it loud
Let there be no mistake
That day will last forever
Whenever I say your name...

[Intro]
Let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

[Verse 1]
Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him ‘cause he started out here locally
Hopefully I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
‘Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear them talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

[Refrain]
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

[Chorus]
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Hands up, hands up
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up
And they in awe, we gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
Hands up, hands up
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap
Verse two, verse two, here we go

[Verse 2]
And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend (Whoa)
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

[Refrain]
But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

[Chorus]
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Hands up, London
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
One more time
And they in awe, we gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
Put your motherfucking hands
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
In the motherfucking air
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

See the children play the ball
See them play along the hall
It makes me cry to see them smile

I see the moon; I see the sky
I see reflections in my eyes
And there's no one to share my life

I need a life to go my way
So every night I pray
Just give me someone for my life

I feel a clown
People try to play me down
And there's one thing I never found
The sound of love

See the old man walk the lane
See him walk along in pain
It makes me cry to see them smile
I watch the moon; I watch the sky
I see reflections in my eyes
And there's no one to share my life

I need a life to go my way
So every night I pray
Just give me someone for my life

I feel a clown
People try to play me down
And there's one thing I never found
The sound of love

The sound of love
Everybody loves the sound of love
Everybody loves the sound of love
Everybody loves the sound of love
How I got over how I got over
How I got over how I got over
My soul look back and wonder how I got over
How I got over how I got over
How I got over how I got over
My soul look back and wonder how I got over

Just as soon as I see Jesus oh yes
The man who made me free oh yes oh yes
He was the man that bleed and suffer oh yes oh yes oh yes
Who died for you and me oh yes

I wanna thank him
Because he brought me oh yes
Because he taught me oh yes oh yes
I wanna thanke god because he kept me oh yes oh yes oh yes
Cause he left me oh yes

I wanna sing hallelujah
I might shout this evening trouble over
I'm gonna thank Jesus for all he's done for me
Oh yell, how I got over, over
My soul look back and wonder how I got over
Oh yell, how I got over, over
My soul look back and wonder how I got over

I wanna wear a diamond gem
In the new Jerusalem
I wanna walk the street of gold
In the homeland of the old
I'm going to view the host in white
Who travel both day and night
Coming up from every nation
On the way to the great carnation

I will sing hallelujah
Trouble over
I wanna thank Jesus for all he's done for me
How I got over, over
My soul look back and wonder how I got over
How I got over, over

How I got over how I got over
My soul look back and wonder how I got over

Soul look back and wonder how I got over
Over, over
Soul look back and wonder
Soul look back and wonder
Soul look back and wonder how I got over
Woke up this morning
After another one of those crazy dreams
Oh, nothing is going right this morning
The whole world is wrong it seems
Oh, I guess it's the chains that bind me
I can't shake it loose, these chains and things
Got to work this morning
Seems like everything is lost
I got a cold hearted wrong doin' woman
And a slave driving ball
I can't lose these chains that bind me
Can't shake them loose, these chains and things
Just can't lose these chains and things
Oh, you talk about hard luck and trouble
Seems to be my middle name
All the odds are against me
Yes, I can only play a losin' game
These chains that bind me
Can't lose these chains and things
Just can't lose these chains and things
Oh, I would pack up and leave today people
But I ain't got nowhere to go
Ain't got no money to buy a ticket
And I don't feel like walkin' anymore
These chains that bind me
Oh, I can't lose, I can't lose these chains and things

[Intro]
How should I lay down?
How should I lay down?
How should I lay down?

[Chorus]
Instruct me, I am so young
Instruct me, I am so young
I haven’t even begun
I haven’t even begun

[Verse 1]
In the fields
How should I lay down?
In the ball
How should I lay down?

[Chorus]
Instruct me, I am so young
Instruct me, I am so young
I haven’t even begun
I haven’t even begun
I haven’t even begun
I haven’t even begun

[Verse 2]
All I can see is your beautiful eyes
All I can see is your beautiful eyes
Take a deep breath with me
Take a deep breath

[Chorus]
Instruct me, I am so young
Instruct me, I am so young
I haven’t even begun
Begun
Begun
Begun
It's a square dance Mr Marshall
It's a square dance on the floor
It's a square dance Mr Perkins
It's a square dance to be sure, to be sure
Everybody, grab partners

I'm just a clown that used to run around
I used to have a million friends
I used to start where everybody ends
But I just give my best to my friends

I've done my shows. Everybody knows
I nearly sold all my clothes
One man can give; another has to lend
So I just give my best to my friends
And so you should

And when you think that your life isn't right
You know the day isn't always like night
You've had your peace now it's time for you to fight
Just give your best to your friends
I'm just a clown that used to run around
I used to have a million friends
I used to start where everybody ends
So I just give my best to my friends

And when you think that your life isn't right
You know the day isn't always like night
You've had your peace now it's time for you to fight
Just give your best to your friends

And when you think that your life isn't right
You know the day isn't always like night
You've had your peace now it's time for you to fight
Just give your best to your friends
Just give your best to your friends
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in a way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, know
I know I'm not the only one

[Skit 1]
Flash Gordon: Yeah!

[Verse]
He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us
He'll save with a mighty hand
Every man every woman every child
He's the mighty flash

[Skit 2]
(We owe everything to Flash!)
(Hail Flash!)
(From this day on, let every breed of Mongo live together in peace)
(Hail Flash!)
Dale: Will we ever get out of here, Hans?
Zarkov: I don't know. But we'll try. We certainly invite you all to stay
Flash Gordon: What do you think?
Dale: I'm a New York City girl. It's a little too quiet around here for me

[Outro]
No one but the pure in heart may find the golden grail
Oh oh, oh-oh
Boots were made of leather, a breath of cologne
The mirror was a window, she sat by alone
All around her the garden grew
Scarlet and purple and crimson and blue
She came dead, she went and at last went away
The garden was sealed, when the flowers decayed
On the wall of the garden a legend did say
No one may come here, since no one may stay
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Yeah
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an Island
Might even raise a little sand
Yeah

Cause I'm a voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child baby

You better listen when I say

I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back to ya one of these days
Ha ha ha

I said I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back one of these days
Oh yeah
If I don't meet you no more in this world then uh
I'll meet ya on the next one
And don't be late
Don't be late

Cause I'm a voodoo child voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child
Hey hey hey

I'm a voodoo child baby

I don't take no for an answer

Question no
Yeah

[Intro]
Ay, ay! Young Jeezy, let's get it, my nigga!
Rubber Band Man & Snowman in this bitch!
Ay! Ay! Y'all already know, man, y'all can't fuck wit us, man!
It's the King and the Killa, nigga!
C.T.E., P$C, what's happening?

[Verse 1: T.I.]
From the trap shit to all the rap shit
Gave you numbers on the bricks and all of that shit
They run up on the team, I bet they be fallin' back quick
Stack the magazine, I'm giving 'em all of that clip
Y'een heard the latest? Ho, ya fuckin' with the greatest
I know the pussy niggas and the sucka niggas hate us
But the lames can't fade us and ain't any way to rate us
Took the train when they see us 'cause there ain't no way to play us
The fame didn't make us and the Feds didn't take us
So we flamin' out in Vegas, private plane-ing in Jamaica
We the top two crews so it ain't a way to spray us
Lay us, down, nigga who, nigga where?
Dream about our deaths then wake up and say a prayer
Grab some tissue for this new asshole we finna tear
Ain't a handgun made for man that could prepare ya
Say what? Buck on us? I dare ya

[Chorus (sample)]
There is no competition!

[Interlude: Young Jeezy]
Yeah! Ay! You already know what it is, nigga!
C.T.E., U.S.D.A. for life nigga!
U.S.D.A is the clique, nigga! Ha-ha! Yeah!
Tip, what up, nigga? You already know what it is, nigga!
A-Town firehouse, nigga!

[Verse Two: Young Jeezy]
(Young Jeez!) Who me? I'm a coupe-driving, bird-flipping
O-serving, gun-toting, set-tripping, chicken-flipping
(Jeah!) Range-Roving, gat-toting, hay-smoking
(Let's get it!) You know I'm sack-holding (Ay!)
You could save the hating 'cause I do not need it
God damn, I'm so conceited (Ha-ha!)
You was rapping, I was trapping, I was busting, they was ducking
I was gunning, they was running, first nigga said something
Police-ass niggas, yeah they so suspicious (Ay!)
Blowing Cali kush, yeah, so delicious (Ha-ha!)
Grand Hustle and Corporate Thuggin'
You can ask ya girl, I'm the one she's loving
Four-four pound, my Cannons been Aphilliated (Damn!)
Damn right, nigga, A-Town's own
Mr. 17.5, I really got 'em for that
"Them niggas getting money", got a problem with that?

[Chorus]

[Outro: DJ MLK]
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. This DJ MLK! Y'all know I don't talk too much on no goddamn mixtape. Nah, I got too much shit to be damn doin'. You know what I'm sayin'? I DJ seven-plus days a week in the damn city. You know! I just wanna shout out my 

[?] fam, I see ya! 

[?] H-Town in the goddamn building! Shout out 

[?]! Mars, I see ya!
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be

Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love
But most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they got to get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me, you got to play your hand
Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is, ain't it a shame

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin': you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

Truckin', I'm a-goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on

[Big Sean - Verse 1]
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I'm lit
So go head and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life'd it!
I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky's the limit, how bitch? I'm moonwalking!
And my middle name Michael hoe
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it's because I got the title hoe
See I just want my fantasies and real life
You got everything to me what it feel like
Muthaf-ck the radio if I can't hear mine

They give the wrong niggas more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I'mma make it, but even if I don't
Don't feel bad cuz honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

[Chorus]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories

Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cuz in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

[Big Sean - Verse 2]
Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
Thats what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set before you considered great
How many missed calls before you considered fake
How many dreams before its considered fate
I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cuz they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can't look at him in his eyes, you don't know how that shit feels mentally!
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say "in memory"
I'm praying that he make, wished we could go back
Cuz honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories...

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
A man cried
“Where do we look? Where do we search? How do we find it?”
A woman cried love
“My body needs love, my soul needs love, how do I find it?”
We all need love, gotta have love
Prophet! Prophet!

[Verse 2]
He said that love will call to you
So follow him, though it’s hard to do
Believe, believe! We gotta believe!
Within your heart is the secret of life
With joy and sorrow, pleasure and strife
Love is all of these things

[Refrain]
I dream of the prophet man from a far distant land
Ali!

[Verse 3]
A priestess said, “Tell us a prayer!”
A lawyer said, “Is law fair?”
Astronomers cried of galaxies and time
A poet said, “Is there duty to find?”
Speak of God, speak of reason
Speak about death, speak about freedom
Gotta have truth, gotta have wisdom
Give us your word to give to our children

[Refrain]
I dream of the prophet man from a far distant land
Ali!

[Bridge]
The clock struck twelve on the church odd wall
Their voices beckoned to the prophet’s call
You give up yourself when you truly give
Possessions shouldn’t rule the life you live
Work with love and love your work
And idle man is a stranger on earth
Blame yourself for wrong deeds done
The innocent can be the guilty ones
Freedom disguises itself in chains
Happiness sometimes hides in pain
Children are made and are born to you
But they’re not slaves that belong to you
God doesn’t listen to the words you pray
He hears what your heart has got to say

[Outro]
I dream of the prophet man from a far distant land
Ali!
I dream of the prophet man from a far distant land

See you lost your trust and you never should have, you never should have
Don't break your back if you ever say this
Don't answer that
In a bullet proof vest with the windows all closed
I'll be doing my best
I'll see you soon
In a telescope lens when all you want is friends
I'll see you soon
See, they came for you they came snapping at your heels, they came snapping at your heels
Don't break your back if you ever say this
But don't answer that
In a bullet proof vest with the windows all closed
I'll be doing my best
I'll see you soon
In a telescope lens when all you want is friends
I'll see you soon

And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?
I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies how they cut so deeply
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and never say
No, you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down, you push it back down
No, you'll never get it inside
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye
You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run but then back you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and take and take
Fuck it, are you listening
No, you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down, you push it back down
No, you'll never get it inside
Push it back down, you push it back down
No, you've gotta get it inside
You push it back down, you push it back down
No, you'll never get it inside
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye
Floating down as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paperwhite
And floating up, you pass us in the night
A future gazing out, a past to overwrite
So come down far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Hey you got hair, long an' black
Hangin' down in the middle of your back
Don't you cut it off whatever you do
I need it to run my fingers through

'Cause you're my baby
Ah-ah, you're my sugar
Yeah drive me crazy
Little wooly booger

Well I got a guitar, got six strings
And a guitarpick that a-make 'em ring
Every string got a note or two
That I'm gonna use to serenade you

'Cause you're my baby
Ah-ah, you're my sugar
Don't mean maybe
Little wooly booger

Well I got a dollar that I saved
Saved it up for a rainy day
Everybody's callin' for bills that's due
And if they don't catch me, I'll spend it on you
'Cause you're my baby
Ah-ah, you're my sugar
Drive me crazy
Little wooly booger

Well I had me a gal, she said she's mine
But she run around on me all the time
Now she's gone I'm glad we're through
'Cause I-I'm plum-guggled-eyed over you

'Cause you're my baby
Ah-ah, you're my sugar
Yeah don't mean maybe
Drive me crazy
Don't mean maybe
Little wooly booger
You could buy me diamonds, you could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
(Baby, you know I'm worth it)
Dinner lit by candles, run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last and last
(Baby, you know I'm worth it)

Wanna please, wanna keep, wanna treat your woman right?
Not just dough, better show that you know she's worth your time
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth

'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
(When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her
(Please her)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
(First)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth
(A woman's worth)
(Hold up)

If you treat me fairly I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should
(Baby, I know you're worth it)
If you never play me, promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough
('Cause baby, I know you're worth it)

She walks the mile, makes you smile, all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth

'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
(When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her
(Please me)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
(First baby)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth

No need to read between the lines spelled out for you
(Spelled out for you)
Just hear this song 'cause you can't go wrong when you value
(When you value value)
A woman's
Say
(Woman's)
Woman's worth
(Woman's)
Yea
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
(When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her
(Please me)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
(First baby)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth
(A woman's worth)

'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
(Nothing like a woman's worth)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
(Comes first)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth
(A woman's worth)

Cherish that woman, you better please that woman
Yeah
That's how it starts
We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out

And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts

And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways that we show our age

And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
And I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
Oh, you're talking 45 turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend

It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except the part
Where the moral kicks in

And when we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's grinding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life

Oh, you drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
When you're blowing 85 days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?

And to tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sales force into the night

And if I made a fool, if I made a fool, if I made a fool
On the road, there's always this
And if I'm sued into submission
I can still come home to this
And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You can sleep on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tanned
You think over and over "Hey, I'm finally dead."

Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You can turn it on yourself you ridiculous clown
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
And you knew you were tired
But then where are your friends tonight?

Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?

If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
"Welcome to the real world", she said to me
Condescendingly
"Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white"
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you "stay inside the lines"
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take
The so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits, and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't
Find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies
They love to tell you "stay inside the lines"
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above

I am invincible as long as I'm alive

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait 'til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snap shot in the family album
Daddy what d'ya leave behind for me?
Daddy what d'ya leave behind for me?

All in all it's just another brick in the wall
All in all it's just another brick in the wall
Well, I travel at a speed
Of a reborn man
I got a lot of love to give
From the mirrors of my hand
I said a message of love
Don't you run away
Look at your heart
Come along with me today

Well I am what I am thank you
Some people just don't understand
Find yourself first
And then your tool
Find yourself first
Don't you be no fool

Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chains
Messin' with that fool babe
Your life is pain
If you want to be free
Come along with me
Don't mess with the man
He'll never understand
I said find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
So if you come alive
You better prove to the man
You're as strong as him
Everybody come alive
Everybody love alive
Everybody love alive
Everybody hear my message
After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red

And the wind whispers, "Mary"

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere, a queen is weeping
Somewhere, a king has no wife

And the wind, it cries, "Mary"

The traffic lights, they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that lived is dead

And the wind screams, "Mary"
Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past?
And with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers, "No, this will be the last"

And the wind cries, "Mary"
Hey baby where are you coming from?
Well she looked at me and smiled
And looked into space and said "I'm coming from the land of the new rising sun."

Then I said "Hey baby where are you trying to go to?"
Then she said "I'm going to
Spin and spread around peace of mind and a whole lotta love to you and you

Hey girl I'd like to come along
Yes, I'd love to come along
Would you like to come along? She asked me
Yes take me along right now

Hey baby, can I step into your world for a while?
Yes you can, she said
Come on back with me for a while
We're gonna go across the Jupiter sand and see all you people one by one
We gotta help you people out right now
That's why I'm doing it all about

Hey! Yeah, may I come along?

"There must be some way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief

Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth"

"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke

But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late"

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl

[Verse 1]
Count the number of beings you are, see how long it takes you
Count the number of beings you are, see how long it takes you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die
You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die
You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Now that all these walls are down, wonder what I'll tell you
Now that all these walls are down, wonder what I'll tell you
Every day in the week I'm in a different city
If I stay too long people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog
Talkin' about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square

Hey!
And that's why
You can't hold me down
I don't want to be down
I gotta move
Hey

Stone free do what I please
Stone free to ride the breeze
Stone free I can't stay
I got to got to got to get away

Alright
Listen to this baby
A woman here a woman there try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realize it's so easy to break
Oh, but sometimes I get--ha
I can feel my heart kind of runnin' hot
That's when I've got to move before I get caught

And that's why
Listen to me baby, you can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I gotta be free
Ow!

I said
Stone free do what I please
Stone free to ride the breeze
Stone free I can't stay
Got to got to got to get away
Yeah, ow!
Turn me loose baby

Yeah!
Stone free to ride on the breeze
Stone free do what I please
Stone free I can't stay
Stone free got to got to get away
Stone free I'm gonna leave right now
Stone free don't try to hold me back baby
Stone free I'm movin' on down the highway, yeah
Stone free got to got to got to got to
Stone free bye bye baby
Stone free
I want you
All of you
Can we break through?
And start anew?

I want your superlove
I wanna be inside your superlove
I need the spirit with the sexual
I'm gonna be inside your superlove

We both know
The way to go
Let's take a chance
It's our last dance

[Verse 1]
The circus is coming to see you
The elephant smiles
Everybody can hear you
Say that's out of style

[Verse 2]
My brother is friendly for reasons
If I am the same
Just for four hundred seasons
We all live in rain

[Chorus]
So I laugh in your face
You're only one race
Yes, I laugh in your face
And I'm right
You lie just like the rest
But there's nobody best
So I laugh in your face
And I'm right

[Verse 3]
I'll pull out your plugs, so you're small
You'll slide down the drain
On the steps of St. Peter's
You all look the same

[Chorus]
So I laugh in your face
You're only one race
Yes, I laugh in your face
And I'm right
You lie just like the rest
But there's nobody best
So I laugh in your face
And I'm right

[Verse 4]
The circus is coming to see you
The elephant smiles
Everybody can hear you
Say that's out of style

[Chorus]
So I laugh in your face
You're only one race
Yes, I laugh in your face
And I'm right
You lie just like the rest
But there's nobody best
So I laugh in your face
And I'm right
It was acceptable in the 80s
It was acceptable at the time
It was acceptable in the 80s
It was acceptable at the time

I've got love for you
If you were born in the 80s, the 80s
I've got hugs for you
If you were born in the 80s, the 80s

I'll do things for you

I've got hugs for you
If you were born in the 80s
Yeah
I never would of thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves, shit got hectic whenever I fall back
For example, ten minutes can go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost latch, the fucking thought of you With somebody else
I don't like that cellular convo's getting left in the wrong
Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts. (fuck)
I love you

(Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good.)

I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah
I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

Girl you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest
Could make me the saddest
Look Alice
Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like god damn vegans
Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing
I love you so much that my heat stops beating when your leaving
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding
Life without you has no god damn meaning
Sorry I'm passive aggressive for no god damn reason
It's that my mood change like these god damn seasons
I'll fall for you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it tonight
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling bitch let's try to catch it tonight
C'mon

Even though I hate you
I still love you

I like when we hold hands

See I get jealous (fuck)
And if I see that nigga (If I see him)

(I wanna strangle you, till you stop breathing)
Love, love, love

(Fuck, look)

When your day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well hang on

Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (Hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (Hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on

Everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts
Don't throw your hand, oh no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you are not alone

If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much of this life to hang on

Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries
Everybody hurts sometimes
And everybody hurts sometimes

So hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Everybody hurts
I get up every evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
Come on in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I am nothing but tired
Mand I'm just tired and bored of myself
Hey there baby
I could use just a little love
You can't start a fire
Can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for fire
Even if we are just dancing in the dark
Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving around the place
I check my look in the mirror
Want to change my clothes, my hair, my face

Man, I ain't getting nowhere
Just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know there is
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up, all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby, I'm just about starving tonight

I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here, trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on, baby, give me just one look

You can't start a fire
Sitting around crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Hey baby!

[Verse 1]
When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall
We used to love while others used to play
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Some one else moved in from far away

[Chorus]
Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

[Verse 2]
The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine

[Chorus]

[Outro]
When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall
Do do do do do do do do do
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Some one else moved in from far away
Your lips could never show a smile
You never tried you just put me in a file
I never lived inside your hole, child
I thought you needed me I never had no style

Never say never say never again
Never say never say never again
You said goodbye; I declared war on Spain
Never say never say never again

Your eyes could never show a grin
You never tried you just put me in a tin
I never lived inside your hole child
You know I needed you
And look at the shape I'm in

Never say never say never again
Never say never say never again
You said goodbye I declared war on Spain
Never say never say never again
Your lips could never show a smile
You never tried you just put me in a file
I never lived inside your hole child
I thought you needed me
I never had no style

Never say never say never again
Never say never say never again
You said goodbye I declared war on Spain
Never say never say never again

Never say never say never again
Never say never say never again
You said goodbye I declared war on Spain
Never say never say never again

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Life is full of up and downs
Twists and turns
But somehow we keep on steppin'

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
These walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated, every nook and cranny
I mean it's still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around demolition might crush

[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)]
If these walls could talk (Step)
I can feel your (Step) reign when it cries, (Uh) gold lives inside of (Step) you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, (Uh) I love it when I’m in it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
These walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I rather miss them
I rather call, I rather diss them
I rather fall on you, put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition go crush

[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)]
If these walls could talk (Uh)
I can feel (Step) your reign when it cries (Chi-town step), gold lives inside of (Step) you
If these walls could talk (Step)
I love it (? step) when I’m in it, I love it when (? step) I’m in it
(Uh)

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
And reality is
Sometimes through these ups and downs
You gotta know when to lead or to follow
Keep steppin'
Chi-town

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Build accessories and stash them on the are
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your homie to save you
Homies to say you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
(That sentence so important)
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hour of the morning
About her baby daddy that's currently serving life
How she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she messing with famous rapper
Walls could talk

[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)]
(Uh, hey)
If these walls could talk
(Yeah)
(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk (Yeah, hey)
(I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it)
(Yes)

[Verse 1]
It was something like a perfect start to this love yesterday
But now who are you?
I thought I knew
Your eyes happen now to look right through me
It’s like you forgot the words you whispered to me
They weren't true
It's like it wasn't you

[Chorus]
Could you tell me what did I do?
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
Tell me

[Verse 2]
Take time to realize
I know that people change their minds
But that was something I wished you would say to my face
But you ran away

[Chorus]
Could you tell me what did I do?
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
Tell me

[Bridge]
If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
Baby, even a lie
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me what did I do
'Cause, baby, suddenly we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
And tell me

[Outro]
And tell me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-yeah
And tell me
Tell me

[Verse 1]
Round six, I smoked a nebula and leveled up
Just ring the bell, knocked him from the heavens into Hell
(Intergalactic triad killer)
Eyes opened up like Christmas
Kicking fits and foaming at the mouth, just like a drunken Orson Welles
(You big sucka, I got you now)
Kick back, stick a move, the ones and twos will always tell the truth
The new Moses parting rooms full of laughter
I rock a black tie like a 1960s massacre

[Bridge]
(Extra, extra, you can read all about it)

[Outro]
I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong
Dying to dodge the draft like an upper cut, strip the title, snap the cuffs
Yeah, I called the bluff on all you racist mother-what! (And I won)

Put it back, get on the vibe with us

Float like a butterfly, sting like an army
Float like a butterfly, sting like an army
Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me
I keep telling my self that it's true
I can get over anything you want my love
But I can't get myself over you

Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
I still remember you
I love you
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Don't forget to remember me my love

On my wall lies a photograph of you girl
Though I try to forget you somehow
You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole
Let me try to go on living right now

Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
I still remember you
I love you
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Don't forget to remember me my love

[Intro: Scent of a Woman Excerpt]
Lawyer: What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today? I mean, the only class in this act is sitting next to me and I'm here to tell ya, this boy's soul is intact. It's non-negotiable, you know how I know? Someone here, and I'm not gonna say who, offered to buy it, only Charlie here wasn't selling
Judge: Sir, you're out of order
Lawyer: How 'bout I show you out of order?
Judge: Stand down, Mr. Slade
Lawyer: I'm not finished! I don't know if Charlie's silence here today is right or wrong, I'm not a judge or jury. But I can tell you this: he won't sell anybody out to buy his future. And that, my friends, is called integrity. That's called courage. Now that's the stuff leaders should be made of. Now here's Charlie, he's come to the crossroads, he has chosen a path, it's the right path. It's a path made of principle and leads to character. Let him continue on his journey

I was born bad
But then I met you
You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true
You never cared what I did at all
Motel singer or the silver pole
I did what I had to do

Femme fatale always on the run
Diamonds on my neck, whiskey on my tongue
Before I get back I gotta get drunk
So get over here pour me a cold one
Babe he can see that I'm danger
Teetering off of the stage yeah
Sparkling in sequins say hey-yeah
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers

Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm flat out of luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
Now daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm kinda outta luck
Wrong, I know, killing someone
Gets a little easier after done it once
You know that I'm fine, you know that I'm young
So tell me you're mine, let's get it on

Babe he can see that I'm danger
Glamorous but I'm deranged, yeah
Dancing on top of the tables
I said it really nice, hey, can you be my saviour?

Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm flat out of luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
Now daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm kinda outta luck

I love you, my little darling
You, my little darling
You, my little darling
You, my little darling

Dancing on top of the tables
Stronger, I wish I was able
Some 

[?] but I'm not capable
I gotta get you back, cause I gotta live 

[?]
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm flat out of luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm kinda outta luck

Let me start off by saying, baby don't go both ways
She don't mind flirtin' and playin'', at least that's what she say
Got off in the spot and I'm trippin', she knows every girl's first name
Could it be somethin' I'm missin'? Or am I just part of the game?

[Verse 1]
She's so pretty but her walk's so mean
The hottest little number that I ever seen (DJ Babey Drew)
And if you seen a dime, she's that times three
She's a bad girl, just what I need, yeah
She got a swagger, sharp like a dagger
Cupid done shot me, I gotta have her
I got a secret that she don't know
I already done seen her goods before, yeah

[Chorus]
I've been tryin' to get her off my mind
Fast forward but it rewinds
'Cause I done seen her naked
Every time I turn around, I'm seein' her clothes come down
'Cause I done seen her naked
No alcohol, no cigarettes, I can't forget
That I done seen her, I done seen her naked
I'm like a dog, I'm just a dog
And I done seen her, I done seen her, I done seen her, I done seen her
(Guess what she did)

[Post-Chorus]
She took it off for me, she took it off already
I done seen her, yeah, yeah, I done seen her already
She took it off for me, she took it off already
Now I done seen it, yeah, yeah, I done seen her really (Hahahahaha)

[Verse 2]
Ooh wee, she got a body (Ha)
And you can't, you can't do nothin' 'bout it
You look her up and down, tryna figure out
How you gon' see what I saw
Don't even act like you surprised, she has 'em mesmerized
All the guys, she got 'em open
Now when you see her there, body everywhere
You gon' see, you gon' see what I'm talkin' 'bout, yeah

[Chorus]
I've been tryin' to get her off my mind
Fast forward but it rewinds
'Cause I done seen her naked
Every time I turn around, I'm seein' her clothes come down
'Cause I done seen her naked
No alcohol, no cigarettes, I can't forget
That I done seen her, I done seen her naked
I'm like a dog, I'm just a dog
And I done seen her, I done seen her, I done seen her, I done seen her
(Guess what she did)

[Post-Chorus]
She took it off for me, she took it off already

Okay, now all the ladies report to the dance floor

Every time I turn around, I'm seein' her clothes come down
'Cause I done seen her naked
No alcohol, no cigarettes, I can't forget

I'm like a dog, I'm just a dog
And I done seen her, I done seen her, I done seen her, I done seen her
(Guess what she did)

[Post-Chorus]
She took it off for me, she took it off already
I done seen her, yeah, yeah, I done seen her already
She took it off for me, she took it off already
Now I done seen it, yeah, yeah, I done seen her really (Hahahahaha)

Fresh up off the stove, I'm hotter than a bitch
Black diamond Audemar is holdin' down my wrist
I'm the shit, you playin'
Nigga, you know my name, dawg
And shawty, let me cut, call me— (Fresh)
Fresh up off the stove, I'm hotter than a bitch
Black diamond Audemar is holdin' down my wrist
I'm the shit, you playin'
Nigga, you know my name, dawg
And shawty, let me cut, call me Mr. Chainsaw
This beat goes so hard, and so does your broad
And when she see me, if it's easy, huh, it's your fault
Lamborghini, fettuccine, count this dough, dawg
Big ice on my neck look like snowballs
Any way that I get it, I don't care, I do it, when I do, I does it
And you know me, shittin' on niggas and I do it in public
I know you mad, why? And I ain't tryna brag
I'm just talkin' 'bout the shit that you wish you had
My tattoos compliment my attitude
Lightskin nigga but I'm not a average dude
You a opener and I'm goin' after you
Headline, I hope you niggas read the news

[Chorus: Petey Pablo]
When they see me, they jaw drop (Yeah)

Blowin' up is what I do, I'm a big grenade
Star stuntin', these niggas frontin', show me somethin'
A whole clique of niggas shittin', bullets dumpin'
And when you see me, please believe me that I'm fly as hell
I got a rack of broads, I call 'em my clientèle
Tyga at the wing, two girls, that's a three-piece
Now you see why all these singers tryna to be me
Now what you talkin' 'bout? To the haters, throw them deuces up
Back number one, middle fingers  up
Straight to the top, zoom-zoom, that's how I go
And then I drop the top on my Murcielago
It's not a game, nigga, so I ain't gotta play
My niggas Mac and Diesel, it's Yung by the way
G5 so I ain't gotta wait
The most hated on, so I ain't gotta hate

[Chorus: Petey Pablo]
When they see me, they jaw drop (Yeah)
Better cuff your chick, when she see me, her drawer drop (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Goddamn, I love the way you fit them Dolce & Gabannas (Gabannas)
The way she dancin', make me wanna get behind her (Behind her)
We can take a cruise off of Gilligan's Island
And just get lost
I got that mister high money, I'm your skipper and your doctor
We can light it up and blast off like a rocket
Gone in the wind, we grown, ain't nobody watchin'
We can get lost

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got you, baby girl, so you can relax, the way you do that
Girl, the way you move that, how they let you do that?
You know I'm on a mission, I ain't tryna get missin'
I'm tryna get lost

Just space and opportunity between us
You ain't expect me to make that, make that thang bounce

[Intro: DJ Drama]
And like that
Haha, we gone

Even though you're fine as fuck
We're just making matters worse
Go from us kissing to you burning my stuff
What you wanna break shit for? Did you buy this? No
Girl, what the hell you think this is?
I think you really need to stop this shit
'Cause I'm not gon' have it, it was fun while it lasted
But this ain't love, no

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
No, no, this ain't love, love, no
Every night, fuss and fight, something ain't right
With us, girl, 'cause we rushed this love
And neither one of us can blame the other
So maybe we should say goodbye
We can make this kiss the last kiss goodnight, tonight
So maybe we should say goodbye
Go our separate way-y-ys, call it quits

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
We gotta stop this thing between us
Girl, you're 'bout to make me cuss you out
Kick you up out my house
Here’s your clothes, there’s a door
And go, shawty, on your birthday
Now my shawty number two gon' be in first place
You're the main chick
'Cause I'm not gon' have it, it was fun while it lasted (Babey Drew, turn it up)
Girl, you gotta go

Just like tha-a-a-a-at (Just like that, oh-oh)
Just like that (Just like that, woah, oh-oh)
All my ladies (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Just like that

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Just like that, just like this
Whatever it is, shawty, you got it
Like a game of tag, shawty, you got it
And shawty got ass, that you can't miss
She the shit, lighters up or just put up your cellphone
Dark skin girls turn me on, so do redbones
Racin' to the V.I.P., lookin' like a marathon
Too many bottles left over, guess I'ma carry home
By the end, I'ma turn it up
And all the niggas smokin', tell 'em burn it up
She got me pimped against the wall
She 'bout to make it stand up
I'ma put my motherfuckin' hands up (Oh-oh)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]
Put your hands in the air (Put your hands in the air)
If you wanna freak somethin' down tonight (Oh)
P-P-P-Put your hands in the air (Oh-woah)
All my ladies, ladies, ladies (Oh-woah)
Do it just like that (Just like that, oh-oh)
Just like tha-a-a-a-at (Oh, oh-oh)
Just like that (Oh, oh-oh)
All my ladies (Oh-oh)
Just like that

[Outro: DJ Drama]
You know what?
We so in our zone
There's nothin' more to do, man
I might quit after this
And like that, hahaha
We gone
My casket needs to be 100% rose gold-plated
I wanna be in my ripped Levis jeans
And my Incesticide Nirvana t-shirt with my Converse
Don't cut my hair
No matter what, keep the casket closed
Send my body to space to be buried on the moon
Or sent through a wormhole with all my music
And my story on a jump drive, if possible
Upon my death, all rivalries are deaded
Dance and celebrate, no sadness
Let my fans have a seperate funeral for me
So my family can mourn privately
Cremation if there's barely anything left of me
Or else dig up my dad's body and bury us together
Whenever my mom sees fit
Funeral must be 

[redacted]
You and me we're both the same
In this life a lonely game
I used to be a happy man
And now I understand just what it's all about
I never had a doubt on the chance of love

As a boy I lived down here
I always saw you near
To be together was happiness
And I just can't forget the moment we first kissed
I'd like to try again on the chance of love

Yeah, on the chance of love
I'll do anything to get you by my side
On the sound of love I will love you girl
You'll be mine

All the world would then be free
An apple falls from an apple tree
You and I will be together
And you will understand when I take your hand
I'll open up the door to the chance of love
I could be king of kings, wear a crown and all the things
I'd want I'd never need
I'd be an ace in an aeroplane
And every year, I'd fly to Spain
If I could get the nerve to plant the seed

Oh, help me how to say goodbye
I see her face in myself
Why, tell me why I made her cry
If only had my mind on something else

Captain of the submarine
Beneath the icebergs never seen
A hero with a medal for everyday
I find me fame, reach the top
I keep on pushing never stop
If I could just forget her name

Oh, help me how to say goodbye
I see her face in myself
Why, tell me why I made her cry
If only had my mind on something else
If only had my mind on something else
What would I say if you should turn away from me
I do not know if there are words that I can see
I only know that I am reaching too high
And who are we to touch the wind
And say our ship is coming in
The turning tide

Tell me the answer in your changing mind, changing mind
I don't know if love can last

When time is gone and we are on the roundabout
Would you still laugh and be a clown when love runs out
Or will you say that I am reaching too high
And who are we to touch the wind
And say our ship is coming in
The turning tide

And who are we to touch the the wind
And say our ship is coming in
The turning tide
I never ask for any time from you baby
I never ask for any lies
You only hurt the one you love the most baby
You only had to make me cry

Cause you left me (you left me) all alone (you left me)
You left me(you left me) to stand alone

And every night I sit beside my bed baby
And I keep thinking of your love
The things we dreamed about
How much I love you baby
We had the world and the stars above

But then you left me (you left me) all alone.(you left me)
You left me . You left me (you left me) to stand alone
You left me to stand alone
You left me to stand alone
You left me. You left me. You left me. You left me
When I was young
We walked to school
And I carried your books
'cause even then I was a fool
But you grew up and said goodbye
I still remember the things that made me cry

For all too soon
My story ends
I found a love
Now not even friends
Why loving you
Loving me like you used to do
I was the child

I held your hand and I told you things
And I made you believe
Believe in fairy tales
And diamond rings

Then all too soon my story ends
I found a love now not even friends
Tell me why loving you
Loving me like you used to do
I was the child
Only last night when your arms held me tight
You told me you thought our love could last forever, forever
I was the one that gave you all my love when I thought
That our love could last forever, forever

I lay down and die
The whole world joins in
And everyone cries
As teardrops begin

I lay down and die

And when darkness falls
Can't see nothing at all

I lay down and die
The whole world joins in
I lay down and die
The teardrops begin

I lay down and die
And die
And die
I lay down and die
The whole world joins in
I lay down and die
And the teardrops begin

I lay down and die
And I lay down and die
If your heart tells you so that you should leave me
Don't try to forget , you and I never met
And before you fly, one kiss should tell me why
You've forgotten all the words that you once said

Long as I've got you there beside me
Long as you're there to stand and guide me
The love we share no one can ever tear apart
Long as I've got this life I'm living
Long as it's you the love I'm with then
I'll keep on calling you sweetheart

If my love for you can't make you happy
Just open the door and you won't see my anymore
And before you fly , one kiss should tell me why
You've forgotten all the words that you once said
When you said

Long as I've got you there beside me
Long as you're there to stand and guide me
The love we share no one could ever tear apart
Long as I've got this life I'm living
Long as it's you the love I'm with then
I'll keep on calling you sweetheart
And I'll keep on calling you sweetheart
I wasn't born in the morning, no
I must have been born in the night
I've done my load and I'll carry my load
And all I own is my knife

I wasn't born to be lucky
'Cause luck had no future with me
I've done my wrong and I'll sing, sing, sing my song
And stand beneath the hanging tree

Bury me down by the river
Let all the towns people see
Their enemy's dead, let me lay, lay my head
Just put me down and set me free

I wasn't born as a rich man, no
A rich man I never, I never could be
I've done my wrong and I'll sing, sing, sing my song
And stand beneath the hanging tree
Everybody sing now
Bury me down by the river, Lord no
Let all the towns people see, see
Their enemy's dead, let me lay, lay, lay my head
Just put me down and set me free
I want to hear everybody sing

Bury me down by the river
Let all the towns, let all the towns people see
Their enemy's dead, let me lay, let met lay, let me lay my head along
Just put me down and set me free

[Intro]
Girl I know you wanna, you know I wanna
Yeah, she keep giving me looks
Hotter than the 6 in the summer, deadass, girl I wanna

[Verse 1]
Girl I know you wanna
You know I wanna
Yeah, she keep giving me looks
Yeah, girl I know you wanna
She's a spice, ride pipe like bike, like Yokohama
She heard the ting bend like banana
So she wanna give me the adunana-ne, ohh

[Pre-Chorus]
She say I'm a sweeterman
But she say that she don't need a man
I say why don't we make an agreement then
We can just fuck while we're being friends

[Chorus]
Girl, I know you wanna
You know I wanna
Girl, I know you wanna
You know I wanna

[Verse 2]
Shawty too fly though, that's all I know
She don't sing songs, but if I go strong she gon' hit this high note
She know she working with the nana
And she wanna give me the adunana-ne, ohh

[Pre-Chorus]
She say I'm a sweeterman
But she say that she don't need a man
What if we make an agreement then
We can just fuck while we're being friends

[Chorus]
Girl, I know you wanna
I know you wanna
Girl, I know you wanna
I know you want to girl

[Verse 3]
Ride the pipe like a bike, oh
Do the things you know I like, oh
I'm the man in my ends, oh
You're the one, let's not pretend

[Bridge]
'Cause the pussy too good, drink too strong
Yiy too change, I'm too sprung, I, I, I
The pussy too good, drink too strong
Yiy too change, I'm so gone, I, I, I

[Chorus]
Girl, I know you wanna
I know you wanna
Girl, I know you wanna
I know you want to girl
Girl, I know you wanna
I know you want to girl
Girl, I know you wanna, I, I, I

[Verse 4]
Yeah
She keep giving me looks (oh-oh-oh)
She keep giving me looks (oh-oh-oh)
She keep giving me looks
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I need you right here beside me
If you oblige me, I'll hang it up, and I'll never come out of retirement
You should just sleep on it, you shouldn't doubt me
It would be different without me
What is it without me
Don't go do nothing without me
This is a blessing, mashallah, wallahi
I swear my life stories better than stories they tellin' 'bout me
They got it twisted
Ride the pipe like a bike, make sure you're going the distance
And if he wasn't with it, then why were you with him?
Maybe you just had to realize
That  knowing the difference can make all the difference
She wanna run me that adanunana
Yeah she keep giving me looks
I ate it all
Plastic diamonds and sugar coated arsenic
We danced in honey and sea salt sprinkled laxative
Coral blossomed portraits in Rembrandt light
Cheekbones high and fashionable
Snap! goes the moment
A photograph is time travel
Like the light of dead stars painting us with their warm titanic blood
Parasitic kaleidoscopes and psychotropic glow worms stop me in my tracks
Aphids sucking the red off a rose
But for beauty I will gladly feed my life
In the mouths of rainbows
Their technicolor teeth cutting prisms and smiling benevolently
On the pallid hue of the
Working class hero
Lyrics from snippet

[Travis Scott & Meek Mill]
... I'ma smoke to solve my issues
One thing about me: I'ma stay ballin' on niggas (Woo)
And none of these niggas
These niggas can't tell me shit (Straight up)
And none of these niggas
These niggas can't tell me shit (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Here we are
In a room full of strangers
Standing in the dark
Where your eyes couldn't see me

[Pre-Chorus: Robin Gibb]
Well, I had to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my loving you
I can't stay away

[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them "straight to the heart" songs
Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
Now in my place
There are so many others
Standin' in the line
How long will they stand between us

[Pre-Chorus: Robin Gibb]
Well, I had to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my loving you
I can't stay away

[Chorus Variation: Barry Gibb (falsetto)]
Blamin' it all (blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them "straight to the heart" songs
Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town (oh those nights)

[Bridge: Barry Gibb]
I will wait
Even if it takes forever
I will wait
Even if it takes a lifetime
Somehow I feel inside
You never-ever left my side
Make it like it was before
Even if it takes a lifetime, takes a lifetime, ooh

[Chorus: Barry Gibb (falsetto)]
Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them love songs (yeah, yeah)
Singin' them "straight to the heart" songs
Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them sweet sounds (oh yeah yeah)
To that crazy, crazy town (yeah)

[Outro]
Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)
Singin' them love songs (yeah, yeah)
Singin' them "straight to the heart" songs
Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)
On the nights on Broadway
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town
In the streets of New York City
Every man can feel the cold
And I don't want no pity
But I want my story told

And the lights shine down on me
They shine on the little boy
Is this way to make him pay
Being born in a world of joy?

But like me, he don't know where he'll go wrong
He won't cry so many tears
Till he finds out why he don't belong

Like me, there's no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
You'll get your share

Sometimes a man breaks down
And the good things he is looking for
Are crushed into the ground
Get on up, look around
Can't you feel the wind of change?
Get on up, taste the air
Can't you see the wind of change?

Don't you understand what I'm saying?
We need a god down here
A man to lead us children
Take us from the valley of fear

Make the lights shine down on us
Show us the road to go
Help us survive, make us arrive
Teach us what we need to know

Like me, he don't know where he'll go wrong
He won't cry so many tears
Till he finds out why he don't belong

Like me, there's no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
You'll get your share

Sometimes a man breaks down, down, down down, down
And the good things he is searching for
Are crushed into the ground
Get on up, look around
Can't you feel the wind of change?
Get on up, taste the air
Can't you see the wind of change?
Get on up, look around
Can't you feel the wind of change?
Get on up, taste the air
Can't you see the wind of change?
Get on up, look around
Can't you feel the wind of change?
Get on up, taste the air
Can't you see the wind of change?
First I rise, then I fall
Seems like you don't want the love
Of this man at all
And it's sure been a lonely time
Right up to the time I met you
So if you take a love like mine

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me

So you say to yourself, boy
You're out of your brain
Do you think I'm gonna stand here
All night in the rain?
And it's the start of a love affair
The moment when I first met you
And if you want I'll take you there
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me

With my love
Our love will seal it together
Oh, with our love
You made a promise
You'll always love me forever

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny, be tender with my love
So, warm is my morning sun, red is my rainbow
Soft is the cool summer breeze when I saw your face
I saw the light in your eyes so dark and demanding
Like a light in the storm

Whenever I cry my friend
You're always away and so I pretend
If I could live the dreams that I see
Long live my love

Walking in country lanes
I'll never belong to someone again
Living my whole life through
Long live my love for you

My life has meaning now, I am a window
And all things seem clear to me now
Like a light in the storm

Whenever I cry my friend
You're always away and so I pretend
If I could live the dreams that I see
Long live my love
Walking in country lanes
I'll never belong to someone again
Living my whole life through
Long live my love

Walking in country lanes
I'll never belong to someone again
Living my whole life through
Long live my love for you
Just my dog and I
At the edge of the universe
Well, I didn't want to bring her
And I know it'll make her worse

Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there
And they call me Shenandora in the air

Well, I'm ten feet tall
But I'm only three feet wide
And I live inside an ocean that flows
On the other side

If I came back down tomorrow
Would it all be far too soon?
And it looks like it's gonna be a lovely afternoon

I thought that I was going home
And all the way I kept on praying
I couldn't stop to turn around;
Well, here I am and here I'm staying
It's been my longest journey
And I've come through the black of night
I was tired and hungry
When I saw your distant light

Well, I know this may sound crazy
But I'm sure I got here first
I'm just me, Shenandora
At the edge of the universe

I thought that I was going home
And all the way I kept on praying
I couldn't stop to turn around;
Well, here I am and here I'm staying

Just my dog and I
At the edge of the universe
Well, I didn't want to bring her
And I know it'll make her worse

Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there
And they call me Shenandora in the air

At the edge of the universe...
Here am I one sad and lonely guy
One shadow of the man I used to be

Now it's past, the love I thought would last
You thought I had you chained
And now you're free

I know it's wrong but I'm still holding on
Still praying you will soon come back to me

But then you go, you let your feelings show
You said I gave you pain, and now I see

But baby, as you turn away
I will always think of what we had together

Baby, this is just your way of breaking my heart

And it's easier to say goodbye
Making me fall, making me try, try to make
You stay as you turn away
Now you're gone, this road I walk upon is just
Another place where I can hide

I'm still your man
There's proof of who I am
Except without your love I'm dead inside

But baby, as you turn away
I will always think of what we had together

Baby, this is just your way of breaking my heart

And it's easier to say goodbye
Making me fall, watching me try, try to make
You stay as you turn away

[Chorus]
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh so

[Verse 1]
Before you came my way
I always stepped aside
So afraid of love
And so alone inside
I never thought that I'd
Believe in love so much
But darling, when you came close to me
Suddenly, suddenly

[Chorus]
You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
I'm crazy 'bout you, girl

[Chorus]
You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so

[Verse 2]
You will never know
What you have done, my love
You gave me so much more
Than my love is worthy of
Deep in my very soul
I'm living for your touch
Your touch is ecstasy
Close to me
Suddenly, suddenly

[Chorus]
You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life (You stepped)
(You stepped)

[Outro]
I feel your arms around me, girl (You stepped)
(You stepped) Aside
(You stepped)
(You stepped)
Know what you've done to me
(You stepped)
(You stepped)
(You stepped)
(You stepped)

[Verse 1]
She came on like the night
And she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
We were free
She moved in like a friend
Started loving me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Now I'm hanging on
Maybe you can tell me

[Chorus]
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong
Oh, my darling (Oh, my darling)
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong

[Verse 2]
Where did she go
When I need her close to me?
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever
And you came to break my heart
Now I'm hanging on
On the chance that you'll come back to me, oh, my love

[Chorus]
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong (So wrong)
Oh, my darling (Oh, my darling)
How a love so right (A love so)
Can turn out to be so wrong (So wrong)
Oh, my darling

[Bridge]
I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes
And break it down to size
It isn't really fair

[Chorus]
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong (So wrong)
Oh, my darling
How a love so right (Love so right)
Can turn out to be so wrong (So wrong)
Oh, my darling
How a love so right (How a love, a love so right)
Can turn out to be so wrong
Oh, my darling
How a love so right (How a love so right)
Can turn out to be so wrong (Can turn out, turn out to be so wrong, so wrong)
Oh, my darling (So wrong)
How a love so right (How a love so right)
Can turn out to be so wrong (Can turn out, to be so, be so wrong, turn out to be so wrong)
Oh, my darling
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so
I cry tears of emotion
To spread across the U.S.A
Ain't no sunshine cowboy
In your pockets
I'll make my own way while I play

Baby you forgot your living
Someone covered up your eyes
In my way at least I'm giving
What I love, am I wise?

There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes
And you'll look to the skies
And you'll pray, while I play

I am my father's son
Or that is what I heard
Maybe I got it wrong
I didn't mean a word
You got my face and I'll play your ace
Pretend I haven't heard
There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes
And look to the skies
And you'll pray, oh while I play

I am a minstrel
That is all I want to be
I'll play inside your soul
I'll show you to yourself
I'll fill your head with wild emotions
A symphony in wealth

There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes
And look to the skies
And you'll pray, while I play

I will take my leave
I gotta move on time
I played inside your soul
I made you sing along
I will return to find out if the melody was wrong

There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes
And look to the skies
And you'll pray, while I play, while I play
I'm full of pride and my heart feels good
Got news from my family up in the woods
At last I can go back where I belong
Sweated it all out for nine long years
Couldn't believe the voice in my ears
When the man saying "No hiding, son"

So I left the only folks I had known
I was fifteen then, hardly grown
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far
Said to myself stay right where you are
Done found yourself a Ma and Pa
Everybody said the kid's no good

Come home Johnny Bridie come home
Johnny Bridie come home
We're all wrong without you
How did we ever doubt you
He confessed to the killing
It's his role we had you filling
We didn't really mean to make you sad
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad
I left the only folks I had known
I was fifteen then , hardly grown
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far
Said to myself stay right where you are
Done found yourself a Ma and Pa
Everybody said the kid's no good

Come Home Johnny Bridie come home
Johnny Bridie come home
We're all wrong without you
How did we ever doubt you
He confessed to the killing
It's his role we had you filling
We didn't really mean to make you sad
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad
I played the game, still it's not worth it
Like a woman in the rain
I close my eyes
I'm on the shelf
I know myself

I've seen the lights of every city
Tried to work out where I am
I close my mind for the day
I know the way

I played the game, still it's not worth it
Like a woman in the rain
So I close my eyes I'm on the shelf
I know myself

There's never ever anybody to rely on
There isn't time to count the shoulders I have cried on
That's just circumstances, I must take my chances
But, baby you don't know what I'm saying
But I guess that's not true, and you know that's true
But there's a method to my madness
I played the game, still it's not worth it
Like a woman in the rain
So I close my eyes for the day
And all the way

[Verse 1]
You're crossing the water for eastern delights
Cause now that you're gone
I feel like a stranger in New York tonight

[Hook]
And the rhythm was new to me
Tokyo nights
Well, she came in the night and she came in the night
And the vision was true to me
Tokyo nights
Well, she came for the moment and stayed till the end

[Chorus]
Ooh wee ah, take me to Tokyo (x2)

[Hook - Var. 1]
I was lonely in western days
Tokyo nights
Well, she took me away by saving my life
I was down in the rising sun
Tokyo nights
Well, I came for the moment and stayed till the end

[Chorus]
Ooh wee ah, take me to Tokyo (x2)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1 - Var. 1]
Crossing the water for eastern delights
Cause now that you're gone
I feel like a stranger in New York tonight

[Outro]
I am calling you, take me to Tokyo
Ooh wee ah, take me to Tokyo
Ooh wee ah, take me to Tokyo
Ooh wee ah, take me to Tokyo

Ooh wee ah, take me to Tokyo (x4)
When I was 10 years old
My parents were poor
Our house was so cold
And I was still in school and learning

And then I never really got too far
And everyone we knew had money
And driving a car and driving a car

Now I'm twenty-one
The street where I lived
Is blown up and gone
And I've had a good day crying

And the world around has changed a lot
I never really gave much more
Much more then I got
Much more then I got
If you think that you can hurt me and make me cry
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
And if you think that you can hurt me with lies that cry
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

Now I've got my reasons for feeling this way
Day after day and as nights go by

So, if you think my heart is broken and I might die
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

All of the world is as lonely as me
Day after day and as nights go by

So if you think my heart is broken and I might die
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

[Verse 1]
You've had your troubles Israel
I've seen them all
But you put the writing on the wall
Israel, Israel

[Verse 2]
You know I've seen you fall so many times
I've cried for you and that's a crime
Israel, Israel, Israel

[Chorus]
Where there's sand
Where there's beautiful sand
You know you got a kind of feeling
That's just grand
Take me into your arms
Let me be with you
Israel, Israel, Israel

[Verse 3]
I like the smiles up on your people's faces
They make you feel warm embraces
And I want that kind of smile
That kind of smile
Israel you make the whole world think about you
And if they don't they'll find a reason
To shout about Israel, Israel

[Verse 4]
You're the only one, Israel, Israel
Tell me all about it!
Tell me all about it
Tell me all about it
Oh, take me into your arms
And make me feel your goodness
Be with me Israel
Take me into your arms
Let me hold hold you to myself
Oh, I want to, Israel

[Outro]
Israel, take me back into into your arms
Israel, Israel, Israel, Israel
Israel
Before I heard your voice
I never heard a sound like that before
I wanna hear it more and more

Take me to heaven
My love is stronger than the wall
I'll climb it till I fall
So I can hear you call, your love

I'd be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I got the greatest girl
I'd be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I got the greatest girl

Before I saw your face
I never saw a dream like that before
I wanna see it more and more

Take me to heaven
My love is stronger than the wall
I'll climb it till I fall
So I can hear you call, your love
Be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I've got the greatest girl
Be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I got the greatest girl
The greatest girl

Be the greatest man in the world
Oh, be the greatest man in the world
Be the greatest man, the greatest man in the world
The greatest man, be the greatest man in the world
Just the way that I feel about tomorrow
I'll be sad and alone all the time
It's just the way that you said
You don't love me anymore, then goodbye

I can't believe what you're saying
You don't love me anymore, goodbye

Just the way that I feel about tomorrow
Knowing you won't be there by my side
I wish that I could say to you
Well, can't we just be good friends?

Would you leave the door open
Let me walk in again?

That's the way I've been thinking 'bout tomorrow
I only know that friends can't be lovers again
I never really want to be alone
I had a woman once in my life
But now she's flown
Every night I keep seeing her face

I never really broke her heart
She was a part of me
But that's the way it was
Now we live separately
When will you walk through this door babe?
When you left I fell to pieces but now I feel as good as if I were dead

I'll keep remembering all my life
Remembering when you were my wife
Remembering all my life
And I'm facing a life that I must go through remembering

I first set my eyes on you one cold February
You made me go out of my way to make me feel fine
Oh, but when will you walk through this door babe?
When you left I fell to pieces, now I feel as good, as good as if I were dead
I'll keep remembering all my life
Remembering when you were my wife
Remembering all my life
And I'm facing a life that I must go through remembering
I arise, try to see my face through my disguise
And on the balcony I knew inside of me it will be done
Somebody stop the music, somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon
Somebody stop the music, somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon

I arose, the truth will out the more it grows
It's not a mystery, no one was hiding it from me
Somebody stop the music, somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon
Somebody stop the music, somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon

Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya

Yeah, today I saw the sun, the sun
I hear you calling me dearest too
My dearest, I'm nearest, then I've ever been before
To have you calling me dearest once more

My dearest, this picture
My own memory
Wishing this picture was reality

Where do I go from here? The Lord took you away
And if you could see my today, I will remember you
I will remember you

My dearest, sincerest
There's no one but you and
Here in my heart you're my dearest too

Where do I go from here? The Lord took you away
And if you could see me today, I will remember you
I will remember you

My dearest, sincerest
There's no one but you and
Here in my heart you're my dearest too

[Verse 1]
I am the searcher of my fortunes
I've got my right hand on the wheel
We've got to dig the buried treasures
I know, exactly how I feel

[Chorus]
Don't want to live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
But then you must believe
In the falling rain

[Refrain]
Don't wanna live inside myself
Don't wanna live inside myself
Don't wanna live inside myself

[Verse 2]
I went walking through a graveyard
Where the darkness is my friend
I heard all about the beginning
I wanna see just where it ends

[Chorus]

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
I have fed the jaded tiger
And every tiger knows my name
But just as long, as long as I can see my face
I can tell myself my name

[Chorus]

[Refrain / Coda] repeat x3

[Verse 1]
To sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean
To ride on the crest of the wild raging storm
To work in the service of life and the living
In search of the answers to questions unknown
To be part of the movement and part of the growing
Part of beginning to understand

[Chorus]
Aye, Calypso, the places you've been to
The things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit
The men who have served you so long and so well

[Post-Chorus]

[Yodel]

[Verse 2]
Like the dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you
To light up the darkness and show us the way
For though we are strangers in your silent world
To live on the land we must learn from the sea
To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell
Joyful and loving in letting it be

[Chorus]
Aye, Calypso, the places you've been to
The things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit
The men who have served you so long and so well
Aye, Calypso, the places you've been to
The things that you've shown us, the stories you tell
Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit
The men who have served you so long and so well

[Post-Chorus]

[Yodel]
You build me up, you let me down
How can I love, you give me no ground
To be or not to be, to be or not to be
Am I gonna have you for me?

One little light I saw before
The light in your eyes, I don't see no more
To be or not to be, to be or not to be
Am I gonna have you for me, well?

Give me a chance, make up your mind
Give me romance, tell me you're mine
To be or not to be, well, to be or not to be
Am I gonna have you for me, well?

Well, to be or not to be
Well, to be or not to be
To be or not to be
Am gonna have you for me?

Well, to be or not to be
Well, to be or not to be
To be or not to be
Am gonna have you for me?
Well, to be or not to be
Well, to be or not to be
To be or not to be
Am gonna have you for me?

[Outro: Chris Brown, Tyga]
Yo, all the fans, Fan of a Fan
That strictly means we're the fan of, the fans of you guys
So we want you to know that we love y'all
And thank you for all the support and we gon' keep rocking, man
Check out Tyga projects coming out, my projects
We gon' get it popping for the streets, like I always say
And uh, my number ones, the ladies
Thank y'all for being so supportive too, man
'Cause you know without y'all, we nothing
Yeah, before we go, we gotta do this, ah!
That's it, cut that real quick

[Verse 1]
Watching the garden grow, happy, happy days
Got egg yolk on my bed, Chinese food on the way
Watching the garden grow, straight into the sky
Got a candle by my window, it keeps me warm at night

[Chorus 1]
Spending time together
Watch out, don't let it get you down
Nothing is forever
That's right, but don't let it get you down

[Bridge]
And I'm sitting in the back of a limousine
Just going to a show
Wishing you were here right next to me
Oh, but you already know

[Chorus 2]
That I'm the one who loves you
Watch out, don't let it get you down
And there will be no other
That's right, but don't let it get you down
Oh yeah, making breakfast

[Verse 2]
Watching the garden grow, such a beautiful day
It's raining through the window but I like it that way
Watching the garden grow, the color of your eyes
Is changing with the season and God only knows why

[Chorus 1]
Spending time together
Watch out, don't let it get you down
Nothing is forever
That's right, but don't let it get you down
Oh yeah, making breakfast

[Verse 1]
Oh it's you I know, you're the one I dream of
Look into my eyes, take me to the clouds above
Oh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love?

[Chorus]
How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things

How will I know if you're thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy, can't speak
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

[Verse 2]
Oh wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love

[Pre-Chorus]
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?

[Chorus]
How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things

How will I know if you're thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy, can't speak
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

[Outro]
If you love me
If you love me, nod
If you love me
If you love me, nod

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yo, waddup this is Kanye and you're checking out Big Sean, Finally Famous: Volume 1
It's crazy though how I met him, you know
I'm leaving the radio station and he comes up to me like "Yo, I just wanna spit for you"
And I say "Okay, you got 16" and he went and spit about 100 bars and I looked at him
And I said "That shit was crazy, I'mma sign you"
I know I'd just seen pretty like unbelievable, the stories we always hear about
But when I heard the songs he was doing, man I knew he had to be on GOOD Music
So man, congratulations dawg, you're finally famous

[Intro]

[Pre-Hook]

Not to sound conceited
But when you see what my bank receipts is
You gon' want to be on top of my sheets like lines to loose leaf
I'm on my green like vegans, that's vegetarian
I see you staring at the new V, Hiccup
Pockets got a sixth sense, all they see is dead people
Mhmm I pay the haters no mind
'Cause I never knew they name
But I know they know mine
Ask any bad broad bet I know she knows Sean
GOOD Music bitch, I know you know Kan-Ye
Yup, he's the reason that I'm paid
One look at you will make me thank God that I'm made
The girls that call me ugly is the ones who wanna love me
So now I let 'em love me, when I'm done I call 'em ugly, yes
If money stinks I admit I'm pretty musky
Eatin' till I'm chubby boy

[Pre-Hook]
I walk around laughing but there ain’t shit funny
Damn it feel good to be that nigga gettin’ money
While y’all ain’t gettin’ nothing, I’m still gettin’ money

[Intro]
What’s next man?
Big Shan I see you, we made it

It’s good music baby, still finalizing it
It’s all good, it’s been Finally Famous

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
You know me, a few hundred for the tee on
Same for the jean on, shit you don’t be on
Man I ain’t Celine, but I’m finna put the D on
Went from doing talent shows to a colosseum
I’m on deck like a shipwreck, damn
Man I get big checks like my nights with six X
That’s high sixty
And I’m busy like bone thugs with more buzz
Than four cups, that’s mo’d up and showing up
They talking ish again, you too?
Man I was on the road with bands like U2
Other side of the globe with the flow doing shows
Man I could give a damn about niggas on YouTube
(And that’s real)
And I’m from the hood around the boulevard
Funny now ‘cause I’m on Hollywood boulevard
So when I drive by, there’s camera’s shooting at a nigga
Call it Hollywood’s drive by

[Hook: Big Sean + (Big Shan)]
I got the D on lock man
Streets gon’ watch man, man, man
(It’s funny how the take 

[?])
I got a few stacks in the knock
Can’t fit ‘em in the sock like, like, like
(It’s crazy how I’m paid for this)
And the girl’s come with dollars now
(Big Sean what up though)
So they all follow now, now, now
(Watch them hoes chase the G)
I’m the man with the facts
You can check the stacks
(We made it, finally famous)
Look, look, look
(Hater’s blocking but I make my hits)

[Verse 2: Big Shan]
You know me, you know how I do
Mink on the coat, alligator on them shoes
Buffalo tux, Cartier with the jewels
But enough about me, homie what about you?
You ain’t gotta adore me
But you’ll surely, T-C-E-P-S-E-R me
Spell it backwards since you try to reflect me
Try to be me in the mirror
You’re reminded, respect me
And if you got a handkerchief
Go and get it out dude
Money talks, and I’m talking with my mouth full
Uh, so excuse me for spitting
I got the Gucci grip so you won’t catch me slipping
I got a dumb swag but I’m rather intelligent, hmm
I went to college just for the hell of it
I came in, took a look, then I took it over
I barely went to class
And when I did, it was over
I was coming just for the hoes anyway

[Hook: Big Sean + (Big Shan)]
I got the D on lock man
Streets gon’ watch man, man, man

[?])

So if you putting out, baby girl get in
Lost in the whip, get lost in the crib

In order for us to make this thing work, man
We've got to get rid of the pimps, and the pushers, and the prostitutes?)

Ba-ha-ha-ha...
Yes, yes, y'all

[ Cool J + Marley Marl]
Ah, ah
Cool J: That's funky

Marley Marl: Yeah

J: Hey yo, Marley, man

Marl: Yo, what's up, man?

J: Hey yo, man
You know
We was gettin busy on the album everyday
We been gettin funky, but
I wanna take this jam back to Farmers
Knowmsayin?
Marl: Yo, let's go back on Farmers
And get some of them early MC's
You used to be kickin it with back in the day?

J: Yeah, yeah, yeah

Marl: Yo, let's do a jam with them

J: Aight, bet
But first I gotta like introduce it
Youknowmsayin?

Marl: Aight, kick it...

(Farmers Boulevard)

[ Verse: L.L. Cool J]
Back in the days, before I was Cool J
I used to hang up on the corner, pumpin' games people play
Sittin' on a garbage can, rhymin' to my man
Talkin' bout big money and future plans
I always told the brothers, if I got a contract
When the money started flowin', I'd be back
To do a jam, against all odds
Introducing rapper 1 from Farmers Boulevard

[Verse: Bomb ]
Hey yo, B-o-m-b, bomb explosion
Attack like a cat when I'm trapped and I'm closed in
Sharp-ass claws, and I break all laws
In a while all jaws, cause I'm perfect, no flaws
Now I'm back to Farmers on some new improved
(Sh...) I'm makin moves, not fakin moves
So don't you never come around here, talkin that talk
Or walkin that walk, you'll get played like a sport
Football, soccer, whatever you savor
You're a tramp and a pussycat, ready for labor
Ha! L'll have you breakin' locks
I'll have you cookin fried rice in a big steel box
The type of skills that I got reigned for years
No worry or cares, your crew'll shed tears
'Hip-hip-hooray, he's back!' Yo, save the cheers
Suckers, I'm drinkin forties of beers
On the Boulevard

[ Cool J + Marley Marl]
Cool J: Funky, funky, funky rhymes bein' said here

Marl: Hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo Uncle L, let's go...

J: Yeah man, I wanna check out my man Big Money Grip
Yo, what's up, man
Kick a little somethin'

[Verse: Big Money Grip ]
Kick out the can and slam
Summertime, C.I.A. step into the jam
Reach for the mic, and the punks start to fold up
And the brothers start fleein' like it's a hold-up
Some step aside, but a few play me close
Never worry, cause the brother who cross me's gettin buried
And the fool who wants to deal with another dose
I see to it in a hour that the mutha...'s comatose
Farmers Boulevard, the place
Handin me a mic is like givin' a chainsaw to Leatherface
Smokin MC's in an instant
At my side bustin caps is T-Boogie, my assistant
Throw that speaker in the trash
Why's that? Cause Gangster Boogie gave the woofer a gash
Big Money Grip makin you get up
Farmers Crew's in effect, we never heard of a head-up

[Cool J + Marley Marl ]
Yo, yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here on the boulevard, yo

Cool J: Yeah, we livin' Chinese people in a Turkish bath, baby
Marl: Hi C over there, man
J: Yo, what's up Hi C...

[Verse: Hi C ]
Hi C on the scene, at last to bust a funky rhyme
More than a line on time, because I'm gettin' mine
Never underestimate the skill of a great one
The Boulevard Lord, shorts, never take none
Another funky rapper from around the way
Leavin' bodies at a party, cause somebody gotta pay
Boy, you been told, put your lips on hold
All you remember is a barrel and a mouth full of gold
Spreadin' terror on the street like they was in the past
Any punks on the block, yo, never could last
And I never feel sorry for a sucker I gained on
Any slick talker, yo, he's bound to get rained on
At any Farmers party at my side is a Mag
(One time a sucker got ill and went out in a bodybag)
Fear will erupt through the heart of another
The Farmers Crew will never fall, that's word to the mother

[ Cool J + Marley Marl ]
Yo, yo
It's kinda funky out here
Yo, yo, yo, Hi C
Yo man, y'all kinda funky out here, yo
I was -
Yo, what's up?
Nine years ago, man
Youknowmsayin?

Cool J: Farmers Boulevard, baby

Marley Marl: Yo, I was kinda -
I was kinda stagnant to sleep on it
But yo, L
Won't you - won't you sum it all up for the people, aight?

J: Aight, let me sum this up

[Verse: L.L. Cool J ]
Now you heard the brothers speakin 'bout the street that we're from
Rhymes hittin', beats kickin', you can't get none
F-A-R-M-E-R-S passin' the test
Marley Marl in the background doin the rest
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, do-ti-la-so-fa-mi-re-do, Kato
Get up out my face before I play you like Play-Doh
I did a jam against all odds
And it was dedicated to Farmers Boulevard
(Farmers Boulevard)
Keep on
(Farmers Boulevard)
To the beat, y'all
A funky beat, y'all
Yes, yes, y'all
You don't stop
Intro]
(Big Sean baby, holla at your boy)
(It’s your boy, come and give me)

[Verse 1]
Man I remember days I used to get up
Praying like a bishop that this music stuff would pick up
I always tried to haul my own load like a pickup
No ordinary nigga
And if you work harder then success will come quicker
But make sure you don't take it to the head like liquor
Aim for the stars, I’m shooting for the bigger dipper
Nights I used to sit up
Man I could feel the hunger in my stomach like sit-ups
Now I’m eating to the point that a nigga got the hiccups
I get up like, damn
I see the sun shine through the dust clouds
We bought our own cars, no more taking the bus now
And it ain’t bust a broad or hoes that we bust down
You should probably see the model chicks that we bust now
And we don’t chase them ‘cause they wanna chase us now
All my ex-dames say they wanna make up now
Take ‘em to the room and they wanna rape us now
Damn

[Pre-Hook]
(We’ll never forget)
We never will, we never will
(The love that you showed)

(We’ll never forget)
We never will, we never will
(The love that you showed)

[Hook]
Man I went through the cold nights
(We’ll never forget)
The wrongs and rights
(The love that you showed)
But I woulda did it twice for the hoes and the highs
(We’ll never forget)
The fights, the struggle on the grind, the hustle
(The love that you showed)
But I woulda did it twice for the shows and the lights

[Verse 2]
Man my city a hell hole like we like with Satan
Tried to make it to Penn State, they throw us in state pen
I’m saying from the rim of the capitol
Concrete jungle where they hunt you like animals
Cut you in half like the sandwich and abandon you
You gon’ need a bit more than a bandaid to bandage you
Damn it dude
And if you turn your back they might stab you in the kidneys
Really niggas known to keep the peace a hippy
But now I tend to spread my wealth around like Jiffy
And the hoes that used to diss me is the ones who wanna kiss me
The ones who wanna kiss me is the ones who wanna quickie
They see I ball hard now, all nine innings
I feel like I made it to the top of the mountain
Rocking designer shit that you don’t be pronouncing
Pissing in fountains
Getting money to the point I need an accountant
Just to count it, yeah

[Pre-Hook]
(We’ll never forget)
We never will, we never will
(The love that you showed)

(We’ll never forget)
We never will, we never will
(The love that you showed)

[Hook]
Man I went through the cold nights
(We’ll never forget)
The wrongs and rights
(The love that you showed)
But I woulda did it twice for the hoes and the highs
(We’ll never forget)
The fights, the struggle on the grind, the hustle
(The love that you showed)
But I woulda did it twice for the shows and the lights

[Outro]
Man shoutout to me and my crew
Feels good to make something out of nothing, you know
Aye DJ why don't you play some of my shit, man?
(We’re gonna play your favorite song for you)

[Hook 1]
Money being made around here (Around here)
Money being made around here (Around here)

Money being made around, money being made around

Money being made around here (Around here, around here)
Money being made around here (Around here)
Money being made around here
Money being made around, money being made around

[Verse 1]
No duh
‘Cause it ain’t nothing funny round here
About all of this money being made around here
So you ain’t getting none unless you running with my peers
And I keep that money coming anywhere that I appear
Get real, I been getting cash money since the juvenile
So niggas gonna feel it more that root canals
Sure, they ball the block like they hoopers now
But to me they translucent, dawg I can’t see them, no
And I’m ahead of them in every way
They front row and I’m center stage
If they cold then I’m Winnipeg
Belligerent
Your bopper running after that bread so long that bitch 

[?]
Money is continuous, he would of thought I hated cash
‘Cause every time I’m getting it, I’m giving it, spending it
Balling like scrimmages
Getting lost percentages of all of my dividends
I got money nigga

[Hook 2]
Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around here (Around here, around here)
Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around, money being made around

Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around, money being made around

[Verse 2]
This is the young heathen
And I do keep that money coming like it’s semen
So it’s never leaving as long as I’m breathing, believe it
There others temporary like seasons, I’m at the four seasons
My kick game is insane, pockets is on Rick James
I’m rich mane, ain't have to sell crack
I left that rock alone like big Dame
Trying to stay out of them chains like 

[?]
My ends raise bodies high as astrals, I’m Castro
They putting out shit like assholes
I’m fast forward as Flo-Jo
These homos moving slow-mo as old folks
They love me ‘cause I’m straight up like goal posts
With steady income, and they’s up and down like pogos
Boy, I’m getting money, money, money, like the bank
With money out the ass, I’m pretty sure it stank
Like ew!

[Hook 3]
Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around here (Around here, yeah)

Money being made around, money being made around

Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around here (Around here, yeah)
Money being made around, money being made around

[Verse 3]
Now if the door’s lifting up, that’s money
If you got your car kitted up, that’s money
Now if a brother on the block, that’s money
Ladies if you baby daddy’s got a job, that’s money
Now if you’re on your own business, that’s money
And if you living independent, that’s money
If you got your own degree, that’s money
And if you got your own CD, that’s money

Yeah listen, I got this
And urban legend like the Lock Ness
I’m controlling this like the cock pit (like what)
I’m out of hand like a mosh pit
So they laying off me kinda like these automotive jobs did
See my apprentice, small as infants
Plotting on me, I can smell it in the air like incense
For instance I’d give you proof like evidence
No questioning and I’m shining like heaven is

[Hook 4]
Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around here (Around here nigga)
Money being made around here (Around here, yeah)
Money being made around, money being made around

[Outro]

Female: Ha-ha, I never did it before

Sean: You want to?

Female:  think I’d be interesting

Female: To the music and then you could like, press play, like, I mean record and record it in the booth

[Verse 1]
Uh-huh

Girl no hickies please
I know that she feeling me, so Ima take her back to the crib to come feel on me
Your name is Tiffany?
Her name is Hillary
Together I almost slipped up and called you Tiffillary
Girl is you kidding me?
Can’t meet your mom though, I just wanna take you right back to my condo
And I’m hoping I’m turning you on like a console
‘Cause with that weave in your head you lookin’ like Tonto
So Ima want the breast and thigh with that, like the combo
She know I’m in charge, she callin’ me the head honcho
And baby I’m afraid if I can’t get that skirt off, then Ima probably hop up in the whip and skrrt off
‘Cause playing hard to get nowadays is such a turn off
And you gon’ feel different as soon as you sip on this Smirnoff
You dig?

[Hook]
(It’s been a long week, yeah word)
(And I’m gonna take you outta that skirt)
(So why don’t you come and sip on something)
(I could bring my friend, you could bring your friend)
Listen, I got short ones, fat ones, Indian and black ones
Small ones, tall ones, 

[?] and them rap ones
He one hit and quit ‘em so he never call ‘em back, hoes
One hit and quit ‘em so he never call ‘em back, hoes

[Verse 2]
I realize that I don’t need hoes, they need me
Soon as they see me, “Oh, I heard your CD”
I know they wanna hop on my peepee
So presidential, I should move to DC
You could ask Kiki, Michelle, and Niecy
They all, take it to the summit like BGs
That’s bubble guts, damn
And I ran through a couple sluts, that’s a whole lotta bubble butts, word?
Periodically like the shuttle bus
And Ima probably order all them hoes some Moet
‘Cause that get ‘em more wet and that mean more sex
Girl, call up your friend, let me come hit the whole set
And Ima probably have them hung up like the coat check
Girl, get on your knees let me give you a throat check
And since they and their friends want some, oh them hoes next
And Ima probably work them all out like the Bowflex
And you and your friends could all watch like Rolex

[Hook]
(It’s been a long week, yeah word)
(And I’m gonna take you outta that skirt)
(So why don’t you come and sip on something)
(I could bring my friend, you could bring your friend)
Listen, I got short ones, fat ones, Indian and black ones
Small ones, tall ones, 

[?] and them rap ones
He one hit and quit ‘em so he never call ‘em back, hoes

I can read your mind even from behind
And fuck what's in your phone, let me take you home
I wanna take you home

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's so rare that I'm here, don't plan on stayin' too long

[Intro]
(Glory)

[Verse 1]
Woo, this that shit they didn't want me on
I'm 'bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lamb', I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in a wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little gals
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails

[Interlude]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweler ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, "cock-a-doodle"
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you (Glory)
Glory

[Verse 2]
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-hoo, I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I'll sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, "Surprise," but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?

[Interlude]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely when sortin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord

[Verse 3]
Am I talkin' crazy? Too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, "Be quiet, we need our privacy"
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, hook you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

[Interlude]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tires Lucas, my driver's cruisin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em

[Outro]
Glory, hallelujah (I got 'em)
(Glory)
I got 'em
(I got 'em)
I got 'em

Fog up these windows, fog up these windows
Girl, first we were just smoking and then we're fucking (Lord)
Drop her off, tell her good night
Gotta go get my money right
OG Louis thirteen on me
Don’t pass me that mid, homie
Judge gave my nigga life
He took the bitch, still didn't snitch homie
Niggas quick to claim they real never been through nothing

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Roll up my weed as soon as the day start
Get me a pound and I break it apart
Kush on my clothes, smell the green in my car
Ain't coming close, you smell me from afar
Time after time, I keep smoking that herb
Joint after joint, I must be on the verge
Of overdosing, I be on that loud
Speeding me up, while I'm slowing you down
I just got back from an overseas trip
Smoking with Ty, he got me high as shit
Cause we keep nothing but good in our J
Repping our gang and we mob everyday
Break down an ounce, put it right on a tray
Ain't saving nothing, we smoke everything
Light up a joint, let it stink up the place
Or hit the bong, blow the smoke in your face

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'ma get money, nigga, I'ma get money
I'm a real nigga so I'ma keep it real
And I love getting high

I'm a real nigga so I'ma keep it real
And I love getting high

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Break it down and roll another one, I could get anything I want
I told her "You should bring a friend for the crew" (friend for the crew)
Hear 'em talk but they ain't want it though, I'm in the Hall of Fame of smoke
'Cause everybody that I'm with, get high too (get high too)
Only rolling in a Wiz Khalifa paper (Khalifa paper)
Taylor Gang G Pen, smell the vapor (smell the vapor)
Take it to the head before I walk up to the plane
I'll probably get so fucking high
Won't even know my fucking name
You got to be a pro, if you wanna get this blow
Never inhale, teach you how to hit this smoke
And I'm never running out of it (running out of it)
Kush smoke, got a lot of it (got a lot of it)
Smoke like we hit the lottery (hit the lottery)
Seen Snoop, he was proud of me (he was proud of me)

[Chorus]
It's high time
To slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

[Verse]
Been missing my roots
I'm getting rid of the flash
Nobody needs a thousand-dollar suit
Just to take out the trash
Ain't gotta be alone to feel lonely
I'm gonna turn off my phone
Start catching up with the old me

[Chorus]
It's high time
To slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

[Bridge]
Been all wrong
Just wanna feel alright
Tomorrow might come crashing down
But for tonight

[Chorus]
It's high time
To slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

[Outro]
I'm gonna let it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

[Verse 1]
I've had my picture made with Willie Nelson
Stayed in a hotel with a pool
Driven through New Mexico where the saguaro cactus grow
And I felt really small under Mount Rushmore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I made it all the way past Austin city limits
And maybe for a minute, I got too big for my britches, but

[Chorus]
I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
'Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home

[Verse 2]
Slept in a room with the ghost of Gram Parsons
Drank some wine I can't afford
Went to San Antonio to the River Walk and the rodeo
Seen the white cliffs of Dover from the shore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I kinda fell in love with a Palm Springs trailer park
But those California stars could never steal my heart, 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
'Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home

[Bridge]
I'm happy with what I got, 'cause what I got is all I need
Just 'cause it don't cost a lot, don't cost a lot, don't mean it's cheap

[Outro]
'Cause I'm just a dime store cowgirl
That's all I'm ever gonna be
You can take me out of the country
But you can't take the country out of me, no
'Cause I'm still the girl from Golden
Had to get away so I could grow
But it don't matter where I'm goin'
I'll still call my hometown home
Yeah, I'll still call my hometown home

[Verse 1]
They're blowing up our phones, asking where we are
Just say we're almost there; we ain't even in the car
You're rolling one for two and I'm still picking out my shoes
I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

[Verse 2]
By the time we get there, everybody will be drunk
The chairs will be on tables and the band will be unplugged
We're gonna look real good, but we're gonna look real rude
I'm sorry I'm not sorry that I'm...

[Chorus]
Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti?
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two?
The world can wait
'Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

[Verse 3]
Let's promise when we get in that we'll try to get right out
Fake a couple conversations, make the necessary rounds
These kinda things just turn into "Who's leaving here with who?"
But I just want 'em all to see me come in...

[Chorus]
Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti?
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two?
The world can wait
'Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

[Chorus]
Late to the party with you
Oh, who needs confetti?
We're already falling into the groove
And who needs a crowd when you're happy at a party for two?
The world can wait
'Cause I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you
No, I'm never late to the party if I'm late to the party with you

[Intro]
Me like the smell of money, you dig what I'm saying?

Pitching underarm and I will play (Hee)
Pimping all these hoes like Scottie Pippen (Pimp)
I'm Tony Montana, bome and get me (Bome on)
Stuff my body with fluid like I bought some Chappie (Know it)
No Rick Ross, I want gun play (What?)
Bet a hundred thousand dollars on a Sunday (Woo)
I got seven cars parked on a one way (Skrrt)
Y'all pussy niggas walking, no runway
She want my ice and my cream like a sundae (Yeah)
Hey, and I'm done with that gangster shit, Black Ken, I'm a Barbie (Yeah)
Yeah, nigga, YSL Barbies (What you say?)
Yeah, I got a whole lot of old hundreds and they wrinkled up like a Sharpei (And what?)
Ooh, I'm a pull up on a nigga block, Bangin' stars like I work at Hardee’s (Skrrt)
Ooh, lil' mama booty soft even though she still hard-head (Boing)
Hey, and my plug named Bob (What?) Marley

[Chorus]
Hey, every three days, brand new wig (What?)
Ayy, five or better upon her titty (Hey)
Hey, I want thighs, I don't want no legs (Ooh, ayy)
That's why I got a diving board inside that bitch, ayy (Woo)
Diving board inside that bitch, ooh (Swag)
Diving board that ho, hey (Drip)
Diving board inside that bitch (Sheesh)

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, views, views, views
Yeah, yeah, alright

[Verse 1: Drake]
Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move into Graceland
Madonna’s a ting I know and I’m the king of pop
I’m building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man, woo!

[Refrain: Drake]
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly!
'Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (Switch it up)
Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double-crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording
Shhh, listen, you hear that?

[Refrain: Drake]
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

[Spoken Intro: "Memaw" Barbara Musgraves]
We had a girl that came in with a drug overdose the other day. And she got real belligerent. And she bit one of the nurses. (Oh man). And, I mean, she bit (Ohhh)—you could see every tooth (Nooo! Hehe). It took two or three of us to get her off of her. It's a crazy Wednesday

[Verse 1]
We finally got a flashing light
They put it in last year
And everybody got real happy
When the grocery store got beer
And last time the census men came a-knockin'
We were busting at the seams

[Refrain]
Aww, but don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean

[Verse 2]
Big enough for a ZIP code
A VFW
A good Mexican restaurant
A beauty shop or two
Got a Methodist, a Baptist
And a Church of the Nazarene

[Refrain]
Aww, but don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean
Yeah, it's too dang small to be mean

[Chorus]
Too small to be lying
Way too small to cheat
Way too small for secrets
'Cause they're way too hard to keep
And somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other

[Verse 3]
You'll end up in the paper
Wreck your family name
What goes around comes back around
By Friday's football game
We only got one sheriff
But we all know how to keep the peace

[Refrain]
Aww, and don't you forget it, as big as we're getting
This town's too small to be mean

[Chorus]
Too small to be lying
Way too small to cheat
Way too small for secrets
'Cause they're way too hard to keep
And somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other

[Outro]
Yeah, somebody's mama knows somebody's cousin
And somebody's sister knows somebody's husband
And somebody's daughter knows somebody's brother
And around here, we all look out for each other

[Verse 1]
Look at us, never thought it would be you
Who found who? Girl, we may never know
It's enough knowing that I won't lose my way
But getting here wasn't easy

[Pre-Chorus]
We bend, don't break, that's the story of us
No give or take, didn't get me nowhere
I've learned from the hurt along the way
And it brought me right to you, babe

[Chorus]
I've taken every road under the sun
Every dead-end love brought another one
I should be fuming at all the time we wasted
But a million wrongs lead me right to, right to you
Right here, I'm right here with you
Yes, right here, so right here with you
Right here, I'm right here with you
Yes, right here, so right here with you

[Verse 2]
We've got scars, some of them you gave me, some of them I caused
That doesn't matter now
We both know the worst part is over
Ain't no letting go, letting go

[Pre-Chorus]
We bend, don't break, that's the story of us
No give or take, didn't get me nowhere
I've learned from the hurt along the way
And it brought me right to you, baby

[Chorus]
I've taken every road under the sun
Every dead-end love brought another one
I should be fuming at all the time we wasted
But a million wrongs lead me right to, right to you
Right here, I'm right here with you
Yes, right here, so right here with you
Right here, I'm right here with you
Yes, right here, so right here with you

[Bridge]
Hearts are like cars just racing on broken pavement
Going nowhere fast, still we stay on the gas
Love don't ride easy and it ain't always pretty
Yeah, I know 'cause I've taken every road

[Chorus]
I've taken every road under the sun
Every dead-end love brought another one
I should be fuming at all the time we wasted
But a million wrongs lead me right to, right to you
Right here, I'm right here with you
Yes, right here, so right here with you
Right here, I'm right here with you
Yes, right here, so right here with you

Smokin' a zip and I pour up a four
Poppin' the molly, she ready to go
She wanna know can another friend come and another friend come

Fuckin' with bitches like her, it ain't easy
Blowin' my phone up, I know that she needy

[Intro]
I went to Kanye West's recent tour, the Yeezus Tour
It was a big, dramatic, theatrical show
He did something very strange at the end of his show
Where he ranted for like 20 minutes
It was kind of a rant, kind of a song
He had auto-tune on his voice
And there was an instrumental in the background, like this instrumental
He talked about his problems
Race, power, his $90 t-shirts weren't selling very well; that was most of it
And I watched this, I thought maybe I could do this
I'll be honest, my problems are not as high stakes as Kanye's, but I have problems
And maybe a crowd in New York would be nice enough to indulge me
So as we get to the end of a night of theater, and comedy and sweaters coming on and off
I got one question for you, and that question is...

[Verse 1]
Can I say my shit?

[Name of city], can I say my shit?
I've got lots of shit to say
I've got lots of shit to say
(Ooh)
I can't fit my hand inside a Pringle can
I have a huge amount of trouble
Fitting my hand inside of a Pringle can
I can get my hand like four inches into the can
But then I have to tilt the can into my mouth
But by that point, a bunch of crumbs have accumulated at the bottom of the can
So they all go spilling onto my face
What I'm trying to say is the diameter of Pringle cans is way too small
I'll say it again
The diameter of Pringle cans is way too small
Two radiuses of a Pringle can is way too small
If you feel me, put your hands up, come on!
If you feel me, put your hands up
Look at all these hands that are way too big to fit inside a Pringle can
Your hands are too big to fit inside of Pringle cans
Your hands are too big to fit inside a Pringle can
You think you can, I know you can't, you think you can
Pringles! Listen to the people!
I am sure ninety percent of the complaint letters you get
Are about the width of your cans; just make them wider
I've overdone the Pringles thing, sorry

[Verse 2]
I wanna have a daughter, wanna have a daughter
So I can finally have someone around the house
Who can fit their hands in a Pringle can
Yes, I'm still on the Pringle cans thing! Yeah!
I'll-I'll move on, alright?
But that is priority número uno
I don't go to the gym, 'cause I'm self-conscious about my body
But I'm self-conscious about my body 'cause I don't go to the gym
Irony can be so painful, that's a Catch-22, ooh
Let's do this!
I went to Chipotle, went to Chipotle
Got myself a chicken burrito, brrap
I went down the line I got like all these ingredients
And at the end of the line, the guy tried to wrap the burrito
But half of the shit inside the burrito spilled out; he still wrapped it
I was like, "Dude, you should have warned me!"
You're a burrito expert; you should have told me halfway through
"Hey, man, you might be reaching maximum burrito capacity here"
Do you think I want a messy burrito?
No one wants a messy burrito
The whole appeal of a burrito is that all of the ingredients
Are contained within the confines of the tortilla
I wouldn't have gotten half this shit if I knew it wasn't gonna fit in the burrito!
Alright? Look

[Build]
I wouldn't have got the lettuce if I knew it wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got the cheese if I knew it wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got the peppers if I knew they wouldn't fit
I wouldn't have got, half of it
Like, I'm okay with small mistakes
If you've got no more chicken, I'll take pork
But I'll blow my dad before I eat a burrito with a fork

[Chorus]
Wouldn't have got the lettuce if I knew it wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got the cheese if I knew it wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got the peppers if I knew they wouldn't-
Man, I wouldn't have got half of it, like
Half of it like, half of it like, half of it like, half of it right now
I think it's time I, think it's time, that we break it down

[Verse 3]
(Put the lotion in the basket)
I can sit here and pretend like my biggest problems are
Pringle cans, and burritos
The truth is my biggest problem's you; I want to please you
But I want to stay true to myself
I want to give you the night out that you deserve
But I want to say what I think and not care what you think about it
A part of me loves you, part of me hates you
Part of me needs you; part of me fears you
And I don't think that I can handle this right now
Handle this right now; I don't think that I can handle this right now
I don't think that I can handle this right-
I don't think that I can handle this right-
I don't think that I can handle this right-
Look at them; they're just staring at me, like
"Come and watch the skinny kid with a
Steadily declining mental health, and laugh as he attempts
To give you what he cannot give himself"

[Build]
Think that I can handle this right-
I don't think that I can handle this right-
They don't even know the half of this right-
They don't even know the half of it
But I know I'm not a doctor, I'm a pussy, I put on a silly show
I should probably just shut up and do my job, so here I go

[Chorus]
Wouldn't have got the lettuce if I knew it wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got the cheese if I knew it wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got the peppers if I knew they wouldn't fit
Wouldn't have got half
You can tell them anything if you just make it funny, make it rhyme
And if they still don't understand you, then you run it one more time
Think that I can handle this right-- Haa
Handle this right-- Ho
Handle this right
You don't even know the half of this right now
Right now (Haa!)
Now
Handle this right
I'll handle this right; I handle this right now

[Outro]
Thank you
Good night
I hope you're happy

[Verse]
Why did you choose to stay?
Are you sure about your life for once?
Have you found how you're gonna live?
I can tell you haven't gotten far
What made you want to come back to me?
Was it cause I didn't want to leave you?
I want you to know I'll keep you out of harm
But you've got to know you left your mark on me

Why did you choose to stay?
Are you sure about your life for once?
Have you found how you're gonna live?
I can tell you haven't gotten far
What made you want to come back to me?
Was it cause I didn't want to leave you?
I want you to know I'll keep you out of harm
But you've got to know you left your mark on me
Well I ain't got no money
No fancy car
Ain't got no excuses baby
Hanging at the bar

I don't owe you a thing baby
I don't owe you a thing

I don't owe you a thing
Oh we ain't getting married

Ain't got no excuses, baby
But goodness knows

I don't owe you a thing baby

This all you get now mama
This all you get
Just me and this guitar baby
That's all you get

Well, ain't got no apology
Won't be no fairy tale
Ain't got no excuses baby
I'm doing my deal
I don't owe you a thing baby
I don't owe you a thing
I don't owe you a thing baby
I don't owe you a thing
Oh we ain't getting married
I ain't buying you no diamond ring
That's alright

Ain't got no money
Ain't got no car
Ain't got no excuses baby
I'm drinking at the bar
I don't owe you a thing mama
I don't owe you a thing
I don't owe you a thing baby
I don't owe you a thing

Well we ain't getting married
I ain't buying you no diamond ring
That's alright
Well we ain't getting married
I ain't buying you no diamond ring
That's alright

Well we ain't getting married ...
I ain't buying you a diamond ring

[Chorus]
J's at my door, I got money on the floor (repeat 3x)
I'm a million dollar nigga on the muthafuckin low
I got money on the floor (repeat 8x)

[Verse 1]

Gucci in the club, poppin bands on them hoes
Go ahead Gucci Mane, toss some grands on the floor
I'm gettin a table dance by a fine ass ho
Got me coming back, now I'm trying to find this ho
I got money on the table, choppa on the dresser
Financially stable, very successful
Money on the marble(floor)
Redder than a cardinal
Bluer Dodger
Blacker than a ninja
Iteneries, calenders, baby and agendas
Boo I'll fuck ya, hit ya when I hit ya
Text message, fax, e-mail me send a picture
Gucci Mane, fuck ya girl, go get the pistol
Gucci Mane fucked the world, and its sister
Main bitch left me, I didn't even miss her
Fucked her best friend, she sucked then you kissed her
Fucked her best friend she sucked me then you kissed her

[Chorus]
J's at my door, I got money on the floor (repeat 3x)
I'm a million dollar nigga on the muthafuckin low

[Verse 2]

Money on the floor, there's more gualas to count
Got a lot of crack heads trying to get in my house
This ho say she hungry, put my dick in her mouth
If she help me hit a lick, then I'm watchin her out
Down south, gold mouth, ya them birds fly south
Made a half a million dollars in my trap house
I'm a million dollar man, on the low worth eight
Every girl I meet fuck on first date
He on 26's, baby I'm on 8's
Bart Simpson color diamonds with the red roller skates
Brazilian, chameleon, reptilian forces
Mustard 9 8's or the retro Jordan's
If bitches and money was my choices
Then i choose money and move with bosses
If bitches and money was my choices
Then I choose money and move with bosses

[Hook]
J's at my door, I got money on the floor (repeat 3x)
I'm a million dollar nigga on the muthafuckin low
I got money on the floor (repeat 8x)

[Verse 3]

Mojo told me step my game up
So if I throw up man, shrimp might come up
Chamillion paint same color the vomit
80 proof liqour all in my stomach
I'm on the look out for a big fine woman
Who wanna suck dick and can keep me company/cumin
I thug this, love this, never been love sick
But been frost bit, back back young bitch
Orange Catalina same color as a Sunkist
Six 12's beat every time the fuckin drum kick
Burn on the track, so you know its gon go
I got half a million dollars on this goddamn floor

[Chorus]
J's at my door, I got money on the floor (repeat 3x)
I'm a million dollar nigga on the muthafuckin low
I got money on the floor (repeat 8x)

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I lay the hammer down
I'ma build a whole house on that ass, I swear
Tell her its hammer time
'Cause I'm from Tallahassee and you know we get nasty out here
Now when we swervin' in the 'Llac, you know we makin' it chirp
You almost made me spill this jack up on this ten dollar shirt
Shawty, tell me when you and your friend get out of work
'Cause all these other bitches just pretending to twerk
I'ma about to unload on a bitch
Baby let me see you get low a lil bit
Dutty wine, dutty wine, keep rollin' on the hips
(Too fast, too fast) Take it slow on the dick

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Now when I walk up in this bitch you know I'm making it work
How you fit all of that cake in that skirt?
Put a whippin' on that ass like I'm making dessert
Water guns, I be makin' it squirt, so holla at me bitch

[Chorus: Juicy J & T-Pain]
Walk up in this bitch, you better make that shit work
I'm throwin' hundreds in your face, you better make that shit work
And when you hop up on a dick, you better make that shit work Make, make that shit work, make, make that shit work
Hop up on a dick, you better make that shit work
Make, make that shit work, make, make that shit work
Hop up on a dick, you better make that shit work
I'm throwin' hundreds in your face, you better make that shit work

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Her booty unbelievably
Tryin' to describe it but my crew just don't believe me
And if she ain't workin' for the premium
I'ma stuck it on the side like a motherfuckin' TV
I'ma beast, I do this shit in reality nigga
If she fuck with me she fuck with beastiality nigga
I got her working, got her working, losing calories nigga
She don't fuck with you 'cause she knows that your swag ain't official
Hundred dollars at a time
Drop that pussy on a dime
Make it clap to the baseline
Boom bap wind chime, I ain't lying

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Now when I walk up in this bitch you know I'm making it work
How you fit all of that cake in that skirt?

If the bitch ain't eatin' dick she might as well starve
Shoot movies in the bed, she gon' play her part
'Cause when it come to givin' brain she gon' play it smart
We throwin' George Washington's, them fives and them tens

Throw that bread tell her momma she gon' be your best friend
But that bitch ain't in love she just tryin' to get them M's

Walk up in this bitch, you better make that shit work

I got my wine with me nigga but I ain’t from New Orleans
You know them young niggas will kill you for them brand new Jordans

Little bad bitch went and bought me that brand new Audi
They call me thigh pad shawty, got the real high prices
Keep a pocket rocket, make your ass come out of the closet
I got the squares in, niggas smelling like nail polish

I got a heart so I'm kill you and send your grandma roses

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
You better play with your children, you better play with your children
Cause you ain’t got to tell me, I can see you’re in your feelings
Hell naw, I’m not a psychic, but I predict a killing
In such a short time, I made myself some millions
You better play with your children, you better play with your children
Cause you ain’t got to tell me, I can see you’re in your feelings
Hell naw, I’m not a psychic, but I predict a killing
In such a short time, I made myself some millions

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Just a short time I made about a million
Not off no rap check but trapping in them buildings
From all this lean I sip I done spent about a million
And I don’t beef with kids nigga, go play with your children
Working with the work man, just like a gym do
Niggas try to rob me, thank god I had my pistol
Some thot calling me, she talking bout her rent due
Better go find your boyfriend, 'cause all I do is fuck you
Nigga playing with me, knowing I’m a loose screw
Don’t make me pull up with the youngins, boy them boys is KuKu
Hop out the cut, on foenem, I will shoot you
Just bought a brand new chopper, them bullets gon' kiss you
Funeral next Friday your mama gon' miss you
But that’s how it get when you’re fucking with a boss dude
Ain’t no pretending, you don’t want to cop a Hyundai
I’mma tell you once boy you better play with your children

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
You better play with your children, you better play with your children
Cause you ain’t got to tell me, I can see you’re in your feelings
Hell naw, I’m not a psychic, but I predict a killing
In such a short time, I made myself some millions
You better play with your children, you better play with your children
Cause you ain’t got to tell me, I can see you’re in your feelings
Hell naw, I’m not a psychic, but I predict a killing
In such a short time, I made myself some millions

[Chorus]
Yeah, champagne on the way, it's a time and a place
Baby girl, I wanna take off everything, but I gotta wait

She couldn't be from down below
For if she was, my heart would know
And when it knows it just won't go
Down

[Refrain until fade]
Picking me up

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you a story about a girl I know
She became a good friend of mine so many years ago
Something special about her, but not too good to be true
But with a running start, I bet she could take off and fly if she wanted to
A gorgeous girl, what a sight to see
And you can be yourself around her, 'cause she gave you the right to be
And someday, she's gonna be somebody's perfect wife
And in her yearbook she was voted most likely to have a perfect life, alright

[Chorus]
Everybody loves you baby
They love you just the way you are
Everybody loves you baby
The soundtrack to the life of a superstar

[Verse 2]
But nobody knows the trouble she's seen
She unwillingly lost her virginity at the age of 15
Yeah, you can look, but you better not touch
'Cause the boy next door must have loved her just a little bit too much
But she's still smiling
I think she's got a gift
The way she can help people with smaller problems than hers they're having a harder time with
And she is still a mystery
And finding her is so much fun
And if you ever get to meet her I guarantee you're going to know that she's the one

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
They're there for your first year, they give you your first beer
When you get your heart broke, they're there for your worst year
Don't get you at all, but your apple don't fall too far from 'em
They own too much wicker and drink too much liquor
You'd wash your hands of them, but blood's always thicker
You might look just like 'em; that don't mean you're like 'em
But you love 'em

[Chorus 1]
Family is family, in church or in prison
You get what you get, and you don't get to pick 'em
They might smoke like chimneys, but give you their kidneys
Yeah, friends come in handy, but family is family

[Verse 2]
They're there when you're married, divorced and remarried
You fall out of touch, but then someone gets buried
And you're right back together like no time has ever gone by
Can't live with or without 'em; you might talk about 'em
But if someone else does, well, then you'll knock 'em out 'cause
When it's all said and done, they're the only ones that you got

[Chorus 1]
Family is family, in church or in prison
You get what you get, and you don't get to pick 'em
They might smoke like chimneys, but give you their kidneys
Yeah, friends come in handy, but family is family

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, family is funny, they'll ask you for money
Even though they know you ain't got no money
They show up at Christmas, get up in your business
They might not be fancy, but family is family

[Outro]
You might look just like 'em; that don't mean you're like 'em
But you love 'em

[Verse 1]
Hold on to me
Don't let me go
Who cares what they see
Who cares what they know?
Your first name is Free
Last name is Dom
Cause you still believe
In where we’re from

[Chorus]
Man's red flower
It's in every living thing
Mind, use your power
Spirit, use your wings
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

[Verse 2]
Hold on to me
Don't let me go
Cheetahs need to eat
Run, antelope
Your first name is King
Last name is Dom
Cause you still believe
In everyone

[Chorus]
When a baby first breathes
When night sees sunrise
When the whale hops the sea
When man recognizes
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom
Freedom
Breathe in

[Verse 3]
We are from heat
The electric one
Does it shock you to see
He left us the sun?
Atoms in the air
Organisms in the sea
The sun and yes, man
Are made of the same things

[Outro]
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

[Verse 1]
Hey!
Feels like I'm asleep, but I’m awake
In this dream, I never see your face
I'm just a step behind
Hey!
Can't remember why you went away
Pinch me, 'cause I know it's a mistake
I wanna see your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I woke up in another life
Where nothing's really dangerous
And everything is black and white
And no one even knows
I woke up in a broken dream
With no one lying next to me
It's not how it's supposed to be
So why'd you have to go?

[Chorus]
I'm still trying to wake up from this
From this nightmare, from this nightmare
Where everything is in its right place
But you're not there
No, you're not there

[Verse 2]
Hey!
Table's set for two, but it's a waste
I'm the only one that's breaking plates
The quiet's getting loud
Hey!
Everyone keeps saying I'm okay
One more night alone, I'll go insane
I need to hold you now

[Pre-Chorus]
I woke up in another life
Where nothing's really dangerous
And everything is black and white
And no one even knows
I woke up in a broken dream
With no one lying next to me
It's not how it's supposed to be
So why'd you have to go?

[Chorus]
I'm still trying to wake up from this
From this nightmare, from this nightmare
Where everything is in its right place
But you're not there
No, you're not there

[Bridge]
Suddenly, I can almost see you
Feel the heat of your breath on my skin
Scared to death that I'm only dreaming
Suddenly, I can see you fading
Going on, but my heart starts racing
Scared to death, 'cause I know I'm dreaming

[Chorus]
I'm still trying to wake up from this
From this nightmare, from this nightmare
Where everything is in its right place
But you're not there
No, you're not there
Let me call this old bitch
See what this bitch doin'
Call this bitch

Hello? Whassup?

She said, "Well, daddy, if I had some nuts
On my chest, would those be chestnuts?"

Broke my promise, baby
Sailed that ship in the yard
Well, it's hard
Snuck her in through the back
"What's your name?"
"Where's the cash?"
Well, that's that
Bird got caught in a wire
Don't fly
Bad man can't grow a hole
All right
Girl pecks hole for a life
Spits white
Boy lives mouth off a wire
Spits white
Ice went straight to my head
I said
Blood went straight to my head
I said
Fuck too fast, made it back
I said
Drift, don't jump on the bed
I said
They came to Cordura, they came to Cordura
In search of destiny as wand'rers have always gone
And there in Cordura, somewhere in Cordura, the hand of destiny awaited a certain one
Bring your hopes and dreams to Cordura, only if they dwell deep in your heart
For the old men say, on each chosen day in Cordura
They will bless your dreams or tear them apart
They came to Cordura, they came to Cordura, and soon they're gone like all the rest
But for him whose dream was blessed in Cordura, I found my love in Cordura
Fairy tale, my favorite fairy tale
Is the one I live with wonderful you
Life is so grand, a fabulous fairyland
And we walk it hand in hand as lovers do

Fantasy became a reality
With your tender kiss, you open the door
You are marvelous, divine
Aladdin's lamp did shine
The magic day that you were mine

Fairy tale, our love is a fairy tale
And it never has been told before

Fantasy became a reality
With your tender kiss, you open the door
You are marvelous, divine
Aladdin's lamp did shine
The magic day that you were mine

Fairy tale, our love is a fairy tale
And it never has been told before

South man, outstanding flow
Ready for the drama like Knots Landing hoe
Bada-bam-bing hoe
Weezy do his thing hoe
You don't need Websters to know what the bling-bling for
Checking in the Four Seasons gotta have a neat hoe

To the down ass chicks that keep it in the slums

Hey, Ms. Red Carpet
She can autograph my pockets
Anytime, anyplace, anyway
I'll be looking at everybody else watchin'
I don't wanna be obnoxious
But this girl worth the gossip
Take away the smile
The tattoos now, forever she very guard-less
I imagine her topless
She might set off my rocket
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
On and poppin' she mad marketing
Attitude like we arguing
With her by my side bring glitter to my life
I should twitter this girl is sparkling

[Chorus]
She ain't no rock star
But she got groupies
She ain't no actress
But she makes movies
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl
She ain't got riches but she got fashion
She ain't a model but camera's flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl
Hey, I wanna know her mamma's name
'Cause that where she get it from
They ain't never shot her with silicon
Shawty is her and her she's the real one
Touch one, grab one, feel one
I wish she would'a told me that
Ain't nothing wrong bringing the old me back
Little mamma knows my body so trophy glass
She worth it, bring me some Chloe bags
Like damn, can I be yo' police badge
Pull it up, get a little cozy and
Woman is sort'a like and oldie jam
Record some ssh
On a playboy cam
She ain't no actress
The movie from my mattress
Rock star, none of that practice
But still she got fanatics

[Chorus]
Ooh oh oh, look at her goo ooh ooh
I wanna know ooh ooh
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl

Ooh oh oh, look at her goo ooh ooh
I wanna know ooh ooh
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl

[Chorus]
I'm in the collard green 6, cornbread in the guts
Got the Halloween kicks trick or treatin' the clutch
Come on nigga, is you trickin' or what?
Flow tighter than a dick in the butt

Just hopped off the plane, came back from Vancouv'
Little white tee, some boobs, and bamboo
White girls tell me, "Hey Nicki, your camp rules
Is that why you get more head than shampoos?"

Asalamalakum, no oink for me
And I never let a D-boy boink for free
'Cause it's Barbie, bitch, you can join the wave
I done penny, nickel, dimed, I done coined the phrase

You couldn't beat me there if you had a Leer
Indian style court side with a cavalier
VIP RosÃ©s you can have a beer
'Cause honey, when you getting' money, you don't have a care

Now r-roger that, r-roger that
R-roger that, r-roger that
R-roger that, r-roger that
R-roger
Young black Rico's kill for the C-notes
But me though, I'm Jack son bitch Tito
She wanna play games but this is not bingo
Monopoly, I'm past go, go ahead and deep throat

4-chick foursomes, skin colors mocha
Sally and Sonia put the pussies on my Totem
Pole vault stroke 'em, strike it like bowlin'
Now open like you yawnin', it's 6 in the mornin'

Sleepin' on me probably in a coffin
I'm hotter than the end of fuckin' August, I'm awesome
I'm awesome, repeat it to your grandma and uncles
M-mothers, Tyga's no dad but I'm the motherfucker

Motherfuckers, this the last supper
Look, no hands, I'm a bread cuffer
I don't dare love her, I'm a dare devil
I don't fear nothin', motherfucker, Young Money

Now roger that, roger that
R-roger that, roger that
Fuck around and never get roger back

(I'm goin' in)
Fresh off the jet, sharper than Gillette
The blunt still wet so pass it like bread
We sip side a mug, we call it upset
Smoke more than 4 quarters, we call it sudden death
I'm a beast, you a pet
AK long neck, key sweat
Weezy, motherfucker, capo in this bitch with me
Money talks and have a convo' in this bitch with me

I'm mountain high, Colorado in this bitch with me
Flow crazy, 730, you just 650
20 bullets from the chopper take the roof off
Laughin' to the bank, I'm a goof ball

It's Y.M. and we at yo' neck like a violin
It's our world, we make it spin and y'all the prey, amen

Now roger that, roger that
Where Roger at? I heard Rog' a Rat
F-fuck around and never get Roger back

Strange people in strange place
Who cares if we don't fit in?
I'd rather be a misfit, at least I fit my skin
I'm on a runaway road to somewhere
I know it's not where is it to this
And if you try to break me softly
You can try, but you'll miss!
Whoever you are you are you are you are
We're not the same
And we'll never change whoever we are
We are we are all loved and lost
Where you can never treat me like I don't have a name
Ooh oh oooh oh
Where you can never treat me like I don't have a name
You're searching for an answer
Come closer. Let me in!
I'd rather be an outcast, and trapped under your wings
I'm on a runaway road to somewhere
I know it's not where is it to this
And if you try to break me softly
You can try, but you'll miss!
Whoever you are you are you are you are
We're not the same
And we'll never change whoever we are
We are we are all loved and lost
Where you can never treat me like I don't have a name
Ooh oh oooh oh
Where you can never treat me like I don't have a name
We built a home here
You can stay, ooh I'll go
I could protect you
You are safe here
Don't you dare forget!!
Ooh oh oooh oh
Where you can never treat me
You could never treat
You could never treat me
Whoever you are you are you are you are
We're not the same
And we'll never change whoever we are
We are we are all loved and lost
Where you can never treat me like I don't have a name!

[Verse 1]
Who's to blame
What's his name?
Where's he from?
Is that my Range he's drivin'...
Tell me what's he got that I ain't got alot of
Besides who is he to lay under covers in my home
Home. My home
Now lets not forget her, Mrs Can't-Trust
I was wrong about her ass
She's nothing like my mother
God rest her soul
Ohhhh
Took her of these streets gave her everything
The only one who believed in all of her dreams and she did me wrong
So prepare yourself, it's about to be a...

[Chorus]
Showdown is going down
Somebody's been fooling around in my home
Wearing my clothes
Driving my car
God help me
Showdown is going down
Somebody's been fooling around in my home
Two words that I have to say
"It's on"

[Verse 2]
Now first things first, gonna need some names
Wheres this cat from
An address to his place
I'm serious
T.J., follow him wherever he goes
Once this all over nobody knows
About nothing..
And if Asia's with him
Then just lay back, wait 'til he's alone
It may be a trap
And, don't screw this up
Prepare yourself, it's about to be a...

[Chorus]
Showdown is going down
Somebody's been fooling around in my home
Wearing my clothes
Driving my car
God help me
Showdown is going down
Somebody's been fooling around in my home
I only got two words to say:
"Its on"

[Verse 3]
Now, this is madder than I've ever been
No more
See, I've been holding all this drama in
This means war
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to do something
Oh, mama...
Because I'm sick of all this creeping around on me
War
Said my piece in church and now it's on
T.J
Saddle up my horses, then I'm gone
We'll take a ride to town
I'll have revenge because they did me wrong
Prepare yourself, its 'bout to me a...

[Chorus]
Showdown is going down
Somebody's been fooling around in my home
Wearing my clothes
Driving my car
God help me
Showdown is going down
Somebody's been fooling around in my home
Only got two words to say:
"It's on"

[Outro]
Showdown is going down
Somebody's been fooling around in my home
Wearing my clothes
Driving my car
God help me
Showdown is going down
Somebody's been fooling around in my home
I swear to God when I catch 'em
It's on
Aww man (shit)
That bitch (DID HE?!)
What the fuck is this?
Did he? (DID HE?!)
Are you for real?

Ryde or die, right or wrong (WHAT?)
Niggas wit'cha by your side 'til the storm (WHAT?)
Then they split, don't wanna ride to the storm (WHAT?)
{I love you my nigga} Shoulda known that was bullshit all along! (C'MON!)

I been doin this for a minute
So with or without you I'ma get it, cause I'm in it to win it
I put in work, paid my dues
Stepped in dirt, changed my shoes
Got those dirty - asked God for a new pair
And He musta heard me; thought I was worthy
Taught me to listen cause in New York
The rule is the more you know the less you talk
So if you fake niggas actin like you down for the kid
When it goes back, don't be around for SHIT!
That's why niggas like you get found in a ditch
You ain't built for war, actin like a BITCH!
Ryde or die, right or wrong (WHAT?)
Niggas wit'cha by your side 'til the storm (WHAT?)
Then they split, don't wanna ride to the storm (WHAT?)
{I love you my nigga} Shoulda known that was bullshit all along! (C'MON!)

We all in the sunshine...

We all in the sunshine, we all want the fun time
So niggas forget that it is gon' rain sometime
Whatever the weather
We supposed to be in this together, B.F.W. forever
I see now that y'all niggas been takin shit lightly
One minute you love me, next you wanna fight me
Am I gon' lose? Not likely
And even though we both know that you a cat, you still be tryin to bite me
C'mon vato, cat-o
That's a real bitch move you made, you know the rest, uh-oh
Walk like a man you gots to talk like a man
Chin up, with a limp, dick in your hand!

Ryde or die, right or wrong (WHAT?)
Niggas wit'cha by your side 'til the storm (WHAT?)
Then they split, don't wanna ride to the storm (WHAT?)
{I love you my nigga} Shoulda known that was bullshit all along! (C'MON!)

Ahh man, ahh man! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
Whatever the fuck I do I go all out
Wait for a few days, ryde or die, fuck out bitch!
I ain't got time for these cats that wanna pretend
Like they gon' ride 'til the end
Cause soon as you hit a bump niggas jump ship
But when it's all good same niggas suck dick
Money is the root of all evil
I ain't a fake nigga, and never had a reason to deceive you
Don't nobody do for me, but me
A nigga gon' be alright, you'll see
When I need a friend, 

[?] sends me one
When I need some ends, he saved me some
Whatever I need I get it, so I don't want for nothin
And I ain't gotta hunt for nothin
Sittin on ten whips, a few chips
And that mayne with the laser from the hip catch you slip

Ryde or die, right or wrong (WHAT?)
Niggas wit'cha by your side 'til the storm (WHAT?)
Then they split, don't wanna ride to the storm (WHAT?)
{I love you my nigga} Shoulda known that was bullshit all along! (C'MON!)

WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAAAAAAAT?
Man, cause I'm fuckin crazy!
And you all fuckin crazy!
Oh my God, what have they done?
What have they done? What have they done?!
What have they done?!
What have they done?! They don't know
What have they done?! They don't know
What have they done?! They don't know
What have they done?! They don't know
What have they done?! They don't know
Grrrrrrr...
Ryde or die, right or wrong!

[Verse 1]
Yes, y'all and, to the like beat and
You could either dance or just have a seat and
Listen to the way and, what I am displaying
A different kind of rapper language that I am saying
To all the party people that absorbs the info
When it come to rocking parties I am a nympho
Maniac, brainiac for doing my dance
And my record Make the Music will put you in a trance and
Hypnotize your body and, like you do Bacardi and
You won't be fighting or illing, you just be partying
Down, with the funky sound with yours truly
I'm the original B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I but the E
I came to have fun and, not be number one and
Just here to let you know, who's like running the place
And everywhere that I perform and do a show
As long as you know that...

[Verse 2]
You know me as the B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E and
I go for what I know doing a show for human beings
I'm guaranteed to rock I make the ladies scream and shout
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
The Mardi rapper toe-tapper always having fun
And when you hear the Biz Markie, I get the job done
Yes I'm the M-A-R the K-I-E you know that's me
I got the stutter step to keep in check my speed is so unique
They say I look and sound funny but I don't be caring
I rock the Latin Quarter, Rooftop, Union Square and
Roseland, the Heartthrob, Madison Square Garden
Even rocked for the World’s Fair at Javits Center
Pardon the way that I be talking 'bout the places I be rocking
I love to perform for the people that be clocking
Not sayin that you're on mine or on it like a hornet
But you pay for a good performance, doggone it, you want it
That's why I'm here, to be like letting you knowing
That I'mma highly recognized as the king of discoing
Making people laugh and have a lot of enjoyment
I'm the best person for this type of employment
That's why...

On and on to the break of dawn
When you buy food cheap, you need a coupon
Or catch a sale retail, before it gets stale
So hurry up and get the WIC check out the mail
And shop non-stop, but how I hip-hop
On the mic and like make you co-op-
-erate with the rhythm, that is what I give em
Reagan is the Pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm
It might sound confusing, the style that I'm using
But in the end I'm sure that you will find it quite amusing
And funny, oh honey, it's just ridiculous
Don't try to front, come on and admit you was
Thrilled, chilled, your heart was fulfilled
So respect the architect as I begin to build
Science and my reliance is upon my rap
Like Carl Lewis I get to it, so let's go the lap

If ya didn't know, if you wasn't informed
Or somethin' like that, this is Da Drought 3
And um, check this out
Yeah, imagine wakin' up out ya, sleep to them pistols blastin'
And if the witness is dead there's no trial
If you didn't know then, hoe, well ya know now
And I don't mean basketball, when I say I don't know Yao
Money money money money, boost my morale
Play with my money money money, okay coral
I like a bitch with a Apple Bottom, like Vokal
The top is at my fingertips, like I ain't got no nails
I got blood brothers, bitch, I ain't got no pals
I make a girl get low, like I ain't got no L's
I'ma paper chasin' dog, check my toenails
And I never miss a game, no Shaq O'Neal
More like Brett Favre, just like Brett Favre
I been shot two times, just wipe that off
But I thank you for puttin' me right back, Lord
And to you, Father, I would give my life back for it
That knife, that sword, that gun, that war
Make ya so called soldiers, just run like Gore
Yeah, Frank that is from San Francis
And I got more banana clips than chimpanzees
10 addresses and I dresses
Like I thinks I'm the muthafuckin' best there is
And I'm about to bubble and she catch that fizz
And I'm straight from Clayborne, nigga, just ask Liz
Check ya neck, there ain't a crook like this
From the city where the judge throw the book at kids
Burna in school, in my book bag hid
Talk stupid at lunch and we havin' ya ribs
If you are not home, then we havin' ya kids
And if you can't come up with half, I'll send ya half of ya kid
Back to the board, an extravagant crib
I'm on the toilet watchin' Martin, just laughin' and shit
Don't know why I get high, but I get high
I get high like every single day
We do shit that them other women can't
Mary Jane, what is it you've done to me?
I pop a beat and start rollin'
And then I smoke it like a muthafuckin' stogie
Pete Pye wrote it, I was rappin' to the
Ding-ding-ding-ding, fuck it
Get high, screw the world and that's that
I need all my funds, yeah, all my money, baby
Black diamonds and pearls, believe that
I may bling bling and my chest look like a mural
I'm nuts, just call me Squirrel
My fetish is the girls but the women not the girls
Act your age, not your shoe size, maybe we can do the twirl
I'll be the Prince of a Pearl, tongue, earring in her pearl, tongue
If she come let her girl come, give her a pill, giver her girl, one
Party time, excellent, yup Wayne's World
Campbell's soup on the wrist, just call me Earl
Lil' ma don't shoot 'em, ya heard
I get high my words slur, I start callin' 'em Mirl
Hey Mirl, light that fur
And I know this old, but I'm really hot in hurr
I went with the phantom, my niggas coppin' the spurs
My hands in the pot, I'd rather eat and stir
It's I against the world and I'm strapped, yeah
I bring all my guns, shoot mothers, fathers, babies, damn
Black hand guns to serve, we could see
But we are so blind to the signs, they tryin' to lose the world
And we will walk right up with our guns
Yup, hand in hand, yeah
We'll march right after the drum
But I don't need no band
April played a fiddle
And my heart began to dance
And I was so surprised to find
My arms around romance
April played a fiddle
And I memorized the tune
And later on, a dream and i
Went singing to the moon

Then may began to gossip
And june just winked her eye
And you should have seen
The know-it-all expression on july
April played a fiddle
Ah but here's the funny part
I had to pay the fiddler
With my one and only heart
I think of you, my love, not as a stranger
Although it's true, my love, we've only met
Yet I know your smile and I know your sigh
Know them well from dreams I can't forget

We've kissed like this before, you're not a stranger
A thousand times or more 'neath stars above
Now the path is clear, for at last you're here
Not as a stranger, dear, but my own true love

We've kissed like this before, you're not a stranger
A thousand times or more 'neath stars above
Now the path is clear, for at last you're here
Not as a stranger, dear, but my own true love
You're my girl the boys all know, you're my girl, I've told them so
You should have seen how their faces fell when they were wishing me well
They called me a lucky guy, and I couldn't hide a feeling of pride
You're my girl, I've chosen you to be mine, my whole life through
And if this heart of mine had a voice, you'd hear it second my choice
You're what I've waited for, and you're my girl

The kids that see me come to call have written your name and my name on the
Wall
It's common gossip everywhere, that you and I have got it bad for fair
You're my girl, I've chosen you to be mine my whole life through
And if this heart of mine had a voice, you'd hear it second my choice
You're what I 've waited for, and you're my girl
Well, I work hard everyday
Come home straight with my pay
My baby either drink it up
Or she threw it all away

I'm gonna quit my baby
If she don't stop cheatin' and lyin'
Well, I would rather be alone
Than to be worried out of my mind

Well, I give her all of my money
I think I'm being kind
She buy a quart of bad whiskey

And the rest is beer and wine

Well, a few nights ago
I had to work kinda late
Somebody broke out of my house
Just like he was Superman's mate
Well, four o'clock in the morning, when I staggered in the block
The little moonshine joint and the rest just begin to rock
I sneaked inside to get a better view
I caught my baby doin' the mambo too
Every night I go to sleep
The blues fall down like rain
Every night I go to sleep
The blues fall down like rain
Taking pills, cheap whiskey
Just to try to ease the pain

Well it's hard to gamble
When you lose every bet
Hard to save money
When you're twenty years in debt
The blues is falling
Falling down on me like rain
I'm gonna take a shotgun now people
And disconnect my brain
Matt 'Guitar' Murphy!

I made some mistakes
Had some bad breaks
Now my mind don't work
And my whole body aches
The blues is falling
Falling down on me like rain
My life is like water
Just swirling down the drain
Well I tried standin' up
I keep on falling down
Tried standing up
Keep on fallin' down
Everywhere I go
The blues is all around
Yum dida dida, I love to play this melody
Yum dida dida, the melody you sang to me
Here beside my piano, I linger
Picking out a memory with just one finger

Yum dida dida, the music brings me close to you
Maybe if I play it long enough it will come true
Now you're far away and I'm alone and so I play
Yum dida dida, da yum dida dida, all day

Yum dida dida, the music brings me close to you
Maybe if I play it long enough it might come true
Now you're far away and I'm alone and so I play
Yum dida dida, da yum dida dida, all day

(Yum dida dida da ooh)
(Yum dida dida da ooh)
Yum dida dida, da ooh
It's fabulous, it's fantasy, it knocks me out tremendously
Your love for me
It never was obtainable and now it's unexplainable
Your love for me

It's priceless and it's precious
It's a joy to reveal
It's hard to believe just how lucky in love
You have made me feel

It's lovable, it's lyrical, it's something of a miracle
Your love for me

It's kinda like a bundle full of everything that's wonderful
Your love for me
Don't let me lose one hour of the magic
And the power of your love for me

It's priceless and it's precious
It's a joy to reveal
It's hard to believe just how lucky in love
You have made me feel
It's lovable, it's lyrical, it's something of a miracle
Your love for me
Your love for me
This is somethin' new to me
When you, ooh, you coo to me
Ooh, what you do to me?
Bop goes my heart

Lips as sweet as muscatel
Make me jingle like a bell
Then comes that dizzy spell
Bop goes my heart

Jumpin' with rhythm and romance
Lit up like a Christmas tree
Goin' around in circles
I ain't a square that I used to be

Something new to shout about
Must be love without a doubt
Baby you just knocked me out
Bop, bop, goes my heart

Got that gonest feeling
All on account of you
When I get this feelin'
Don't know what to do, what to do
This is somethin' new to me
When you ooh, you coo to me
Odeli di bop, ooh what you do to me?
Bop goes my heart

Lips as sweet as muscatel
Make me jingle like a bell
Ding a ling, zang zoong a dizzy spell
Bop goes my heart

Lit up like a Christmas tree
I ain't a square that I used to be

Somethin' new to shout about
Must be love without a doubt
Baby you just knocked me out
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
Odeli di boo, goes my heart
E, O heart
Hey, one heart is not enough, baby
Two hearts makes you feel crazy
One kiss make you feel so nice
Two kisses puts you in paradise
Two hearts, two kisses make one love

Two hearts beat as one, dear
Two arms make me know you care
I have plenty of loving
Your kiss is hotter than an oven
Two hearts, two kisses make one love

Loving you, baby, is my desire
I know that you can set this world afire
Little spark is burning deep inside
Love should be made by two

Two hearts beat as one, dear
Two arms will make me know you care
I have plenty of loving
Your kiss is hotter than an oven
Two hearts, two kisses make one love
Loving you, baby, is my desire
I know that you can set this here world afire
Little spark is burning down deep inside
Love should be made by two

Two hearts beat as one, my dear
Two arms will make me know you care
I have plenty of loving
And your kiss is hotter than an oven
Two hearts, two kisses make one love

You hear me
Two hearts, two kisses make one love

[Verse 1]
The problem is for many years
I've lived my life publicly
So it's hard for me to find a man I trust
I really trust
And every time I find someone I like, gotta worry about
If it's really me that they see
And I thought you were the one, ohhhh...

[Chorus]
Deep inside I wish that you could see
(I wish that they could see)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
(I wish that they could see)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary

[Verse 2]
I don't have a lot of friends
And sometimes I have to wonder
Is it cash they see when they look at me?
'Cause they're lookin' for a ride that's free
So I made the choice to be
Good to those who are good to me
Don't judge me or think I'm bitter
For the evil does allow me to see I'm just Mary

[Refrain]
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
(I'm just Mary, can't you see that I, I...)
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
(I said, I said I'm just Mary)
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary

[Chorus]
Deep inside I wish that you could see
(Deep inside I wish that...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
(I wish that they can see that I'm Mary, yeah)
Deep inside I wish that they could see
(Deep inside I wish that...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
(Every day of my life I wish...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that they could see
(And I wish, I wish, I wish...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary

[Bridge]
The car i drive, the clothes i wear
The diamonds, the furs, and the house
Don't make the woman
Material things don't mean nothing to me
So, I need someone to stand by me and supply my needs
And I'm just plain ol' Mary
Why can't you love the person inside, and stop lookin' outside

[Chorus]
Deep inside I wish that they could see
(I said that I'm just Mary)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that they could see
(Said I wish, and I wish, and I wish, and I wish...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary (MJB, yeah)
Deep inside I wish that you could see

If I could give you something else
But I can't give you nothing but me all day and all night (Mary)
I'm just Mary, Mary, Mary

[Chorus]
Deep inside I wish that you could see
(It can't be the clothes or the car I drive, 'cause I...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
(See the problem is, for many years, I've lived my life publicly...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Look to your heart when there are words to say
And never leave your love unspoken
Day by day, we go our thoughtless way
And only when we pray
Do we remember those we love

Too late, we find a word that's warm and kind
Is more than just a passing token
Speak your love to those who seek your love
Look to your heart, your heart will know what to say
Look to your heart today

(Too late, we find a word that's warm and kind)
(Is more than just a passing token)
Speak your love to those who seek your love
Look to your heart, your heart will know what to say
Look to your heart today

Ain't a damn thing changed just because I was gone
I be robbing mad niggas in the street for loot
Since there ain't no money in jail, I'm taking sneaks or boots
Inmates is getting bust wide open over jew-els
Names rings two bells, so large I got two cells
On the Island it was strictly a bing thing
Niggas know the half, from the L to Sing Sing
Ding Ding! Another knock out on the lock out
Money was kinda big so I bought the soap and sock out
Hit him up quick and ran up in his cell
Robbed him and scared the motherfucker to tell

I'm going all out with two fifths running wild
I'll play the low until it's time to do what I gotta do
So just hope I ain't scheming on you

First get knocked off, coming through the bullpen
A nigga running his mouth, about how he had pull when
Another nigga tries his hand he bitches up
And that'll be a nigga, that the doctors stitches up
You know a nigga pussy when he says that "I'm
Not really looking for trouble, I just wanna do my time"
Fucks me up, don't turn into a Christian now
The Lord won't save that ass when I take your chow
But after that it'll be aight shorty, shit'll be merry
Just wash my clothes and give up the commissary
Bitches I used to fuck with it is cut off
I got enough on my mind, doing time Up North
Hold up, I got my eye on these white guys
One of them got on a pair of Timbs and they my size
You know what happens next, I ain't even have to say it

Tiiiiiimes up, I'm playing the gate, watching the clock
On my way out, trade in my soap and sock for a Glock
Back on the block, seeing a lot of new faces
Which means more money from a lot of new places
I give a nigga every reason to trust me
But if you don't want to get robbed you better bust heat
Bumped into a nigga, I remember from up top
Looked him up and down (AIYYO), "What's up Hobb?"
In jail he was washing draws and shit
Now that we both out, money gots to be a Vic
A crab nigga so it's only right I shit on him
Should I smack him first, or sick the Pit on him
He said he's got a whole block and he's running it
I played him like he played hisself, I had him sonning it

Hey, little girl, comb your hair, fix your make-up, soon he will open the door
Don't think because there's a ring on your finger, you needn't try any more
For wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment that he comes home to you
I'm warning you
Day after day, there are girls at the office and the men will always be men
Don't stand him up, with your hair still in curlers, you may not see him again

Wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment he comes home to you
He's almost here, hey, little girl, better wear something pretty
Something you wear to go to the city
Dim all the lights, pour the wine, start the music, time to get ready for love
Time to get ready for love, yes it's time to get ready for love
It's time to get ready, kick your shoes off, baby....
Oh, by Jove and by Jehovah, you have set my heart aflame
(And to you, you Casanova, my reactions are the same)
I would sing thee tender verses but the flair, alas, I lack
(Oh go on, try to versify and I'll versify back)

Well, let me see now, cherry pies ought to be you
(Autumn skies ought to be you)
Mr. Pulitzer's prize ought to you
(Romeo in disguise ought to be you)
Columbine ought to be you
(Sparkling wine ought to be you)
All of Beethoven's Nine ought to be you
(Every Will Shakespeare line ought to be you)

You are so enticing, I'm starting to shake
(You are just the icing to put on my cake)
You mean I'm yummy, heaven's blue ought to be you
(Heaven too ought to be you)
Everything super-do ought to be you

Ashe Pudells ought to be you
(Orson Wells ought to be you)
Ankles like Kip Cornell's ought to be you
(Towels from Ritz hotels ought to be you)
Sweet Snow White ought to be you
(Ambrose' light) hey, that's good (ought to be you)
Eleanor wrong or right ought to be you
(Errol Flynn loose or tight) watch it (ought to be you)
You are so exciting, I can't even laugh, wanna top that one
(If you're fond of biting, I'll bite you in half)
To continue, Whistler's ma ought to be you
(Eliot's pa ought to be you)
Everything hip-hurrah ought to be you

(Ought to be you) Ought to be you
(Ought to be you) Ought to be you
(Ought to be you) Ought to be you
(Ought to be you) Ought to be you
You could leave tomorrow, fly to Mandalay
Darling, I would love you anyway
I just couldn't help but care
Anytime, anywhere

You can keep me waiting every single day
I'll be there to meet you anyway
You make life a love affair
Anytime, anywhere

Why should I lie and pretend I don't belong to you
Why even try when it makes no difference what you do
I'll be true

Take my heart completely, treat me as you may
I am yours forever anyway
All I have is yours to share
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere

Take my heart completely, treat me as you may
I am yours forever anyway
All I have is yours to share
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere
I know I said that I was leaving
But I just couldn't say goodbye
It was only self-deceiving
To walk away from someone who
Means everything in life to you
You learn from every lonely day
I've learned and I've come back to stay
Let me try again, let me try again
Think of all we had before
Let me try once more
We can have it all you and I again
Just forgive me or I'll die
Please let me try again
I was such a fool to doubt you
To try to go it all alone
There's no sense to life without you
Now all I do is just exist
And think about the chance I've missed
To beg is not an easy task
But pride is such a foolish mask
Let me try again, let me try again
Think of all we had before
Let me try once more
We can have it all you and I again
Just forgive me or I'll die
Please let me try again

[Intro]
Hugh
Hey
Oogh
Aaaghoo

[Chorus]
Get up and try again
You gotta get up and try again
What you gon' do
When the shit don't go just like you want it to go
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you gon' do
When it don't go through just like you want it to

[Verse #1]
We make the moves that break the rules
A fool and his money are soon parted
So we take from fools
If and when you ever fall down just get back up
Drop something, stop frontin', pick that shit back up
Stand for something or fall for everything
Wait for the right pitch and miss with every swing
In the absence of the truth, bullshit prevails
So what they did? Fucked around, threw truth in jail
The objective is to keep you blind
So along with the handcuffs on your arm they got shackles on your mind
Seek and ye shall find (come on)
Accepting failure is the only crime (what)
Fall down eight time and get up nine

[Chorus]
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do
When the shit don't go just like you want it to go
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do
When it don't go through just like you want it to

[Verse #2]
Plenty a times a nigga slipped and fell
Got right back up
Slipped and fell
Got up again
Slipped and fell
One time I didn't get up as quick as I did before
It was hard as shit gettin' up off that floor (real talk)
You want the raw?
Ain't even about that
It's about when opportunity knocks
How you goin' be on the ground and expect to answer the door
No matter how hard a nigga goin' through it
You get up
You better stand up like shit
I know I'm goin' do it
Don't expect
Any support from fake friends cause what you do with fake friends is figure if you done 'em wrong, make amends
Walk your road
Don't let 'em walk you
And every once in awhile it's okay
Let them think they out talked you or caught you

[Chorus]
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do?
When the shit don't go just like you want it to go
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do
When it don't go through just like you want it to

[Verse #3]
Everyday we walk these dogs, we walk through the fog and
One day where you walk, we'll put you up in the morgue (check it)
The road was rough, but I'm built for it
And when shit get tough that's real
So I'm still for it
Make every move the strongest one
Get down to go hard
Cause the last yard will be the longest one
We know the difference between right and wrong so don't mix it
And if it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it ain't smoke, don't twist it
I just hit y'all niggas with a jewel right there
But most of y'all missed it (Check it)
You fall out, get the fuck back up, try it again

[Chorus]
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do
When the shit don't go just like you want it to go
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do
When it don't go through just like you want it to
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)

[Outro]
Yo, 

[?]
Ain't nothin' too big for the lord
All you gotta do is have faith
Fall down, get back up and try again
That's all you can do
Accepting defeat is a sin

[Post-outro Chorus]
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do when the shit don't go just like you want it to go
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through

(Verse)
Understand, this ain't something that you talk about
You cats talk that gangster shit, I walk the route
I could be a grimy nigga for real sometimes
That's why I lie, rob, cheat and steal sometimes
I know God made me
But what am I supposed to think he made me for
When he only gave me war
My whole life has been a hustle
Money coming in bundles
Half-way to the struggle pulled me out the jungle
God if you listening, I need you to help me
Please cross this bridge, or you done lost the kid
My back's against the wall, I am under pressure
Like I'm about to fall, he like no, I won't let ya
(Chorus)
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through

(Verse)
Put me in the hood for a reason
I don't understand, it's cold outside, but I ain't freezing
You kept me warm enough
You kept me around long enough
Til I got strong enough
To understand the days as they come
To live the life of a rich man and the life of a bum
Yet the life of a wise man is the hardest
It forces you to sometimes play dumb when you know you the smartest
Regardless
This is the shit we go through
And have to get through
In order to get to the place that we all end up at
Think about it, heaven or hell is where you gonna end up at
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through

(Verse)
Think back when I was a little bad motherfucker
Or was I really?
Or was I just misunderstood?
Does y'all hear me?
I don't know if I can take it, slow sometimes
I don't know If I'm gonna make it, holding mine
I'ma do the best I can
As long as I got him by his hand, that's the best plan

(Chorus)
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Take back when I was a little bad motherfucker
Take back when I was a little bad motherfucker
Take back when I was a little bad motherfucker
Take back when I was a little bad motherfucker
Take back when I was a little bad motherfucker

[Verse 1]
First you take me to the limit then expect me to stop
You know I'm sick and tired of waiting for the penny to drop
You make a living out of making people think you give it all away
But you and I know very well there's always gonna be a price to pay

[Pre Chorus]
But times are tough, and life is hard
You've got enough
And so you'll pardon me for saying

[Chorus]
You've had it all your way
You've got to know someday
You'll have to share or there'll be hell to pay
There will be hell to pay
There will be hell to pay
There will be hell to pay
There's gonna be hell to pay
Do do do do do do do do do, do do do do do do

[Verse 1]

I wanna be around to pick up the pieces when somebody breaks your heart
Somebody twice as smart as I
Somebody who will swear to be true like you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn that misery loves company, wait and see
I wanna be around to see how he does it when he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits, so fine
And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
That's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
Like you, like you broke mine
Gonna live my life, make it through the night
It's gon' be alright, cause I'm a get mine
When it comes that day, carry me away
It's gon' be OK, cause I done did mine

I extort niggas, so don't come up short
You cowards ain't got the heart to do shit but talk
Give a fuck who you know and who your mans is
It's just you and me here and he's gon' handle his
From semi to fully, bitch, I've always been a bully
Picked on niggas, couldn't do nothin' to me
So what, you a little older now, and what?
Still sittin' down to piss, stand up
Shit, I throw at 'em hard, go at 'em hard
I ain't gotta blow at 'em hard
Got 'em droppin' their guard
Cause niggas respect the dog in me
And the cat in you that I'm able to see
That's why I'm on the ground and you up in the tree
Who the fuck you think you talkin' to, nigga this is me
Come on, lil' man, don't be like that
What did daddy say, daddy said he'll be right back
Listen...

Gonna live my life, make it through the night
It's gon' be alright, cause I'm a get mine
When it comes that day, carry me away
It's gon' be OK, cause I done did mine

I rob niggas that I hang with
You know X up to the same shit
EFL, I bang with
Pull out the thang quick, clear out the whole room
Step back, ch-ch, what, nigga boom!
Lift niggas off their feet for thinkin' it's sweet
My hands on the heat, your mans in the street
I ain't got a problem with poppin', we're all goin' to jail
My shit stay off safety, my aim as well
I get down like I used to
Y'all niggas think somethin' soft
We can get off cause dog, I get loose too
Denna denna dehhh, like the Juice Crew
When I cruise through, bitch, you gonna lose too
Blam blam, that's how a nigga gettin' at 'em
Blam blam, I stay spittin' somethin' at 'em
Whatever, vato, I know you're pussy, nigga, I can see through you
Whatchu expect me to do!?

Gonna live my life, make it through the night
It's gon' be alright, cause I'm a get mine
When it comes that day, carry me away
It's gon' be OK, cause I done did mine
Cats is sloppy, stoppin' me is outta the question
I'm always gon' be the best and that's a confession
I ain't talkin' shit, nig, I'm talkin' what's real
Dog with the grill, walk what I feel
Fuck you and them niggas you run with
Niggas get done quick over some dumb shit
I'm startin' to smell pussy 'round here
A little bit of fear, figured I'd throw that in the air
Now, walk with it

Gonna live my life, make it through the night
It's gon' be alright, cause I'm a get mine
When it comes that day, carry me away
It's gon' be OK, cause I done did mine
Have you ever passed the corner of Fourth and Grand?
Where a little ball o' rhythm has a shoe shine stand
People gather 'round and they clap their hands

He's a great big bundle of joy
He pops the boogie woogie rag
The Chattanoogie shoe shine boy

He charges you a nickel to shine one shoe
He makes the oldest kind o' leather look like new
You feel as though you wanna dance when he gets through

He's a great big bundle o' joy
He pops the boogie woogie rag
The Chattanoogie shoe shine boy

It's a wonder that the rag don't tear
Man, the way this cat makes it pop mop
You ought to see him fan the air
With his hoppity-hippity-hippity-hoppity-hoppity-hippity-hop
He opens up for business when the clock strikes nine
He likes to catch 'em early when they're feelin' fine
Everybody gets a little rise 'n shine

With the great big bundle o' joy
He pops a boogie woogie rag
The Chattanoogie shoe shine boy

It's a wonder that the rag don't tear
The way he makes it pop
The way he fans the air, here he goes
With his hoppity-hippity-hippity-hoppity-hoppity-hippity-hop

He opens up for business when the clock strikes nine
He likes to grab 'em early when they're feelin' fine
Everybody gets a little rise 'n shine

With the great big bundle o' joy
He pops the boogie woogie rag
The Chattanoogie shoe shine boy
He's my budle of joy

Man, you know one thing
If you don't get your foot out of the way in time
This cat will bear down, right through the leather
And manicure your toes
That's crazy
The niggas got it
You should solve them
Fuck the bullshit nigga
That dog is a problem
Problem, problem

When I walk through a jam, no one knows who I am
Put your head on my chest, and I am Mr. Success
Never closed me a deal, all at once I'm a wheel
Just your head on my chest, and I'm Mr. Success
Why I once knew a worrying man, he was a hurrying man
With never a second to play
He had appointments to keep, people to meet
And it took thirty hours to make him a day
Not for me, not what I wanna be
Just your head on my chest, and I'm Mr. Success
(instrumental)
Why, I once knew a worrying man, he was a hurrying man
With never a second to play
He had appointments to keep, lots of people to meet
And it took thirty hours to make him a day
Not for me, not what I wanna be
Put my love to the test, that's when I'm at my best
Cause with you, pretty baby, standing by my side
I couldn't be a failure even if I tried
Cause you make me Mr. Success
What a difference a day made
Twenty four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain

My yesterdays was blue, blue days
Today I'm a part of you, dear
My lonely, lonely, lonely nights are through, dear
Since you said you were mine

What a difference a day makes
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above they might be stormy
Since that moment of bliss, ohh, that thrilling kiss

It's heaven when you, when you
Find romance on the menu
What a difference a day makes
Well, I know the difference is you

It's heaven, heaven, heaven when you, when you
Find love and romance on the menu
Ohh, what a difference, what a difference a day makes
I know in my heart, the difference is you
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get low
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
Your girl just kissed a girl
I do bi chicks
Shake for a shake
I'm throwing these Emirates in the sky
Spinning this As-salamu alaykum
Peace to M.O.N.E.Y
I love my beaches, south beaches
Surfboard and high tide
I could just roll up
Cause I'm swoll up
So that birthday cake get a cobra
Buggati for real, I'm cold bruh
That auto-biography rover
Got the key to my city it's over
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's
I said rackets, ratchets hold up
(I said rackets, ratchets hold up)
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get low
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
And they already know me
It's going down for real
It's going down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah my girl you never seen her
'Cause my tints by limousines
My touch is the Midas
We de-plus your man to minus
My team blowing on that slam
Make you cough-cough that's Bronchitis
Put your hands up
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double up tonkers
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get low
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
If you should meet some lonely soul
Who on this earth can't reach his gold
And he's travelin' down the road so dark and dim
Lend the hand, say a prayer
Give a smile that he might share
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him)
Befriend each stranger in the night
Help to make his burdens light
Lift up the fallin' ones and be a friend
(Be a friend)
Shed a tear, share a sight
Share his fears don't pass him by
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(It could be you instead of him)
Shed a tear, share a sigh
Share his fears don't pass him by
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(It could be you instead of him)
I gotta move faster

All because of technolog-ay
I always got to play
Trust me shorty, I'll be on my way
I gotta mova faster
Can't slow down
Gotta move faster
Need a lil mo power
Hook it up so it'll go faster
Feel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts
Something's telling me I must go home
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own

Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco
Gotta do the things I wanna do
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you

Talk about the life in Massachusetts
Speak about the people I have seen
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen

I will remember Massachusetts
I will remember Massachusetts
I will remember Massachusetts
I will remember Massachusetts
Hook: Pullin up in that new Bentley truck

Pullin up in the new Bentley truck. 3x

Chorus 1:

Chorus 2:
Patrick Ewing on my shoes, AK47, 9 millimeter and rube rubas is for my tools
80 thousand in tattoos, your girl she suckin and fuckin me in the bathroom

Soulja boy tellem a fool. Ridin around in the trap, Ridin around with the pistol it's sitting all in my lap. Fitted pistol in yo mouth it go through the gap

You kno that these niggas they hate I'm real and they fake
Go hard for the cake, I'm dumping bodies in lake, to land me estate
Lil Soulja the great, I'm going hard in the paint

[Chorus:]
People see me in the street now
They wave at me and they ask me turn my beat down
Turn my beat down, turn my beat down
I tell em never I forever let my beat pound

[Verse 1:]
I keep my speekers in the trunk just like that yay
Everybody where I'm from like that like that bass
Just can't wait till I get that woopty just to ride threw the hood
Buy theyself an amp and hook some woofers up to it
If your motor running good and your 808 bumpin
That's all that really matter you can't tell a nigga nothing
Nevermind what you ride when it's dark outside
And there's broads outside, you just park outside
Pop your trunk and cut your music up loud
Now watch a crowd around bet they dig a nigga now
And my beat down low and my top let back
Now cut it to the max like I never said that (hey)

[Chorus:]
People see me in the street now
They wave at me and they ask me turn my beat down
Turn my beat down, turn my beat down
I tell em never I forever let my beat pound (hey)
Police ask to turn my beat down
He let me go, I turn the corner let my beat pound
Turn my beat down, won't turn my beat down
I tell em never I forever let my beat pound

[Verse 2:]
When my girl ride with me, gotta cover my seat
Cause that thang go to skeetin, and when I cut up my beat
Pumpin something Grand Hustle in a 96?
Even amplify my tweeters so my music ain't muffled
Your ass in trouble if you pull up next to me
When it's really up high you can't hear yourself think
Cause my speaker box the biggest trunk sound like a midget
Tryna get up out of there 15's stay hittin
We be coming from a distance out of everbodys vision
They don't matter what I'm playing, I make everybody listen
See I'm turning around wondering how I get so loud
Ears ringing all day cause my shit so loud

[Chorus:]
People see me in the street now
They wave at me and they ask to turn my beat down
Turn my beat down, turn my beat down
I tell em never I forever let my beat pound
Police ask me turn my beat down
He let me go, I turn the corner let my beat pound
Turn my beat down, won't turn my beat down
I tell em never I forever let my beat pound

[Verse 3:]
When I pull up to the light and my shit so high
People mad I don't see them cause I'm sitting so high
Looking at me like they stupid they can't hear they're own music
But ain't nothing they can do they just gotta listen to it
Jackie chan in my trunk just like young dro
I love that song cause the bass so low
They be setting off alarms
The sound like I drop bombs
Pumpin trick www. thug. Com
R.I.P. Pimp c number 3 ridin dirty
Own it first I cut it up and make sure everybody heard it
Shaving swerving bumping young jeezy
Got him on the map best belive me when you hear me say I got it in my lap
In the trap bumpin old B gizzle hot boy
Old lady on the porch holling what is that noise
People asking me to cut it off
I roll my window down and I tell em it ain't nothing dawg

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2]

Ladies, we gon try something different this time
I ain't sayin you wrong for doin it how you do it, fellas
But its something different
(When put a lil extra in it man Im tellin you, you get a lil more power)
Sing it ladies, listen
I see you standin here lookin real nice
I bet I know whats going through your mind
You probably thinkin that every man in here
Is lookin for somebody for one night
Your friends drug you out cause you ain't wanna come
Thats why youre standin there actin stuck up
Holdin up the wall, you got a misconception of men
Thinkin were all the same, full of games
All because you ended up with the wrong one
I bet you think that chivalry is gone
Cause you ain't seen nothing like it in so long
Its when you open her door, walk on one side of her
You give her your coat when its cold outside
A man ain't a man until hes man to his woman
Compliments and flowers really lets her know that you want her
Let me spell it out C H I V A L R Y
Girl, if you feel like chivalry is gone girl, Ima change your mind
Your probably like, why did I pick you
Well, Im over there, you L double okay at me like, ooh
And I was wonderin whats your N A M E
How you gon A C T when I C O M E over and ask you what it do?
And her reply was S O double R Y
Thanks for the compliment
But I gotta let you know Im probably not your type
You got a misconception of me, listen and Ill make you see
Dont let one B A D a double P L E spoil it for the bunch
I bet you think that chivalry is gone
Cause you ain't seen nothing like it in so long
Its when you open her door, walk on one side of her
You give her your coat when its cold outside
A man ain't a man until hes man to his woman
Compliments and flowers really lets her know that you want her
Let me spell it out C H I V A L R Y
Girl, if you feel like chivalry is gone girl, Ima change your mind
Now this ain't for everybody man
So dont get twisted on what Im sayin
If you wit somebody right now
But you feel that they playin
Then I know that you understand
How it feel when you talk for hours
Show up at the door wit some flowers
When you put a lil extra in it
Man it give you just a lil more power
Most of us go the extra mile
To get what even though it ain't our style
The stuff Im talkin most ain't seen
Or heard since they was just a lil' child
Im tryna show you how to really get her on
Im tryna show you how to really get her home
Im tryna show you how to have shorty mind
All messed up in the zone, just tell her I
I bet you think that chivalry is gone
Cause you ain't seen nothing like it in so long
Its when you open her door, walk on one side of her
You give her your coat when its cold outside
A man ain't a man until hes man to his woman
Compliments and flowers really lets her know that you want her
Let me spell it out C H I V A L R Y
Girl, if you feel like chivalry is gone girl, Ima change your mind

[Verse 1]
One young fawn, in a maze
Eager-eyed and the milky haze
Scampers round, heavy feet
Spinny legs and knobbly knees
Twitching tail and tongue-in-cheek
She munches fruit from harlot trees
Looking smug and fresh and pleased
She wanders so sloppily and eats

[Chorus]
She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and she's icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It makes her well up, it makes her well up
She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and she's icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It makes her well up, it makes her well up

[Verse 2]
She feels a lick, down her nape
It looks up with a fair glass face
The peeling palms of dirty hands
Jointed thumbs with drumstick ends
Yellow nails from pinching fags
A slimy creature lacking clad
He pulls his fingers from her mind
And lets her see, just like she was blind!

[Outro]
She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and she's icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It makes her well up, it makes her well up
She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and she’s icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It make her well up, it makes her well up

The day is past and gone
The evening shades appear
May we all, may we remember, remember well
For the night of death draws now
We lay our garments, our garments by
Upon our beds to rest
For death shall disrobe, it's gonna disrobe us all
Of all, of all we, what we possess
Wonder if you know, I wonder if you mind, I wanna know why
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
For death shall disrobe, disrobe us all
Lord, Lord, Lord, oh oh...

Welcome to the real world
She said to me condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well, I never lived the dream of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
So the good boys and girls
Take the so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories tiny tragedies
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above
I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for

[Verse]
Villain man never ran with krills in his hand and
Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion grand
Tillin' the wasteland sands
Raps on backs of treasure maps, stacks to the ceilin' fan
He rest when he's ashes
Ask 'em after ten miles in his galoshes, smashes stashes
Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
They supposed to know, it show when his aura glow
Get from out the row, when he get dough, it's horrible
Time is money, spend, waste, save, invest the fess
For 10 Ks, he'll cave a chicken chest S
Yes, y'all, the dub will get ya trickles
The best ballers pitch in and rub together nickels
But tut tut, he 'bout to change the price again
It go up each time he blow up like hydrogen
Villain here, have 'em shrillin' in fear
And won't stop top illin' 'til he a gazillionaire
Grillin' stare, yeah, ya boy had drama
Got 'em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma
Once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
Plus a brand new chrome smoker with the triggers broke
I thought I told 'em firing pins was separate
He find out later when he tries to go and rep it
Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah
Charged in advance to translate it and ignored it sorta
One monkey don't stop no slaughter
A junkie wanna cop a quarter ton, run for the border
Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill
Flow skill, still, there's no thrill
Fill a billion 10K bills in his pill'a
Villain, when it gets realer, split the skrilla with
Dilla his is agenda is clear
Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here
It's not meant for the seein'
Went through the ceilin' after enterin' his center bein'
A new meanin' to sales through the roof
Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof
It's the return of the tramp
Who do a duet jam when Ernest goes to camp
For the right earn, nah mean like Vern
We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn
Jiminy crickets
He gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off sickly lyrics
One man's waste is another man's soap
Son's fanbase know the brotha man's dope
A real weirdo with a bugged rare flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
Black licorice and equally as yucky
How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be seemin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile, ding, sparklin' jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach was never dead
Live for a week then dehydrate with a severed head
Instead, it was depicted as flicked in
Split, the wick's lit

[Chorus: Plies]
You a real tall glass of water
Just looking at you made me thirsty
Oh Lord shes the preacher's daughter
But still I want her in the worst way
She shouldn't have came her in the first place
Special occasion it's her birthday
I swear to God I'm glad I caught her
Come blow the candles out baby

[Verse 1: Plies]
Ok, ok, ok, Animal ok, ok, Glamorous ok, ok
She's the preacher's daughter, but I'm a ghetto star, ok
She ain't going nowhere(why) because I just beat her raw, ok
Hooked her on the first shot, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, ok
I let her play Khloe, I just play Lamar, ok
She just hit my cell (why) cause she done left her bra, ok
I, I, I got her on quavo
Got her with her shorts off, looking at her vajayo
Driving with my fingers crossed hoping I don't go to hell
I, I, I got her rolling
I, I got her losing focus

[Chorus: Plies]
You a real tall glass of water
Just looking at you made me thirsty
Oh Lord shes the preacher's daughter
But still I want her in the worst way
She shouldn't have came her in the first place
Special occasion it's her birthday
I swear to God I'm glad I caught her
Come blow the candles out baby

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
She like a devil with her red dress
I wanna get her in my incents
And plus I was just too fresh
She was flirting getting too fresh
She the preacher daughter on the alter
But, I spoil her like her father
I school her like a toddler
She with Gucci, so don't bother
I go harder and grind harder
I ride hard as she loving my persona
The aroma, a Kush ammonia
It's what she smells and I can't keep my hands off her (its Gucci)

[Chorus: Plies]
You a real tall glass of water
Just looking at you made me thirsty
Oh Lord shes the preacher's daughter
But still I want her in the worst way
She shouldn't have came her in the first place
Special occasion it's her birthday
I swear to God I'm glad I caught her
Come blow the candles out baby

[Verse 3: Plies]
Red plus she bowlegged her cherry no pit, yea
Caught on the six yep for later on the six, yea
One thing I can say about her, shawty takes the stick, yea
She was greener then a motherfucker now I got her talking slick
She get it from her momma, all in the hips
I love walking behind her, so I can see her twist
I think I hit her kidneys the last time I ripped
I felt kind of bad though, so I left her a tip
Her Becky on steroids, that's little momma gift
She don't like to drink it strong though, so I just let her sip
4 o'clock in the morning, that liquor had me stiff
But that's my little baby she know how to make a grip

[Chorus: Plies]
You a real tall glass of water
Just looking at you made me thirsty
Oh Lord shes the preacher's daughter
But still I want her in the worst way
She shouldn't have came her in the first place
Special occasion it's her birthday
I swear to God I'm glad I caught her
Come blow the candles out baby
You've given me a true love and ev'ry day I thank you love
For a feeling that's so new, so inviting, so exciting
Whenever you are near, I Hear A Symphony
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly, oo, your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind
I'm lost in a world made for you and me
Oo love me
Whenever you are near I Hear A Symphony play sweet and tenderly
Ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby
Baby, baby, I feel a joy within
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now baby

Baby, baby, those tears that fill my eyes
I care not for myself but for those
Who've never felt the joy we've felt
Whenever you are near
I Hear A Symphony each time you speak to me
I hear a tender rhapsody of love, love
Baby, baby, as you stand up holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air now
Baby, baby, don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
Oo so close to me, baby, baby
Baby, baby, I Hear A Symphony, a tender melody
Ah it goes on and on and on and on and
On and on and on and on and
On and on and on and on and
You go hard, I go the hardest

Well she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Well she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man now
And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now

And she'll have fun, fun, fun
Till her daddy takes the t-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the t-bird away)

Well the girls can't stand her
'Cause she walks, looks, and drives like an ace now
(You walk like an ace now, you walk like an ace)
She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race now
(You look like an ace now, you look like an ace)
A lotta guys try to catch her
But she leads them on a wild goose chase now
(You drive like an ace now, you drive like an ace)
And she'll have fun, fun, fun
Till her daddy takes the t-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the t-bird away)

Well you knew all along
That your dad was gettin' wise to you now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
And since he took your set of keys
You've been thinking that your fun is all through now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)

But you can come along with me
'Cause we gotta a lot of things to do now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)

And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the t-bird away)

On the beach I build a castle
Out of loneliness and sand
I'm the saddest boy I know
Just had to build me a wonderland

'Cause when you came by hand in hand
With another guy
I just could not stop those big tears
Falling from my eyes

The high tides coming in
Oh no no no, I can't stand to see my kingdom end
Her voice laughed at me and said
"Oh sad boy, never build your castle by the sand"

The tide came rushing in
Took my poor castle out to the sea
If the ocean be that strong
Well then, that's where I wanna be

When she reads in the paper
That this same sad boy has drowned
Will she laugh with him
And say "That funny clown"

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Holdin’ up Holdin’ holdin’ holdin’ up…

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My main bitch, her anklet
‘Bout the same size of a ankle monitor
If a diva late one time I’mma put her ass on probation
I’mma give her two scratches
She’s a fuckin’ good woman, I’mma give her a life
I’mma walk by shinin’ with a bitch
Aye, say I had enough in my life
I got 80 chains, I got 100 rings
And a nigga can’t take my ice
Caught a murder charge, but I beat the shit
‘Cause a nigga tried to take my life
I’m a millionaire, but I’m a country boy
And my right hand man got a Tonka toy
I sell, charge, I’m servin’ boy
Major saver, I’m the golden boy
And I serve the pass like Lawyer Milloy
Poppin’ and poppin’ and poppin’ the shit
Talkin’ that shit, now you shot in the head
Brick Squad niggas don’t shoot in the leg
Shouts to our fallen, I ball till I fall, and
The neighbors don’t talk ‘cause the neighbors are scared
A white girl, a black girl, a hell of a mix
Rollin’ up kush while they suckin’ my dick
On my chain is a tag team
All my niggas gettin’ money
You can get tied, then tagged then me and your freak’ll start fuckin’
Got two choppers, it’s a tag team
Four bad bitches and it’s all to me
Had to break into like ten houses to ride on these 9x17s
Oops, my fault, that’s your team’s line
I ain’t have time, I was grindin’ real hard
People goin’ crazy, and my mama goin’ crazy but belive it or not, bitch, I gotta thank the Lord
Ballin’ so hard when I came out of jail
Now I’mma get a scene and weigh the doja up
Sippin’ on lean ‘til I throw up
What you want to be when you grow up?

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
GuWop GuWop GuWop, nigga
All these hoes screamin’ GuWop, nigga
GuWop GuWop GuWop, nigga
All these hoes screamin’ GuWop, nigga
GuWop GuWop GuWop, nigga
GuWop GuWop GuWop, nigga
GuWop GuWop GuWop, nigga
All these hoes screamin’ GuWop, nigga

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Y’all scooted in my team
Flockaveli that’s my shooter
R.I.P to my nigga Dunk
Think about your ass every day
Momma called, said she need some money
Sent her ten bands and it made her smile
Child nude, no shoes
Got to get him those new Trews
Mail your head to your mama
Hide your body in a restaurant
Nigga wasn’t shit anyway
Playin’ around with my awards
Gucci Mane is a cool dude
But a nigga might turn into a werewolf
Got a stash box and it’s all hundreds
And your CEO ain’t worth nothin’
Made a half a mil’ in three weeks
Gucci Mane, I’m a blessed man
I’m a real man, you can’t feel me, man
These fucked niggas keep tryin’ to hold me back
Matter of fact, nigga slow down
When you drivin’ in the ‘Lac, you gon’ spill my ‘Gnac
Like Pinky, nigga, I’m big and black
Rock so many chains it gon hurt my neck

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
GuWop GuWop GuWop, nigga
All these hoes screamin’ GuWop, nigga
GuWop GuWop GuWop, nigga
All these hoes screamin’ GuWop, nigga
GuWop GuWop GuWop, nigga
GuWop GuWop GuWop, nigga
GuWop GuWop GuWop, nigga
All these hoes screamin’ GuWop, nigga

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
Trinidad and Gucci Mane

Trinidad and Gucci Mane
I said Trinidad and Gucci Mane
I’m turnt up, fuck off
I said Trinidad and Gucci Mane
Trinidad and Gucci Mane
Them pussy nigga call me Trinidad
Them bad hoes call me TJ
I got a girlfriend in Magic City
And a side bitch in the Blue Flame
Her pussy bomb as Saddam Hussein, pussy nigga
Gucci needed me for a verse
Call me up, nigga tap me in
This verse here, a tragedy
Bad bitches they after me
Only buy molly from rich hoes
‘Cause these broke hoes be taxin’ me
Got a problem with it?
Do somethin’ ‘bout it
Bomb squad like “Hoorah!”
Real niggas call Gucci
But these hoes call “GuWop”

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
GuWop GuWop GuWop, nigga
All these hoes screamin’ GuWop, nigga
GuWop GuWop GuWop, nigga
All these hoes screamin’ GuWop, nigga

I said Trinidad and Gucci Mane
Trinidad and Gucci Mane…

[Chorus]
I'll take care of you with all my heart and all my soul
I'll take care of you with all that's in me, you are my love

[Verse 1]
And good things, I pledge my love to you
Put your trust in me
Make no mistake, you see
It's no good being all alone
You need someone to call your own

[Chorus]
I'll take care of you with all my heart and all my soul
I'll take care of you with all that's in me 'cause you are my love

[Verse 2]
This is a golden age of happiness
But to know it, really know it, you need togetherness
Take my hand, let me lead you girl
Let me show you, show you to my very world

[Chorus]
I'll take care of you, oh, just don't leave me baby
I'll take care of you with all that's in me, you are my love
Hey, I'll take care of you, you were born to love me, baby
The old man turned off the radio
Said, "Where did all of the old songs go
Kids sure play funny music these days
They play it in the strangest ways"
Said, "It looks to me like they've all gone wild
It was peaceful back when I was a child
Well, man, could it be that the girls and boys
Are trying to be heard above your noise?"
And the lonely voice of youth cries
"What is truth?"
A little boy of three sittin' on the floor
Looks up and says, "Daddy, what is war?"
"Son, that's when people fight and die"
The little boy of three says, "Daddy, why?"
A young man of seventeen in Sunday school
Being taught the golden rule
And by the time another year has gone around
It may be his turn to lay his life down
Can you blame the voice of youth for asking
"What is truth?"
A young man sittin' on the witness stand
The man with the book says, "Raise your hand
Repeat after me, I solemnly swear"
The man looked down at his long hair
And although the young man solemnly swore
Nobody seems to hear anymore
And it didn't really matter if the truth was there
It was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair
And the lonely voice of youth cries
"What is truth?"
The young girl dancing to the latest beat
Has found new ways to move her feet
The young man speaking in the city square
Is trying to tell somebody that he cares
Yeah, the ones that you're calling wild
Are gonna be the leaders in a little while
This old world's wakin' to a new born day
And I solemnly swear that it'll be their way
You better help the voice of youth find
"What is truth"
And the lonely voice of youth cries
"What is truth?"
TIM BERG
I've been watching you, you've been hurting too
You give all your love, nothing left to show

Watching life go by, no one whom to share

I will give to you the love you seek and more

[Verse 1]
Here he is, our little bundle of joy
We did it, honey, it's a baby boy
We'll love him and raise him till he finally leaves us
What should we name him?
How about Adolf?
Little Adolf

[Verse 2]
He's growin' up like little boys do
He's grown a mustache and he's only two
He's a pyrotechnic and he loves to play with knives
And our little buddy gives the weirdest high fives

[Chorus]
Little Adolf
Little Adolf
Little Adolf
Little Adolf
He's a dictator-tot
Dictator-tot

[Verse 3]
He get's a little bit angry, but he's smart as hell
And who taught him how to speak German so well?
He doesn't like milk, soda hurts his head
I tried to give him juice this is what he said:

[Spoken Interlude]
I hate Jews

Okay, Hitler, please drink your juice. I'm tired I want to go to bed

Just you know what?
Get the Jews out of here
Out of this house, out of this country, now

Hitler, get the ju-
What do you want me to do with-?

Put the Jews in camps and separate them

Separate juice?
Hitler, what do you want me to do?
Like separate them by flavor
By, like, concentration?

Concentration... ooh

[Chorus Outro]
Little Adolf
He's a dictator-tot

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' money, I'm ballin' hard
Heard them niggas hatin on me, cause they fallin' off
Honestly bitch, I'm ballin' hard
Yeah It's my time, and I'mma shine just like my Audemars, my audemars
Bust down, and iced out
Just hit the switch, that bitch be shining when the lights out
Bust down, and iced out
Look at my wrist, that bitch be shining like a lighthouse
I spit a verse, that's like a point
I do it short, that's like a joint
That's like a bird, oh nigga you ain't heard
I'm in the mixin like a saute when it's gettin stirred
Pull up in the Maserati, got them bitches lookin' at me like I shot somebody
I'm stackin' paper, I need that dropped Ferrari
Got them trying to claim a nigga and we not on Maury
My AP, cool as an A/C
Look in the magazine, the same exact as Jay-Z (Same one)
I'm gettin' money, nigga you straight flea
That bitch be shining thunder up I call it KD
I'm ballin' in this bitch like it's my motherfucking born day
Bout to get a swiss account, so fuck bout what the forms say
I just did 100 shows, ain't never get a tour date
MMG we winning bitch, go check what the score say

[Chorus]
Hundred stacks, Frank watch
Mill at the crib with them tools out
Money nigga, head huntin'
Big timer, rap hunter
Uptown soldier on the battlefield
Big timer blood gettin killa kill
High roller been doing this since the 90s bitch
Flippin' birds shippin' how we did this shit
Swag dawg, the money hangin'
A hundred stacks, been bangin'
High roller, shock collar
Ferrari speed, niggas been ballin'
Cherry on them flakes when we on the mound
Fire on that candy blowin' out the pound
Bad bitch stand 6 feet, standin' on this money bought a new fleet

[Chorus]
Look at my wrist, that shit 200 hundred thou'
Cut the lights down, look at me now
Back then they didn't want me, now I'm hot and they all on me
Pull a bunch of these white bitches, I'm chillin hard at the Pink Pony
Gucci Mane and Meek Mills, I'm ballin hard, I'm too trill
New ride with new money, so I had to put it on new rims
Hawks game, I'm court side
Red bottles on the wet floor, give them up to the athletes
Smellin' like a pound of dro, Versace shades I'm yoked out
Rolls Royce it smoked out, parked in front your whole house
I blew the horn, she jumped out
Maybach on cascade, the one on down my west side
4 girls, only fucked 3
Cause one left, and she missed out

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Going nowhere fast, we've reached the climax
Were together now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away
Do we separate? Oh
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late
We've reached the climax, climax

[Verse 1]
I've fallen somehow, feet off the ground
Love is the cloud that keeps raining down
That keeps raining down
That keeps raining down

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
You say it's better if we love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had off my mind
Where are you now? When I need you around
I'm on my knees but it seems we're...

[Chorus]
Going nowhere fast, we've reached the climax
Were together now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to run away...

[Verse 2]
I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all, at all, at all, at all

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Climax (Ah, ah)
Climax (Ah, ah)
Climax

...Hoody hooo....
(whispering) Shhh! Listen! Listen, boy, listen!

Fart
Both laughing

Nasty
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
I've become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
I've become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you
And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
I've become so tired
So much more aware
I'm becoming this
All I want to do
Is be more like me
And be less like you
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb
I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
We are one, one for sure

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
I'm so fucking awesome – my marbles, I lost ‘em
I'm taking everything – everything but precaution
Your bitches wanna call us, and text us like Austin
Pussy make me hard, pussy niggas make me nauseous
I've been on my feet since the day I started walking
Bitch, I think I'm MC Hammer, put the nail in the coffin
See coke in a drought, sell pussy at an auction
Bullets got a nigga runnin' fast enough to race horses
‘Round here, you sniff these lines, you don't cross ‘em
Kill your ass and leave you behind, like an orphan
I swear it happens all the time, very often
Still gettin' baseball money, Barry Larkin
‘Round here we play for keeps, yeah we eatin' but we starvin'
I get me a little money, try to spread it like margarine
I'm flyer than a motherfucker, all my flights chartered
Green kush, red flag, black car, white lawyer
I'm good

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I say, I go in in my beast mode – rappin' niggas I eat those
I tell a bitch take a deep breath then bend her knees like a free throw
I don't want me no good girl, I fell in love with these freak hoes
In my bedroom, I'll make a movie, it's starring me with that Lee Rose
I ball hard like D-rose, my stash on closet
Racks in my pocket, these racks I deposit
Got racks on my conscious, money on my mind
I've got shooters on my team, they've got bodies on their nines
Look at that bad bitch right there – see that body on that dime?
I ain't swimming in no hoe, you know I'm probably on that grind
All these niggas hatin' on me, me – but I ain't on that time, time
I be in that back, nigga, and I ain't talkin' 'bout swine
I'm talkin' 62 West, they say a nigga too fresh
You a rat, your homie singing, you should do a duet
Shorty say she love my swag, I make that pussy too wet
You niggas banned, and my hoes, and I'm like "why'd they do that? "
Go!

[Verse 3]
Um, I don't have a conscious – all my friends are monsters
They visit me so constant and talk to me about nonsense
Like stabbing you and then watching you fight for your life like you boxing
Bitch, deuce-deuce – I smoke that OG killer, Bobby Johnson
I'll ollie over that bitch's head, it's Hollygrove 'til I'm fuckin' dead
I did a bid for that toast, so fuck with me, I'll treat you like buttered bread
But I still go hard with no regard – Earth Day? Shit, bitch, go to Mars
Leave a nigga dead in the gutter
I just beat him with a bloody-ass bowling ball
I'm fresh as hand sanitizer – don't hate the game, just analyze it
Two Xanax, I'm fantasizing about fat bitches' panty sizes
Took a bullet to the chest? Be a man about it
Stop actin' like a little bitch, nigga
Most of y'all niggas is bitch niggas
I got a tiger in the basement, Big Tigger
My hair long and my dick big
My hair long and my dick big
My hair long and my dick big
My money long and my weed strong
I feed hunger, I no longer get my weed from Fee
I pull that freedom off my waist, now watch me let freedom ring (ding)
That's the way you do it
That's the way you do it
That's the way you do it
Baby let me tell you about how I feel
This urge is seizing me, controlling it's unreal
Ahh baby, I wanna let you know
You got me yearning, so baby let me show
Ooh, I want you baby
Gotta know I need you here with me
This ain't the right way
Gotta find another way to earn your love
Just give me a clue, 'cause you know
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willin'
Cryin', beggin', pleadin' on your knees
Pardon my expression
But the feeling I have is so strong
I guess you know this isn't easy to do
I keep tryin' and tryin' to give my love to you
Ooh, I want you baby
Gotta let you know I need you here with me
This ain't the right way
Gotta find another way to earn your love
Just give me a clue, 'cause you know
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, you know you gotta be willing
Cryin', beggin', pleadin' on your knees
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willin'
Cryin', beggin', pleadin' on your knees
That's the way you do it
That's the way you do it
That's the way you do it
Ooh, I want you baby
Gotta let you know I need you here with me
This ain't the right way
Gotta find another way to earn your love
Give me a clue
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willin'
Cryin', beggin', pleadin' on your knees
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willin'
Cryin', beggin', pleadin' on your knees
Sympin' ain't easy
Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
Sympin' ain't easy
And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willin'
Cryin', beggin', pleadin' on your knees
Sympin' ain't
Sympin' ain't
Sympin' ain't
He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be your preacher, when your soul is down
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but
He'll never love you like I can, can
He could be a stranger, given the circumstance
He could be a trophy, of a one night stand
He could have your humour, I don't understand but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
Why are you looking down only one road
Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can
A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be a silence in this mayhem, but then again
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
Why are you looking down only one road
Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
We both have demons, that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're still seeking an honest man
I'm self deceiving but please
Why are you looking down only one road
Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
Why are you looking down only one road
Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day

Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)

[Tinie Tempah]
I buy time in Switzerland
I drive round in Monaco
I shook hands with Royalty
I make songs that monarchs know
Ti Ti Ti La So fa?
Mi Mi Mi Ra Do?
Call me Aloe Blacc cause I Need That Dollar yo
Ha ha
Hic-hic-hiccup
Blame it on the liquor
I came through like a stick up
Now I'm ballin' like a kick up
I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of Nip Tuck
And yes I am the best man, I'm so sorry bout the mix up
Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill
You know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love

Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone
But I won't be gone for too long

[Tinie Tempah - Verse]
In Amsterdam, and Milan
Just came off Aussie tour
You've never seen this before?
I'm the one like 2 plus 3
M-M-M-Minus four
Fe-fe-fe-fi-fo-fum
Everytime I can stalk
Yeh, yeh, I'm honest I landed in a rocket
With a crown inside my watch and silver B sign on my bonnet
You don't need a thermometer to tell you who's the hottest
Ip dip do muthaf-cker you are not it

Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill
You know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane

Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)
(check this haha, let's go!)

[Tinie Tempah]

I'm in it, i'm in it to the finish
I keep them bottles coming like my card ain't got no limit
Got some friends that play in football
And Some friends that play in cricket
And a mistress that is fine
Like a fu*king parking ticket
Ha-ha

I said I'm in it, I'm in it til the finish
I keep them bottles coming, til there ain't nutin' in it
I'm like mario on mushrooms
I'm like popeye on some spinach
We gon' keep it comin' til i no speakin' no English (Aahhhh)

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]

Til I'm gone (gone)

Big Snoop Dogg
Can you be my doctor?
Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down?

So I can make you give it up give it up
Until you say my name
Like a Jersey Jersey shuttin' down the game

Be my head coach

And never take me out

Do it again, and again till you say my name

Damn it feels good but I feel bad for (them next door)?
And I, I I I up on the

Girl, let me pop up in your hot tub
Every night every day
Sippin' on a different drink
Different chicks, different tastes
I do it different ways

Where you goin?
Whatcha say?
I'm why her river flowin'
To another lake
By to ocean by the ocean
On the beach on the beach
I'm bout' to take a swim
Let me dip my feet in and make you sweat

DR. DRE
When darkness be closin in
I'm motivated, with the howlin wind
With a list of chosen men, frozen in sin
Knowin that your end is beginnin
Swift silent and deadly
There's no defending my plots, I know your every movement
For six months I watch, coulda gotchu at your baby's mother's house
Even at your down-low weed spot
But the backdrop, wasn't flattering enough
I didn't want people gathering and stuff
Snapshots of blood splattering from the snuff
Here - puff this here, while I figure which way, to split yo' wig
Right now you as nervous, as a Farmer John pig
As I dig into my tragic bag, take out the HK
Twist on the silencer, insert the thirty-shot mag
Bullet stuck to his brain like a magnet
Skull in fragments, I leave the cleanup to Dragnet

This is anybody (Murderah)
To fuckin' everybody (Murderah)
Nigga all y'all (Murderah)
Uh, uh, for real
You'll fuck around and get killed
This is anybody (Murderah)
Motherfuckin' everybody (Murderah)
Yeah nigga all y'all (Murderah)
Uh, uh, for real
You'll fuck around and get killed
Peeped all the stash drop and exchange of the dough
Lurkin through the turf, think how I'mma just work
Give em chase to the crib and yo he properly laced
Stepped out the car, put my steel, to the side of his face
Murder - this the fuckin Case, rob this nigga and shake
The fuckin spot cause in a few it's gon' be crawlin with cops!
Who's the bad bitch now, you crept on, paid the piper
Who'da thought a sexy bitch could be a murderous sniper
Detrimental to your health, shoulda learned yo' lesson
But it's too late nigga bye-bye, better count yo' blessings
I been watchin you watchin me, yeah you ballin
Was, nigga now you finger fucked and steady fallin
A thug wit no love, but bitch niggas die fast
Thug niggas die young - oh what you thought you would last?
Blast two shots to the dome, slide back to the pad
And jack my nigga off, til his dick get soft
Resume the wifey boo shit, cause yo my man don't know
That his bitch is straight ill, servin ass with fo'fo' {*KABOOM*}

This is anybody (Murderah)
To fuckin' everybody (Murderah)
Nigga all y'all (Murderah)

You'll fuck around and get killed

No more sunny days
Skylines becoming gray
Flirts and first dates to verses about runaways
Feels like yesterday where heartbeats drum away
This coulda woulda shoulda been a love song, but it's late
We had language barriers but we broke it down
She ain't understand, but laughed when we joked around
She said let's take it further. I said let's slow it down
Only now do I realize that it's over
Calling like a crazy ex, I need to stop, wait a sec
Give her room to breathe. five feet. please, baby
Is it my ego? tell me, people, cause I ain't sure
Is it cause she broke my heart before I got to break hers
I'm a selfish man wanting what I can't have
We had a ball, but I gotta have the last dance
I just stay cool, trying for us to coexist
Saying this song ain't about you, but you know it is
I'm not trying to be rude, I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
Hope these sunny days, giving me thoughts of you
All I know, baby All I know
You're the one I love, the only one I love

Man just nigga hold up, I ain’t tryna call yo ho

Ho never would get in my trap
She can never get front for her will never stand up

Fuck with something now you dealin with some real nigga yo

(Verse)
Trae Tha Truth Gates, young nigga rich
Who the fuck you niggas think you talkin to bitch
Middle fingers up, play say eat dick
Never gave a fuck and probably filled on bitch
When I’m right up in the fleet, when I’m down I move around
Bald on the head and you ain’t see me shoot around
Walk up out the club til money cover the ground
All gold chain, they weigh bout 10 pounds
Tryna find a slut that fuck for 10 rounds
I tell her go long, get ready for 10 gowns
Bitch with my name we bringin all town
King of the turf, my throne is all gold
Hustle Gang bitch, my hustle is out of order
When I’m done with that I get big for somebody daughter

Where her study is? I’m playin like a recorder
(Hook)

Since the world met me now the whole globe blast up
Oh, you wanna fuck me?

Yea, you wanna smoke with me?

(Hook)
I don’t give 2 fucks
I don’t give 2 fucks
I don’t give 2 fucks
I don’t give 2 fucks
You took my heart and you had it in your mouth
And, with the word all my love came rushing out
And, every whisper, it’s the worst, empty though by a single word
There is a hollow in me
So I put my faith in something I know
I’m living on such sweet nothing
But I’m trying to hope with nothing to hope
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it’s hard to love
And it’s hard to love
When you’re giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
You’re giving me such sweet nothing
It isn’t easy for me to let it go
Cause
I swallow every single word
And
Every whisper, every sigh
It swept this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me
So I put my faith in something I know
I’m living on such sweet nothing
But I’m trying to hope with nothing to hope
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it’s hard to love
And it’s hard to love
When you’re giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
You’re giving me such sweet nothing
And it's not enough
To tell me that you care
When
We both know the Words are empty air
You Give Me Nothing!
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Nothing!
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Sweet Nothing
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Sweet Nothing

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
The sun rose on the wrong side of the Earth this morning
Nobody noticed but you
So you winked at the sun
And the sun winked back, and you kept it to yourself
Alright

[Verse 2]
The stars are gonna give up hope this evening
Nobody knows this but you
When the small ones have imploded
And red giants have supernova'd
Then sorry the Earth will be

[Instrumental Outro]
I just wanna keep my love lights burning, yeah (Just keep your love lights burning)
I'll do it anytime you want me to (Just keep your love lights burning)
And you know who IÂ´m talking to (Just keep your love lights burning)
Spread it good over yeah woman

[Let it burn¦ Let it burn]
Wow now 

[Let it burn¦ Let it burn]
Hahahaha, Yeah yeah
I keep my love lights sticking out light like a torch now (Just keep them joy bells ringing)
I'll stick it with storch now (Just keep them joy bells ringing)
I slay the wicked with fire now (Just keep them joy bells ringing)
Wow now. Hear what I sing

[Let them ring¦ let them ring]
Let it ring 

[let them ring¦.. let them ring] Let it ring
Oh now. As close as I am to September, I still don't miss November (Just you take one step closer)
Come on woman hold me tighter (Just you take one step closer)
I can show you tomorrow will be brighter (Just you take one step closer)
Cause you no sorrow never hurts you

[Come on in Come on in Come on in Come on in]
Not even bad minded people could stop this one (Just keep your love lights burning)
As it was in the beginning it shall be (Just keep your love lights burning)
Right here, right here, right here (Just keep your love lights burning)
Let me know what I have to say

[Let it burn¦. Let it burn]
I wanna see you live with love

[Let it burn.. Let it burn]
I wanna see you live with love. Hot pants on
It's getting late have you seen my mates
Ma tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
Want to get a belly full of beer

My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handfull of grease in her hair

Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in

Get about as oiled as a diesel train

Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright alright alright
Well they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out She's with me! "

A couple of the sound that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass
If you live for something, you’re not alone, my friend
So fill up your cup and, lift your lighter, a toast to life
Luda!
They say what don’t kill me, can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
Cause why tip toe through life, to arrive safely at death
I’m on a journey, yeah, i’m on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes, just to open my soul
And tonight is the night, I gotta feeling that i’m about act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and usher are about to break some rules
That’s somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for all, and yes i’m not here to fall
But for what it’s worth i’m ready to pay for the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

[Beat break]
If I got one life to live, i’mma party til i’m dead
What the hell is a life worth living if it’s not on the edge
Tryna keep my balance i’m twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say “women, weed, and alcohol”
That’s somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can’t afford
But for what it’s worth i’m ready to pay for the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

[Beat break]
If you live for something, you’re not alone, my friend
So fill up your cup, lift your lighters, and toast to life
I’m stuck in this moment, free the hands of my time
Cause I feel inner peace when i’m outta my mind
And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice
So i’m willing to bet that i’mma be crazy for the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life…

Drunk girls

Drunk girls cause a couple of heart attacks
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are unusually mild

Drunk boys keep in pace with the pedophiles

Drunk girls are boringly wild

Just 'cause I'm shallow doesn't mean that I'm heartless

Just 'cause I'm heartless doesn't mean that I'm mean
(Drunk boys)
Sometimes love gives us too many options
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause you're hungry doesn't mean that you're lean

Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad
Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong
How optimism led me astray
Two hundred things I took the wrong way
But I saw her love gauge running low
I tried to fill but it overflowed
Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong, oh no

She remembers my name, could be blown way out
It's all going to change, she remembers my name

But she was only messing around
Please, no more playing with my heart
Ooh, go with Mr. Right just for once!
(Then it all just came out
Guess I'll hold it in next time...)
Ooh, no more mischief with my mind
No more getting it wrong, I'll be frozen here on
If forever we'll see, but no more guessing for me

Oh, I was just so sure of everything
Oh, that's what you get for dreaming aloud
Oh, the day that words are clearer to me

[Verse]
There is a fountain that I see
Filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's vein
The sinners, sinners plunged beneath that blood
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
The sinners, sinners plunged beneath, beneath that blood
They're gonna lose all their guilty stains

[Bridge]
Mmm, mmm, ooh Lord, mmm, mmm

[Outro]
The sinners, sinners plunged beneath, beneath that blood
They're gonna lose all their guilty stains
Give me all, give me all, give me all attention baby
I got to tell you a little something about yourself
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh you're a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
(fine, so fine)
Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhh
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine(mine, oh mine)
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
Oh oooooh
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl you should be smiling
A girl like you should never look so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true
Oooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
(fine, so fine)
Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine(mine, oh mine)
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you

[Intro]
You're back now at the jack-off hour
This is DJ Eaazy Dick
On W-Balls
Right now something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow wow wow
Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight
This is DJ Eazy Dick
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass
With a fat dick

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking endo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch

[Hook]
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon do
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

[Verse 4: Warren G]
Hey now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
So get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

[Verse 1]
Hey brother!
Do you still believe in one another?
Hey sister!
Do you still believe in love, I wonder

[Refrain]
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call!
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out!
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Post-Chorus]
Far from home
Far from home

[Verse 1]
Hey brother!
There's an endless road to rediscover
Hey sister!
Do you still believe in love, I wonder

[Refrain]
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Chorus]
What if I'm far from home?
Oh brother, I will hear you call!
What if I lose it all?
Oh sister, I will help you out!
Oh, if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

[Post-Chorus]
Far from home
Far from home
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is a prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know
Looks like I hit the jackpot! (Supervillain!)
That's the best part of all! I'm working for the biggest group of villains this world has ever known! We're led by the man himself! (The Supervillain! Yuh!)
Doom's got a plan that's gonna shake the heavens...You wanna get tough punk?
Good! Time to get the feta!

[Intro]
Ughh!
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack ughh!
Come on, hey yo, it's just another bombtrack ugh
It goes a-one, two, three

[Verse 1]
And it's just another bomb track
And suckas be thinkin' that they can fade this
But I'm gonna drop it at a higher level
Cause I'm inclined to stoop down
Hand out some beat-downs
Cold runna train on punk ho's that
Think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
As I recall our downfall
And the business that burned us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck manifest destiny
Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch 'em burn
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

[Verse 2]
It goes a one, two, three
Another funky radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere
With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline
Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

[Chorus]
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn!
Timbaland
Mr. world wide
Here we go
Everybody say
Dance on the floor and give it up
Baby, put it down and give it up
Nigga, set the floor and take it up
Baby, put it down and give it up
So listen a couple girls
Who was in and I mess with a couple girls
Magazines, you can catch me on a couple girl
I created my own planet to hover the earth and cover the world
I spit so sick so i put 'em on girls
She's tryna come over
And she burn my perms
She tryna come at
Of all of my hurts, place to be
But I made at my girls
Now she just wanna sey
Just wanna please
She want it, so she lives on her knees
Jack and Jill, went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter, Jill came back with 250
What a working girl, now work it girl

With Timbaland and I'm out of breath
So go g-g-g-g-g-g-g-o, so g-g-g-g-g-g-g-o

And one in a middle, and I'm feeling their breath

Know your name, uh
Don't think it's what you're afraid of
Come in you know what's been made up
Hold you tight, words have a new sound
Reading the signs that just seep out
You've got to leave it

"Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done"

Each of your reasons has broken
Call it off once you have spoken
Filled to the top then split open
Repeating over and over
Now you have to leave it

"Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done
I've been thinking lately how
All these feelings won"
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Ooh everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin' baby, yeah, it's you I hate to lose

Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Well worries and trouble darling, babe you know I've had my share

Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin' baby, yeah, it's you I hate to lose

Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Well worries and trouble darling, babe you know I've had my share

[Alicia]

[Chorus:]
Throw down your hat, kick off your shoes
I know you ain't goin' anywhere
Run 'round the town singin' your blues
I know you ain't goin' anywhere

You've always been a good friend of mine
But you're always sayin' "Farewell"
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself...
Or is that what you're tryin' to do?
Put up a fight you believe to be right
And someday the sun will shine through

You've always got something to hide
Something you just can't tell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

And I know what you're wishing for
Time in a peaceful world
Time in a peaceful world
Time in a peaceful world
Time in a peaceful world
You've always been a good friend of mine
But you're always sayin' "Farewell"
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

[Verse 1]
This old goat with beard of grey
He turns his leather gripped cane
Those times you clapped and called for quiet
They've come to hold you, ain't that nice?
He packs a fat oom paul to
Jib and make home-baked perfume
Sip froth from soft, warm Joe
Snug eiderdown bedclothes
You know the way that I hide
You know

[Pre-Chorus]
This old goat with beard of grey
He turns his leather gripped cane
Those times you clapped and called for quiet
They've come to hold you in the
You know the way that I hide

[Chorus]
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
You know the way that I hide

A heart thats true, there are such things
A dream for two, there are such things
Someone to whisper darling you're my guiding star
Not caring what you own but just what you are
A peaceful sky, there are such things
A rainbow high where heaven sings
So have a little faith and trust in what tomorrow brings
Youll reach a star because there are such things
So have a little faith and trust in what tomorrow brings
Youll reach a star because there are such things

[Intro]

Turn the lights down low
I'm ready to break it off
Since computer love
Been wantin' to set it off
Like a hotel room
I'm checkin' into you
I'm diggin' like a shovel
All the things you do
Take a leap over the broom
That's how you're makin' me feel
Come on in this room
And let's keep it real and go

[Chorus]
Half on a baby
All I need is your body next to me (Singing ooh)
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Now tell me what the deal is
Are you ready to bump?
It's gonna take a lifetime
To give you all of this love
So baby, open up
And get ready to receive
A miracle of love
Gettin' down with me
Like a baseball field
Wanna hit a home run
Me and you get together, babe
And raise a little one

Half on a baby (All I need)
All I need is your body next to me (Singing ooh)

[Verse 3]
Set it off in a six
Baby, that'll be cool
Take a trip downtown
Between me and you
Trippin' on Perignon
Conversation like what
Not afraid to go there
Once you open up
After nine to five
You deserve some twelve
Makin' future plans
To be where I dwell

[Chorus]
Half on a baby (All I need, yeah)
All I need is your body next to me (I'm singing ooh)
Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your, give me your body (Oh yeah)
Your body, na, na, na, na

The girls dig the way the guys get all wiped out
With their feet in the air you can hear 'em shout
They're not afraid (don't back down, don't back down)
The girls dig the way the guys get all wiped out
With their feet in the air you can hear 'em shout
They're not afraid (don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys (don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth, (a-oo) they don't back down

Don't back down
You gotta be a little nuts
Don't back down
But show 'em now who's got guts
Don't back down
Don't back down from that wave

With their feet full of tar and their hair full of sand
The boys know the beach like the palm of their hand
They're not afraid (don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys (don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth (a-oo) they don't back down
Don't back down
You gotta be a little nuts
Don't back down
But show 'em now who's got guts
Don't back down
Don't back down from that wave

When a twenty-footer sneaks up like a ton of lead
And the crest comes along and slaps 'em upside the head
They're not afraid (don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys (Don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth (a-oo) they don't back down

Don't back down
You gotta be a little nuts
Don't back down
But show 'em now who's got guts
Don't back down
Don't back down from that wave

Don't back down...

Weight is coming off
Soaring high
Pleading you to stay
Come alive
Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you wanna try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you wanna
Once you get the feeling it
Wants you back for more
Says it's gonna heal it but
You won't make the call
One step back you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
'till it's gone?
Fading out the light
Softly say
Get it out my mind
Any way
Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you wanna try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you wanna
Once you get the feeling it
Wants you back for more
Says it's gonna heal it but
You won't make the call
One step back you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
'till it's gone?
Once you get the feeling it
Wants you back for more
Now it gets ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor
One step back you're leaving it
Jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it
'till it's gone?
You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go
You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go
Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you wanna try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you wanna
Once you get the feeling it
Wants you back for more
Says it's gonna heal it but
You won't make the call
One step back you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
'till it's gone?
Once you get the feeling it
Wants you back for more
Now it gets ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor
One step back you're leaving it
Jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it
'till it's gone?
Paroles de la chanson Turn To Me :
There was a story
About a man comin' in
Findin' his woman in bed with
Well, listen
It's 2 a.m., just gettin' in, about to check my message
No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors
Cellular rings, somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her, she don't hit me back, something is funny
So I called her mother's house and asked her, had she seen my baby (whoa, ah)
Drove my 6 around lookin' for that missin' lady
Got back in, turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused
And then I turned the TV down (TV down)
'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound (Whoa whoa whoa )
Mmm, something's goin' on upstairs, yeah
'Cause I know nobody else lives here, yeah
Bom-bom-bom
As I get closer to the stairways, all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear
Screamin' out
You're contagious, touch me, baby
Give me what you got (then a man said)
Sexy lady (ooh), drive me crazy
Drive me wild (all I heard was my baby's voice screamin')
You're contagious, touch me, baby (touch me)
Give me what you got (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sexy lady, drive me crazy (then I heard another man, yeah)
Drive me wild (And I just can't believe this shit)
I ran downstairs, looked in the closet, lookin' for that, ooh
Said a prayer 'cause only God knows what I'm gonna do
What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplatin', not in my own damn house
Who would of thought she was creepin' with another man (whoa, ah)
The down low happening to me all over again
And then I turned the TV down (TV down, yeah)
'Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound
Something goin' on up there upstairs
'Cause I know ain't no one else lives here
Bom-bom-bom
As I get closer to the stairways all I fear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear
Screamin'
You're contagious (whoa), touch me, baby (oh)
Give me what you got (then a man says)
Sexy lady (oh, ah), drive me crazy (oh, ah)
Drive me wild (all I can do is hear them say)
You're contagious, touch me, baby (ooh)
Give me what you got (whoa whoa whoa )
Sexy lady, drive me crazy
Drive me wild (oh, I can't believe this shit)
What the hell is goin' on between the sheets in my home
Baby, wait, let me explain
Before you start to point your cane
Girl, I'm 'bout to have a fit
{Oh, it's about to be some shit}
{How did I get into this}
{Shoulda never came home with this bitch}
You lowdown dirty woman
Back to where you come from
But baby, wait
But wait, my ass
Hit the streets, your ass is grass
{Now Mr. Biggs, before you're done}
Wait, how you know my name, son
(Honey wait, I was gonna tell you)
Move, this cat looks real familiar
Hmm, now don't I know you from somewhere a long time ago
{No-no, I don't think so}
Yeah, yeah, I feel I know you brother, very well
{No-no, you're mistakin' me for somebody else}
(Frank) shut up
Can't you see two men are talkin'
(But) thought I told your ass to get to walkin'
Now I think ya'll better leave this place
'Cause I'm about to catch a case
You're contagious, touch me, baby
Give me what you got (whoa, that's what she said)
Sexy lady (ooh), drive me crazy (whoa)
Drive me wild (and then he replied)
You're contagious, touch me, baby (touch me)
Give me what you got (give me what you got)
Sexy lady (whoa), drive me crazy (oh, whoa)
Drive me wild (ah, yeah, oh)
You're contagious, touch me, baby (I should have known from the shoppin' spree)
Give me what you got (that's the only time you smile at me)
Sexy lady (and makin' love girl), drive me crazy (will never be the same)
Drive me wild (I can tell how you said my name)

[Intro]
Ya
One, two, three
Two, two, three

[Verse 1]
Seems like a dream now, it was so long ago
The moon burned so bright and the time went so slow
And I swore that I loved her and gave her a ring
The bluebird was high on the wing

[Chorus]
Whatever happened to Saturday night
Finding a sweetheart and holding her tight?
She said, "Tell me, oh, tell me, was I all right?"
Whatever happened to Saturday night?

[Verse 2]
The years brought the railroad it ran by my door
Now there's birds on the windows and dust on the floor
And she passes the time at another man's side
And I pass the time with my pride
What a tangled web we weave?
Go around with circumstance
Someone show me how to tell
The dancer from the dance

[Chorus]
Whatever happened to Saturday night
Choosing a friend and loosing a fight?
She said, "Tell me, oh, tell me, are you all right?"
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
Seize upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time... so gold

Steal away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever... and be in time
Stay gold

But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory
And yes you say
So must the day
Too, fade away
And leave a ray of sun
So gold
Life is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined
All things that happen
Will age too old
Though gold
I know a star that shines
But somewhere in your mind
You're always right on time
I know a star that shines
But somewhere in your mind
You're always right on time
Yeah, won't you let it shine?

I'm so glad that I'm free, yeah
Lord above would have blessed it on me
I don't mind, won't you let it shine?
Please be kind and let it shine, shine, shine

Well, I know the words to say
Gimme my daily bread, yeah
I never close my eyes, no
Always sleep, they're wise yeah

Now I know that you're fooling me
Can't take life so seriously
Broke my heart one hundred times
Now I want to let it shine, shine, yeah
Eh, I know a star that shine
Is somewhere in your eyes
You're always right on time, yeah
Yeah, won't you let it shine?

I know that you're fooling me
Can't take life so seriously
Broke my heart one hundred times
Now I want to let it shine, shine, shine, yeah, yeah

Sanctify feelings, let it shine
Tales all my in my mind, yeah
Take me forth and let it shine, yeah
Take me forth and let it shine
Everybody hits the dance floor heat it up
Ladies put it down and take it up
Hit the dance floor and pick it up
Baby, put it down take it up
Everybody hits the dance floor and heat it up
Ladies put it down and take it up
Hit the dance floor and pick it up
Baby, put it down and throw it up!
We listen to cover girls
And now more than any I mess with cover girls of magazines
You can catch me on the cover, girl
I created my own planet, I hover the Earth and cover the world
I spit so thick I call it pearl
I see you tryna claim her now I play with her pearls
They try to comeback but they all stir
But I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please
Now more than any she lives on her knees
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter
Jill came back with $2.50. what a working girl

It fell from midnight skies
It drummed on the galvanized
In the washroom, women tracked the rain
Up to the make-up mirror
Liquid soap and grass
And Jungle Gardenia crash
On Pine-Sol and beer ...
It's stifling in here ...
I've got to get some air ...
I'm going outside to get some air
Back in my hometown
They would have cleared the floor
Just to watch the rain come down!
They're such sky oriented people-
Geared to changing weather ...
I'm floating off in time
I'm floating off
I'm floating off in time
When I was three feet tall
And wide eyed open to it all
With their tasseled teams they came
To McGee's General Store
All in their beaded leathers
I would tie on colored feathers
And I'd beat the drum like war ...
I would beat the drum like war
I'd beat the drum
I'd beat the drum like war
But when the church got through
They traded their beads for bottles
Smashed-on Railway Avenue
And they cut off their braids
And lost some link with nature
I'm floating into dreams
I'm floating off
I'm floating into my dreams
I dream paprika plains
Vast and bleak and God forsaken
Paprika plains
And a turquoise river snaking
(Where crows gaze-vigilant on wires
Where cattle graze the grasses
Far from the digits of business hours
The moon clock wanes and waxes-
But here all time is stripped away
Nowhere on these plains
Is a sprout or an egg in evidence
To measure loss or gain ...
Only a little Indian band
Come down from some windy mesa
No women to make them food and child
No expressions on their faces
I'm low in a helicopter
And the wind from whirling blades
Flaps their woven blankets
And flags their raven braids
How came they to this emptiness?
How came they to this dream?
How came I to this view
From a flying machine
Of earth and air and water
And a band of Indian men
Without herds or flocks or crops
Or families or fires to tend?
Like a phoenix up from ashes now
A blanket figure springs
With a fist raised up to turquoise skies
Like liberty
And at the point of vanishing
Where the sky and the earth meet
A bomb blooms
Deadly mushroom
White
Gold
Heat
Like a phoenix up from ashes
Up from violent mysteries
And growing 'till the giant blast
Is to it like a golfer's tee
There comes a child's beach ball
And memory takes me back
To the beach to toss it up
To the garage to get it patched
A pink and yellow beach ball
Rolling
Grand
Detached
Turning the blues and greens of earth
From space probe photographs
I float out of the hovercraft
Naked as infancy
And weightless
And drifting
Horizontally
Like a filing to a magnet
Like the long descent of rain
I am drawn
I fall against the ball
And lose paprika plains
I suckle at my mother's breast
I embrace my mother earth
I remember perforated blinds
Over the crib of my birth
And just as Eve succumbed
To reckless curiosity
I take my sharpest fingernail
And slash the globe to see
Below me-
Vast Paprika plains
And the snake the river traces
And a little band of Indian men
With no expressions on their faces.)
The rain retreats
Like troops to fall on other fields and streets
Meanwhile they're sweet talking and name calling
And brawling on the fringes of the floor
I spot you through the smoke
With your eyes on fire
From J&B and coke
As I'm coming through the door
I'm coming back
I'm coming back for more!
The band plugs in again
You see that mirrored ball begin to sputter lights
And spin
Dizzy on the dancers
Geared to changing rhythms
No matter what you do
I'm floating back
I'm floating back to you!

[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine
Everyday when I’m rollin thru the hood
Playas watch me cuz they know I

[Verse 1 – Snoop Dogg]
I shine like Neptune, Venus, and Mars in ya face in ya state
In and outta cars, interstate, win a date with one of my broads
But you gotta hate a bitch before she gets your dick hard
That’s what shinin about and when you get the hoe
You can tear her linin out, what you whinin about
You want the presence of pimpin, I’m walkin while limpin
And holdin on the drink that I’m sippin, I’m flippin the script an’
I’m slidin while I’m dippin my whip in, out of traffic
It’s so drastic, boombastic, this shits a hit, Jadakiss

But it be so funny cowards be wantin see me with my eyes and nose runny
I got nails and burbs while you got pounds of curbs, and one of us got a play
Basically around the burbs I’m fittin like a lego block, you bullshittin
While I’m sittin in an eight o drop, these suckaz tell me keep it gangsta
But they dont know, when they ain't lookin I be doin population control
Then I’m lookin for a breezy with a whole lotta soul so I can have a malfunction in my warddrobe
To not the jada with the Smith, its the Jada with the fo’ fifth, clutchin on the fifth

Uh ya, uh like a African diamond that’s deeper than rappin and rhymin
Success happens with timin, over here I’m doin low with the punk
When I’m over there I’m in the low low with my unc and all the bitches
Lookin for us but I ain't lookin for puss, right now ma I’m lookin for cush
And I’m strapped with the pound and ?? shoes, cackies, T shirts
Uh uh after my surrounding, air force ones, jeans, city lab
A fitted that’s when I’m back in the town and dont get it confused
I’m proud to be gone, be home in a year with duffle bags out on the lawn
So much money my *****z be countin it wrong, so many hits
I can’t keep count of the songs and we still grindin, stainless still nine
And ya’ll still hate but we still shinin let’s go

[Chorus]
Shine, shine, shine

[Female Singer]
Keep doin what you doin
It’s ya time and its ya shine
I love the way you ride
I hope you shine
The party starts tonight
My friends are comin over
I really think you fly
Tonights the night
Shine, shine, shine
Lightning strikes
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love why don't you say so?
If you want more love why don't you say so?
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love why don't you say so?
If you want more love why don't you say so?
Just say so...
How come the only way to know how high you get me is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me but I can't break through it all
It's a heart... heartbreak...
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God we're gonna get it right
If you lay your weapon down
Red wine and ambient
You're talking shit again, it's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name, it's heartbreak, heartbreak
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare
SONGWRITERS
MAYER, JOHN
This is a story about two lovers who shouldn't have been
They did their thing, went their separate ways again
Then by chance, they happen to meet at the neighborhood dance
Got that feeling all over again
He said, "How much have you missed me since I had you?

How much? Ooh baby, how much? 

[Incomprehensible]
Oh, I really wondered, oh baby
Wondered if you remember baby, how good you made it to me, darling?
Such a thrill, but it's been so hard since I had you, baby

Oh baby, come on, give me a break
'Cause it's been so hard, since I had you, baby

Oh, my eyes must look serious
'Cause when I look at you, I get delirious, baby
Your voice sounds so serious
But since we're still friends
Let me make love to you again, baby

Don't make me wait so hard
Since I had your sugar, oh baby
Don't make me wait, 'cause it's been so hard
Since I had you baby, ooh, oh baby
Oh baby, still you look good, sugar, you look so fine
Still I love you baby, you know, I gotta tell you right now
I must have been a fool that ever let you go without even thinkin'
'Bout the hard, hard, hard, decision, oh, so glad to see you, baby
Let me take you home, let me tell you how I feel about it really, baby

Oh, since I had you, girl, I haven't wanted no other lover
Since I had you, honey, there hasn't been no other lover
Baby, no other lover

Since I think you're a lover, darling, I haven't wanted no other lover
Since, since I 

[Incomprehensible] to me baby, I ain't have no other girl
Or no other woman, but you baby
Since I had, since I did, since I had your love
Lover (Feat. Lil Wayne)
This argument is just gonna keep going on, and on
And at this point I don't even really care who's right or wrong, ah
I just don't wanna fight anymore, even forever but on you and for
And if you think this is the way to be, I'm sorry this ain't no worth on me
And I know, I know, that no one's perfect
But what's the purpose, if we can't even make it through the day
Without fighting, we can't even get along
I would just rather let it go, cause you soon already know that

I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter X 3

Don't even matter, what you sayin'
Right now I just need some time so I can do some thinking
Will this be the end of me and you, whoa, whoa
All I know is that I'm stressed out
Seems like we've tried everything I gave me best shot
Now and every time for us to go in the town
I know, that no one's perfect
But what's the purpose, if we can't even make it through the day
Without fighting, we can't even get along
I would just rather let it go, cause you soon already know that
Without fighting, we can't even get along
I would just rather let it go, girl you already know that
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter X 3

I got that gene in my system, somebody gonna be my victim
Yeah, don't fight that love, just bear with me baby like a white and black cub
Girl love is a must, so don't put up a fuss
I'm hard as steel, she wet, making rust
With you nobody, and I'm somebody
... around it, yeah, haha
All we do is fussin, don't start honey
And I put that ... and make you up funny
Yeah, PJ, young money, New Orleans, and it really don't start nothing
Won't be nothing, let me say something
I'm a lover not a fighter, but I think I told you that
I know, that no one's perfect
But what's the purpose, if we can't even make it through the day
Without fighting, we can't even get along
I would just rather let it go, cause you soon already know that

I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter X 3
Your eyes don't shine like they used, like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone, gone, when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over, over, over
And so is love, my darling and so is love
Your words don't mean what they used, what they used to mean
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid, oh the masquerade is, it's all over, it's all over
And so is love, and so is love
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise
And learn, learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes
You look, oh baby, you look the same
You're a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, the same
But my heart says "No, no, no, no, no, you are not the same"
And I'm afraid, I'm afraid the masquerade, oh it's all over, over, oh
And so is love, and so is love, love, love, love
So is love, oh the masquerade is all over
So, so is love
Like a snowball rolling down the side of a snow covered hill, it's growing
Like the size of a fish that the man claims broke his reel, it's growing
Like a rosebud blooming in the warm of the summer sun, it's growing
Like the tale by the time it's been told by more than one, woo, it's growing

Everyday it grows a little more than it was the day before
My love for you just grows and grows
Oh, how it grows and it grows
And where it's gonna stop I'm sure, nobody knows

(Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows)
How it grows, and it grows, and it grows
(Nobody knows) Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Nobody knows, it grows, it grows, where is it gonna stop)

Woo, like a need in a guy to see his girl
When she's gone away, it's growing
Like the sadness in his little heart
When he knows that she's gone to stay, woo, it growing

Everyday it grows a little more than it was the day before
My love for you just grows and grows
Oh, how it grows and it grows
And where it's gonna stop I'm sure, nobody knows
(Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows) It gets a little wider
(Nobody knows) Oh, it gets a little stronger
(Hey, hey, hey) The feeling for each kiss, baby
(Hey, hey, hey) Oh, it lasts a little longer, yeah
(Hey, hey, hey) Oh, so much oh, so much
Can't you see it's growing, baby
It grows, and it grows, and it grows, and it grows
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons
Bugatti veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom
Upper echelon
He says to be cool but, I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?"
He said, "Yes"
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby
Heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss
I sing the national anthem
While I'm standin' over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me
Or your pants on
See what you've done to me
King of Chevron
You said to be cool but, I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Umm, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
("Yes, of course I will my darling")
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now.)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how now, take your body downtown.)
Red, white, blue's in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby
Heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara, and your party dress
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe in the land of
Sweetness and danger --
Queen of Saigon
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now.)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how now, take your body downtown.)
Red, white, blue's in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby
Heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success
See here's the thing

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're actin' like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me?
Hmm, that sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burgulary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
I'm quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Now here's another bar, I'm coming for the slow gunners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your mom and 'em
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to "Did He Really Just Say That Shit?"
Yep
I'll take a mile if you let me
6-5, 200 plus and so sexy
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been tryin' to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

[Verse]
Good god girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidote's under my tongue
Whoa

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Damn
Up in the mornin' out on the job, work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Fuss with my woman toil for my kids
Sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day

Good Lawd above, can't you know I'm pinin'
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver linin'
Lift me to paradise
Show me that river

Take me across and wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day

Up in the mornin' out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Fuss with my woman toil for my kids
Sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Good Lawd above, can't you know I'm pinin'
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver linin'
Lift me to paradise
Show me that river

Take me across and wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on
Trying not to feel this pain no more
That's why I'm pooping these pills and smoking this dro
And drinking this Henney straight
Trying not to feel this pain no more

I came from the bottom of the barrel, to everyday new apparel
From a shoe string budget to more jewelry than a pharaoh
Up out a place called Vallejo, house smaller than a hut
First city in California to go bankrupt
Came a long way, let the truth be told
Penitentiary chances sweating over the stove
Seen them come and go, I'm the last of my crop
Don't compare me to nobody unless you're talking bout Pac
Just trying to survive and stay alive, so many of my people done died
Nowadays, you're an O.G. if you live to be 25
My partner in there with his grand-daddy doing 25
Lifting water bags, doing burpees exercise
I hand pick my friends cause people ain't trustable
Feelings like broads, their motives is questionable
Suckers sneak diss me and call me up on the phone
They say, "40 Water, I just wanna be on"
I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on
Trying not to feel this pain no more
That's why I'm pooping these pills and smoking this dro
And drinking this Henney straight
Trying not to feel this pain no more

They say money makes the world go round
And since I'm worth twenty mil, I wanna see this bitch spin like the rims on a schwinn
Hop on that bike, ride through the neighborhood
Compton on smash, them boys get Cash Money like Baby do
I got a scar over my heart, cause that's what hating'll do
So watch your back like a tattoo artist
A coffin don't fuck about who the hardest
You lay where the people who mourn pray
Get your name etched in stones with your born day
Small talk over a glass of Grand Marnier
As I sip from the glass, my mind starts packing this Louis Vuitton bag
Take a trip to the past, hear that shot going blast
See my brother lying dormant, IV's in his arms
Can't you see he got a piss bag
17 years old, and you niggas wonder why I'm so cold

I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on
Trying not to feel this pain no more
That's why I'm pooping these pills and smoking this dro
And drinking this Henney straight
Trying not to feel this pain no more
Let me get a fifth of some brandy, a plate of some candy
Cindy, Sandy, Mindy Mandy
Tina, Brandy, Keisha, Angie
Man we, can't we all get along
Two shots of Patron, I did it till the break of dawn
Big fish in a pond, running my triathlon
Doggy Dogg keep the bone
One of a kind, blow you mind
Just like Einstein, born to shine
I'm getting mine prime time like 21
Get 'er done, everything in my life, I make it look like fun
Everyday of my life, I'm trying get my buzz on
Cuz on some other shit, I'm keeping it on the under bitch
So much pain I overcame, same thang
Me, E-40, and Game came from the same gang
But you wouldn't understand
I'm populating with my???'s translation
That's my main man, let me hit that damn thang

I'm doing everything I can to get my buzz on
Trying not to feel this pain no more
That's why I'm pooping these pills and smoking this dro
And drinking this Henney straight
Trying not to feel this pain no more

Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, "cry girl"´
When I saw you and that girl, walking out

Ooo I would rather, I would rather go blind boy
Than to see you, walk away from me child, and all
Ooooo so you see, I love you so much
That I don't want to watch you leave me baby
Most of all, I just don't, I just don't want to be free no

Ooo I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips, now baby
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah
Ooo and baby, baby, I would rather, I would rather be blind boy
Than to see you walk away, see you walk away from me, yeah
Ooo baby, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind now

[Akon]
I heard ya'll niggas on that fly shit
Yeah that trap or die shit
Thrown on the block don't let it get too hot
And moving that "get you high shit"
Me I'm in that cockpit
On my suit and tie shit
Tryna cash it and ready or not tryna get up in them pockets
Fully packed up and holy
Best believe that it's loaded
Telling you now brother
Try that shit and your casket will be closed ay
A hundred stacks and we throw it
Ain't none of it stolen
And if you think you gon' take from us
Well we'll point at ya and blow it so..

[Hook]
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now
Look out and drop down low now

[Chorus]
Don't bother nobody
Unless they bring a fight to my party
Well then hey
That means they're asking for it
They're asking for it
Like I'm asking her to break it on down (look out, look out)
Break it on down (look out, look out)
Break it on down (look out, look out)
Break it on down (look out, look out)

[Ludacris]
Ha look out guess who it is
That nigga from Atlanta
Where the best do it is
So get your money together and bet who it is
Cause when it comes to spitting lyrics I'm the best in the business
Go by the name of Luda
The industry intruder
Collipark Park G.A
Where the hustlas stay and the criminals rob us, shoot us
On the corner with the keys in hand
We'll leave you where you stand
We'll lift you off your feet and make you fly like Peter Pan
Don't make no sudden moves
Or I'll squeeze my southern tools
While I'm with my southern bitch
26 inches no southern shoes
I ride out slide out
Groupies cry they eyes out
Cause I'm making the kind of paper that dope boys get when they bring them pies out
Wasn't born with a silver spoon
So recognise when you hear that tune
You better drop down low when you hear that
When you hear that
Hear that boom

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Akon - Verse 3]
I know that you like it
Your body's what I'm enticed with
Move around like you work it girl
But that ain't you in the slightest
Love the way that she hide it
Says she want me inside it
Baby girl got the Superwoman
And I'm a kryptonite it
She feeling so weak
Made her drop to her knees
Got a taste of this ?
Taller than all of your trees
She'll pin me down to my seat
And rolling hips to the beat
I had to come and take full control
And show her how it's gon' be
And told her

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Paroles de la chanson Don't Have To Cry aka Past Day :
Well, this past day, darlin'
I don't have to cry no more
Well, this past day, darlin'
I don't have to cry no more
Well, i found my baby
Don't have to walk from door to door

Well, i look around me
Lord, my baby can't be found
Well, i look around me
Lord, my baby can't be found
Well, i don't have to walk around no more
Don't have to go down to the bowlin' ground

Oh, i'm sayin' goodbye
Well, i don't say goodbye no more
Oh, i'm sayin' goodbye
Well, i don't say goodbye no more
Well, i found my baby
Don't have to walk from door to door
You been talkin', talkin' to the people
Tryin' to get them to go your way
Tellin' us not to worry
That we won't be led astray

So blind, and signifying
Your opponents always lying
Think about the mistakes you make
'Cause I believe America's at stake

You know, busin', busin' is the issue
Do you have a plan with you
If, if you have a plan
If you have a master plan, got to vote for you
Hey, hey, got to vote for you
You're the man

We don't wanna hear no more lies
About how you planned to economize
We want our dollar value increased
And employment to rise
The nation's taxation
Is causin' all, all this inflation
Don't give us no peace sign
Turn around and rob the people blind

Economics, is the issue
Do you have a plan with you?
'Cause if you've got a master plan
Got to vote for you
You're the man

Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land

Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land

Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land

It's the last time! (DJ Scream, hood rich, bitch) 

[Free Bricks, nigga]

[Verse 1]
I get you fuckers knocked out for a quarter key
I told you mother fuckers not to fuck with me
Cocaine dancin' in my mansion, it's a homicide, Charles Manson
She nervous and she panicked (Hood rich)
So I vanished instead of vanquished
Call her dandruff, leavin' bloody trails in my Stan Smiths
Swear I killed the bitch like Columbine
Left the bitch dead, flatline
Only talked to you like ten times
Had a great lawyer who loved to shine
I heard it through the grapevine
Gucci Mane lives a life of crime

[Verse 2]
I brought her back like Frankenstein
All my goons like Frankenstein
Tryna go and I ain't a kid
And I don't ever die they like vampires
Bought a tractor trailer with like ten times
And make the money back on the first try
Got more hands than an octopus
Got eight different kinds, it's octo-kush
You talkin' to them folks cause you needed protection
If your ass was lost I wouldn't even give you directions
She only sucked my dick cause she needed affection
How the fuck you let that bitch slip and come in my section?
She say that she a teacher, she teach first grade
So what? Still imma fuck her on the first date
Like a wine cellar, I'm gon keep some fine grapes
My swag sick, imma need some first aid
Cause I pull up in the old school with the candy
The parking lot gon need a fucking band-aid
Colder than a icicle, it's a Can-Am not a tricycle
It's a Harley, not a bicycle
My gang stronger than corn liquor
Stop!
The train is riding
Down to the station where you lived
When we were school kids
Hey!
The rails are caught now
And I am falling down
Fools in a spiral
Round this town of steam
My Body tells me no!
But I won’t quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more!
My Body tells me no!
But I won’t quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more!
Stop!
The train is riding
Down to the station where I lived
When I was a cool kid
Hey!
Is it my fault that
The fallen embers burn
Down in a spiral
Round your crown of thieves
My Body tells me no!
But I won’t quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more!
My Body tells me no!
But I won’t quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more!
And it rides out of town
Oh, it’s my road (x6)
It’s my war (X3)
His eyes are open(x2)
Oh, 'cause I want more
I want more
Want more
His eyes are open (X2)
Hey! Hey! Hey!
My Body tells me no!
But I won’t quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more!
My Body tells me no!
But I won’t quit
' Cause I want more, 'cause I want more!
And it rides out of town
Boop, pop, ba, loo, pop

You sing along, my baby and my love
For you are my love
You are my lady
You say that you need me only
So I come on back to you, baby
Cause you can hold my hand so sweet

The way you hold me in your arms
It's crazy, it's been all along
Said I'd never
I'd never, let you go

Boop, pop, ba, loo pop

Baby, oh, my baby
I love you so, yes I do
And there is one thing that I wanna know
That I love you
And I will never let you go
Ah, you been so good to me, baby
And you can hold my hand so sweet
The way you hold me in your arms
It's crazy

Boop, pop, ba, loo, pop
Ooh, baby let's get down tonight, whoo
Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
Whenever blue teardrops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby
And honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing
Let's make love tonight
'Cause you do it right
Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby, I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
And it's good for me and it's so good to me
My baby, ohhh
Come take control, just grab ahold
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great, I can't wait for you to operate
I can't wait for you to operate
When I get this feeling, I need sexual healing
Oh when I get this feeling, I need sexual healing
I got to have sexual healing, darling, 'cause I'm all alone
Sexual healing, darling, till you come back home
Please don't procrastinate
It's not good to masturbate
Paroles de la chanson Backwater Blues :
It rained five days
The sky has turned black as night
Oh, it rained five days
And the sky has turned black as night
And there's trouble takin' place
Way down in the lowlands tonight

I woke up this mornin'
And I couldn't get out of my front door
I woke up this mornin'
And I couldn't get out of my front door
It was so much trouble
Make a poor man wonder where he wanna go

They rowed a little boat
About five miles 'cross the pond
They rowed a little boat
About five miles 'cross the pond
I packed up all of my things and threw 'em in
Boys and the boat rowed along
I climbed up on the high lonely hill
Oh, I climbed up on the high oh, lonely hill
And I looked down at the house
Baby, where I used to live

Backwater blues caused me
To pack my things and go
The backwater blues caused me
To pack my things and go
'Cause my house fell down
And I can't live there no more

Yeah, when it's thunderin' and lightnin'
And the rain begin to pour
When it's thunderin' and lightnin'
And the wind begin to blow
There are so many poor people
That didn't have no place to go

[Spoken Intro: Child]
Think about the generations and to say we want to make it a better
World for our children and our children's children. So that they know
It's a better world for them; and think if they can make it a better place

[Verse 1]
Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

[Harmonizing]

[Bridge]
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & (Choir)]
(Hold me) Show me
(Lay your head lowly) Lowly
(Softly then boldly) Yeah
(Carry me there) I'm only human
(Hold me)
(Love me and feed me) Yeah yeah yeah
(Kiss me and free me) Yeah
(I will feel blessed) I'm only human
(Carry) Carry
(Carry me boldly) Carry me, yeah
(Lift me up slowly) Yeah
(Carry me there) I'm only human
(Save me)
(Heal me and bathe me) Lift me up, lift me up
(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there) I will be there
(Lift me)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly) Yeah
(Show me you care) Show me you care
(Hold me) Woo!
(Lay your head lowly) Get lonely sometime
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there) Carry me there
(Need me) Hoo!
(Love me and feed me) Lift me up, hold me
(Kiss me and free me) Lift me up sometime
(I will feel blessed)

[Spoken Outro: MJ]
In our darkest hour
In my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence
In my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pains
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart

Gucci Mane- Me And My Niggas Lyrics
Me and my niggas we like brothers, talkin bout hustle down for each otha
We ain’t tussle touch or tongue wrestle wit a nigga, we gone buss em off da muhfuckin muscle

[x2]

[Verse 1:]
You see can't catch meeee, gucci mane ain’t runnin and i heard dey got pounds of weed
Got everythang you need from da X to da hard or soft nigga get served if you shop wit me
Got a team of cut throat niggas bout kickin doors clean off, when dey get dat word from me
Nigga please and my clique see 1 brick a piece den you gone get burnt to da third degree
Gotta two-twenty-three shootin bullets on da dot, a nigga finna get found by da birds and trees
Get ya ass dropped down on, by a nigga wit grill sayin get down on yo hands and knees
Give a fuck what anotha nigga got, who he shot, just long as da nigga don’t fuck wit me
Ain’t neva been a nigga trickin bucks just to fuck, cuz a slut catch a real nigga nut for free
Catch me on da streets of da southeast, gold grill and a million dolla mouthpiece
Deres a lot of hatin shit said about me, cuz I’m ridin twenty threes on a grand prix
Bitch check my family tree, ain’t nun but G’s, ain’t no pussy nigga finna handle me
You can try and see, I bet you D-I-E, cuz love bussin shots out randomly
Have you lookin at da eyes of a dead body, grab a choppa come back shoot errbody
Give a fuck what ya homeboi say about it, ain’t a muhfuckin secret I’m dead rowdy
I remember when I first start trappin, talkin sun valley tryna make shit happen
Sellin reefa dude, tryna make a lil loot, you can ask D and coop cuz dey seen me in action
Me and my niggas we like brothers, talkin bout hustle down for each otha
We ain’t tussle touch or tongue wrestle wit a nigga, we gone buss em off da muhfuckin muscle

[x2]

[Verse 2:]
First we lost smiley den we lost dre, den we lost twon den we lost ayon
Now my boy von doin time for a murder charge, shit lookin bad so I gotta pray for em
Where we come from niggas die young, a nigga truly blessed if he turn 21
Ill neva turn my back on my niggas from da crest, and I put da momma and my unborn son
Crest where I’m from, dats real tung, straight up out da slum, and my word is my bond
I rob wit my gun and I con wit my tongue, if a nigga still breathin den da job ain’t done
Everything we serve A-1, still sellin jays straight drop dat make dey mouth feel numb
Still throwin big barbeques at da park, if u ain’t from my hood den yo ass can't come
Me and my niggas we like brothers, talkin bout hustle down for each otha
We ain’t tussle touch or tongue wrestle wit a nigga, we gone buss em off da muhfuckin muscle

[x2]

[Verse 3:]
Nigga gotta hustle nigga gotta struggle, makin power moves gotta use a lil muscle
Gotta keep a tool, you a fool, if you think dat da straight drop crew ain’t gone mothafuckin buss you
Tight like brothas, talkin bout hustle, if we don’t know you den we sho don’t trust you
Just might touch ya, cuz we feel like fuck ya, deres a lot of niggas getting killed on custer
Bouldercrest road bitch dats my post, use to sell blow up at dat store
Lost a lot of homebois in da process, only lord knows who’ll be da next 2 go
Gotta studio on Gresham road, dats where da Gucci mane disc gets sold
Dats where I stand on deese ten toes, tryna make my money come back ten fold
Gucci got da work my nigga 10-4, drunker den drunk sippin on glenmoe
Got 4 grams bout 2 we score, hit pryor street gimme bout 10 mo
Still got da hydro fo da low, order too big holla at chevro
Straight drop clique tight like kinfolk, helpin each otha so we can't go broke
Me and my niggas we like brothers, talkin bout hustle down for each otha
We ain’t tussle touch or toungue wrestle wit a nigga, we gone buss em off da muhfuckin muscle

Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the slit wrist, that's with
As we move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know
Ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify
Defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key
We'll break in
Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Fist in ya face, in the place
And I'll drop the style clearly, yeah

Know your enemy
Know your enemy!
Ugh
Come on
Word is bond
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D the E the F the I the A the N the C the E
Mind of a revolutionary
So clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What? The land of the free?
Whoever told you that is your enemy?
Ya got to know
Ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify
Defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key
We'll break in

Know your enemy
Yeah
You've got to know your enemies
Somethings got to be done
Look at what you've done
Stand still, falling away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?
I'm holding on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now every other day I've been watching you
Oh oh, oh oh I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
So you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you
Tell me what lovers do
How are we still breathing
It's never for us to choose
I'll be the strength in you
Now I'm holding on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now every other day I've been watching you, oh oh oh oh
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside, oh oh
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside, oh oh

We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
Yes, the nights are so long, baby
And the days are so blue
Seems like everything has gone wrong
Baby cause Im without you
I guess this is that awful feeling
Baby, that feeling they call the blues
All by myself, baby
Yes, I began to weep
Yes, and when I dry my eyes, baby
You know I still can't sleep
Yes, I guess this is the feeling
Baby, the feeling they call the blues
Yes, as I sit here in my dark room, woman
With the tears running down my face
Yes, as I sit here in my dark room, woman
With the tears running down my face
Yes, I can feel and I can see you, woman
I can see you all over the place
Yes, then I start walkin, woman
Start walkin all over the floor
Yes, my heart is telling me, woman
Tellin me you won't be here no more
Oh, I guess this is the feeling
Baby, the feeling, the feeling they call the blues
Mary, Mary, had a little baby
Ooh, pretty little baby
Ooh, pretty little baby
Glory be to the newborn king

Star a shinin', shinin' on the manger
Ooh, shinin' on the manger
Ooh, welcoming a stranger
Glory be to the newborn king

Mary, Mary, who was here who knew him
Ooh, did anybody know him
The ox and the donkey they bowed right down before him
Glory be to the newborn king

Mary, what you gonna name your baby?
Ooh, pretty little baby
Mm, pretty little baby
Glory be to the newborn king

Some call him Manuel, think I'll call him Jesus
Mm, yes think I'll call him Jesus
Mm, my pretty little Jesus
Glory be to the newborn king

[Intro: Trey Smith]
Now Dad this is a very sensitive subject

[Chorus]
Just the two of us
Just the two of us (just the two of us)
Just the two of us (just the two of us)

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough
Against wrong, choose right and be standing up?
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just ta get the car seat in right
People driving all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your bassinet
That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
Cause I know I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
Five years old, bringin comedy
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me
Just like me, wait an' see, gonna be tall
Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be
A general, a doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true that
Uh-uh-uh why you do that?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can, show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an'
I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame in it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove, you was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

[Verse 3]
It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM
See me-I'm tyin to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nothin promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go on
But just in case, it's my place to impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true
I love you and I'm here for you

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

[Outro: Trey Smith]
(This is a good song Dad, how much am I gettin paid for this?)
When I was young
I never needed anyone
Making love was just for fun
That day is done
Livin' alone
I think about the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home
All by myself
Don't wanna' be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna' live
All by myself
Anymore
Never too sure
Sometimes I'm so insecure
The love that's distant and obscure
Remains the cure
All by myself
Don't wanna' be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna' live
All by myself
Anymore
(instrumental)
All by myself
Don't wanna' be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna' live
All by myself
Anymore
When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
What's somebody like you, doing in a place like this?
Say, did you come alone, or did you bring all your friends?
Say what's your name, what you drinkin'?
I think I know what you're thinking
Baby, what's your sign?
Tell me yours, I'll tell you mine
Say, what's somebody like you
Doing in a place like this?
(One, two, three, c'mon!)

[Chorus: Timbaland & Katy Perry]
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - say if we ever meet again
This free fall (Ahh) got me so (Ohh)
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again

[Post-Chorus: Timbaland]
Ohh, ohh
Say if we ever meet again

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Do you come here much? I swear I've seen your face before (Before, yeah)
Hope you don't see me blush, but I can't help but want you more, more
Baby, tell me what's your story?
I ain't shy and don't you worry
I'm flirting with my eyes, wanna leave with you tonight
Do you come here much?
I gotta see your face some more
Some more, 'cause baby...

[Chorus: Timbaland & Katy Perry]
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - say if we ever meet again
This free fall (Ahh) got me so (Ohh)
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again

[Bridge: Katy Perry & (Timbaland)]
If we ever meet again, I'll have so much more to say
(If we ever meet again)
If we ever meet again, I won't let you go away
(If we ever meet again)
If we ever, ever meet again, I'll have so much more to say
(If we ever meet again)
If we ever, ever meet again, I won't let you go away
Away-ay-ay-ay

[Chorus: Timbaland & Katy Perry]
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - say if we ever meet again
This free fall (Ahh) got me so (Ohh)
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away - say if we ever meet again
This free fall (Ahh) got me so (Ohh)
Kiss me all night, don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same - if we ever meet again

[Verse]
Rarity glistened sharp
The memory of silver tooth bark
Bathed led light history
Fractured into pieces
And outside
Storm forks a snake tongue
Curls through my finger tips warm
A rouge streak ribbons around my skull

[Refrain]
The world it softly lulls
The world it softly lulls
The world it softly lulls
The world it softly lulls

[Verse]
Rarity glistened sharp
The memory of silver tooth bark
Bathed led light history
Fractured into pieces
And outside
Storm forks a snake tongue
Curls through my finger tips warm
A rouge streak ribbons around my skull

[Refrain]
The world it softly lulls
The world it softly lulls
The world it softly lulls
The world it softly lulls

[Verse 1]
Now listen to me, baby
Before I love and leave you
They call me heart breaker
I don't wanna deceive you

[Pre-Chorus]
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I'm might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

[Chorus]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
There's no point trying to hide it
No point trying to evade it
I know I got a problem
Problem with misbehavin'

[Pre-Chorus]
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

[Chorus]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

Now my closet full of J's like a crackhouse
Ceiling so high, you would think it was Shaq house
Whip so big that it beep when I back out

Like beep, beep, ayo tell that *** move this
Bow Wheezy, Mr. "Get ‘em where the dinner's cool"
I step up in the room, put ya ice on my chain B
All the bad ******* screamin' like they angry

Some call me cocky but how could you blame me?
There no other ******** like me because my money lanky

Never been fake ‘cause all the girls love official
S.O.D. ‘cause girls love initials
I'm on another level, I'm in my zone
Black car, white rims, can't they both get along?

This is not The Matrix but I am the oracle
"Do you wanna get wit me?" The question is rhetorical
Say the same lines but the fans aren't bored of me
75 thousand dollars if you want to order me

Hold on! Let me change my swag
My flow broadband, y’all boy still LAN
My whole click straight, y’all whole click ****
Last night your girl forehead was on my abs

Gucci bandana
Louis V leather
Keep on lookin' there's no lame gutta
Air Force Ones mixed with the new J's
You can't catch me, I'm too far away
Marco Polo

Bow makes the girls go crazy, they wanna be my lady

Lime green Lambo, no roof, that's a drop t
