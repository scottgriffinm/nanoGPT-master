I throw up all I eat
So I can fit
Inside these clothes

[Chorus]
And even if it hurts to walk
The people laugh
I know who I am
Even if it hurts to walk
And I get beat up
I'm proud of my new clothes

[Verse 3]
I’ll never eat again
And suck my cheeks
And hold my breath
The people stop and stare
At the emperor
The thing from Mars

[Chorus]
And even if it hurts to walk
The people laugh
I know who I am
And even if it hurts to walk
And I get beat up
I'm proud of my new clothes
And even if it hurts to walk
The people laugh
I know who I am
And even if it hurts to walk
And I get beat up
I'm proud of my funky clothes

[Chorus]
And even if it hurts to walk
And people laugh
I know who I am

I'm proud of my funky clothes, yeah

[Outro]
I'm so funky
Funky, ah, my funky clothes

[Intro]
But um
Part, part of the reason for coming out again is to play new songs
And um, this is another new song
Called "I Promise"
I hope you like it

[Verse 1]
I won't run away no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise
Even when you lock me out
I promise
I say my prayers every night
I promise

[Verse 2]
I know which side I'm spread
I promise
The tantrums and the chitty chats
I promise
Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
Tie me to the rotting deck
I promise

[Verse 3]
I won't fool around no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise
Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
Tie me to the rotting deck
I promise

[Outro]
I won't run away no more
I promise

[Intro]
Is it on tape, yeah?

[Verse 1]
In the next world war
A jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
An airbag saved my life

[Chorus]
In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

[Verse 2]
In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

[Chorus]
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

[Intro]
Dan
Can you hit me with naught?
Shall I stop them?

[Verse 1]
He was sick of his clock stopping
It winds him up, that girl still
Snoring next to him
He was sick of his excuses
To not take off her dress when
Bleeding in the bathroom
The watch smashed, and he got restless
He sighs in broken English

[Chorus]
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises

[Verse 2]
He was, he was
He was your final fit
Your final bellyache

[Chorus]
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
If I ever get my head out of this bed
If I ever get this head out of this bed

Do not give us, like you don't
I'm gonna shake a tree that's holding that 

[?]

If I ever get my head out of this bed
If I ever get my head out of this bed

Why don't you try to-

[Verse 1]
Before the night begins the night is
I will watch you grow down is
I think that I will ride again, you know

[Verse 2]
There's something that I haven't figured
A billionaire, the open room, I
Thought that I could understand it

[Verse 3]
It didn't end up auditions
I know what I'm feeling in this, in this thing, in this to us
I want you to know
That when I go
I'm gonna shed
And if it comes
Somewhere that I'm away
I'm not gonna shed it there

Listen I won't hurt you

[And I won't?] come home again
Baby, I can't control it
Wait but, I think that I 

[won't end / want in?]

I'm stronger distant from you
I'll look a little further that what you do
So change for the best
Take me under your wing

I want you to know
That it is okay
I'm just gonna ride a pony
The bed it wants you way beyond my little piece of mind
Baby, won't you own it for my inner peace of mind?
I know I get up against me
Baby, here I am
It's just gonna look to a higher cloud and put it in the air
Baby, some girls want
I'm so good at everyone's cause
Baby, you're the ground
I'm going where I'm found

Freedom from fear and distress
Freedom from pain or disease
Freedom from hunger and thirst
Freedom from depression
Freedom to express
Freedom to express
Freedom to express

And don't run away
Don't run away
'Cause letting me in and
Push him away

[Intro]
This environment
Is in your door
Is in your lack
Is in your lens
Baby you say
Baby say

[Verse 1]
This 

[?] known
As some kind of 

[eyes / prize?]
And love is all I crave
From you, baby
Far too often
For the chance to say
I know the one
The one who'll try to grind inside us
Miss me out
From our hell-bound
'Cause I know what you're doing Sunday

[Verse 2]
Don't you see
You're the best thing that could happen to me?
The pulls in the curtains, aren't you, Baby
I know you do
I know you really want to
I know you do
You're just saying "No"

[Verse 3]
And the scent of his ass is gonna fade
And with your murder eyes into my bones
Before it's too often
And I'll get on my back
A heart attack is all I'm craving
It may seem that I'm still worse
And I dress myself
I wash myself
I can't forget you know that bedroom
On the ground
All the time
'Cause I get angry
With your omens

[Outro]
La la la

Stumbling with words

You know you should

On our way that mounted up
Just 

[gone / go an' ?] get a letter
I know all the time is up
Just gonna light the

And I won't stand for what you've done
I must be sad 'cause I am disappointed now
I must be light ’cause I am standing with your

On a palace night
Put them together

Oh, I must be dreamin'
I must be mad
Forever think

[Break]

Well he said he wants it all
But he's not quite sure how
He wants to belong
But he's not sure how
The midsized car
And a midsized home
The evil in the table
The menace when he walks
Yeah

What I love in your eyes
Want to see what'd happen
When you're burnin' down
'Cause baby we're all
In a double mind
Should of come saying' I'm down, and that's alright
If you know what looks
Eddie is a fan
And if no one looks
It'll not go away
They threw 'em out for spare
And everything you say
Are like I wasn't trying
Like I'm none at all
And it won't go away
Come on
I want you alone
You're just too crazy but you're not wrong at all
I must get back
I'll have a heart attack
I must not 

[?] and involved with anyone at all
That's mad
I must not write
I must not tidy up my prose
And in time
I must not try
Oh, I oughtta try
But it's just too good at messin' up and I never want that

[Studio chatter]
Haha, and then can we just get-
Change the key there
What?
If we, if we go on that second player, change the key a bit
Huh?
Lead into s-, lead into... That's the bridge, that's the bridge from that piece
Yeah
So lets take it somewhere else, just take it to another key. Do you see what I mean?
If you-
What?

[Verse 1]
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

[Verse 2]
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life

[Verse 3]
Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limbless and helpless

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

[Outro]
I will see you in the next life
Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
Sentimental (?)
Clinging on to bottles
When it comes it's so, so, disappointing

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel
One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
(Mumbling)
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life

Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limbless and helpless
I can't even recognize you
I think you're crazy, baby

I will see you in the next life
White wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

My heart's all a mess
Listen for my regrets
Baby, I can see
One way over me

[?] what I could be doing
I could go there and watch 

[?]

Bless me with your love
Someone's over there
Bless me with your love
Like a golden gun
Paint myself, I'm gonna be good
Tell myself it's gonna be good

Like an orange girl

[?] orange girl
Orange girl
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

People do it all the time
In cars, boats and planes
So why can't I?

I'm so-

Right now you look like
You're the sexiest thing on earth

So don't get any big ideas
'Cause they're not gonna happen

You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking

But I'm so in with you
I just stare at you
We look so funny when we're nude
In bed, in bed, in bed, in bed

Are you stranded?
Are you hopeless?
It makes the wall that someone needs and I know it
One day at a time
Yeah, I don't know it
I guess that I don't mind
Break the wall that someone needs

It's close
I know
It comes
It shows
So don't

So don't
Break the wall that someone builds
I don't get it
Go round and 

[slide?] away
I don't get it

[I want to die to me?]
Don't explain to me already
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won’t heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I’ll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises

He was, he was
This is my final fit
My final bellyache

(Yup, it might be, yup, it might be)
He said it's my pussy (Yup, it might be)
M-my pussy, m-my pussy (Yup, it might be)
'Cause I'm a millionaire, this pussy pricey

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel up, baby, feel on me
Pull up if you're feeling lonely
Feel up, baby, feel on me
Pull up if you're feeling lonely

[Chorus]
Brra-ta-ta-ta
Shots, shots, shots, I'm drinkin'
It's better when I'm drinkin'
I tune up when I'm drinkin'
Rum, rum when I'm-

Shots, shots, shots, I'm

Shots, shots, shots, I'm

Shots, shots, shots, I'm drinkin'

Lyrics from snippet:

You want it, babe?
We can leave right now, let's go
Let's go all the way
And I'm gonna do it how you want it
Tell me, face down
I'ma act a fool with it
Give it to you properly
Oh yeah, papi
Lyrics from snippet:

[Chorus]
I'ma give it all to you
Girl, you gonna get it like you never had it before
I'ma do it like I mean it
I'ma do it like I mean it
I'ma do it like I mean it
Hey, oh

Do something, do something
And I'm about to take it all the way tonight
I'ma do it like I mean it
I'ma do it like I mean it
I'ma do it like I mean it
I'ma do it like I mean it
Hey

[Verse]
When you look into the mirror, tell me what you see
Staring right back at you, eyelashes, lipgloss and glitter
There's more to you underneath the surface
So look deeper, hearts in your eyes
There's a beautiful girl inside
And I need her to stop hiding
Girl, you're perfect, don't need a disguise

[Chorus]
You're beautiful in and out, like you notice
You're beautiful in and out, you're flawless
I love, I love you the way you are
I love, I love you the way you are
You're beautiful in and out, like you notice
Beauty's not just skin deep
Deeper than I can see
I want you to love who you are
Girl, you're flawless
Everybody get down on the beat

[Verse]
When you look into the mirror, tell me what you see
Staring right back at you, eyelashes, lipgloss and glitter
There's more to you underneath the surface
So look deeper, hearts in your eyes
There's a beautiful girl inside
And I need her to stop hiding
Girl, you're perfect, don't need a disguise

[Chorus]
You're beautiful in and out, like you notice
You're beautiful in and out, you're flawless
I love, I love you the way you are
I love, I love you the way you are
You're beautiful in and out, like you notice
Beauty's not just skin deep
Deeper than I can see
I want you to love who you are
Girl, you're flawless
Everybody get down on the beat

[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down

[Verse 1]
I'm slipped again
As if it bothers me that
You are 

[?]
Livin' out of trees, I
I'm no good, I can't

[Verse 2]
He deceits me once
We know what he wants
He wants to lie
He wanted to be loved
And win yourself and 

[?]

[Chorus]
This is what you get when you fuck with me
This is what you get when you fuck with me
This is what you get when you fuck with me

[Verse 3]
I never guess what
And now he's all around
I want your suggestions
To cut a little 

[?]
And wish me over someone

[Chorus]
This is what you get when you fuck with me
This is what you get when you fuck with me
This is what you get when you fuck with me

[Chorus]
This is what you get when you fuck with me
This is what you get when you mess with me
This is what you get when you fuck with me
This is what you get when you fuck with me
This is what you get when you fuck with me
This is what you get when you fuck with me
I go hard, I go fast
And I never look back
I go speedin' on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speedin' on the highway
Flame burning, tire screech
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump, bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever and

Drop, body high
Blue and pink like the sky
I go speedin' on the highway
Vroom vroomin', might die
Turn the volume up in your Prius
Windows down and just vibe
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and
Roll wit' your friends, out till 7 AM
Come on, meet me on the highway
Smoke blowing, let's race
Turn the volume up on the speakers
Got that look on your face
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

I go hard, I go fast
And I never look back
I go speedin' on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speedin' on the highway
Flame burning, tire screech
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump, bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever and
Drop, body high
Blue and pink like the sky
I go speedin' on the highway
Vroom vroomin', might die
Turn the volume up in your Prius
Windows down and just vibe
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Roll wit' your friends, out till 7 AM
Come on, meet me on the highway
Smoke blowing, let's race
Turn the volume up on the speakers
Got that look on your face
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

I go hard, I go fast
And I never look back (X-X-XCX, Charli)
I go speedin' on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump, bump, in the rave (It's Charli, baby)
Go forever and ever and (It's Charli)
Bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speedin' on the highway
Flame burning, tire screech (It's Charli)
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump, bump, lights go out (It's Charli)
Go forever and ever and

[Verse 1: Jake]
Calico, you'll always chase a pedigree
A better half, so contrary
Why are you so jealous?
Why are you so jealous?

[Verse 2: Jake]
Say you won’t
Say you will attend to me
Space is all the light we need
In your room, so selfish
In your room, so selfish, ah

[Chorus: Jake]
We ran our rule
We chased our blues down
I thought it familiar
Patience growing thin
I'll sing for you again in the morning
In the morning, baby

[Bridge: Jake]
Passenger, I'm clinging to the driver’s seat
But you've got all the fight we need
Why are you so jealous?
Why are you so jealous?
Ahh

[Chorus: Jake]
We laughed like fools
To chase our blues down (Oh)
I thought it familiar
Patience growing thin
I'll sing for you again in the morning
In the morning, baby

[Outro: Jake]
I was always awake
Spry to your feels
Keen on the way we were
But I fell ill like our friends
Corrupted by youth
And those who wanted more
If you ever became
The things we lost
The things we left behind
I would wish for the past
When we were pure
Suffering intertwined
A passenger, mhm
A passenger

[Verse 1: Jake]
I know you see the light upon my face
A warning from the gods to stay away
Forbidden like a fruit and I’m the snake
Just a bite, I wanna know the taste

[Pre-Chorus]
All the things I've seen beyond the frame
I'll steal them like I steal your heart
I'm not that bad, I make mistakes

[Chorus: Jake]
Sometimes, mistakes
Sometimes, mistakes

[Post-Chorus]
Mm
Mm

[Verse 2: Jake]
I swear I see 'em dancing on my grave
The fucker's gone, we'll never see his face
Forbidden for this life and I'm the snake
I'm hardly fit to bear this cross I made

[Pre-Chorus]
All the things I've seen beyond the frame
I'll fuck 'em like I fucked your heart
I'm not that bad, I make mistakes

[Chorus: Jake]
Sometimes, mistakes
Sometimes, mistakes

[Verse 1: Jake]
I could say it right now
But it's not the time
You see those friendly faces but they only make you anxious
You could shout it out now
In the crowded space
People have been hoping but I've never been that open

[Chorus: Jake]
I've been here before
Don't you know it's not the same
Don't you know I'm not the one who told ya
I've been here before
Don't you know it's not the same
Don't you know I'm not the one who told ya

[Verse 2: Jake]
I wish I'd seen this family's start, so I could see us thrive
We didn't make it out together, but we made it out alive
See, it's not about hope, as much as honesty
I need you in this fight, so we can someday get it right

[Chorus: Jake]
I've been here before
Don't you know it's not the same
Don't you know I'm not the one who told ya
I've been here before
Don't you know it's not the same
Don't you know I'm not the one who told ya

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I wish this head would quiet down
So I could talk to you
Help me sound out what's been in and we can finally make it through
I could say it right now
But it's not the time
I know you've been hopin'
But I've never been that open

[Bridge: Jake]
I'll scream it but I won't believe it
I'll tell you what you want to hear then
Just give me a week or two to find it
Then maybe we'll try hard to ignite it

[Chorus: Jake]
I've been here before
Don't you know it's not the same
Don't you know I'm not the one who told ya
I've been here before
Don't you know it's not the same
Don't you know I'm not the one who told ya

[Outro: Jake]
I'll scream it but I won't believe it (I've been here before)
(Don't you know it's not the same)
(Don't you know I'm not the one who told ya)
I'll tell you what they want to hear then (I've been here before)
Just give me a week or two to find it (Don't you know it's not the same)
(Don't you know I'm not the one who told ya)
Then maybe we'll try hard to ignite it

[Verse 1: Jake]
I know, I-I know dear
I think that you wanna tell me
Something that, something that I don't know
How it goes, go on and tell me no
I know, I-I-I know dear
I think that you wanna tell me
Something that, something that I might know
How it goes,  go and tell me no

[Refrain: Jake]
You go on and tell me no
You go on and tell me

[Verse 2: Jake]
Your friend, all your friends say
You need something like some time away
They say "tell me all your secrets"
Blast that up, up on some dramatic shit

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
I laugh, I-I-I laugh, dear
I think that you're just excited
Got my heart up and undivided
Got our love feeling like an island

[Chorus: Jake]
Love, all your love
Catching feels off of your touch
I'm awake, I'm the one
Never doubt it
Doubt it
Love, all your love
Catching feels off of your touch
I'm awake, you're the one
Never doubt it
You go on and tell me no

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Jake]
Love, all your love
Catching feels off of your touch
I'm awake, I'm the one
Never doubt it
Doubt it (Go on and tell me no)
Love, all your love
Catching feels off of your touch
I'm awake, you're the one
Never doubt it
Doubt it (Go on and tell me no)
Love, all your love
Catching feels off of your touch (Go on and tell me no)
I'm awake, you're the one
Never doubt it
Doubt it (Go on and tell me no)
Love, all your love
Catching feels off of your touch (Go on and tell me no)
I'm awake, you're the one
Never doubt it
Doubt it
Love, all your love
Catching feels off of your touch
I'm awake, I'm the one
Never doubt it
Doubt it

[Verse 1]
Little Jim
Caught himself lookin' for the dead
Step away
Stick around for what I can see
I can see for miles
Everything
Everything still north side up
Why’s there no
Why's there no-one round the photo-book
Gettin' scared of looking at the book
One of your positions
I vote
He says war is gonna end
Gather ’round
A strong if I walk down enough
Patch it up
I'm already goin' back
I want the truth
Did you really want to mess with you?
Did you really want to hurt?

[Verse 2]
Mess around
Did you really want to 

[?]
Did you really want to call?

[Verse 1: Jake]
I swear to God, I wasn't born to fight
Maybe just a little bit, enough to make me sick of it
But I-I-I-I can read between the lines
I want to run from everything
But my legs won’t work, it's clear to me

[Chorus: Jake]
I-I-I-I haven't been much myself
And I feel like my friends are being put through this hell I’m feeling
I think that I'm living
If you could call it living
So brash and unforgiving
Ruled by the vibe I'm bringing
Serving myself
Serving myself

[Verse 2: Jake]
The timing's poor I know it's never right
It's hard to see this time of night
Hard to know the reasons why I fucked it up again
Still, I breathe a sigh
It doesn't seem so lucky now
Maybe I can figure out why-y-y-y

[Chorus: Jake]
I haven't been much myself
And I feel like my friends are being put through this hell I’m feeling
I think that I’m living
If you could call it living
So brash and unforgiving
Ruled by the vibe I'm bringing
Serving myself
Serving myself

[Interlude]

[Outro: Jake]
Wait and see
I’ll be making my own way now
I'll be making my own way now
To where I got to be
Wait and see
I'll be making my own way now
I'll be making my own way now
To where I got to be
(I-I-I-I haven’t been much myself)
Wait and see
I'll be making my own way now
(And I feel like my friends are being put through this hell I'm feeling)
I'll be making my own way now to where I got to be
(I think that I'm living, if you could call it living)
Wait and see
I'll be making my own way now
(So brash and unforgiving)
I'll be making my own way now to where I got to be
(Ruled by the vibe I'm bringing)
Serving myself
Serving myself

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 1: Jake]
When I forgot you, you came to mind
Every trouble, back in your eyes and
It's all cyclical, so why even try?
Why even try to change?

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2: Jake]
You're yourself way more than I am
Being friends was in the palm of my hand
But I let it fall and break, so why even try?
Why even try to mend?

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Bridge: Jake & Nathan]
No more us
No more we
No more you
No more me

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 3: Jake]
Someday soon it will all disappear
Maybe I will miss your voice in my ear
But I can't go back now, so why even try?
You can't go back now, so why even try?
No, we can't go back now, so why even try?
Why even try to hear?
Little Jinny's 

[?] 

[thighs/eyes?]
He's just about to run inside
'Cause the cats now running when the lights go down
And even James looking for the person on the 

[?]
He's just about to run and cover
Just about to when he calls, and I don't wanna know

[?]
Anyone should come with your 

[?] between your eyes
Anyone something that'll wave a 

[?]
And 

[?], you are on the closet room with a chance that you'll 

[?] And put me on, and I wonder what on earth we've come to 

[?] with your

[?] just about to break your leg
Something that happens when the boy's police arrive
I'm gonna stain the walls with your children’s cry
What do you suggest I do with the boggle eyes
Is it right to call such a 

[?]
Turn the other cheek and get the bill
I don't look concerned, but then your eyes
I'm gonna sit with you until you admit it
Is it right to 

[?] the girls 

[?]
Or I’m gonna get you back again
You don't see the signs
You're comin' round a lot
You couldn't see where I am
'Cause you don't understand
Just pretend that you're here and that's part of it
'Cause you don't care why
It's just the way you are
You're just a 

[?] star
Yeah, yeah, yeah

But then they want you to
As I never do
Pretend they want it all
Recognise anybody on my block I can

It hits me we're the same
Has anyone here seen Chairman Mao?
I know that Mao now, ahead of speed off
I wish I was here
I wish I was mine
How did a piece of it around us
How did 

[?] on my mind
I want some better time, and
I want your parasite, yeah
I want some better time
The best of it
The best of all
The best of the fall

[?]
I want you to know
I want someone else
It's not all that bad

I had a bad dream
You bury me in
One look, is it never

So I get to know I want to go
I leave
I know

It's just with
A strangling kid
I know what I'm up to

So don't say a word
Just get right up
It's not gonna help
You know
And I need to know
I need to go
I want to know
And if it once made it, I should burn into your wings
I'm gonna stop signing from the bottom of my head
But don't get up again
Hey, I'm not a 

[?] lullaby
So don't get up, my babe
I'm just about to ask

And if at once that matters stays with him, do you go in there
And if I told them slowly on a day event
I'm never stop our matters into that again
Baby, I want you close
Baby, it's not too much
Reminds me how
Baby, I want you all
But it's 

[?]
If i'm gonna talk
I just want to talk
No evaluations
No deliberations
Tearing me to bits
Before I'd even started

When I was sick you'd write

And if i'm gonna talk
I just want to talk
Please don't interrupt
Sit back and listen
And if you're gonna laugh
Please leave the room

Not all angels have wings
If I don't see him

[?] eyes crying
Bloody eyes broken
I see

You never go to heaven
If you don't see him
Never did it happen
Better go away
Fill me up this time
It could be I can't crawl

Why don't you stop runnin' 'round in a circle?
Why don't you stop runnin' 'round in a circle?

Take your glasses off
We understand most of
Most of the time
You understand me
And the crosses, babe
Then I know I should
Run a little circle
It could be I can't stand up on my own
It could be I can't stand up, I'm an old man
They should be one of the side of the room
My God, my God, my God, I've lost my feeling
My God, my God, my God, I’ve lost, I've lost, I've lost my feeling

They should be waiting for wealth and goods
Patiently watching the 

[?] hearse
Oh no, oh no, oh no, I’ve lost all feeling in my hands
Oh no, oh no, oh no, I've lost all feeling in my hands

Guess I was wrong when I thought you'd go back
Strong as an ox like the wolves won't attack
Oh no, oh no, I've got to worry, I know it's true
Oh no, I've lost all feeling in my hands and in my heart
If I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don’t interrupt
Just sit back and listen
And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
No evaluations
No deliberations
They're tearing it to bits
Before it’s even there

Halfway to the sun
They're blasted into bits
Watch each hour down
Flames and parachutes
Appliances have stopped
Although never end
Lazy on the ground
Thank you, I'm fine
No one else could know
What I do know
Believe
Believe
Believe
Believe
Believe
Believe
Believe
Believe
Believe
Believe

[Chorus: Jake]
You've got time to think it over
You've got time to think it through
It's a circumstantial outcry
It's a failure to pursue
It’s a sentimental mindset
It's a thoughtless way to love
It’s a blossom in midwinter
It’s a poor man’s cure for touch

[Bridge: Jake]
So far in
You could feel it
(So far in you could feel it)
So far in
You could feel it
(So far in you could feel it)
Ah-ah (Ah-ah)
Ah-ah (Ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah-ah (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
So far in
You could feel it
(So far in you could feel it)
So far in
You could feel it
(So far in, so far in you could feel it)

[Chorus: Jake]
You've got time to think it over
You've got time to think it through
It's a circumstantial outcry
It's a failure to pursue
You've got time to think it over
You've got time to think it through
It's a circumstantial outcry
It's a failure to pursue
It's a sentimental mindset
It's a thoughtless way to love
It's a blossom in mid-winter
It's a poor man's cure for touch

[Verse 1: Jake]
Living for the past cause the future's gone
Praying in the dark that you won't go home
I should have said it better
I should have set fire to her letter
Forayed by our own
Playing in the dark, where we bore it all
It all makes sense in the center
All makes sense where I sent her

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
But I could
Run to your apartment
Hope to get it started better than before
And I could write it in a poem
Pretend I used to know you
Better than before

[Chorus: Jake]
Naomi, I wanna change for you
Naomi, I wanna see this through
Naomi, I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Naomi, I wanna change for you
Naomi, I wanna to see this through
Naomi, I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Longer nights with lesser feelings

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Jake]
Naomi, I wanna change for you
Naomi, I wanna see this through
Naomi, I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Naomi, I wanna change for you
Naomi, I wanna see this through
Naomi, I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Naomi, I wanna change for you
Naomi, I wanna see this through
Naomi, I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Naomi, I wanna change for you
Naomi, I wanna see this through
Naomi, I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Naomi, I wanna change for you
Naomi, I wanna see this through
Naomi, I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings
Naomi, I wanna change for you
Naomi, I wanna see this through
Naomi, I'm sick of sleeping longer nights with lesser feelings

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Built a world all in my mind
All on my own, will I survive? Oh

[Pre-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Century of tears
Sadness was my only smile, yeah
So I fall apart
But you're gone and I'm doing fine
I'm screaming out

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Ooh, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
When you're not around, when you're not around, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
I'll finally cross you out
Ooh, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
When you're not around, when you're not around, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
I'll finally cross you out

[Verse 2: Sky Ferreira]
Melt me down one piece at a time
I seal these eyes wide shut
I wasn't mesmerized, no

[Pre-Chorus: Sky Ferreira]
Century of tears
Sadness was another denial, yeah
Thought I'd fall apart
But now you're gone, I'm doing fine
I'm screaming out

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Ooh, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
When you're not around, when you're not around, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
I'll finally cross you out
Ooh, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
When you're not around, when you're not around, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
I'll finally cross you out

[Bridge: Sky Ferreira, Charli XCX, Both]
I've become someone better
I've become someone better
Yeah, yeah
Now I look in the mirror
And I love myself better
Yeah, yeah
I've become someone better
I've become someone better
Yeah, yeah
Now I look in the mirror
Feels so good to forget ya
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Ooh, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
When you're not around, when you're not around, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
I'll finally cross you out

Annie got a wall, her son inside the dreams then out again
And remind her

Everything else and then
Anyone else that I

You're never gonna see it back
Falling to her father's eyes

Baby, what you doing tonight?
If you listen birds are playing

I woke you up, look to your eyes
I could see an angel
Everything's travelling away

Teeth beat down so what?

Standing make me laugh
You turn away
You dead bore inside

[Tape Blip]

Appliances have gone berserk
Smashing up the kitchen
Everything's moving too fast
I cannot keep up

Hit the ground so hard

[?]
Poppin' out
I'm excited to go

Damage will come my way

Don't forget that you are our son
Now go back to bed

I just know that you are there
And you won't be sure you are

The next world war
A jack-kniffed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrollin' up and down
I am born again

[Chorus]
In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

[Verse 2]
In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a West German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

[Chorus]
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

Did you

Yeah

[Verse 1]
Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so, so disappointing

[Chorus]
Let down and hangin’ around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hangin' around

[Verse 2]
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

[Pre-Chorus]
One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

[Chorus]
Let down and hangin’ around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hangin' around

Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse: Charli XCX & Clairo]
Know I keep on saying I'm alright
But every single night
When I cut off the lights
I feel like crying
Your picture revolving in my mind
But then it turns to white
I guess I’ll go in blind
I feel like crying
Hope you can forgive all of my crimes
You read, but won't reply
I just need your reply
I feel like crying
Baby, all I need's a single night
A sign, a sign, give me a sign

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Sorry I broke you down
Sorry I tore your heart
I ripped it all apart
Your headlights in the dark
Sorry ’bout Grammy night
Was flyin' out my mind
Was in a different place
Tortured and drifting by
Kept dancing in that house
The windows turned to black
My windows turned to black
My eyes were rolling back, yeah
Hope I get one more chance
Hope I get one more call
I only know what's good once I have lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I've done)
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I’ve done)
Hope you can forgive the things I’ve done
(Things I've done, things I’ve done)
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I've done)
Reply, reply, give me a sign
Yeah

You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason (No, no)
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love

[Chorus: Charli XCX]

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Why, why, why?
Don't you lie, what do you want?
Fall in love, ah, risk it all

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Tell me what you want
'Cause I know that you're lonely on your own
We're out in L.A. for a month
I don't think I can hide my emotions no, no more (Uh-huh)
A late night, say you want me, say you're selfish
Think about my body, then two-time
Say you want her? Do you want her?
Doesn't do it like me, no
So hot, burn the place down
Give you what you need

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
So you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
(Why we can't fall in love)

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Why, why, why?
Don't you lie, what do you want?
Fall in love, ah, risk it all

[Verse 2: HAIM]
Make me wanna fall in love
Baby, make mistakes
Hit me with a champagne kiss
And now I'm not thinkin' straight
Look at the skyline high
I look up, I wish I saw your face
I wanna fall in love
Jump in the deep end
'Cause deep down, you're d-dying
Tell me you're kinda nervous
Tell me you feel the same
I wish it was more than surface
I wish I could feel nothing
Come give me everything
Burn down and go again

[Chorus: HAIM]
So you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
And you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love

[Outro: HAIM & Charli XCX]
Ooh, baby
Why, why, why
Tell me, tell me, tell me the reason

Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason, oh yeah
You gotta tell me the reason
Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason

[Chorus]
Drivin' 'round in Hollywood, I can only think 'bout you
Everlasting pain and it weighs on my body, it's you
Did I lose it all? Did I fuck it up?
Are my friends really friends now or are they far gone?
On the drugs at a bar, took 'em all
Can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Fucked up, I just wanna break glass
Phone calls, I just wanna talk back
Yeah, big attitude, just like a big stack
Braindead for days, am I gonna relapse? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna talk
I don't wanna smile, no, no
Got a couple problems
I don't wanna compromise, no, no (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm drivin' 'round in Hollywood
I can only think 'bout you, you (Think 'bout, think 'bout)
Everlasting pain and it weighs on my brain, like you
Did I lose it all? Did I fuck it up?
Are my friends really friends now or are they far gone?
On the drugs at a bar, took 'em all
Can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 2]
Don't stop, I just wanna go fast
No sleep, I don't wanna relax
10 planes in five days, I been 'round the world and back again
Man I feel insane, I'm numb, can't stop the pain, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna talk
I don't wanna smile, no, no
Got a couple problems
I don't wanna compromise, no, no

[Chorus]
Drivin' 'round in Hollywood, I can only think 'bout you
Everlasting pain and it weighs on my body, it's you
Did I fuck it up?
Are my friends really friends now? Are they all far gone? (Yeah)
On the drugs at a bar, took 'em all
Can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Do you feel alright?
Do you need me by your side?
We go out all night
Makes the pain hurt a little less
Do it one more time
'Cause it feels so justified
We go out all night
See you fall, pick you up again

[Pre-Chorus]
If your eyes are sad, it makes me sad too
You got me so overprotective, it's true
Feel like I would jump off buildings for you
It's okay, I'll watch you cry all night
I promise I won't let you go

[Chorus]
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go
(Never let you go)

[Verse 2]
Lie awake till dawn (Oh, oh)
We're face to face and palm to palm
Do you feel okay?
All your problems are far away (So far away)
Lying till it's true (Oh, oh)
It's alright, I'm trusting you
Do you feel okay?
Take a breath, make you feel safe

[Pre-Chorus]
If your eyes are sad, it makes me sad too
You got me so overprotective, it's true
Feel like I would jump off buildings for you
It's okay, I'll watch you cry all night
I promise I won't let you go

[Chorus]
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never you let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go

[Outro]
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go

[Verse 1]
Hard to read, you could be OCD
You could be bad for me, you could say anything
Sometimes I get a bit TMI, little bit scared of heights
Little afraid to say
You know the things that make me smile
The face I make before my tears fall down
The things that I feel when you're acting suspicious
You know the place I run to hide
I take my problems there to work ’em out

[Chorus]
The things that I say when you don't wanna listen
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

[Verse 2]
Look at us, isn't it obvious?
Is it so dangerous? Is it so complicated?
You know the shapes my body makes
Under the sheets at 4 AM with you
The things that we break when we’re switchin' positions
You know the words to my mistakes
You understand because you made 'em too

[Chorus]
The things that I say when you don't wanna listen
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

[Bridge]
All of the things that we sometimes forget
All of the dreams that you put in my head
I'm still asleep, but there's breakfast in bed
These are the things that could make us official
Maybe the sky might not always be blue
All of my wishes will never come true
It doesn't matter 'cause I’m here with you
This stuff could make us official
So tell all your friends ’cause we're goin’ official

[Chorus]
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official
These are the things that could make us official
These are the things that could make us official
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

Work it
Oh, it's a migraine, make them pupils dilate
Wanna watch it gyrate, ass is on a tirade

Shake it, shake it, shake it, make you spray it like an aerosol

I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it

[Verse 2: CupcakKe]
I shake it like Jamaican
No birthday, but I'm cakin'
I shake it like I'm tryna get the oil off of the bacon
If I need wakin', I'ma alarm that shakin'
This ass 'bout to move like I need the house vacant
It move, move, move, and you know it won't stop
It shakin' like I'm pulled over by a white cop
It shakin' like a virgin, 'bout to give up the box
Told 'em this ass a miracle, like my name Watts
I be purgin' shit, never nervous, bitch
I get on top of that dick, shake it like turbulence
You haven't heard from 'em since, I'm a different expense
And now this pussy need Staples like I'm fuckin' on Vince
Told 'em paddle, paddle, paddle 'cause this pussy in Seattle
I'ma fight my own battles, shake it harder than a rattle
He get in it, then he tackle, wanna bite it like a apple
And this pussy so juicy, when I cum it's made of Snapple, ayy

[Interlude: Brooke Candy]
Brooke muthafuckin' Candy, Charli XCX
Miss CupcakKe is on this muthafuckin' track, oh

[Verse 3: Brooke Candy]
Tell me what you want, tell me what you want, daddy
Little bit of sugar, little bit of Brooke Candy
Cocaine-colored sheets where my ass bouncin' (Bounce)
'Bout to turn your mansion to the pussy palace
And shake it on ya like my ass on the Richter scale
My pussy crucify your body, it's the holy grail
My pussy lean, I got you sippin' from the two cup
I'm 'bout to shake my ass like I'm in a strip club
Hey, my ass is Magic City
Double Ds, all-natural big titties
Shake it like a box-fresh vibrator
Ass first-class, fast like Concorde
Damn, my ass so insane
Put me in a straightjacket, still you ain't safe
You can't handle all the jelly, put it on a plate
I'm 'bout to shake and leave you shook, like Beyoncé

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Pabllo Vittar]
(Shake it, I shake it, I sh- I shake it)

Oh darling, you say you don't know me?

Please, haha
(I sh- I shake it)
(Pabllo Vittar)

[Verse 4: Pabllo Vittar]
Pra começar direito eu soletro pra você
Rainha se escreve com dois L e dois T
Como estagiário no trabalho, eu tô sem tempo
Se tenho um problema eu resolvo com talento
Dedinho na boca, sou uma tentação
A pista pega fogo derretendo o paredão
Já mostrei que eu sou queen, falo sério pra vocês
A coroa é pesada, mas eu me acostumei
I shake it, I shake it, o meu popozão
Achei que, achei que aguentasse a pressão
Do MA, cheguei em LA
É a Pabllo e a Charli mais uma vez

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Pabllo Vittar]
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh

I just want a cupboard monster

[Intro]
I won't fuck you, you can't even sing
Yeah, sing you of bitches (Ahh)
Baby I like it raw (East side shit)
Baby I like it raw
Baby I like it raw (East side)
Baby I like it raw (East side)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, think about the game and what it could be
If all these niggas pay producers how they pay for pussy
Serious what you took me, a quick as how you lookin'
All these rappers cookie cutters
Rockin' crop tops, coochie cutters
Long way from drop tops and coogie sweaters
I'm in between two different eras though
You and you and you and you and you are all identical
Fuck the clone I can't even tell who the original
Mandela effect, I cannot remember you
As far as conscious rappers go I do what they pretend to do
So what have you assumed? How a pop nigga got the biggest nuts in the room
How you, how you conscious runnin' for Congress
Ain't this the system that put your people in bondage?
Ain't this the system that sprinkled diseases on the original people?
Gave us a book and a steeple, got niggas hooked on the needle?
And drug money, casino money
We don't ever see no money
Unless of course you got a degree or somethin'
From the school that the elite funded
Okay, you need a degree to make digits
You work your whole life to pay back tuition
By the time you retire, all of your four children have drained all your pension
Now they need tuition

[Chorus]
Shame on a nigga for tryin' to run game on a nigga
Who buck wild with the trigga
Shame on a nigga for tryin' to run game on a nigga
I'll fuck your ass up
Baby I like it raw
Baby I like it raw (Ooh)
Baby I like it raw (Ooh)
Baby I like it raw

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I put a end to the world you the greatest rapper in (In)
A rapper is nothing but candy packagin' (In)
Guess that mean you sweet inside, Laffy Taffy skin (Skin)
Bars too advanced like a graph in calculus (Mm)
Huh, I thought you guys was felons
Y'all so gangsta in the street but be so nice on Ellen
I see no lies I'm tellin', spend your life hoteling
You bought a mansion in the 'burbs to make the white folk jealous, well
The richest slave on a plantation still work on a plantation (Huh)
Rich as a bitch, wealthy indeed
Still at the end of a very long leash
If we inside a cell, I'm the mitochondria
Niggas steal your style like hypochondria
Reportin' live from the human holocaust
Fuck what the masses do them niggas is dumb lost
Yeah, it's the return of Osiris (Of Osiris? of Osiris, of Osiris)
Look, they know what clothes you like they know the timin'
To peel back layers of your psyche and send you niggas some Nikes
Just a step away from being an animal
A food crisis away from being some cannibals
Best part of my day is the back of my eyelids
Only thing better is waking up next to my bitch

[Chorus]
Shame on a nigga, try to run game on a nigga
Who buck wild with the trigga
Shame on a nigga, try to run game on a nigga
Who buck wild, wait
Baby I like it raw
Baby I like it raw
Baby I like it raw
Don't make a biopic about me, bands

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Shame on a nigga, who try to run game on a
Ol' Dirty Bastard, live and uncut
Shame on a nigga, who try to run game on a
Ol' Dirty Bastard, live and uncut
Shame on a nigga, who try to run game on a
Ol' Dirty Bastard, live and uncut
Shame on a nigga, who try to run game on a
Ol' Dirty Bastard, live and uncut
Shame on a nigga, who try to run game on a
Ol' Dirty Bastard, live and uncut
Shame on a nigga, who try to run game on a
Ol' Dirty Bastard, live and uncut

Nigga don't gas me, I don't need a fill up
Pick her up and make her suck my dick 'til she hiccup
Wop lookin' slim like a bicycle rim
But his bank obese, and the pockets on chubby
He'll play head coach just like Lovie
Thuggin' in public, these hoes love it
I double and triple, quadruple your budget
Baseball money like David Justice (Money)
Whole load sold, I ain't even touched it

Jumped off the porch, I got a Porsche
Too many hitters, they can't extort

Then split it up with my dawg like divorce
They shot at us, it was by force
We shot at them, they went to court
I don't wan' be with these niggas no more

Shorty said she only fuck trappers (Trappers)
End up fuckin' with a rapper (For real?)

Shoot you for your butter
Fuck it, pass me the cutter

Nigga, it's plain to see

[Verse]
I'ma fuck her hard and make a buddy
I'ma fuck her hard and make her bust
I'ma pull up clean, make her crush
I'ma pull up fresh, make her lust
Drankin' me some Tuss'
I ain't ever ever gotta rush
Foreign with a paper tag flushin'
Paper tag, paper tag, uh
Niggas ain't gettin' it like us
Niggas ain't better like us
I'ma take her shopping, like today
Smokin' out the jaw like clay
Feed her, feed 'em, give it to the needy
I'm so murkin' these niggas
And I ain't never ever tryna get it
Pass me the pussy, make me eat it
Bustin' on they head like a beanie
Young nigga rollin' up the reefer

[Bridge]
That lil' money ain't nothin'
Spend that shit, ain't nothin'
That lil bitch ain't nothin'
Pass her to the dogs, she nuttin'

Fuck it, pass me the cutter

[Chorus: Kanye West & Charlie Wilson]
We'll be brothers forever
What happens to one of us happens to us together
And we'll be brothers forever
We'll be brothers forever
We'll be brothers forever
(Brothers forever)

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Charlie Wilson]
We should've lit cigars, when your baby was born
Should've shouted you out and dedicated a song (Oh, oh)
I can say I was wrong, I can take the blame
'Cause brothers don't always have to share the same name
(Oh, oh)
We met when we was young, I forgot the grade
When last one to base was a rotten egg
Since then I done good and rotten things (Brothers forever)
So I could tell you one thing (Brothers forever)
As soon as I cut the grass low
It's easier to see the assholes
So I'm sorry for all the miscues
How about I admit that I miss you
I miss the fam and our brotherhood
I just wanna make sure that my brother's good
So I ain't embarrassed or above (Eh, eh)
Flying out to Paris for a hug
Or picking up the phone just to call up (Ooh)
Picking up the phone hope it's all love
'Cause Jesus taught us love, so did Moses and Mohammed (Ooh)
So nothing so atomic that we can't agree to drop it, chop it
Peace it up and get it poppin'
And bury the hatchet so we can lock in (Ohh-oh)
Why don't you still have him on the line?

[Chorus: Kanye West & Charlie Wilson]
We'll be (Woo) brothers forever
What happens to one of us happens to us together
And we'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
We'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
We'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
(Brothers forever)

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Charlie Wilson]
I wish I had a PA system for all the brothers we love
For the ones that was missing but joined the cut where we from
See how the DA did 'em, when they was hustling drugs
And that was in the city of brotherly love
See brothers are amused by other brother's reps
But it takes a real one to keep the other in check (Other in check)
So this fraternity's for eternity (Brothers forever)
And every rhyme I write is 25 to life (Brothers forever)
Every dime I wife thought I was Brian McKnight
And my homies said that you should shine your light
And the groupies gave us the time of our life
And I think about those times when I'm flying a flight
And I knew we'd reconnect when the timing was right
Man, I ain't spoke to you in like forever (Brothers forever)
Maybe it's time we put the band back together

[Chorus: Kanye West & Charlie Wilson]
We'll be brothers forever
What happens to one of us happens to us together
And we'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
We'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
We'll be (We'll be) brothers forever
Brothers forever

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Brothers forever (Uh, oh)
We'll be brothers forever (Oh)
Brothers forever, brothers forever (Ooh, ooh)

Got a big whopper in my clothes
Racks stack taller than you know (Know)
Hell nah, she can't come if she got clothes (Woah)
Every night a different ho at all my shows (Woah)
Drankin' red on the low (Low, uh)

[Chorus]
I'm sick of you sayin' that you love me too, ooh
I'm sick of you sayin' that you thuggin' with me too
I'm sick of you sayin' that you bussin' with me, boo
All I wanna see is your relaxation, yeah, yeah, yeah (Relaxin')
(Ooh, ooh) Read and write for me, baby (Read and write)
(Ooh, ooh) Fuck me out my sleep, baby
(Ooh, ooh) Warm it up for me, baby (Woo, warm it up)
(Ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah (Warm it up)
Yeah

[Verse]
Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

[Verse 2: Drake]
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

[Intro]
Ayy, yeah, church voice, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, you dig?
Huh, huh huh
With you, I'm right
Mmm, ayy

[Chorus]
Gon' and take some links up out that bitch
Put it on your wrist, watch that motherfucker gliss
Down, boogie boogie, down down with your bitch
Let me suck that clit, baby, let me suck them tits
Gon' and, gon' and take some, take some links up out that bitch
Put it on your wrist, watch that motherfucker gliss
Down, boogie boogie, down down with your bitch
Put it on your tit, let me put it on your lips

Shawty got Versace speedos on
All we know is ball, ball, ball, chemo, holmes
Spendin' money on each other, yeah, ping pong
Woah, woah, ape shit, YSL, King Kong
Gonna love the tall conversation, woah, woah
Bitch, we get it on, confrontations, woah, woah
When the door ajar, just go spray it, woah, woah
Let the room be dark, gotta cover, call 'em, woah
Wheezy Beats that raw, all these bitches kick it in
Walked inside the room and seen the light hittin' through the lens
Man, don't play that bull with none of these bitches, none of these niggas
It's hard to say "Sorry" when you dealin' with a kingpin

[Chorus]
Gon' and take some links up out that bitch
Put it on your wrist, watch that motherfucker gliss
Down, boogie boogie, down down with your bitch
Let me suck that clit, baby, let me suck them tits
Gon' and, gon' and take some, take some links up out that bitch
Put it on your wrist, watch that motherfucker gliss
Down, boogie boogie, down down with your bitch
Put it on your tit, let me put it on your lips

[Verse 2]
Ayy, bitch, I'm a martian, I think I lost it
I just got a foreign, put the D's on the car
Nigga, stop playin' 'fore we feed you to the sharks
Left hand steering and the other one doin' it 

[?]
One wrist livin' lovely and the other one livin' large
Droppin' the pin, pull up
And I put that on Allah
You fuck niggas done made it war
So fuck it, shoot up all the cars
You better have your money ready, lil' bitch
And you better have straps 'fore we charge
You better have hunnid rounds with every boy
You better have racks with 'em, boy
I spent me some racks on my T
I'm straight up, she tryna leave
I'm ballin' like I'm Rasheed
I'm thinkin' 'bout goin' to the league
I pull up beside the street
Don't make me pull up on that Jeep
These niggas gon' do it for free
But I'd rather give 'em some G's

[Chorus]
Gon' and take some links up out that bitch
Put it on your wrist, watch that motherfucker gliss
Down, boogie boogie, down down with your bitch
Let me suck that clit, baby, let me suck them tits
Gon' and, gon' and take some, take some links up out that bitch
Put it on your wrist, watch that motherfucker gliss
Down, boogie boogie, down down with your bitch
Put it on your tit, let me put it on your lips

Alone on an airplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane

I need to wash myself again
To clean all the dirt away
But I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
But who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?

Baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends
Oh, no, no

Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?

Keep an eye out for the neighbors
Anyway you turn

Open your skull

Climbing up the walls
I am the club and carving knife
We are friends til we die
You should not walk alone at night
You must show me your care
In the time when the lights go out
I am her face when she sleeps
I can't remember how it happened
Fifteen blows to the brain
I am the face on the news
I will strike when the- I will strike anytime
I will knock fifteen times
I have the smell of a local man
I can strike anytime
I am the pick in the ice in the quiet country lanes
I am the newspaper round
I am the eyes in the cupboard
I am the creak in the floorboards
I am the crack of the hammer
Overhead powerlines
I am the old, frightened
I am the years, ever... poording

We’ll love him and raise him
Till he finally leaves us
What should we name him
How about Adolf
Little Adolf

He's growing up like little boys do
He's grown a mustache and he’s only two
He's a pyrotechnic and he loves to play with knifes
And our little buddy gives the wierdest high fives
Little Adolf

Little Adolf
He's a dictator todd
Dictator todd
He gets a little bit angry, but he's smart as hell
And who taught him how to speak german so well

He doesn't like milk, soda hurts his head
I tried to give him juice, this is what he said
I hate juice
Okay, Hitler please
Drink your juice, i'm tired
I want to go to bed
Just get the juice out of here
Out of this house, out of this coutry, now
Hitler, what do you want me to do
Put the juice in camps and separate them
Seperate juice, Hitler
What do you want me to
Like separate them by flavor
By like consentration
Consentration camp, ohh

[Verse]
Guess I got the mind of a little man

[Bras] are like women, about how you hit a man
Then she tell a story, this shit kinda bitter man
This is a nut 

[?], about how you did it man
You never hit, so you feel like a silly man
She never mention the spot that you fillin' in
She keep on tellin' your friends, your head in a spin
You can't even win, your head in a dance
She won't let it in, you spend it on her, she spend it on him
You see a check, then you see a grand
As soon as you speak, I pace as 

[?]
A face in the sand, a face 

[?] her man
And ya'll take your pictures, save it a chance
She call you a name, you scratchin' your chin
Like who is this nigga man, who is a 

[?]
You finally get it, you catchin' ahead
Suckin' your head, I'm far out the wing
And she tried to vent 'bout she wasn't in
How she really good, how she ain't a pimp
Then you take her back, she do it again
The story are, niggas are really a wimp, ey

[Verse 1]
As long as you got yours
Maybe I can go and get mine
I'll parade my fish and barrel
Right beneath your loaded eyes
Though I know it may sound cruel
Inconvenient for you and ugly
But I'm too handsome to sit and hide

[Refrain]
So you tell me, what's a man to do
When man done lost all his pride?

[Verse 2]

[?]
Believe me, I can get with anyone
You'll find me laughing in the weeds
Flanked by Persians and blondes
And I know neither of us wants
To spend our time in the spotlight
As glamour withers on the vine

[Refrain]
So you tell me, what's a man to do
When man done lost all his pride?

[Verse 1: Akon]
When I see you
I run out of words, to say (Ahh)
I wouldn't leave you
’Cause you're that type of girl to make me stay (Ahh)
I see the guys tryin' to holla

[Verse 1]
My daddy told me always be strong son
Don't you ever cry
You find the pretty girls and then you love them
Then you say goodbye

[Chorus]
I never dreamed that you would leave me
But now you're gone
I never dreamed that I would miss you
Woman won't you come back home

[Verse 2]
I never dreamed that you could hurt me
And leave me blue
I've had a thousand, maybe more
But never one like you

[Chorus]
I never dreamed I could feel so empty
But now I'm down
I never dreamed that I would beg you
Woman I need you now

[Verse 3]
It seems to me I took your love for granted
It feels to me that this time I was wrong, so wrong
Oh Lord how I feel so lonely
I say woman won't you come back home
I tried to do what my daddy taught me
But I think he knew
Someday that I would find one woman like you
I never dreamed that it could feel so good, Lord
That two could be one

[Chorus]
I never knew about sweet love
So woman won't you come back home
Oh baby won't you come back home

Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh

Wasted (wasted)
And the more I drink, the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby, every place I go reminds me of you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
And every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
That you got someone new
Yeah, I see but don't believe it
Even in my head, you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be? (What we used to be)
Is it better now that I'm not around? (That I'm not around)
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name

Who's taking you home, home, home, home

Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh

You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, whoa

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh (The way I used to love you)
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

[Verse 1]
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

[Verse 2]
She wants it all
She's always taking something
And now I'm left with nothing
I'm ripping off, oh
I'm ripping off that bandage
Because I just can't stand it

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing on a fool
Like she's seventeen and cool
She really thinks that she can move
But it's just nasty
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

[Post-Chorus]
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular, oh

[Bridge]
This summer's gonna hurt
It's gonna hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
I see her dancing in the street
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
'Cause she's so fancy
'Cause she's so fancy

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker

Karma police
Arrest this man he
Talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio

Karma police
Arrest this girl she
Stares at me
As if she owns the world
And we have crashed her party

This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with me

Karma police
I've given all I can
It's not enough
I've given all I can but we're still on the payroll
(And it's coming around)
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with me

Phew for a minute there
I lost myself

Phew for a minute there

For a minute there

Phew for a minute there

I've got a problem
I cannot speak

Walked a thousand miles
With your heart
Where it’s supposed to
Never hide
Where I'm going

I walked and I timed

Since there's nothing wrong
To be good
To be good
I’m to 

[?]

So when it gets dark
Make your mark
On my face
I walked away
Wants to offend
Little dogs
I guess I'll just walk a little dog
And I know what happens
When you go away
If something had gone
Whatever you say

And I know I strangle in
And

I know I

Put him on the ground
Of the ashes baby

Wanting me to

Anyone at all
If he comes back I'll
Be ready this time
With a gun and alarm clock
And in

Way up in time

Way up the line

[Jim do you have the dat? Okay]

Angel calls you
You'd better reply
Other angel burn you
Cut out your eyes

Tonight i'll want to
Be on my own
Tonight i'll want to
Be left alone

But it never happens
You're always on the phone
It never happens

[Cool]
This is the place
Sit down, you're safe now
You've been stuck in a lift
We've been trying to reach you, Thom

This is the place
It won't hurt ever again

The smell of air-conditioning
The fish are belly-up
Empty all your pockets
'Cause it's time to come home

This is the place
Remember me
I'm the face you always see

You've been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale
At the bottom of the ocean
The smell of air-conditioning
The fish are belly-up
Empty all your pockets
'Cause it's time to come home

The smell of air-conditioning
The fish are belly-up
Let it go

Today is the first day of the rest of your days
So lighten up, squirt
If I get old
I will not give in
But if I do
Remind me of this

Remind me that
Once I was free
Once I was cool
Once I was me

And if I sat down
And crossed my arms
Hold me to
This song

Knock me out
Smash out my brains
If I take a chair
And start to talk shit

If I get old
Remind me of this
The night we kissed
And I really meant it
Whatever happens
If we're still speaking
Pick up the phone
Play me this song

[Chorus]
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker

[Verse 1]
I wouldn't try to throw myself away
If you asked me, I'd say
To be careful, my love
At death we'll leave the same
If you want me to stay
Don't keep me waiting for it

[Pre-Chorus]
We can't change the things we can't control
It's summer somewhere so you shouldn't be so cold
But you can't even look me in the eye if you tried
We can try, we can try

[Chorus]
I see us dancing by ourselves
We do it better with no one around, yeah
Just you in my imagination, yeah
In my imagination, oh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, there's nothing left to cry about
I guess I'm living in a drought
It's raining like it was before
Something that you never knew you needed more of

[Pre-Chorus]
We can't change the things we can't control
It's summer somewhere so you shouldn't be so cold
But you can't even look me in the eye if you tried
We can try, we can try

I see us dancing by ourselves
We do it better with no one around, yeah

I can do so many things
So many things, so many things
You know if you just use your imagination
Oh, if you just use your imagination, oh
I really love you

Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm... (Hey)

Now you can say that you made out the ghetto, you're back in that 'yo being creative
Bih better say nothin' about me, I pull up with sticks and I hope that they ready

Pull to the hood with that muhfuckin' shotty and K, let 'em know that y'all ready

[Bridge]
I just dropped a brick in the driveway

Big booty here and they ridin' on me

Bring that Act' to who want it
Bad bitch out Barcelona

Do this shit in my sleep
Family first, I rock Fendi jeans
Plenty people depend on me

Jewelry, you know that you dig it
You can't let 'em ruin this
This money pursuing us
I throw it like cruelty

[Chorus]
Cop me a coupe and I paid all my rent, make these niggas obey while I pull up with the stick

[Verse 1]

[?]
Jacknife Janet drove across the earth
To take a flaming ‘68
To the body shop on 3rd
Now her old man is called The Reverend
He was the horizontal judge
Running his tab off across the county
Healing on psychedelic drugs
Let's just say he eyes at the turnstile
But though the landing didn’t stick
To hear my Zen-dispensing figures
Screaming, "Josh, how bad is it?"

[Chorus]
If you tell it like it is
Then lover, I will let you in

[Verse 2]
Let's call up Tony
He was our family ghost
Smoked crack on Lily's floor
And wrote in his evil notes
A fishmonger gone too early
Is what he called his higher power
And this holy field is full of typos
And published on his brow
Now we messed with the wrong painter's daughter
For someone so attached to his legs
Before they banished him from New York
You'll never believe what this guy says

[Chorus]
Says, if you tell it like it is
Then lover, I will let you in

[Verse 3]
Hey, dreamtime stranger
I am dying to ask
Where a child of nature like you can see
Diamond skull tipped staff
And now what's this piss you're drinking?
Are you trying to make the spirits laugh?
Well, I have outlived the blood blush trailing you
And now I know what's coming next
The last time I saw her, she was hanging by her wrists
Said if they miss with 

[?] my gospel
Said if they played the thing in six
Said if they tried to call a beautiful wedding
And you just tell them all I meant

[Chorus]
Is if you tell it like it is
Then lover, I will let you in
If you tell it like it is
Then lover, then lover, I will let you in
Then lover, I will let you in
Then lover, I will let you in, oh
Then lover, I will let you in
Then lover, I will let you in

[Verse 1]
Make the incision
Careful precision
Blood minestrone
Decomposition
New life christened
Fatty rolls of brie

[Refrain]
Organ farmer
Organ farmer

[Verse 2]
Delicatessen
Of our profession
Growing muscle meat
Bring in the carcass
Waken departed
Speak our blasphemy

[Refrain]
Organ farmer
Organ farmer

[Bridge]
Counterfeit hypocrite
Runs the mall, runs 'em all
Citadel guards it well
Counting coins, counting stem cells
Wiretap divinity
Human laboratory
Kill the squid, cut the tree
Arrogant human being
Meadow's vast, body parts pulled apart
Partly smart, partly art, partly not
Part of me wants to breathe eternally
Part of me wants to cut out my heart

[Outro]
Farm colossal
Wake the fossil
In the fields of beef

[Intro]
Six7 on the beat
Marii Beatz, turn me up

[Chorus]
She's a superstar, I need to sign her
Super bad bitch, I'm tryna find her
She so bad, she made me switch the lineup
Fresh fade, just got it lined up
Big old booty, it's draggin' behind her
She's my Wonder Woman, my bitch from Wakanda
Crocodile Birkins and piranhas
Rockstar wasted like Nirvana

[Verse 1]
Bad bitch with a body
I'ma make her call me papi
Niggas gettin' out they body
Fuck the opps, they can't stop me
Black card in my wallet
I ain't never snitched, I'm solid
Bands to make the watches rocky
Fuckin' up the money like Scottie
Black thick chick, she cocky
Eat a nigga balls like broccoli
Hard in the paint like Barkley
Hard to kill, they can't chop me
New coupe, they can't park it
Claim the beef up, let's spark it
Geeked up so high, in orbit
Money so tall, it's corporate
Shawty said I taste like sherbet
I don't even think she worthy
I don't think she deserve it
New Phantom with the curtain
Zone 6 Julius Irving
Supermodel bitch, she perfect
Pass her, Kyrie Irving
My ho so bad, they nervous

[Chorus]
She's a superstar, I need to sign her
Super bad bitch, I'm tryna find her
She so bad, she made me switch the lineup
Fresh fade, just got it lined up
Big old booty, it's draggin' behind her
She's my Wonder Woman, my bitch from Wakanda
Crocodile Birkins and piranhas
Rockstar wasted like Nirvana

My lil' bitch gettin' dollars
Green like an iguana
Grande, Ariana
We'll bust your piñata, shotta
My lil' devil wear Prada, yeah
She'll lie to your honor, yeah
Bad bitch is her partner, yeah
Smokin' on the ganja, she high as hell
She shop 'til she drop like she live in the mall
Gotta fly where it's hot, that's where she live in the fall
Give a damn what them haters say
Shawty livin' in a real major way
Never put shit on layaway
She'll work a nigga on Labor Day
You so beautiful, boo, I'm in a beautiful mood
'Cause I'm a beautiful dude, and your friends beautiful too
I let her shop 'til she drop, closet look like a mall
And I'ma fly her where it's hot when the temp start to fall, burr

[Chorus]
She's a superstar, I need to sign her
Super bad bitch, I'm tryna find her
She so bad, she made me switch the lineup
Fresh fade, just got it lined up
Big old booty, it's draggin' behind her
She's my Wonder Woman, my bitch from Wakanda
Crocodile Birkins and piranhas
Rockstar wasted like Nirvana

We born to be wild
She sworn that she vow imma only denial?
Catch her on the rebound
Animalistic sexual tendencies express them tremendously
And work out the chemistry enjoy the intensity, serenity

We get higher than eyesight
And then we just skydive
Mentality in a phase radicals in a rage
Valuables in a blaze hot animals in a cage

Hear ye! Hear ye!

When it comes to football
I'm a bad mama jama
The 49ers is my team of choice
I love chucking the pigskin to Gerald Rice
My SuperBowl rings speak for themselves
And there's dozens of trophies all over my shelves
I'm tired now, but that won't stop me
From going out this evening and crushing 'tang
Bye!

[Part I: GONE, GONE]

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon’ leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it’s rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
I guess it wasn't meant to be
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love’s gone, my love’s gone
My love's gone, gone

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can’t compete with me

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love’s gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
I guess it wasn't meant to be
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone, gone, gone)
Going, and now I'm scarred for life

[Interlude: CeeLo Green]
My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
It was my fault, I reached
That contract got breached
Now I'm back roaming the streets
So peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)

[Outro: Jerrod Carmichael]
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul

[Part II: THANK YOU]

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy

Crime scene too dirty, they left a fingerprint
Oh you gangsta of the year huh
Bet if I threw your mixtape out of my window you shed a tear huh

She wanted me choke her, told her sign a waiver first
I'm talking paperwork, paperwork, body search
When they hundred bitches falling like life alert
And I don't want no praise, I don't want no debt
So many agents on my page think my phone is tapped
She tells me "Bobby Ray you always drip the hardest"
Call it jaws, pussy wetter then the sharks fin

That ain't your hubby just a nigga you live with
Fuck on a little bit and split out her bills with
You split 'cause he found he had a family in Memphis
And his kids go to clipston (to clipston?) to clipston
You want a nigga everyone ain't been with
But nigga's gone nigga I would say it's a slim pick
If love is a crime I got felonies
Baby momma's crushing like a jelly bean

All the beds full, they gon' have to sleep on the floor
Yeah I got a little head before I got out of bed
Then I got a little uh and she fixed me some eggs
Hopped in the McLaren, yeah I hit Flat Shoals
From a tribe called Decatur off of Candler Road
Hoes be trapping like T.I. and Gucci
She know that she bougie doing yoga and sushi
Mami send me pics so she want an invite
But she wasn't tryna smash so I cancelled the flight
You see dealin' with these bitches is a serious task
Didn't know what that bitch wanted, didn't have time to ask

Six-six-six in the morning
Six-six-six in the morning
Six-six-six in the morning

[Verse 2]
One by one yeah I'm knockin' 'em out
Just ran out of smoke, had to pick up an ounce
B.o.B. be making heads ring
People always ask what the hell does that mean
Kickin' all of the rhymes and breakin' all of your spines
I ain't gotta specify, to all it applies
Your head real big but your cash real small
Tryna sell pussy, ain't got no walls
You got the right one bitch, B-I-N-G-O
Pulled up Follies hangin' out of the window
Pass the keys to valet and he tossed me a demo
I gave that shit a listen but it wasn't on tempo
Mobbin' to the party on some hooligan shit
Please don't bring your friend cause she too in the mix
She a mi-mi-mi-mixy 'lil bitch
She could hop out of a plane and land on a dick

[Chorus Sample]
Six-six-six in the morning
Six-six-six in the morning
Six-six-six in the morning
Word

[Verse 3]
Yeah, 'cause see the juug in the hood is always fraud
She'll go through your bag, she'll steal your card
Wanted nothin' in life, just smoke weed and strip
Take them grandma panties off 'fore you hop in the whip
Take my city with me like the ground strapped to my feet
King Kong when I land, carpets that's the relief
I was 16 when I was clappin' her cheeks
I was rappin' before I could actually speak
Judge Judy bitches feel the need to discuss you
Get out your feelings girl, at least a real nigga loves you
Just livin' in the city is a serious task
Never know what these hoes want, didn't have time to ask

Six-six-six in the morning

[Intro]
You ain't shit with him either
Apparently, yeah

[Verse 1]
It was all love, then it got ugly
Took me to the courtroom, got full custody
Kids growing up like, "my dad don't fuck with me"
So they don't fuck with me
Moved to the West Coast, she got real uppity
Told me that she was in love with me
Now she on the flight every night, straight hustlin'
Her name, Joseline, she be out he jostling and shit
Modeling and shit, for photographers
The wedding, she be breaking all them zodiacs down
You would've sworn that that bitch was an astrologer (Mm)
Even though she know the whole town, man she swear that she anonymous
Look, talkin' 'bout she ain't shit without Jesus
Bitch, you ain't shit with him either
Snapchattin' the preacher
She's a palm reader

[Interlude]
Give the poor man a break (Give the poor man a break)
Give the poor man a break
Give the poor man a break (Give the poor man a break)
He done took about all he can take
As we go a little somethin' like this

[Verse 2]
I was tryna fuck the bitch, she was on some other shit
Came to the crib but she wasn't tryna fuck with me
Said she had a man but that wasn't really public
Now she got a publicist coverin'
All of the dudes that she cuddle with
She was a nurse wearin' scrubs and shit
I find it puzzlin'
She do a couple of drills to pay a couple of bills
She turned her IG page to a couple of mil'
She make more from rappers babies than rappers maybe
He been on child support since the 80's
When you get head, you gotta pull out
She'll spit it out, get pregnant for clout
I-I-I ain't being comical about it
She just being economical about it
Water bill, gas bill, light bill, phone bill
Slipped him a Benadryl, ran off with his bank card

[Interlude]
Give the poor man a break
Give the poor man a break
Give the poor man a break
He done took about all he can take
As we go a little somethin' like this

[Verse 3]
'Cause of you bitch
'Cause of you bitch
Yeah, he broke, so she strip
He trip when she dip
'Cause she live from three sips
She takes trips for three grips
He broke, so she strip
He trip when she dip
'Cause she live from three sips
She takes trips for three grips
She got clientele, if you ask how much, she say, "I don't sell"
Got a couple of hoes that I know well
But you'll never know because I don't tell

[Interlude]
Give the poor man a break
Give the poor man a break
Give the poor man a break
He done took about all he can take

[Intro]
The Grand Wizard, B-O-B
B, Do you wanna be down with the king? O-B
The Grand Wizard B-O-B
B, Do you wanna be down with the king? O-B

[Verse 1]
They try to get under my skin, ingrown hair
Rappers in a box, huh, you belong there
I cut four holes in the top, you could draw air
King, I should start an airline called Throne Air
Niggas never step but be having long stairs
Fuck your girl like rabbits all night, that's long hair
Ain't talking royalty but I brought the Dutches
My blunts is Dublin, you black but your blood be Russian
I said I showed you niggas how to do gold, I'm a blacksmith
My demographic all say my verse demographic
Wish a nigga would, presidential cabinet
Too much baggage, if you fly I'm gravity
Your water ain't shit, I control the drip
Show up with a bitch look like Farrah Fawcett
Made a couple m's cleaning out my closet
Just a prophet that make profit

[Chorus]
(Bands) The Grand Wizard (Bands), B-O-B
(Bands) B, Do you wanna be down with the king? (Bands), O-B
(Bands) The Grand Wizard (Bands), B-O-B
(Bands) B, Do you wanna be down with the king? (Bands) O-B

[Verse 2]
Looking out the window
I close blinds but I win though
Beat drop, rappers barely stayin' alive
That's how this go, my disc go platinum like Sisqo
First class nigga, y'all snuck in the cargo
Had to call an embargo
I'm the black El Dorado
I put the fye in WiFi
Your ex files for divorce, sci-fi
She on standby, I land on her cheeks (Huh)
In my seats is 30,000 feet
Join the mile high club or see 36 deep
She gets off at concourse B (Ah)
That's why they say I'm deranged
B-b-b-b I brought my snake on the plane, getting brain
I step off the plane, terms ill
Terminology filled with shit to heal the terminally ill

[Chorus]
(Bands) The Grand Wizard (Bands), B-O-B
(Bands) B, Do you wanna be down with the king? (Bands), O-B
(Bands) The Grand Wizard (Bands), B-O-B
(Bands) B, Do you wanna be down with the king? (Bands) O-B
Your water, your water, your water ain't shit
I control drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Your water ain't shit, I control the drip
I control the drip
You water ain't shit, I control the drip
I control the drip, drip, drip
You water ain't shit, I control the drip

[Verse 1]
And I ain't gotta drive tonight
Called a Uber to the party tonight
Who feelin’ like a thottie tonight?
She about to catch a body tonight
You ain't tryna fuck, who you tryna convince
Niggas tryna pay, bitches gotta pay rent
All that cockblockin', what you trying to prevent?
All these bottles, we ain’t makin' a dent

[Chorus]
Gas tank on E, but all dranks on me (Ayy)
All dranks on me
Yeah the top lonely but I'm rollin' low key
All dranks on me 'cause I'm B.o.B

[Verse 2]
Ayy this shit is a banger
I'm woke, but all I know is strippers and gangsters
I delivered Topanga
All that hatin', you just building up anger
If you ain’t throwin’ them knees up
Don't smoke my weed up or drink my drink up
Tell the DJ to turn up the speakers
I’m throwin' ten racks, niggas tryna keep up

[Chorus]
Gas tank on E but all dranks on me (Ayy)
All dranks on me
Yeah the top lonely but I'm rollin' low key
All dranks on me ’cause I'm B.o.B

[Verse 3]
She looking at all of this ice (Uh)
Don't be caught in the hype
You about to catch a body tonight
It can happen in my bed but I'm the ottoman type (Ha)
This the lottery life
I got a woman but we got us a wife
The type of nigga that you gotta invite (Uh)
With some verses that you gotta recite

[Chorus]
Gas tank on E but all dranks on me (Ayy)
All dranks on me
Yeah the top lonely but I'm rollin' low key
All dranks on me 'cause I'm B.o.B (Ayy)

[Verse 4]
I'm a dog ass nigga, I'm Anubis
Gotta clean the weed smoke off my Cuban
Fuck around and pick up the acoustic
I let her rock the mic, she said it's therapeutic (Ha)
Light it and puff
We just thuggin', we ain't wifein' 'em up
You be gripin' and such
She with us 'cause you ain't pipin' her up

[Chorus]
Gas tank on E but all dranks on me (Ayy)
All dranks on me
Yeah the top lonely but I'm rollin' low key
All dranks on me 'cause I'm B.o.B

[Outro]
'Cause I'm, 'cause I'm B.o.B

[Intro]
I-I-I-I got a six shooter for the top five vets
And then one bullet left to play Russian roulette
I'm Nostradamus, I've seen your future, it's too late
All y'all niggas suspect I guess crime pays, what can I say?
(What can I say?)

[Refrain]
So fuck you and your mob guys
This the part of the film where your mob dies, I got 'em!

[Verse 1]
N-N-Nigga flip and spit hot coals
I showed you niggas how to go diamond like I was minin' hope
My mind's a playground where my mood swings
But I ain't here to play though, I'm more like Plato
Y'all niggas Play-Doh
Y-Y-Yeah, I'm the man of the hour
Songs made 30 mils like I'm manufacturing flour
You niggas ain't that hard to find
Should be a fine to get in line like, "damn, one at a time"
L-l-l-l-l-like how you niggas make it this far
I never babysit my liquor but I raise the bar
I left the 'gram to cut an album, niggas thought I was dead
And I ain't talking diet when I say you niggas fed
I get to, get to, get to, get to, get to slidin' on 'em
And then I get to, get to, get to Frankie Limon on 'em
Veganism, feminism, government hypnotism
I'm just speaking facts bro, this ain't even lyricism
I drop a gem but niggas carry the mask
Gas tank on empty but the car full of gas
W-W-Why do fools gotta try me though (Gotta try me though)
Like I ain't got a .308 rifle scope (Rifle scope)
Nigga you ain't saying shit, I'm about to blow (Boutta blow)
Tell a rap nigga park it like a automobile
I ain't got no more chill

[Refrain]
Fuck you and your mob guys
This the part of the flick where the mob dies
And all of the Gods rise

[Chorus]
Gorilla, Godzilla, God nigga, vibe nigga
I don't need no props nigga
I just raise my stocks nigga
Don't say I'm pro-black, fuck niggas
I trust everything but niggas, what nigga?
And if you knew what I knew
The government would back up off of you too, boo

[Verse 2]
You had the ball but you fumbled though (But you fumbled though)
Your bills piling up, you must live in Buffalo (You must live in Buffalo)
I don't want no respect from you
Sent your girl home in a Uber XL to be respectable
Niggas gon' start to question you
How you grown gettin' bullied?
I guess your mind did not quite develop fully (Uh yeah)
I'm going bat shit, niggas scared to wipe their asses
Yeah I'm from a different bracket
Rappin' on a track where 2Pac did a verse for Michael Jackson
Got the flash drive in my jacket
Why the fools try B.o.B
Before you try me, try crack, shit
Tell a nigga park it like Jurassic
Country ass accent, you gotta admit, above average
I just bagged your bitch, with an iPhone 6
I showed you magic, when y'all was getting no bread
On that Atkins

[Outro]
Hi-Hi-Hi-High hopes for hell
They say in war you must oppress the male
Niggas said they woke and I'm skeptical
Same mentality, you just replace Jesus with vegetables

[Verse 1]
Niggas be nice to me just 'cause I drive a Benz
I could be your enemy, I could not be your friend
I could be the Unabomber, durag and some Timbs
An alien that blends in, bitch I’m crazy in skin uh
Is eatin' and shittin' and thrivin’ on Earth
The greatest shit in the universe
Even roaches give birth huh
Life ain't what they make it out to be
If heaven is Poppa Doughs then Earth is Applebees
And I just came for the appetizer dog
It's a shame that I can't abide the law
You would think that I'm suicidal, nah
Fuck suicide, transform inside
Bitch I wanna die
I'm a horny guy with a horny dick
Call it poltergeist, don't ignore the signs
'Cause if she wanted a family
She wouldn’t be popping E and plan B
And I ain’t got no kids but she calling me papi
Five-oh spilling coffee over my clock speed
Pineapples party looking like Great Gatsby
Niggas wanna at me but can't get at me
Kundalini rising, the snakes is rattling
I keep snakes around to eat the rats huh
I tried to be vegan but I eats the cat
I ain’t dyking but the backpack keeps the strap
You conditioned like that, I'm a nigga like that huh
You call the cops, you dependent like that
Wait, did I pick the right track?
Wait a minute, let me get it right back
Prayin' for a freedom that you already had
That sound like a recipe for starvin' the blacks
You think that he a friend ’cause he give you opportunity
He really just a poverty pimp in your community
That's not ambiguity
I'm killin' niggas all of my verses are eulogies
Physical body's just a shell
Take off the S and what does that spell?
What does that spell? What is that smell?
Glasses tortoise shell
You a waitress, tell you hold the L

[Interlude]
Over to you B.o.B
Man I tell ya, it's a great night here in Atlanta
For all the people that just got here
Welcome to Atlanta
Hoes be hoin'
Schemers be schemin'
Trappers be trappin'
Thots be thottin'
Niggas be niggin'
And it's like that

[Verse 2]
I'm armed and present, I'm beyond eclectic, this is Armageddon
Get your army and your armor ready, get your bomber ready
I'm a monsta and you headed in the swamp direction
Trespass find yourself pointed in the pump direction
I would apologize and issue out a statement
But controversy is way too entertainin'
The let down of the American dream
I guess life is not a swell as it seemed
All this false hope passed down from generation to generation
You thought lil' man man would be amazin'
And get an education
But he still live in the basement, sellin' eighths to the neighbors
The last slice of weddin' cake in the fridge
He got a couple of side kids, fuckin' hoes in your crib
Niggas bug me, get the D
But books are nigga repellent, I tell them read

[Outro]
That all we have for tonight
We gonna get out of here
And pay these light bills ah, pay these rents ha
Yeah Georgia power don't take EBTs
So we can do this shit for free on TV ha
And remember, don't drink and drive
Just smoke and fly
Where's that fucking bar at

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Ski mask, from a wild ass county called DeKalb
Might get capped in your knee cap
Come back and finish the job while you in rehab
Amy Winehouse, send you back to rehab
Notice the pattern
My flow killin' niggas, Black Lives Matter
Punches give you headline fractures
Push your hairline backwards
Four words, rings bigger than Saturn's
I'm just tryna get by
Skipped the first day of high school just to get high
Tried to fuck my second grade teacher back in the day
They kicked me out 'cause I was older than my actual age
I was, I was, I was looking for a cougar bitch
New niggas be on that groupie shit

[Refrain]
In my head, I see spooky shit, loony shit
This, this, this is what goes on in the mind of a lunatic (Bandz)

[Interlude]
He's a paranoia who's a menace to our society
He's a, he's a, he's a paranoia who's a menace to our society

[Verse 2]
These niggas ain't got the heart they portray
Tell them ghetto boys, I'll put a scar in their face
Just go the opposite way
Hop in your Honda and escape
Bobby Ray, one with the wolves and I pummel the greats
I'm on a killin' spree, turn up my auxiliary
Difference 'tween me and you, I say the shit I really mean
Choose the one can feel with me
All about your energy
Say she spiritual and sexual, I guess two different things
You want some hero shit?
It's now a Tarentino flick
Boom, now you missing, Findin' Nemo shit
Niggas do whatever to survive, I done seen some shit
They be snitchin' for the precinct, get a fingerprint
She a Spanish broad but she like that gringo dick
Ice a bitch out, Sub Zero shit
I been throwin' racks for ten summers
Bitch you ain't save none of it?
Say you want the whip, half of that could've funded it
She know that I'm a hooligan
She wanna see if her coochie fit

[Refrain]
In my head, I see spooky shit, loony shit
This, this, this is what goes on in the mind of a lunatic (Bandz)

[Interlude]
He's a paranoia who's a menace to our society
He's a, he's a, he's a paranoia who's a menace to our society

[Verse 3]
Yeah
Went pop, went conscious, ain't no shuttin' me up
When it became about the money, that was fuckin' me up
I'll never throw another motherfucker under the bus
So I'm the only one to blame for second guessin' my gut
I cut the TV on and nothing's on but black trauma porn
Strap in my underarm, loud as a thunderstorm
Niggas only hit you back when they need somethin'
Then disappear like police comin'
Raise your fucking kids so they don't run in my crib
Sold a funeral home and gotta send you dozens of bills
Be lookin' puzzled for real
I'm from struggle for real
Bobby Bandz, I ain't got no fuck or no chill
Flip, flip, wear flip flops to your funeral
Treat your grave like a urinal
Niggas wouldn't pass me a crumb, now they wanna ask me to prom
I'm tea-baggin' your mom, bitch

[Outro]
Ha, lil' bitch
This is what goes on lil' bitch
In a mind of a lunatic, bitch

[Intro]
Glorious
Decatur Eastside, ATL
You can't hotep your way out sissy

[Chorus: Brother Panic]
Grand Herbalizer, what time is it?
The Gods have come, the dark side speaks
Grand Herbalizer, what time is it?
B-Bobby in it for the strong, hotep for the weak
Grand Herbalizer, what time is it?
We come from the East to teach in the West
Grand Herbalizer, what time is it?
The masters teach, my science is deep

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
In a light prison doin' a light sentence
A mix between DJ Scratch and Jimi Hendrix
Niggas always hang the hero so I'm the villain
The bad guy, the Joker, the end, the beginnin'
I thought slavery was over, it just got remolded
They stole what was yours and back to you they sold it
The same ones that be sayin' down with the systems
The same motherfuckers investin' in prisons
Private free labor, I am the staple
Went independent and said fuck the label
The eyes of these haters say how are you able
To do what you want and keep food on your table?
She cried when Obama got elected
She cried when Trump got elected
Bitch went vegan cause of Netflix
Tell me why she's still a diabetic
Niggas still rap don't know where rap came from
So how the fuck you gon' tell me where slaves came from
You don't know where your name came from
Like the World Trade ain't know where them planes came from
Before they give you niggas titles
Before they give you niggas bibles
Before they give you niggas rifles
And they say it's all cycles
12 months, 12 notes, 12 tribes, 12 disciples

[Chorus: Brother Panic]
Grand Herbalizer, what time is it?
The Gods have come, the dark side speaks
Grand Herbalizer, what time is it?
Bobby in it for the strong, hotep for the weak
Grand Herbalizer, what time is it?
We come from the East to teach in the West
Grand Herbalizer, what time is it?
The masters teach, my science is deep

[Bridge: Brother Panic]
Opening gateways with our mind (Come on y'all)
This is an invitation (Come on, come on)
Dark side niggas only
Bob, what you think the government gon' do?

[Verse 2]
Nigga they watchin' your ass to see what you gon' do
To see what you gon' say, to see how you gon' move
And hide the truth in books 'cause reading you won't do
Something greater than goin' vegan and shea butter
Something greater than eucalyptus and face scrubbers
Something greater than chem trails and GWEN towers
Something greater than Ph.D's and brain power (Come on y'all)
Trees that you can't uproot
Problems a computer can't do
People that the cops can't shoot
That a bomb can't nuke
That the news can't spook
Huh, but still that bag, I want it
Is money their god? or the faces that they plastered on it
Ha look, I never blame the other team
They live by a book that my oppressor gave me
They hit you with a Clinton then they hit you with a Bush
Then Obama then a Trump, keep you runnin' 'round a bush
Run around a bush, run around a bush

[Chorus: Brother Panic]
Grand Herbalizer, what time is it?
Run around the bush, ru-run around the bush
Grand Herbalizer, what time is it?
Time to roll up kush, t-time to roll up kush
Grand Herbalizer, what time is it?
The Gods have come, the dark side speaks
Grand Herbalizer, what time is it?
Bo-Bobby in it for the strong, hotep for the weak

[Outro]
Riding the crossroads, this is the 

[? 3:10] sissy
Vegetables are not the key to enlightenment

[Intro]
Because I know
Somewhere, deep down in my heart
I still love you

[Chorus]
Even though you counted me out
I still got love and I'm shoutin' you out
No hard feelings though
I still love you
Let's get the liquor though
'Cause we about to take shots
For you cyber niggas and all you cyber thots
We gon' take shots
No hard feelings though
I still love you
Let's get the liquor though
'Cause we about to take shots

[Verse 1]
I ain't talkin' name tags when I rip your whole label
360 deals, sting you, turn a nigga to a dreidel
This shit I picture, niggas can't channel like scrambled cable
On demand like the man in advance in advance
So high, I never land
Feelin' like Peter Pan
Ha, I clap at you, give you a hand
I hear hip hop's on life support
Real rappers on vacay, I'm the last resort
I'm talking, my epitaph will be a paragraph
The money come first, that's why none of you niggas last
Tommy gun with the hunnid round drum
Blow the horn play these imbeciles
Nigga I put the fun in funeral
Sleepin' on me is bad for your back
Herniate the disc when they master the track
Niggas, niggas said they had bars, I snicker
Chitlin Circuit how I'm shittin' on niggas, let's take shots

[Chorus]
Even though you counted me out
I still got love and I'm shoutin' you out
No hard feelings though
I still love you
Let's get the liquor though
'Cause we about to take shots
For you cyber niggas and all you cyber thots
We gon' take shots
No hard feelings though
I still love you
Let's get the liquor though
'Cause we about to take shots

[Verse 2]
Yeah, for all you bitches throwin' subliminals
The impact is minimal
Please stay off of my genitals, I'm a general
They don't fuck with you bitches in general
In case you forgot, I administer shots like a sinister doc
Not pop, but a kernel that pop corns when needed (Uh)
You my bastard child, the pop secret (Huh)
What you poutin' about?
If I pay your momma's rent, watch your mouth in my house
These niggas overrated like procreation (Uh)
Clappin' all night, standin' ovation
Yeah, when I emerge it's an emergency
Niggas think they Fresh Prince, don't make me pop a wheelie
Yeah, green with envy, that's Martian
Yeah, it's April, these fools marchin'
Yeah, biggest song had my name in it
I don't know if it was you or if my name did it
Let's take shots

[Chorus]
Even though you counted me out
I still got love and I'm shoutin' you out
No hard feelings though
I still love you
Let's get the liquor though
'Cause we about to take shots
For you cyber niggas and all you cyber thots
We gon' take shots
No hard feelings though
I still love you
Let's get the liquor though
'Cause we about to take shots

Niggas be hurt for life, hoes be hurt from life, niggas be hurt

Hurt people hurt people, can't you see, she's your queen to be?
Modern programs from the projects, it's a project to stop your progress (Let it, let it, let it, let it, let it)

Yeah, I'm feeling myself, uh (Burr, burr)

[Verse]
Ain't no way I'm squashing my beefs like Drake and Meek (Nah)

Survival of the fittest, the weakest, they gettin' eaten
Department of corrections, civilians, they gettin' treated
Sorry to the mamas and papas I made weep (Mama)
God, thank you for the mama and papa that made me (Pop)
I don't like makin' no promise, I can't keep it (Nope)
I don't fuck with none of these niggas, that's no secret (Nah)
I don't fuck with holmes, and holmes don't like me (Who, me?)
You could never cancel the gang, we too deep (It's Gucci)
I killed the parking lot, I been wanted for ten weeks (Alright)
I pray 'fore I sleep, then sleep with my heat
Predators nothing but prey, you ask me (Huh?)
Niggas get shot every day on GP (Gresham)
So fly, I touch down, I still ain't touch ground (Ground)
Since I'm the emperor, rock emerald cuts now (Emerald cuts)
Count so much money, got paper cuts now
All kind of plain janes, all bustdowns (Bling)
Same nigga wouldn't even trust your born round
Home invader hunt like we huntin' Saddam down
Room raider, traitors can't put they guns down (Boom)
Don't let this shit go over your head, I dumb it down
Finesse town, he paid for a bale, he got a pound (Fuck)
Like 8Ball said, y'all pussies all lay it down (Pussy)

[Outro]
Haha, yeah

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Niggas say no cap, but they be pretending (Huh?)
FaceTiming my jeweler, ask him what I'm spending (Damn)
Take a couple seats 'cause this a couple tickets (Facts)
I never lie to kick it, murderer but not convicted
They say I'm filthy rich, I told the judge, 'Yeah, I'm guilty'
Fuck my baby mama, I can't let no bitch extort me (No)
All this ice I'm rocking, pray to God they don't deport me (ICE)
Five with the fuck you, Zone 6 nigga worth a fortune

[Verse 1: Gunna & Gucci Mane]
Copped the Z06 and then I set it on some Forgis
Lam' truck came from Italy, my manager got it imported (On God)
We done set the city on fire the whole world call us arsons (Damn)
Paint the Rolls Royce truck all blue, me and Baby ridin' down Slauson
Last year I signed for six M's, bitch, can't tell me nothin' (Nope)
My new bitch look like K, Kim, ass fat with no stomach (Yeah)

Baby mama textin' paragraphs, I ignore it
And I ran a M up off a freestyle with no chorus
The drip shit, I pour it, that Hellcat, I floor it (Skrrt)
They was hatin' on me, hit the dealership and crushed 'em
Bankroll too big, got me held up in customs
Money is the answer every time she ask questions
I got superpowers 'cross the globe, I can touch 'em
That's your girlfriend? I am sorry, we've been fucking
Cullinan truck, come through like a bucket
I keep that FN, I go for nothing
If he out of line, get him dropped, end discussion (Go)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Niggas say no cap, but they be pretending (Huh?)
FaceTiming my jeweler, ask him what I'm spending (Damn)

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up

Gucci, yeah
Tay Keith, wow
Wop, go

[Chorus]
Shawty got a face like a model
And a frame like a Coke bottle
Big fat booty and it wobble
I'm tryna get to the bottom
Gwala got me walkin' with a waddle
Heard that pussy drippin' like water
I'ma be a genie in a bottle
And I'm tryna get to the bottom
El Gato got 'em drinkin' out the bottle
Twenty, fifty girls, it's a brothel
Pussy so good, it's a problem
I'ma try to get to the bottom
Drop my top in autumn
Fuck my opps, I shot 'em
Trick my plug, I got him
In the pot, fork scraping at the bottom

[Verse 1]
I ball out without a budget
Ring size, that's McDonald's nuggets
These bad bitches gotta love me
I'm gon' hit the bottom of it
Like Santa, I'm stocking stuffing
Dick rock hard, it's up to something
Work on me like Doc McStuffins
I'm geeked up like David Ruffin
Nobody can tell me nothing
'Til I hit her belly button
Her ex was a minute man
Two minutes, already done
Gucci Mane, I'm super rich
Bitch gotta be super thick
She pulled up, took off the trench
Nothin' on but some Louboutins
Beatin' it up, I'm talkin' shit
Bottom bitch, that's Gato bitch
All this dick, it got to fit
She gargled it and swallowed it
Slapped that ass, I left a print
She's lovin' it, it's obvious
Cocaine sex, I brought a brick
To numb out her esophagus

[Chorus]
Shawty got a face like a model
And a frame like a Coke bottle
Big fat booty and it wobble
I'm tryna get to the bottom
Gwala got me walkin' with a waddle
Heard that pussy drippin' like water
I'ma be a genie in a bottle
And I'm tryna get to the bottom
El Gato got 'em drinkin' out the bottle
Twenty, fifty girls, it's a brothel
Pussy so good, it's a problem
I'ma try to get to the bottom
Drop my top in autumn
Fuck my opps, I shot 'em
Trick my plug, I got him
In the pot, fork scraping at the bottom

[Verse 2]
Down South ho so cunning
Rain, sleet, snow, getting money
Lames keep calling her honey
She gon' play 'em all like dummies
When I put it in, she running
Probably put dick in her mommy
I'ma put the D in her tummy
Don't stop, ho, keep cumming
Late night kissing and touching
Waterfall, she so gushy
Beat it from the side, she bustin'
I done fell in love with that pussy
Big booty and a smile, don't trust it
Millionaire drip, she crushin'
If a bitch suck me, she lucky
She a bad lil' bitch, she bucking

[Chorus]
Shawty got a face like a model
And a frame like a Coke bottle
Big fat booty and it wobble
I'm tryna get to the bottom
Gwala got me walkin' with a waddle
Heard that pussy drippin' like water
I'ma be a genie in a bottle
And I'm tryna get to the bottom
El Gato got 'em drinkin' out the bottle
Twenty, fifty girls, it's a brothel
Pussy so good, it's a problem
I'ma try to get to the bottom
Drop my top in autumn
Fuck my opps, I shot 'em
Trick my plug, I got him
In the pot, fork scraping at the bottom

Is it a crime to be full of yourself? 'Cause I'm gettin' cocky as hell
Ain't got time to be goin' to jail but I been feelin' myself
For three months they say Gucci canceled, I'll be rockin' Chanel
Know you heard 'bout my rep, I got murders on my belt
Black and green Moncler ring, call that bitch the Boston Celts
Sent a fiend to rehab but that shit didn't even help
Tell the haters when they see me, "Look, but do not make no step"
Slidin' through Charlotte in my Spider, man, I think I left a web
Dope jumping like Spud Webb, tell a hater go to hell
I'ma send a ting through the mail and drive the money in myself
Early teens, East Atlanta, we was broke, we jumped the rail
On my dick, had to ante up, pitch in to pay for bail (It's Gucci)

Water like a whale, cold as a polar bear

Shawty got a bod' but she's a known woodpecker, 'pecker
Crowd full of folks, Coachella, 'chella

Wise guy like Goodfella (Fella)
She wanna suck me up, I let her, let her
Beat her from the back, it's better, better
Told her hit back, she better, better
Gucci Mane got forever cheddar
Save a bitch, I never ever
Grippin' on her head, I pet her
Took her out to eat, I fed her
Knew she was a freak when I met her, met her
Fly ass and I jet her, jet her
She drink it all up like kettle
Dick rock hard, it's metal, metal
Head so good, got a medal, medal
Bad bitch, I'ma go get her, get her
Broke hoes hate, they bitter, bitter
I'ma leave money for the sitter, sitter
I'ma keep rollin', they quitters, quitters
They gon' keep trolling on Twitter, Twitters

Lemonade convertible, I flushed it to the motorboat
You don’t want this type of smoke, this shit here worse than smoking dope
Drew a line and pick us out, I did that a long time ago
Can't come outside or press rewind, some words are unretractable
Heard you 'bout that action, captain, what the fuck you cappin’ for?
I see through the fake bravado, boy, you mad your money low
Glacier Gang got stupid dough, your CEO is super poor
Y'all niggas some actors, but my chopper can flip tractors, so

[Chorus]
It's us over them, we kill 'em with the M's
It's us over them, like we don't even see 'em
It’s us over them, yeah, we just made a film
It’s us over them, we ballin', broke the rim
It’s us over them, and that's just what it is
It's us over them, like we don't even see ’em
It's us over them, we kill 'em with them M's
It's us over them, and that's just what it is

Coupe low to the earth, touching the turf
Thug to my core but they calling me sir

Emerald cut watch, yeah, it came with a blur
Some locals in here and some jokers in here
My chef always near, it's no smoking, my dear
I'm missin' my deal, missin' a lil'
Done with you niggas, I'm keepin' it real
Stealing ideas, ride on my Lears
I'ma kick back and lay back at the crib
Ten of the mid, makin' it big
MTV cribs, yeah, we makin' 'em dig
Sleep with the SIG 'cause he play with the kid
Quick on the draw like I'm Billy the Kid
Ice on my neck, got me cold as the fridge
Gucci the GOAT, I stay 'way from the pigs

[Chorus]
It's us over them, we kill 'em with the M's
It's us over them, like we don't even see 'em
It's us over them, yeah, we just made a film
It's us over them, we ballin', broke the rim
It's us over them, and that's just what it is
It's us over them, like we don't even see 'em
It's us over them, we kill 'em with them M's
It's us over them, and that's just what it is

[Intro]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Take off

[Verse 1]
Said I was bad, now I'm rich, they say I'm nice now
The royal treatment what I get when I bring my wife around
Invited to exclusive events, yeah, that's my life, clown
First they was scared of me, but now they all feel safe now
Said I was ugly, but she can't stay out my face now
Ooh, how they lovin' me, man, this industry so fake, wow
They call me Mr. Clean because I put that lean down
I'm writin' checks, I'm payin' tax, my money clean, clown
Upgrade the sixty carat ring for the queen now
I had to cop the four-door Phantom for the king now
You know the team 1017 shine when the lights out
They tryna surf on Guwop wave but they wiped out
They had to cool the crowd off, brought the ice out
They thinkin' I'ma pipe it down, but they psyched out (No)
They say I'm bad 'cause I'm rich, yeah, I'm nice now
I'm a legend in this shit, I've been nice, clown (It's Gucci)

[Chorus]
I was down for a second but I'm up now
I had to turn my life around, yeah, I fell down
Went through hell to get here, but I'm up now
In cold cells, I shed tears, but I'm up now
I was down for a second but I'm up now
I had to turn my life around, yeah, I fell down
I went through hell to get here, but I'm up now
In cold cells, I shed tears, but I'm up now

[Interlude]
Now
It's imperative that I change the narrative
Haha

[Verse 2]
Look at me then, look at me now (Look at me now)
Say you my friend, but tell me how? (You not my friend)
Kicked, I was down (When I was)
You been talked down
Can't come around (Can't come around)
You're not my round (You're not my round)
See through the grin
Know it's a frown (Know it's a frown)
Back on the town
Give me my crown (Give me my crown)
Look at me now (Look at me now)
Golds out my mouth (Golds out my mouth)
At Mr. Chow (At Mr. Chow)
Me and my spouse (Me and my, mwah)
Look at my coupe, look at my house (Skrrt)
My mom and pops (Mom), they in the clouds (Pop)
They lookin' down (They lookin')
I know they proud (I know that)
My engine loud (My engine, yoom)
My paint so wild (My paint so, it's Gucci)

[Chorus]
I was down for a second but I'm up now
I had to turn my life around, yeah, I fell down
Went through hell to get here, but I'm up now
In cold cells, I shed tears, but I'm up now
I was down for a second but I'm up now
I had to turn my life around, yeah, I fell down
I went through hell to get here, but I'm up now
In cold cells, I shed tears, but I'm up now

This beat from Murda (Murda)

[Chorus]
Started off a local dude, like, nah, I never heard of you (It's Gucci)
They wouldn't give me a shot, but now my money got a vertical (It's jumpin')
Started on the MARTA bus, but now I drive convertibles (Vert)
It's Gucci Mane and Murda Beatz, and niggas wanna murder you (Well damn)
The dope so clean, I cut it, they didn't know this shit was surgical (Woo)
Can't let the haters in no more, that's what I closed the curtain for
Started as a burglar, but turned into a murderer (Woo)
The story of me growin' up, the making of a murderer (It's Gucci)

[Verse 1]
Come ride with the BC, me, pre to Gucci
Yup, in my black tee (Yup), hand on my Uzi (Yup)
Trigger finger squeeze in the sun (Yup), like a Capri (Yup)
Try me, young boy (Yup), strapped to an IV (Bah)
'80 baby, crack spread just like poison ivy (Skrrt)
Without it, where would I be? Sun Valley with the ivory (Damn)
Ask how I survived it, real crazy and conniving (Crazy)
Guwop really grimy, I send a slug, he slimy
Wasn't born with diamonds, me and money wasn't Siamese
Killed that boy with kindness, delivery killers, Chinese
Let's have a moment for silence for anyone else try me

[Chorus]
Started off a local dude, like, nah, I never heard of you (It's Gucci)
They wouldn't give me a shot, but now my money got a vertical (It's jumpin')

Lump him like a pumpkin, everybody stompin' (Stomp)
One man jump in, now everybody jumpin' (Jump)
My hood is full of junkies, at night the walkin' zombies (Huh)
The neighbors sayin' nothin', it's vigilante justice (Shh)
They still can't find no suspect, detective screamin', "Fuck it" (Woo)
I re-up with your budget, I grab a brick and bust it (Woo)

[Chorus]
Started off a local dude, like, nah, I never heard of you (It's Gucci)

[Intro: DJ Drama & Gucci Mane]
Ayy, let me get somethin' straight here
Honorable C.N.O.T.E.

Wait, hold up, hold up, hold up

Armani, Armani, Armani, Armani, I'm rockin' Armani
My closet exclusive, I pick out a 'fit just like shoppin' at Barneys
Started from nothing, got fronted, and only got thirty off a hundred
I said that I did it, admit that you run up on Wop, you get punished

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]

Started from nothing, got fronted, and only got thirty off a hundred
I said that I did it, admit that you run up on Wop, you get punished

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane & Peewee Longway]
Life on the line, nickel and dime
Thought I was jokin', I caught me a nine
Old niggas hate and they sit on the pine
I stayed in the A and I got me a line
Stick make you hiccup, I shot with your re-up
Want some ketchup, if you run up get wet up
I get you hit up and go kick my feet up
VVS bricks, we might drop on a Brinks truck
Money on my mind
Still in the pot, whip a nine
Wheelchair, nigga, break his spine
Glacier Gang, still in my prime
I'ma put the dick all in her spine, woah

Flatline a nigga 'cause he lyin'
Wop hit my line, then I'm ridin'
Longway, bitch

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

[Intro]
We marvel about some athlete earning ten or fifteen million a year
Well, if that's the case, that athlete must be worth to his owners billions of dollars

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Getting to the paper like it's human nature
Goddamn, the more they hate us, that just motivate us
I know revenge tastes the sweetest, mmm, I'm gon' savor
I'm just sending all my graces up to my creator
No negotiation, this is world domination
You can fill the trophy cases up with nominations
I'm the Alpha-Omega, that mean you can't replace us
That mean I'm throwing dice in Vegas, betting all the wages
My girl expensive, remember you get what you pay for
Big, big pay-off moves on and off the radar
You can't afford to miss a layup when you in the playoffs (Uh)
Press on, stress on
I give this shit blood, flesh, bone
Can't catch me, I skate to my destiny
That's necessity, you can't out-finesse me
She like chocolate, Nestlé, brown and sexy
Touch me, tease me, please me, just don't test me
I'm the bar, my weight up, you can't press me
Legendary bloodline, my ancestry
Ooh, I'm devoted and hated, I re-coded the Matrix
I just loaded the bases and you know I'ma make it hit

[Chorus: Big Sean & Meek Mill]
Getting to the paper like it's human nature
(Getting to the paper like it's human nature)
Getting to the paper like it's human nature, uh (Uh)
Getting to the paper like it's human nature
No time to relax, we ain't in Jamaica
Getting to the paper like it's human nature (Uh)

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lil Tunechi

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I've been having conversations with the constellations
We keep this shit between us, just like a doctor-patient
The heaviest intoxication make the problems weightless
I'ma need some sanitation for the time that's wasted
Told my shrink that life is crazy, he said, "Life is crazy"
I bought a house so fucking big it feel like I'm my neighbors
I told my weed man, "I need nature," he accommodate me
I got two choppers look alike, I call 'em crock and gator
The flowers looking quite amazing, I ain't like the fragrance
I stand beside a baby, see who you decide to play with
I'ma take my fucking chances, I'm a lucky bastard
My heart race 'til it catch up to who it's running after
Oh my gosh, I'm gone, I'm on a planet I'm not knowin'
Said, "Let there be light," but then all my lights were blown
Yeah, I know my rights, I mean I know right from wrong
I know yayo white and sweeter than a yellow bone
I know love is life and I know life is never long
I made plans to get away and in the morning, I'll be gone
Man, I mind-fuck, no foreplay, brainwash, my thoughts fade
Brainstorm, I storm chase, guilty conscience no court date
Lil Tunechi (Tunechi)

[Chorus: Big Sean, Lil Wayne & Meek Mill]
Detroit (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Getting to the paper like it's human nature (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Getting to the paper like it's human nature (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get this shit no matter how long it takes us
I've been having conversations with the constellations (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Getting to the paper like it's human nature (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Black music sells about sixty percent of the music sold in the world

And yet, we're willing to sing for pennies a record

[Verse 3]
The reality is I know exactly what my salary is
And I can't afford to play myself
Rather play myself, trick off, and pay myself
Before I break myself to make her take off belt
Nah, we can go shoppin', yeah
And we can roll around in the drop, boo, yeah
But you can't hold it down from the top, boo (Yeah)
So please understand that my buck stops here
I don't need you, why should I succumb
To the power of the P U, frontin' to intrigue you
Something for your peoples, I seen it coming like previews
So I started dumbing to deceive you (Uh)
And make you fall for the okie-doke (Uh-huh)
Boo, I must admit this was mostly hoax
I mean, I stopped pushing Ranges when I was 17
Now it's about Porsches, forest green (Uh)

[Chorus]
I just came to run game (Oh)
Flash my watch and show off my chain (Oh)
Yeah, let her know it's my Range (Oh)
I'm just playin', I'm just sayin'
Look, so this what we do (Yeah)
You, me, and her go back to my room (Yeah)
To chop game, pop a bottle or two (Yeah)
I'm just playin', I'm just sayin'
(That ain't me)

[Verse 1]
You're stone cold
Your heart is broke
Somebody tell me
This is a joke
You left me hanging
On a rope
So now I gotta
Let you go

[Chorus]
I tried to play nice but you don’t
You don’t
Get out of my head but you won’t
You won’t
Cause you, you’re like a bullet taken to my brain
No, Mr. Nice Guy, no more, no more

[Verse 2]
You must really
Have a sweet tooth
Cause when I have your cake
You need it too, yeah
You swallowed to me
I’m not about it, oh
They wanna catch me
But I rather fall, fall

[Chrorus]
I tried to play nice but you don’t

[Outro]
No more, no more
Is it that you
You need a man
And I happen to be standing here
How convenient
For you

Tonight
This drink will be
Our sweet lullaby
While you're shinning bright
With someone else

But don't say (don't say)
You got it figured out
Don't Say (don't say)
That you want me around
'Cause you don't
So I'll take this chance to say
C'est la vie, to everything

[Verse 1]
First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game, you fired a shot in my heart

[Chorus]
Took me to Heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on
(Carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on)

[Verse 2]
I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best, and it's not you
You've broken my heart, but you can't break me down
Not falling apart, once was lost, now I'm found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

[Pre-Chorus]
Took me to Heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody help
Changed your mind when I changed my life, better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God so we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard
Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
Used to slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
Dead lens zoomin' in, catchin' all my strikes
Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm actin' foolish
Chris would pick me up around noon-ish
Half a blunt, yeah, we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Hunnid, Texas heat, and yeah, we cruisin'

[Pre-Chorus: bearface]
But when I love you right, I love you right
All by yourself
But I'll make it bright, baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you, I'ma make you see that
I want you, I want you

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport

[Outro: bearface]
So, do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh

Venusian 1

[Verse 1]
Forest desertified
Ocean wave amplify
Constant tornado sky
Black water, no supply
Otherworld, surrogate
Interstellar our escape
Sulfur star liberates
Gotta beat the outbreak

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we're going to the second planet from the sun
Oh, our ship can deliver us from our ruin

[Chorus 1]
Death admirer
Ground of fire
I heard there's a holy yellow sky
Just make sure you close your eyes
Venusian 1

[Verse 2]
Made of junk from the Earth
Human waste, how absurd
Journey is childbirth
Plant a flag, start a church
Sharp as ice in the night
Cutting space, satellite
To a sphere set alight
We escaped parasites

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we're going to the second planet from the sun
Oh, our ship can deliver us from our ruin

[Chorus 2]
Floating helium
Blimp of freedom
Outside air will bring you death
Just make sure you hold your breath
Venusian 1, oh

[Bridge]
Ve-nu-si-an 1
Ve-nu-si-an 1

[Chorus 3]
(Ve-nu-si-an 1)
I heard there's a holy yellow sky
Just make sure you close your eyes
(Ve-nu-si-an 1)
Outside air will bring your death
Just make sure you hold your breath

[Outro]
There is one planet V

[Verse 1]
Space is the place for the human race
Chasing the race for the new place
Days on our old place waste
Starship's team full of everybody keen
Pilot in the twilight is a deep dream
Men and machine convene

[Refrain]
Peri-perihelion
Peri-perihelion
Peri-perihelion
Peri-perihelion

[Chorus]
Giver of life and the giver of speed
Ever we take even her gravity
Her glowing beauty is something to see
Bigger and brighter, she cometh to me

[Verse 2]
Solar mountain comes on the perihelion
No rerouting, only countin' till we're done
Shoutin' sins until we're in the sun
(Peri-perihelion)
Melting humans and everything they bring
In a blink, the sun will drink their things
Grinning sun has sinners for dinner

[Refrain]
Peri-perihelion
Peri-perihelion
Peri-perihelion
Peri-perihelion

[Chorus]
Giver of life and the giver of speed
Ever we take even her gravity
Her glowing beauty is something to see
Bigger and brighter, she cometh to me

Peri-perihelion (Peri-perihelion)
Peri-perihelion (Peri-perihelion)
Peri-perihelion (Peri-perihelion)
Peri-perihelion (Peri-perihelion)

[Verse 1]
In the lap of the gods
The last one did explode
In a blaze all fiery
I sit in the cockpit
It may be a sinking ship
But fortune favours bravery

[Chorus 1]
Road trip with me
Vitamin V
In focus now

[Refrain]
Venu (Venu)
-sian two (-sian two)

[Verse 2]
Fingers getting warm
And eyes are turning gold
Evil twin is coming in
Weathering the storm
I put the birdie down
For the sin, I have a grin

Road trip with me
Vitamin V
I see the ground (Oh)

[Refrain]
Venu (Venu-)

[Verse 1]
God, it's pretty hot down here
Under surface
Antichrist has tempted me
With a purpose

[Chorus]
Remember where to enter
Remember where to enter
The door to hell is amber
Hell, hell, hell, hell

[Verse 2]
Here I was thinking I'd die
I see a thousand flies and wings and tails and spines
Nausea-less, resoluteness near the entrance
Satan points me to the rats' nest

[Chorus]
Remember where to enter
Remember where to enter
The door to hell is amber
Hell, hell, hell, hell

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Remember where to enter
The door to hell is amber

[Outro]
Fifteen infantry paratroop into the propylene new scene
Hell's where they wanna be
Infest the rats' nest

[Intro]
Red Mars for the rich

[Verse 1]
I'm just a poor boy
Living frugally
I see Mars on TV
I see people happy
I work fields with
Blistered fingers
I look starward
That world has no place for me

[Chorus]
Red Mars
The tsars
Live large
Red Mars for the rich, rich

[Verse 2]
Mars for the privileged
Earth for the poor
Mars terraforming slowly
Earth has been deformed
Just forget it, ya ain't coming here
The ticket's too dear
I stare sadly into my beer
That world has no place for me

[Chorus]
Red Mars
The tsars
Live large
Red Mars for the rich, rich, rich

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Red Mars
The tsars
Live large
Red Mars for the rich, rich, rich, rich

[Verse 1]
Superbug coming up
Feels like he'll never stop
Shoulda used phages
Instead you took ages
Superbug gave a shrug
And ate all your prescription drugs
And never, ever, ever stopped
Deadly contagious
And inter-generational
Never ever ever stops
And never ever gives a fuck

[Pre-Chorus]
Pony up
Join the club
Shake my hand
Let's run amok

[Chorus]
Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff
Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff

[Verse 2]
Superbug coming up
H1N1 was a flop
Anti-microbial
Resistance is futile
Superbug is like a truck
Penicillin is a duck
That's sitting on the road for luck
Faceless and ageless
It's simply outrageous
Never ever, ever stops
And never ever gives a fuck

[Pre-Chorus]
Unnecessary
Anti-Bs
Likely killed humanity

[Chorus]
Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff
Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff
Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff

[Verse 1]
No, this isn't what I wanted
I never thought it'd come this far
Thinking back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are
We were young and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
I'm standing here, but you don't see me
Give it all for that to change
And I don't want to lose her
Don't wanna let her go

[Chorus]
Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
Yeah-ah-ah
Before the storm

[Verse 2]
With every strike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
And not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up

[Chorus]
Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm

[Bridge]
I'm tryna keep the lights from going out
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
They always say a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm

[Chorus]
Standing out in the rain
Knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold you
Like I did before the storm
Yeah, like I did before the storm

[Verse 1]
I need some recovery
Don't wanna make this messy
Push and pull again as you untie the ends
Baby, I need some recovery

[Verse 2]
Harder and harder to sleep
You're weighing heavy on me
Try and I try, can't push it aside
It's harder and harder to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you, do you know the things you do to me?
Do you, do you know the way that you sit on my couch
Staring silently, burning a hole in the wall

[Chorus]
Really got me
Where you want me
With my head just
Above the deep
Hear the sirens
Silent crying
Hard to be here
When you don't see me

[Verse 3]
Stuck in that weird in-between
Running through old memories
Felt it for ages, on different pages
Stuck in that weird in-between

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you, do you know the things you do to me?
Do you, do you know the way that you sit on my couch
Staring silently, burning a hole in the wall
While I'm trying to fix this, do you even care?

[Chorus]
Really got me
Where you want me
With my head just
Above the deep
Hear the sirens
Silent crying
Hard to be here
When you don't see me

[Outro]
I need some recovery
Don't wanna make this messy
Push and pull again as you untie the ends
Baby, I need some recovery

[Verse 1]
Different places, different faces
But our love still feels the same when you're holding me
You can follow your dreams, explore the world, sail the seas
And I'll meet you on the other side in harmony
I'll let you lead, and I'll follow
Ain't no valley way too deep that's gonna keep you away from me

[Chorus]
You might be far away
Don't care, no time or place
I'll meet you where you're at on the map
I'd travel near or far
No boat, no plane, no car
Keep me from where you are, running back

Ooo 在沿路

[Verse 2]
In another world, in another world, love lost
Tryna find your heart, was a little red dot
Racing through your thoughts like mileage
Million pictures of you was running through my eyelids
Raise your flag for me if you a nation away
I'll be right there, no place out the way
Over hills or mountains, through the valleys
Always on the map where you found me

[Pre-Chorus]
Our little place, a little way through the maze
No one around
See, it's just you and me
Illuminate our own little county
Well you'll never see a bluer day
Only thing you need to say
Take me here, take me there (Take me away)

[Chorus]
You might be far away
Don't care, no time or place
I'll meet you where you're at on the map
I'd travel near or far
No boat, no plane, no car
Keep me from where you are, running back

Ooo 在沿路

[Bridge]
Home is wherever you want it to be
Girl, if it's right here with me, then you're home
走进远方盛开晴朗茂密
走进这杂草相拥的神奇

[Verse 3]
踏上征途的路 去向丛林深处
找到了会开花 那棵树 Ohhh

[Chorus]
You might be far away
Don't care, no time or place
I'll meet you where you're at on the map
不要在意束缚 阳光驱散迷雾
然后我们相遇 在沿路

Ooo 在沿路
Ooo on the map

[Outro]
You might be far away
Don't care, no time or place
I'll meet you where you're at, right on the map

I really did try to put the time for you
I really did try to be the one for you
I really try to go deep with you
Instead I found myself sinking deep for you
Every night I swear to god I think about you
Like you my queen as if I had dream for you
I like it when you smile
Mhan it goes with your style
Touch me deep heart
I might Dance with the stars
And I could take you to mars
Don’t hide any scars
Am I could show you my cries
And I would kill all the lies
Let’s us dance with stars
While I look in your eyes
Like I just payed the prize
Never feeling surprised
Cause I know that your mine
You got the shine girl
You looking fine girl
You got the shine girl
You looking fine girl

[Chorus: Prince]

You had my heart played with it

Heartaches every time

Nightmares everytime

Purejoy everytime
I think about you
But it's cool cause I'm always thinking bout you

[Verse 4: 2FARR]

Something about you that i like
But no body sees
You’re the key
To my heart that I gotta keep
You’re the view of the sea that I wanna see
Cause your the type of women that drown in
Would you run for me
Would you cry for me
Would you smile with me
Or would you laugh at me
Or would you hate on me
Look down on
Or would you build me
And would you pick me up

[Verse 5: Prince]

I tried to move on but the thoughts
Keep holding me back
Like my side bag thought you would
Always be by my side
But instead
You like my backpack all behind
But you still with me
But you still with me

[Chorus: Prince]

You had my heart played with it
Had fun it this weren't no game innit
Me & Elysee had your gyals tryna link up
Chances are we prolly done linked up

You had my heart played with it
Yessir
Had my heart played with it
You had my heart with it×2

[Intro: Marcus Garvey]
May I say something to you to give you a true knowledge of yourself and life?
Man in the full knowledge of himself is a superb and supreme creature of creation
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself, he becomes the master of his environment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess what, baby? I feel free (Scoop)
Nothin' hurts me anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free

[Verse: Kanye West]
Created in nah-nah-nah
Guess what, baby? I feel free
And you know damn well
Ah! I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free
You should quit your job to this
Hold up, let 'em drop the mist
Got on the concert
One stunt in yours, don't stunt on us
They stunted on, ah
I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free
This like a mix of some Ja Rule shit and some King Krule shit
Don't assume shit, the news shit
This a fool shit, I'm on some bullshit
I'm on some wildin' out in some new shit
I'm on somethin', 'bout to lose it
Take your con and does it, don't double fools it
Lyor come up arguin' saying, "Don't lose the music"
I got none' but cool shit, I been known to lose it
You stuck with a bunch of motherfuckers you don't know
Like a cruise ship
Hottest on new shit, bangin' on that new shit
Popstar, move it
Man, he goin' foolish
Man, he goin' stupid
Man, he got the movement
Now they couldn't move it
Talkin' in jewels, yeah

Can't not bump 'em anymore

Don't ya, don't, don't ya
Don't ya, don't, make it

[Verse 1]
Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say?
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy
K-kind of busy, k-kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

[Verse 2]
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy

[Pre-Chorus]
Kind of busy, kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

[Chorus]
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore
I've got my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't wanna talk anymore
I've got my head and my heart on the dance floor

[Post-Chorus]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

[Refrain]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Verse 3]
Not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight, I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing
'Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('Cause I'll be dancing)
'Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('Cause I'll be dancing)
'Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('Cause I'll be dancing)
Tonight I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing

[Chorus]
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't want to think anymore
I've got my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't want to talk anymore
I've got my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't want to think anymore
I've got my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't want to talk anymore
I've got my head and my heart on the dance floor

[Post-Chorus]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I'm busy
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

[Refrain]
Can call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Can call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Outro]
My telephone
M-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not going to reach my telephone
My telephone

And you're not gonna reach my telephone

"My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy's up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork, I want...
You to know that Lucy got you—all your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible"

[Chorus: Jimi Somewhere & boy pablo]
No, I never cared 'bout all that
You were never there when I called back
I left all the walls black, I left my door unlocked
If you wanna fall back
What if everyone used to think that
We would never cross roads and look back
On all our favorite times that we used to drive back home
Never had the chance to do that

[Verse 1: boy pablo & Jimi Somewhere]
I wish that I had more to say
I'll keep it for another day
A new light that lead you away
Another time, we'll be okay

[Verse 2: Jimi Somewhere]
Yeah, I left too quickly, I mean, my mind was in a rush
Is there a life here for us that goes beyond just a crush
That goes beyond these borders, around these corners
All these rules they got me, I always hated orders

[Chorus: Jimi Somewhere & boy pablo]
No, I never cared 'bout all that
You were never there when I called back
I left all the walls black, I left my door unlocked
If you wanna fall back
What if everyone used to think that
We would never cross roads and look back
On all our favorite times that we used to drive back home
Never had the chance to do that

[Post-Chorus: Jimi Somewhere]
Never had the chance to do that
Never had the chance to do that
Never had the chance to do that

[Bridge: boy pablo]
But I swear we'll get another chance
You got more of me than I ever planned
There is more to life than the sand
But every time we got close you ran

[Chorus: Jimi Somewhere & boy pablo]
No, I never cared 'bout all that
You were never there when I called back
I left all the walls black, I left my door unlocked
If you wanna fall back
What if everyone used to think that
We would never cross roads and look back
On all our favorite times that we used to drive back home
Never had the chance to do that

[Intro]
It's Connor
Right off the top of the dome

[Verse]
I sprint ahead of the pack
Coming straight off the top of the dome
That's a real fact
Big Boy sitting there blue shirt, pink hat
I'm looking at the floor there's a big rat
Might wanna handle that
You fools are hella nasty
Not to mention the decor in here is not classy
I'm playing, you know it's all up
Plus the smell in here is like a stank butt
And there's porno covered every wall
Damn Big Boy, you a perv, my dude
What is this, a locker room? (haha)
Connor comes correct
Off the top of the dome piece
With all these kittens written
Making fake MCs
But I keep it real, Big Boy's my witness
Throw out anything
And I'll rhyme it with a quickness
(Cards)
Say anything, no
Society is real, man
(Cards)
You got the sick-, no no no
Society is ill with the sickness
Open your mind
And you'll find on my wishlist
Peace and love and quite frankly some air freshener
'Cause this studio is stank butt
Yeah, Big Boy smell like stank butt

[Outro]
Hahaha, just playing
*Spoken* That's Connor4real, man, fresh off the top of the dome

[Intro]
Give it up, nigga

[Verse]
Somebody tooted in the student commons
The bell rang and he went home and argued in the comments
I watched the Doppler move, I watched a child get introduced to violence
I beat you to the point, my noose was golden
True and living, lonesome, pugilistic moments
Riveting, come get to know me at my innermost
My family been this anguished, now I need atonement
I set the goal and half my wings was broken
I spread the other for my brodie OD
Tiptoeing, too much love, I sense to show in a rut
We getting over, send it up
Living in the moment you've been corrupt
Have some gin and rum
Since a jit, I figured what's the use of giving up
I can't give enough
Shit, I got gin in my sippy cup, feeling cuts
Reviledly I'm refilling the pump
No concealing the enemy up in arms, bearing snubs
They just went to see the cub
My memory really leaking blood
It's congealing, stuck pieces in psalms one
Peaking in the dust, weavin'
I remember woods
I remember Indle when he wasn't remembering much
I remember love healin' my ruptures
Feelin' way too rush, grew up quick
Trip around the sun, this my 25th
Give it up, gin and rum
We wasn't supposed to be alive, no funny shit
Now look at us

[Verse]
Look, uh, uh, uh
Same clothes on me for a week straight
Pray the Lord help me for my peep's sake
When my mama died, I became a soldier
Papa couldn’t save him, I was out there gettin' paper, hol' up
MAC-11, barcodes in my arsenal
Lil’ nigga Lost Cause, Arg Fargo
Shit I'm comin' for the game and you all know
And you know I keep - on the - slow, uh
Should - you -ers if it's real call
I'll pay the ticket for your bitch, get if it's wheel call
And when I ridin' on you niggas wit' my lil’ dogs
Stone cold, we just wanted that control hol’ up
I'm with my niggas rollin’ in this whip, it's stolen
Off a fifth of Hogan, if you chick is scoldin'
The whip get open and your bitch get open
Look, this shit is sinister, ain't it ironic
My pops was a minister, nigga
For that side, I will ride, I will finish a nigga
Catch them how I rolled ’em
Shootin' photos of the job, hold it
Young Fargo, I'm just tryna let it all go, look
Lil' sister cryin', she got multiple structures
Takin' needles every night just to hold a discussion
You don't know that pain nigga you don't know that rain
Beggin' niggas for they change, you don't know that shame
You never slept in no park, you had a home to stay
Walkin' through The Dot, nigga, you ain't show that chain
I was down and dirty, tryna get a pound for 30
Hit a nigga I'll buy him for a round of 30
Listen and my - got the - going
Shade 45, or K 45
And we ain't playin' on you niggas, boy, I'm so live
And you know nigga, shit, you know a nigga
Eyes on a nigga, do 'em like I owe a nigga
It's all gravy though, it's all gravy though
I come up in the spot, niggas like, I'm crazy though
I got that crazy flow
I got that might fuck around and just fuck around and just fuck you lady though
Oh, niggas know, I stay freestylin' bars like I'm P nilin'
Young nigga be wilin'
Don't give a fuck about a nigga who's hatin'
I'm in street's muh'fucker you could, uh
Hol' up, I just come through spittin'
Niggas come through and they ain't - with the written
I'm never with the written but I'm -
Hol' up

Girl, you know you summertime fine like the 28th of June

And a nigga fresh out that deal, yeah

She a fire bitch but I still
Talk to me nice, nigga, we gettin' real money

[Verse 1]
We can dance around like cool kids
Run the city streets, girl, it's on you
Lost my heart in last December
I'll never find somebody like you

Oh, I see fireworks like a Chinese parade
Electric in my heart, I'm so glad that you came
Now don't you disappear, I'll be tempted to chase

Clouds so swift, the rain falling in
Gonna see a movie called Gunga Din
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn
You ain't goin' nowhere

Ooh-wee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come
Ooh-wee, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair

Ooh-wee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come
Ooh-wee, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair

The sky that cries and a bird that flies
A fish that walks and a dog that talks

Ooh-wee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come
Ooh-wee, are we gonna fly
Down into the easy chair

I think it's almost 4 AM but baby I'm still feelin' just fine

Some people never understand the way we live but we're livin' life

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh huh, hey, uh huh, Monday to Sunday, it's never too late
So everyone say, "We don't wanna stop!"

[Chorus]
'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna keep it goin'
We're gonna rip it up, the neighbors might complain
'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna stay 'til mornin'
Then when the time is up, we'll do it all again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're all in love
We're all in love

[Verse 2]
I'm hangin' on my best friend's couch and my clothes are all on the floor

Let's pour another drink, the glasses go *clink*
Yeah, we're always up for one more

We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers...

[Verse 1]
It's never too late to turn things around
Recover, unravel the path to confound
The doubters and losers that line up despair
Will tell you it's over, you're going nowhere
It's never too late, I hope
It's never too late

[Verse 2]
It's never too late to get back on track
To get at least some, if not all of it back
I thought I was happy, and sometimes I was
The sadness is just as important because
Got to carry the weight and hope
It's never too late

[Chorus]
Never too late to fight the fight
Never too late to keep the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Time will start to move too fast, the time is now, my friends
I'm a long way from the start, but further from the end
Oh no, it's never too late

[Post-Chorus]

[Swahili]

[Verse 3]
It's never too late to get up off the ground
Don't have to be noticed, don't have to crowned
I get what I done and I don't try to hide
I lost many things, but never my pride
It's never too late, I know
It's never too late

[Chorus]
Never too late to fight the fight
Never too late to keep the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Time will start to move too fast, the time is now, my friends
I'm a long way from the start, but further from the end
Oh no, it's never too late

[Post-Chorus]

[Swahili]

[Bridge]
I used to say I don't have time, I'm sleepin' tonight
A day doin' nothin' is doin' it right
No hurry, no Harry, take as long as it takes
You might as well sleep for all the difference it makes
I didn't find love or the peace or the breaks
These aren't excuses, but a string of mistakes
I won't go back there, not goin' back there

[Chorus]
Never too late to fight the fight
Never too late to keep the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Never too late to fight the fight, babe
Never too late to keep the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Time will start to move too fast, the time is now, my friends
I'm a long way from the start, but further from the end
Oh no, it's never too late

[Outro]
It's never too late (

[Swahili])
Oh, it's never too late (

[Swahili])
It's never too late (

[Swahili])
It's never too late (

[Swahili])

[Swahili]
I'm often often, sittin' in my world in the coffin, coughin off the herb of the curb
Money, money, money is what they concur
Do they Agree? what they might see, could be
Not exactly what they thought
The car the rap star allgededly bought is probly the same car that the rap star rented
Front end in tennis, supreme in the snowfish
Tailin' the whip, parkin lot a double piece, parked then
My mom swore that I'd be the next come up
Them otha niggas far from it
Can't stand how these dick rock bandits even get granted the access
All up in the mix
Wanna be a Kanye
Wanna be a Skateboard P, but nigga
All the BBC cannot put you, in the same place or give you the same face
Find you first and you couldn't raise the stakes, higher
Not talkin shit just fire, please muthafucka
All this BAPE shit I rock is none otha
Who the best MC's in the Cleve?
Cas, Chip, da Cudder, triple da illness
And Ohio gotta feel this
Took a decade just to say I'm paid
Took a took a decade just to get girls to lay down, spread eagle, pop dat pussy ho'
Need the love below I'm the champ that needs a gold medal
Styles of flow homeboy, I got plenty
I payed for my noodle, the digital vortex. Textin' a freak
Digital phone sex
She wanna suck a dong 'cus my songs got me digital checks
Gigabytes decide the words that I write, I get gone nigga day and night
Unh. Take it literally
How more crystal clear can I be?
How more crystal clear can I be?
How more crystal clear can I be?
Stepping in, stepping right on through
Same old shit, same old solitude
But I won't be too alone if I bring my horses
And ride my freedom all the way back home

Tell that pretty boy I wanna see him dance, dance away
Oh, oh
Pretty boy, I wanna see you dance, dance away
Ooh, ooh

Look ahead, say I see me now
Smiling at what used to stress me out
'Cause it won't be too long, but I'll take my time with it
It won't be too long 'til I come back home

See that pretty boy I wanna see dance, dance away
Oh, oh
Pretty boy, I wanna see you dance, dance away
Ooh, ooh

Pretty boy, I wanna see you dance, dance away
Oh, oh
Pretty boy, I wanna see you dance, dance away
Ooh, ooh
Listen very carefully my words are about to unfold
Concerning a lady I've seen but I never could hold
I can see by your smile, take a long while, the words that come through, I see that they're true, for she reminds me of you

Don't misunderstand me, it's not always easy to say
The words in your head and your heart that you just can't explain
I can see clearly a face in the sky, Moon's in your eye
You're passing me by, well tell me the reason why

I can see clearly a face in the sky, Moon's in your eye
You're passing me by

Saw you riding on a moon cloud, saw you walking on a whirlpool
From the corner of my eye, I saw you
Saw you sitting on a sunbeam in the middle of my daydream
Oh my Lady Fantasy, I love you
Ay when I give you these keys homeboy don't move my car man
I ride in the front ya dig?
Don't move my shit man!
Ho! Oh baby what's your name?

Go girl, it's your birthday
Open wide, I know you're thirsty
Say ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Say ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh

And we don't buy no drinks at the bar
We pop that champagne cause we got that dough

Yeaa!
It's Young Khalifa man
Oh-kayyy

I got a bottle in my hand right now
And man I'm so high a nigga can't come down
Lotta niggas hatin but the gang stay close
So much money that she caint say no
I gooo
On and on until all the weed's gone and I see the Rosé stop pourin
And my diamonds look bonkers
Made her say "aah" like I was a real monster
Darlin
Bet another bottle'll quench your thirst
When I was broke I never got to them bitches first
Now either them hoes put me on they wishlist
Or treat me like I'm they dentist
And say ahh
Go girl, it's your birthday
Open wide, I know you're thirsty
Say ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Say ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh

Brian:
Alright. Go slow because I'm on, uh...

Michael:

Brian:
All right.

Michael:
Just a little at a time...

Brian:
Alright, hit it! Ow! There, I'm on!

Michael:
Alright! Now one more time and boost yourself all the way out.

Brian:
Wait a minute! Strike the Bb.
Michael:
The Bb?

Brian:
Yeah! My left foot's on it. Oh, there I am! Ah, okay, I'm on top the C#. Now hit the C# real hard and I'll come flyin' out. How are ya?

Van:
Hey! We're glad to see ya.

Weird thing to happen. Weirdest thing that's ever happened to me out there.

Van:
I wanna be 'round my vegetables.
Brian:
Ahhh-Ah-oooo.

Jim:
Take your time, Brian.

Mike:
Listen girl, I said "I gotta go out, buy me some new shoes." I told her, European too, "I have to run around with rags on my feet". Hallelujah, you got some fine some rags on your feet. I mean, I told the man "Shit, I needs credit".

Brian:
Ah-ooo.

Dennis:

Brian:
Alright, get in. Move in, please. Come on, sing out now.

Brian:
Two, three...

[Our Prayer: Take 37]

Al:
Which one is it? Alright.

Brian:
Yeah! I went like this: "wHOOAAAaa" and Al was running that way. Al was looking like this, ya know, waiting for the ball, and about 4 guys break his leg up. Isn't that how it went?

Al:
That's right Brian.

Brian:

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Juicebox, tank top, tube socks
Dude stop, forehead shiny like a new Glock
Two shots fired at the Excursion we were swervin' in
All-purpose verses with a passion for servin' kids
Empty out your purses on an immature crime spree
Eyin' up the nurses with some gloves that read "I squeeze"
Who the fuck said to speak, Mr. Me-Is-Siamese?
Even Christ said "Christ, he flows quite nicely"
Hypebeast's highly likely to bite me
And try to high five me, but I just give them high threes
'Cause y'all don't get two, touch me, I'm the shit
Sue me, if you got an issue, grab a tissue
Mediocrity is odd to me
Ass as far as ya eyes can see. Who the best? They holla me
Nombre, Ho-lay shit, I don't spit crack, I spit cocaine crisp
I ain't fuckin' with it if it's no payment
'Cause everyone knows paid dues don't pay rent
I'm dope like the coke that I'm laced with
Dreams what I'm chasin', flow hot it's chafin'
This is why I'm hot? No, that is why I'm blazin'
Dilla jacked Nick, I am shinin' like the diamond that I'm draped in
But I don't wear jewelry, it's HUF over Louis V
Excuse the endurance miss, this critic thing is new to me

[Verse 2: Big L]
Fuck them other cats I'm running with my own wolfpack
Keep frontin' like you's a thug and get your dome pushed back
'Cause you don't get down, that tough shit you talk is profound, you's a clown
Fuck around, come uptown and get found
I keep a pocket full, none of you niggas can touch my funds
I don't fight no more, all I do is bust my guns
While you home relaxed, I'm squeezing macs
Bustin' off caps, those coward cats, will go to platinum plaques get taxed
And I do jooks and sling pies to make cream rise
It's all about these green guys, front your whole team dies
How I'm, livin' so far swell you can't scar L
Headed a cartel selling more cakes than Carvel
And I'm, labeled a kind thug police got my line bugged
Hope I see a grave from old age and not a nine slug
I'm quick to bust a mean nut in some teen slut
Big L is clean-cut with more jewels than King Tut

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Most niggas think I'm redundant
'Cause I like to take my shopping sprees out in London
I go to the can, I go shine in Japan
A diamond black card, I get as much I can, man
My seven chains seem so real
Imagination changed all the way that this feels
'Cause it's soft
Ice creams and ducks
My girl rock Louis Vuitton pumped you asked how much it cost
My nigga I go hard
I rock Goyard, Supreme, oh god
Thought I had to wear black just to kick Bush
Until a mechanic button pushed me just to kick push
Niggas know I'm a teenage millionaire
Got polos to match every color Care Bear
I get fit with Ralph Lauren, white tees is boring
That's why I rock the best, my nigga, get fresh

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm color-coordinated
Get fresh
They're not color-coordinated
They need to get fresh
We just color-coordinated
It's fresh
(Oooh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Burtono]
Yeah, all white polo, self-titled jeans
Filliano Burtono, dog, own everything
Your boy Filliano is OTC
And at it's worst, I shop out this country
Your boy Filliano got his own clothing
What's the name of it? It's named after me
You ain't gotta stay tuned, this ain't a cartoon
Somewhere far Mr. Burtono is coming soon
Red, white, blue, that's so fresh
Black on black, you look like a mess
The sunny part about it, I'm so funny
Yeah, I'm so fresh to death, I sweat money
I love it, chillin' in the public
Three hundred bucks for the Rockin' Republics
I don't know, but I'm not the best
I stay, I dress to impress, but just get fresh

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I'm color-coordinated
Get fresh
They're not color-coordinated
They need to get fresh
We just color-coordinated
It's fresh
(Oooh, yeah)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
I go to Beverly Hills for perfection
Just so I can scope out the new Polo Hansen
My own clothing gives me an erection
I like to jack off to my own clothing
Nigga, check my wallet and see how much I'm holding
A new Bathing Ape t-shirt I'm unfolding
Cuff hands, block sip and attraction
With my jeans now I have a creative reaction
All my jeans get ripped up from my crew
Probably 'cause my new purple label look blue
Orange, yellow, green, pink, I got fits
My closet is thicker than silicone and Lil Kim tits
And as you can tell I'm on a mission
'Cause I got more True Religion than a Christian
I'm rockin' in public, but not in Republia
You rockin' Akadema jeans, I'm rockin' Rockin' Republic (Yup)
Paper with O's on the check
T-shirt with V's on the neck
My flow is sicker than AIDS patients havin' sex
And you know what's next, I'm one of the best dressed
I'm not even gonna tell you the rest, my nigga, get, fresh
(Oooh, yeah)

[Chorus: Together]
Life is a circus
It's not a fair
Life is a hard road
When you're not there
At the fair

[Verse 1: John Hutchinson & David Bowie]
Friends come to see me (With what way shall I go?)
To see the show (To help my friend, I'll go)
Crowd moving in line (And let them 

[?] me time)
(To laugh and drag my name on the ground)
The circus must go (Nothing ever stood so badly)
To the fair (And, whichever shall I go)

[Verse 2: David Bowie]
Papa, he talks to me
Don't dry your eyes, hmm
Gets deep inside you
Does you real harm
Don't you care?

[Verse 3: John Hutchinson & David Bowie]
High tightrope-walking  (With what way shall I go?)
Stand straight and tall (To help my friend unfold)
Don't lose your balance (And let them stride below)
(To laugh and drag my name on the ground)
Long wait home (Nothing ever stood so badly)
Crowds don't care (And whichever shall I go)

[Chorus: Together]
Life is a circus
It's not a fair
Life is a hard road
When you're not there
At the fair (What way shall I go)

[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight)
(Seven, six) Commencing (Five) countdown
Engines on (Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One)
And may God's love (Blast off) be with you

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past 100,000 miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you

[Chorus]
Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 1]
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The thinker sits alone, growing older
And so bitter
She gave them life
She gave them all
They drained her very soul dry
Dry, dry

[Chorus 1]
Hey hey hey, bitter girl
We're out to sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
It's easy
Don't be so bitter
Oh oh oh, crazy girl
You gave too much and you got nothing
Too many problems and not one thing
In return
Left high and dry, oh

[Verse 2]
And as the sun rise stream
Flickers on
She finds lavender
To hide the beckoning of hatred
Oh, what rise, baby skin
Throws back her head to scream her sides
The woodland shades its eyes
To such a strange event

[Chorus 2]
Hey hey hey, bitter girl
We're not just sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
It's tragic
You seem to lose
Oh oh oh, crazy girl
Don't throw your heart to the prowling moon
Don't wait too long for the prowling moon
Why do you stay here for so long

[Outro]
Here comes the David in your eyes
To the sun, to the sun
Here comes the David in your eyes
To the sun, to the sun
Here comes the David in your eyes
To the sun, to the sun

[Verse 1: David Bowie]
While walking on red roosters scars
A charred faced man I spied
Blew into his handkerchief
And stuttered as he sighed:
"I wish to play the 'doo-dah' horn
'Doo-dah' horn is fine
Sell my house and furniture
To make this daydream mine"

[Chorus 1: David Bowie]
Doo dah doo, doo dah
Doo dah doo, doo dah
Doo dah doo, doo dah
Doo dah doo, doo

[Verse 2: David Bowie]
While flying through an azure cloud
A crystal girl I spied
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue
And stuttered as she sighed:
"I wish to sing the 'ching-a-ling' song
'Ching-a-ling' song is fine
I'd give my jewels and caviar
To make this daydream mine"

[Chorus 2: Together]
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling (Doo dah doo, doo dah)
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling (Doo dah doo, doo dah)
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling (Doo dah doo, doo dah)
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling (Doo dah doo, doo)

[Verse 3: John Hutchinson]
While stepping through a heaven's eye
Two lover souls we spied
Their wispy cloud boys sang to me
A cheerful happy cry:
"We love to play our love-strong harps
No fetters do we know
No gifts of money do we give
For love is all we own"

[Chorus 3: Together]
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling (Na na na na na na)
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling (Na na na na na na)
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling (Na na na na na na)
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling (Na na na na na na)
Na na na na na na, Na na na na na na
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling (Na na na na na na)
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling (Na na na na na na)
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling (Na na na na na na)
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling (Na na na na na na)

[Verse 1]
I recall how we lived (I recall)
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And we’d talk with our eyes (And we'd talk with our eyes)
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise
Some things we could do

[Chorus]
Boy, you and me tomorrow (In our madness)
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An occasional dream

[Verse 2]
And we'd sleep, oh so close (And we’d sleep, oh so close)
But not really close our eyes
Between the sheets of summer
Bathed in blue
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago (It was long, long ago)
And I can't touch your name
For the days of fate
Were strong for you
Danced you far from me

[Chorus]
Just me and you tomorrow (In my madness)
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time, time
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder
Because the years of fretting days is right behind you now
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds
I will show you games where the winner never wins

[Chorus]
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

[Verse 2]
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free
I will hold a lighted that lamp and we shall walk together

[Chorus]
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

[Verse 3]
Your darkened eyes throw mystery, but your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'll like to hear
I will show you games where the winner never wins

[Chorus]
Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Let me sleep beside you

[Verse 1]
Looking up there's always sky
Rest your head, I'll take you high
We won't fade into darkness
Won't let you fade into darkness

[Bridge]
Why worry now? You'll be safe
Hold my hand, just in case
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

[Chorus]
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

[Verse 2]
This world can seem cool and grey
But you and I are here today
And we won't fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Nothing to fear but fear itself
We'll be okay just keep the faith

[Chorus]
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

[Outro]
Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness

Hear ye! Hear ye!
I'm Joe Montana
When it comes to football
I'm a bad mama jama
The 49ers was my team of choice
I love chucking the pigskin to Gerald Rice
My friend Ronald Rott is a tankerous lad
When he tackles your body
It'll make you feel sad
There is no denying
That I'm cock of the walk
I throw perfect spirals
While my cohorts flop
I'm retired now, but that won't stop me
From going out this evening and crushing 'tang

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs

[Verse 1: Mylo]
Yeah, yeah
Look, love I'm mesmerized by you
Saw a little dimple and I knew I had to try you in the book of love
My name sat right next by you and I knew it was meant to be
And I see you’re into me
I tag love on the wall, was it 12/1/08
With the heart and all in the bathroom stall, the rebel type
On the first flight to the Moon, that's where we should go
Just love a little lust, God please forgive me
While he hits me, look at her hips and lips be
Beautiful like the sunset we
Together and...we see...the sun
But we just have to run, yeah
Her voice harmonizes to my life
Once I hear, everything is, um
Balanced and nice
She's like ice on a summer day
She make me think of when to stray
She’s the reason I'm having a great day

[Bridge: Mylo]
I said honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry, that's my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
Nigga slide though

[Verse 2: Sly Tendencies]
"Wake up son, good morning"
I rolled out of bed, greeted mama with a yawn
Then paused to scratch an itch and went down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in, a thought jumped into my head
School was to be attended, shit
I paid my thoughts no attention 'cause I wasn't tryna kick it with this bitch that just ended it with me
But mama wasn't havin' it, so I grabbed my bag and split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick
It seems kinda brash but it’s the hash, I mean the harsh truth
She runs shit, she’s the jock, I'm the horseshoe
She’s gorgeous, when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache, stalking your MySpace
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say

[Chorus: Q-Tip & Sly Tendencies]
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
She's gorgeous
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
She's gorgeous
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs

Gotta put the boot on ya, who on ya, was it mad tight?
Was it worth a bitch in ya ear and all of this glass on the floor?
Heard the giggling tippy toe out the back door (goddamn)
Asking you do you know who is that though (nah man)
Saw you out with someone eating Ramen
Thought it was a friend or something, damnit was I wrong then
Look, don't waste your time don't waste my time though
You gon be stored as 'Dick' in my phone
Bitch all you want gon' hit the high notes
Look can’t walk the walk so sit n lie low

[Verse 1]
I cannot fuck with you
You want my juice
You lead me on
Now I know
All that you had to do

You want some’ new

You know you say you would but you won't (oh oh)
Acting like you do but you don’t (oh oh)

[Verse: Doja Cat]
Yeah

If you was Minute Maid then you should get honey

[Intro]
Baby
I'm so lonely, baby
Call me baby
I’m so lonely, baby
Um, call me baby
I'm so lonely, baby
Just call me baby, um
(Tell me, baby)
(I'm so lonely)

[Chorus]
Tell me, baby
Why you leave me all alone?
When you talking to me
How you leave me all alone?
When you’re right beside me
I feel so alone
Please don't come and find me
Baby, baby
Tell me, baby
Why you leave me all alone?
When you talking to me
How you leave me all alone?
When you're right beside me (Fuck is your on)
I feel so alone
Please don't come and find me (Please)
Baby, baby

[Verse]
Fuck is your ass on?
Nigga, fuck is your backbone?
Back to back, we got back and forths
And you wilin' like you on bath salts
Wish you really would touch me
Remember when you would touch me, baby?
Way to make me feel ugly
Hundred million would fuck me though like
Got me Cardi B'ing, like what was the reason?
Was it your demons? Was it the cheating?
Or was it you reading all through my feed and texts?
Baby, we not playing Simon says
Tell me to shut up, I'll find your bags
I just don't live a lifestyle fit for
The childish shit that you riding with

[Chorus]
Tell me, baby
Why you leave me all alone?
When you talking to me
How you leave me all alone?
When you’re right beside me
I feel so alone
Please don’t come and find me
Baby, baby

When you talking to me

When you're right beside me
I feel so alone

Baby, baby

[Outro]
Call me baby
Don't you call me baby
I'm not lonely, baby
I'm not lonely, baby
Call me baby
Don’t call me baby
I'm not lonely anymore

[Intro]
More so than me
She knows my name
And more so than me
Understands this pain
I'm either too lost
Or not lost enough
I think I'm too smart
For this type of love
I wasn't sent off
But straight to the ground
And I know God best
Is one with no crown

[Bridge]
Don't know why the past affects me in this way
Don't know where I'll go if I leave here today
But I know my limits, and you're not the type
To be fooling around in this way
No reason you're here but there's reasons to stay
Not as easy to know as it's easy to say
'Cause to my family and my friends, I can't think of one thing
That I gain
But more for me
And more for me
More for me

[Verse 1]
Age 14 at midnight, I hear voices from the kitchen
I let my feet follow the sound as I let my ears listen
I walk upstairs and at the kitchen table, I can see
That God is sitting with the Devil, sharing drinks and old stories
The floorboard creaks, a red embarrassment floods all throughout God's face
He swears that it's not what it looks like, then he swears he can explain
The Devil speaks, "Your God and I put all our differences to rest And a man's actions are his own
But man will blame us nonetheless"
The Devil stands, he grabs his keys and straightens out a rusted crown
He tells me, "Hell is frozen over, Heaven burned down to the ground
And you have only got one life, so do with it what you would like
We solemnly apologize, but we won't be there when you die"
And I stand cold and alone in a body that won't move
Watching the eyes of these gods that I once knew
One pair looks down in a half-hearted lie
While the other looks straight into mine with a whole truth
Lacking the fear I've been told that God deserves
I say, "What good is a prayer that goes unheard?"
He says, "What hope could they find in a book
If the book doesn't sell and the pages stay unturned?"

[Verse 2]
And with a wink, the Devil turns and exits the back door
And God is standing there in silence with his eyes glued to the floor
But then he speaks, "I am no savior, but I give them what they need
And there has never been a dreamer who prefers reality
The war for truth is raging on, but it's not one you have to fight
And if it is the truth you want, then it is hope you'll sacrifice
It's yours to choose"
And you can choose
This is not the way I am, this is just how I was raised
So let me make up my own mind, let me map out my own way
And to the parents of the kids whose tongues are in their throats
Because of tears that you will cry if they don't stick to what they know
I'm sure you're giving it your best, and I am sure it takes a toll
But whether God given or not, our lives are not to be controlled
Just let us choose

[Intro]
Okay, okay, okay

[Verse 1]
I wonder why you're coming
I wonder why you're coming to me
I wonder why you're coming
I wonder why you're coming to me
I wonder why you're coming
I wonder why you're coming to me
I wonder why you're coming (okay, okay, okay)
I wonder why you're coming to me
I think you must want something
I think you must want something for free
I try to work out what I could say
But my brain's not working today

[Chorus]
I know you need something
You're talking to me
You're talking to me
I know you need something
Well, what can it be?
Well, what can it be?
I know you need something
You're talking to me
But you don't get nothing for free

[Interlude]
Okay, okay, okay (Nothing's for free)

[Verse 2]
You've got a real cool way about you
Is there a lot you want me to do? (Yeah)
I'd love to help out in any way
But my brain stopped working today (okay, okay, okay)

[Chorus]
I know you need something
You're talking to me
You're talking to me
I know you need something
Well, what can it be?
Well, what can it be?
I know you need something
You're talking to me
You're talking to me
I know you need something
Well, what can it be?
Well, what can it be?
I know you need something
You're talking to me
But you don't get nothing for free
Okay, okay, okay

[Interlude]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I know you need something
You're talking to me
You're talking to me
I know you need something
Well, what can it be?
Well, what can it be?
I know you need something
You're talking to me
You're talking to me
I know you need something
Well, what can it be?
Well, what can it be?
I know you need something
You're talking to me
But you don't get nothing for free

[Interlude]
Okay, okay, okay (Nothing's for free)
(What they say, what they say, what they say)

These red eyes in the night, looking like giants, not the flights
Colossus watching the optics, are brighter
These demons blocking the right, might hop up in the sky, and start boxing the lights
Through the haze finding ways of expression
Past like graves on a train, and feel a wave of protection
Wisdom is a prison, not a cage for correction
Is it real or is it feel, trying to gauge the connection
Discretion got me stepping like bears in the trap
VPN gang checking China Air with an app
No status on trying to keep that baggage to a minimum
Linen gi, lemon tea, beef noodle gimme some (Yeah)
Look around, look around, everybody's on their phones
It's a room full of people but everybody's alone
Looking down, looking down
I even got the monks getting down to the sound

I don't wanna leave, I just want to breathe Air China
I don't wanna die, I just want to fly Air China
Say, speaking to my sifu, finding gold in his counselling
Fire car speed through a hole in the mountain
Next to the businessman with his soul in accounting
Blessed be the hands that control the surroundings
Can we calculate fate
Can we look into the future and evaluate grace
Is it wisdom in the body, treat death like a job (eh)
Living like a hobby (eh)
Master the form, stand behind, copy (whoop)
I'm skilled to the way flies play on the anvil of the blacksmith
Martially off of fireworks sparkle at the funeral
The practice is incense turned to ashes in a sense
It represents life, and its vastness in a flash
What came before becomes floor for the inheritance of the assets
This too will burn and return to his place among the masses
But not before sitting still in the traffic
And I wish you could come here with me
But no crying allowed in these one tier cities

My hotel ain't got no fours in it
Repeat the form to my mind, ain't go no wars in it
Fire in my belly, my doubts keep it warm in it
And don't authorize unless it's authentic
Ya hear me, even though you weary
Still move sincerely and do it all clearly
Listen to my father, I'm continuin' the saga
Faced with different missions, so I'm switching like the opera (Ye)
Bath stands, heaven's in the body and there's weapons in the lobby
The fat faced baby, wise ladies
Imperfections, misconceptions, and assumptions
Stereotypes, corruptions and compunctions
Appropriations, mispronunciations and manipulations of the functions
We all let the junction like
I don't wanna leave, I just wanna breathe Air China
I don't wanna die, I just wanna fly Air China

[Verse 1: Jake]
Is it cruel to pursue you
If I make it half the night?
I'm a joke, but I'll fool you
Into thinking love is blind

[Chorus: Jake]
Lost souls
Lose to live
My body
Your teeth and lips
I remember
The taste of it
When we were younger
When we were younger back then

[Verse 2: Jake]
Chevrolet, down on market
Where the parking garage was home
Used to wait half an hour
By your mom's house on my phone

[Chorus: Jake]
Lost souls, lost souls
Lose to live
My body
Your teeth and lips
I remember
The taste of it
When we were younger
When we were younger back then

[Bridge: Jake]
If you stand where you are in the makeshift present
I could greet you in arms with a strange affection
I could take what we have and make it familiar too
If you lay the foundation for a brief extension
A framework to deal with the kind of pension
For retirement from all the upkeep that kept us down

[Chorus: Jake]
Lost souls, lost souls
That lose to live
My body
Your teeth and lips
I remember
The taste of it
When we were younger
When we were younger back then

[Outro]
When we were younger
When we were younger back then

[Intro: Jake]
Which books, what tunes, why God, how love?
Are we alone or from above?
Bright eyes atop the afternoon
Adrift the atom bomb harpoon
Which hooks, what loons you got now, bud?
Trade data for Sahara blood
I fuckin' miss the green hills there
But I was not supposed to care

[Verse 1: Jake]
Elephant boys, the speaker's trunk
Together through the stampede drunk
Our textures dazed in dark lamplight
Their thoughts and pupils shuttered wide
Raincoats adrift, I hush myself
Bloodthirsty, wild and unkept
How high my pillars seem to be
A uniform is all we see

[Chorus]
Elephant boys, just be yourself
Build with your trunk and ask for help
The city peeks around the night
The waterhole has lost its sight
The lightning bugs will understand
Our shaking ears are out of hand
We're nothing more than elephants, tough
But that is more than enough

[Bridge: Jake]
Which books, what tunes, why God, how love?
Are we alone or from above?
Bright eyes atop the afternoon
Adrift the atom bomb harpoon
Which hooks, what loons you got now, bud?
Trade data for Sahara blood
A fuck amidst the green hills there
But I was not supposed to care

[Chorus]
Elephant boys, just be yourself
Build with your trunk and ask for help
The city peeks around the night
The waterhole has lost its sight
The lightning bugs will understand
Our shaking ears are out of hand
We're nothing more than elephants, tough
But that is more than enough

[Verse 1]
It's so goddamn reverent
Everything's purpose is fickle to me
It's so goddamn hard to forget
Here we go Kentucky, you're leaving me again

[Verse 2]
Shame, it's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
Southern skies leaving on the hills of a train
Here we go Kentucky, your wide eyes roll me down
Feeling pretty lucky you're keeping me around

[Verse 3]
Picking lipstick flakes off of my shirt
Licked up bone bags left in the dirt
Sweet tea drinkers, farm for the worst
Singing like a kick drum, blessed with the curse
Singing like a kick drum, blessed with the curse
Singing like a kick drum, blessed with the curse
Singing like a kick drum, blessed with the curse
Singing like a kick drum, blessed with the curse

[Verse 4: Jake & Nathan]
It's not as strange as it seems
We're just walking and pacing the seams
Aptitude high, you know it so well
Faking drowning, going to hell
I'm so goddamn tired (I'm so goddamn tired)
I'm so goddamn tired (I'm so goddamn tired)
I'm so goddamn tired (I'm so goddamn tired)
I'm so goddamn tired (I'm so goddamn tired)
Shame, it's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame, it's a shame, it's a shame

[Outro]
Here we go, Kentucky
Feeling pretty lucky

[Verse 1: Jake]
In my house, snow is coming down
Solemn nights, haven't lost or found it, it, it
Half of me is trying not to want
What I want is something I forgot
I forgot

[Chorus: Jake]
Ease up kid, don’t you worry
You'll be fine
Simple worries have got you
It's alright
Things will change with the seasons
’Til that time, be a man, be a brother
You'll be fine
Ease up kid, don't you worry
You'll be fine
Simple worries have got you
It's alright
Things will change with the seasons
'Til that time, be a man, be a brother
You'll be fine

[Verse 2: Jake]
While I'm home I think of other beds
Finding comfort in the sheets instead
Mother planted a garden
In the back
I don’t feel very hungry, sorry about that

[Chorus: Jake]
Ease up kid, don’t you worry
You'll be fine
Simple worries have got you
It’s alright
Things will change with the seasons
'Til that time, be a man, be a brother
You'll be fine

[Verse 1: Jake]
I know we've been friendly
Maybe more than family
It is far from perfect
But I'm just killing time
I'll come over later
It's so calculated
But I am not your savior
I'm just killing time

[Verse 2: Jake]
Looking in the mirror
It could not be clearer
I might as well stay near her
Killing time
Why don't we just listen?
Are we too blind to see it?
I can barely breathe in
We're just killing time
We're just killing time

[Intro: Jake]
Oh, my guardian
My tears don't fall like they did back then
Mama's champion
I haven't lost, but I have never won

[Verse 1: Jake]
I was swept right off my feet
Searching for a love that isn't real
A blind man's eyes could see
It's far too vague to even mean
Something

[Verse 2: Jake]
Charmed by self-righteous men who fear their insignificance
I'm becoming it

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
Oh, the modern man
Prideful son and the family band
Sam's girl's fully spread
I swear I'll laugh myself to death

[Chorus: Jake]
Oh, my guardian
Oh, my guardian
Oh, my guardian
Oh, my guardian

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
What I gotta do?
Keep it real with you
Stuck inside my truth
Spendin' all my loot
Diamond on my tooth
R.I.P. my brother Luk
When I spit, let it hit, hit a double U
Couple rainbows, my lil' halo
Think it's J-Lo, bro don't say so
Homie don't play, no
Takin' my day slow
Takin' my ray, throw
Talkin' to angels
Speedin' a pave' though
Changin' a page though
Lookin' like ace, talkin' 'bout spade, you are afraid though
Spendin' my queso
All on some fake clothes
When I change, never say, this is my blaze throat
South Central
All my homies know
If I could go, I would just wait though

[Verse 2: Joba]
Anyways, gotta go, disregard what I say
Grain of salt, sprinkle some over the shoulder, ayy
Lucky Strike, filterless, don't push me, 'kay?
Sensitive, abrasive, stab you in the face
Keep a blade, heaven sakes, had to raise the stakes
Dracula, in a cave, a bit lonely, mane
Grab a stake, have a cape, it don't work no more
Fly away, different ways, hit the liquor store
Better days, follow me like the saddest song
Grab a case, hideaway, fill my loads with bleach
Couple stains ain't a game, they both hauntin' me
Lot to say, people hate, wearin' blindfolds
Now where did I go? Where do we go?
How do we grow? How should I know?
Feel responsible, intolerable, displaced (Uh-huh), insane

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Piss 'em off, piss 'em off, piss 'em off
Shit, I better set it off
I just made a deposit, CDG in my closets
Fuel ain't really made of fossils
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
Spying on your ho from a SpaceX rocket
She wanna know why my wrist so rocky
Flash splash on me, photocopy
My weed, my weed at the party
Shoot me a sheriff for Trayvon Martin
King, Ali, and Bobby Marley
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
You know

[Refrain: bearface]
I wish you'd love me for life
Love me for life, love me for life, wish you would lie
I wish you'd love me for life
Love me for life, love me for life, I will
Love, love me for, yeah
Love me, love me for life
Love, love me for life
Love, love me for life
Love, love me for
Love, love me for life
Love, love you for
Love you for

When she leave, I swear I feel her in my liver (In my liver)
She got that type of pussy make your body shiver (Body shiver)

[Intro: Marcus Garvey]
May I say something to you to give you a true knowledge of yourself and life?
Man in the full knowledge of himself is a superb and supreme creature of creation
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself, he becomes the master of his environment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess what, baby? I feel free (Scoop!)
Nothin' hurts me anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Created from no-no-no
Guess what, baby? I feel free
And you know damn well
I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, babe? I am free
You should quit your job to this
Hold up, let 'em jog from this
Got blunts or what, one stun of lumps
Don't slow the lumps
Got grrrrr

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, babe? I am free

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This like a mix of some Ja Rule shit
And some King Fool shit
Under rude, city news shit
This is a fool's shit
I'm on some ooze shit
I'm on some wildin' out in the news shit
I'm on some Doctor Blues and
Psycho, kind of lose it
Don't con-confuse it
Leo called me artist and said, "Don't lose the music"
I got no reclusion
I've been known to cruise it
We stuck with a some motherfuckers you don't know like a cruise ship
Had a son, news shit
Banging on that new shit
Popstar movement

Many going stupid

[Verse 1]
This is a wake, lay your head on my pillow
By the time you're awake, baby you’ll be my widow
I taught you how to feel when you thought you never could
And I taught you how to love, nobody ever would

[Pre-Chorus]
But tonight I gotta go, somebody's waitin' home
So after this rendezvous, might as well be dead to you

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Tryna take my life and they took my guys
So we forever shedding blood
I'm just spending my nights, running all my life
Them niggas never understood
Nigga, fuck the fame, get it on my name

[Chorus]
When I die, young legend in my hood
Young nigga, I'm a legend in my hood
Young nigga, I'm a legend in my hood
Hi guys, it's us
We are, back stage
We are, back stage
But soon, we won't be
Now we're walking at the back of the stage
Yeah walking at the back of the stage
Now we're at the top of the back of the stage
Building suspense
Now we're just waiting
Now we're just waiting
We can see you but you can't see us
Can you imagine if we came on stage
Well get ready, cause we're about to

We're on stage
We're on stage
Get the fuck up cause we are on stage
We're on stage
We're on stage
The Lonely Island is on this stage
We're on stage
We're on stage
This is a concert we are on stage

Now we're hiding, where did we go?
Is this show over? Will we be back?
Hang on a second, look over here
We're peeking at you, isn't that annoying?
Maybe not the best way to start the show
But we made our bed and now we're lying in it
Now we're embarrassed so we hiding again
But have no fear cause we're coming back out to be

On the stage
We're on the stage
Get the fuck up cause we are on stage
We're on stage
We're on stage
The Lonely Island is on this stage
I wonder we go back and we'll see her
Oh I know we know we came by eight an'
It said at eight well we'll missed the wine an'

Okay, oh, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, this is better..."

[Part 1]
And you feel the dissolve
Of grit against the walls
And you follow your words
And then
As the winter grows cold
You watch them all grow old
Them all

And they watch your eyes, all them
And the greed in yourself
But be carful how we get
They're all

When I wake up you have flown over
Sometimes if you were wrong
Like you always said to me, but I
Forgot your face, don't leave

[Verse]
It's that ancient love
That you won't outgrow
It's the fee you pay
It's the debt you owe
It's that subtle way
That you throw me down
I am inches above
The dust on the ground

Put a ring 'round your finger, charisma (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Dropped outta school then pulled up in a Tesla (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I've got a lover
She's settled next to me right now
Landing her cartwheels
Gonna make it sure she's not let down

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking through the trees where the rooftops bounce
She asked me if I wanna know, know how

[Chorus]
I can be
Your honeyweed

[Verse 2]
Brushing her blue hair
Spiked lemonade and a warm breeze
Crossing her arms as she makes a toast to the daily

[Pre-Chorus]
Dangling our feet off the fire escape
She asked me if I wanna know, know ways

[Chorus]
I can be
Your honeyweed

[Bridge]
I've always questioned if
I'd find devotion or
Something which to believe
In a year from now
We'll be living in the south of town

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Last but not least, I wanna thank me
I wanna thank me for believing in me
I wanna thank me for doing all this hard work
I wanna thank me for having no days off
I wanna thank me for... for never quitting
I wanna thank me for always being a giver
And tryna give more than I receive
I wanna thank me for tryna do more right than wrong
I wanna thank me for just being me at all times
Snoop Dogg, you a bad motherfucker
(Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Eagle side, homie coming up
I was young and I didn't give a fuck
Long Beach nigga, a fiend for the bucks
Lean in my chucks, banger, I'm tough
Yeah, long time coming, had to earn my G
Gold digging hoes had to learn my fee
I beat a couple cases, I'm H-O-T
I'm Snoop Dogg to the world, gotta thank 'ol me
We celebrating, you hating on a real one
All the L's that I took, man, I still won
Big bank rolls coming at ya
West Coast king, man, I need a statue

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, I said it, who did it like me?
Who want the dice? Nigga, bet it
20 plus years, I ain't even gotta sell it
I ain't even got to show up to get the money
Mail it, I'm going in

[Bridge: Marknoxx]
Oh, I paid my dues and earned my stripes (Can you hear me?)
No matter what ya say it's all me (Can you hear me?)
Bring that beat back, bring that B-Cat

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Who did it like the King? Go tell
Sent a bunch of kids to the NFL
Did it from the dirt, nigga, can't you tell?
Don't I ride by in that SSL?
Snoopy had to get it on, ball, beat ten of y'all
I'm just tryna show 'em how the men evolve
Couple mill', then they into y'all
Still screaming, rolling through my Hollywood stid-all (yeesh)
Back up off me, sip your coffee, it's the Dogg show
Smoking weed on TV like a Marlboro
Standing there flexing, hoes see the drip
This crip, no question

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Who bigger than me? Shit, yeah, I said it
Who did it like me? Who want the dice? Nigga, bet it
20 plus years, I ain't even gotta sell it
I ain't even got to show up to get the money
Mail it, I'm going in

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Battlecat, what you gon' do?
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Long Beach, East Side mad-ass lunatics
Still own niggas who talk bitch shit
Down for whatever, whoever wanna see me now
Slap a bitch nigga out to get a grip
Take a whole lot to be Snoop D-O-dub
You gotta put it down and always stay G'd up

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Who did it like a muhfuckin' legend?
Yeah, it hurts, church, reverend
Sat back, took a look at me, shit's classic
Pocket full of paper, the haters, they can't grasp it
Still at the top of my game, I'm all-pro
Lost count of the cars, nigga, they all show
I got a family to feed, now that's growth
But I'll still lay your ass out for the low
Now, grown men make it hard to trip
I'm talking big dick shit, man, it's hard to grip
Got a whole gang of albums and some major flicks
I got a wife, rich life, that's some major shit

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Bigg Dogg, yeah, I said it
Who did it like me? Who want the dice? Nigga, bet it
20 plus years, I ain't even gotta sell it
I ain't even got to show up to get the money
Mail it, I'm going in

[Outro: Battlecat]
Used to be out West, but now you hear me
From the LBC, around the room, let's blow this smoke
Used to be out West, but now you hear me
From the LBC, around the room, let's blow this smoke
La-da-da-da-dah
It's the Snoop to the D-O-double-G

DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It’s just the way it is, oh
These niggas beat me to it (Just the way)
Yeah, these niggas started changin', oh no (They changin', they changin’)
And everything I got they wanna take it, oh
My money and my lady, no (Hey)
They wanna separate it, they try and tear us down
They tryna tear us down, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller & DJ Khaled]
Hey, I been reaping those rewards
From my hard work, I'm startin' to see the jealousy
Hey, they talkin' shit, that's what they tellin' me
They rather tell somebody else instead of me (Okay)
I got my dollas, my cash up
They wanna see me on my last one (Last one)
They tell you things you don't wanna hear
They don't wanna see me with a bad one
No, or see you in a Benz wagon
With your new bag on (No)
The bag that these hatin’ bitches
Only spend a hundred plus tax on
The one we spent five racks on
And I love to get on tracks that I can rap and spit facts on
I’m the one that niggas love to turn they backs on (Yeah)
That's cool with me, that’s cool with me
Another one
Another one

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]

Just fine, yeah, just fine, yeah
We was best friends until the fall out
Now I got the lawyers goin' all out

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm touchin' triple digits, now it's tangible
I'm touchin' M's now my life is pandemonium
I go and re-up on you, new Aventadors (Skrt, skrt)
Everything around me too colossal (No)
You niggas old news like a fossil (Woo)
Every single night I got a bad bitch
She didn't come alone, she came with another bad one (Woo)
I done caught a vibe and a wave, double jeopardy
They know I'm the king of these melodies
You know I was in the bando, smellin' like a half a key
You can smell the molly comin' off me when you next to me
Put it in my cup and let me medicate
And it all started off with foreplay
Cappuccino vodkas in Santa Monica
We was best friends until the fall out
Now I got the lawyers goin' all out

[Chorus: Bryson Tiller]
It's just the way it is, oh
These niggas beat me to it (Just the way)

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Looks like it's one of those nights again
I told the devil that I got him in my sights again
Life's full of cycles and I'm hopping on my bike again
The energy around the light could cut just like a knife my friend
We just some carbon based life forms spitting hydrogen
Sometimes I wind up so the gears inside my mind will spin
Switching lanes, 110, I know they like to pretend
Don't try to sleep cause they might take your dreams and cash them in
Consume the pack and clap for all the ones surpassing trends
My bones are black, my blood is red, my brain a javelin
They play for paper, but I'm safer with my oxygen
Wave like tsunami, with this proxy, everybody wins
Pass on my posse till they start to photocopy them
Life after purpose had me in the game but out of it
So it's no time for folly gotta point out all the counterfeits
I'm counting on this gift to guide me to whatever's right within
I've been divisive, now I try to stay above the fence
Need all my soldiers till we over every wall and trench
You'll have to pardon us for contact marijuana stench
I thought to switch it up but then remembered that this flow is rich
With history. Your come up is a myth to me
My vision monolithic and my aura is a mystery
Step beside the critics with an effortless delivery
My presence is a symbol of my victories
They wrapped inside their misery

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
Stay rough, get buff, get out, hey, boy
Stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys

[Verse 2: Joba]
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (you can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (you can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it

[Verse 3: bearface]
Why the fuck would you share this shit with these people?
I don't know these people, I don't know you either, no more
I'm at war with myself
Every time I see this shit I wanna kill myself
And they coming for my mother, sending bullets for my head
Think they fallin' in love but I'd rather be dead
Please just leave me alone, I don't wanna be read
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout

I just wanna drink you up
Pour you in a silver cup
You know I like to party
But you know I love your body
So many things I shouldn't do
I hate myself for hurting you (Yeah)
Honestly, I'm reckless
I'm sorry if I'm selfish

I can't keep on losing you over complications
Gone too soon, wait! We was just hangin'

In the face lookin' at you like ("Wait!")

(I can't keep on losing you) I run away so fast
But my heart like gold, but it break like glass
Know my shit get old when I act so young
Baby you so cold, never have no sun
You don't wanna grow up, yeah, that shit no fun
So when I get home, I'mma give you some
Make you feel like (Woo!) when I hit that drum
Yeah the dick ain't free, I don't give no fucks
Yeah it's complicated, got you frustrated
Get home late and you don't trust me, baby
Way too drunk, you don't know what I'm sayin'
You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy
Complicated, got you frustrated
Every single night, I keep you waitin'
You say you don't care, is what you sayin'
We both know that's some bullshit
Okay, we be fightin', we be reunitin'
Kiss me, touch me, tease me, me excited

Tryna get through to you because...

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I can't keep on losing you over complications

Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude

Only got a little time and I ain't tryna spend it
Arguin' about who ain't givin' who attention
Startin' up the engine, need to reboot
I just eat pussy, other people need food
It's complicated, keeping me up late
Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain
If it's love, then why the fuck it come with pain?
I just think that's some bullshit
Okay, it seems invitin', trust me, she's a titan
This week she like him, next week they fightin'
Need protection, all your dresses bulletproof
You're safe with me, girl

When I feel the love, did it safely
It's just everyone, ooh, yeah
Not makin' up, 'cause I'm insane
Now we know, on me, me
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Without you, without you, without you
I'm crossing all my T's, and I'm dotting all my I's
Gotta watch out for debris when its falling down
As far as I can see, I done confronted all the shit I couldn't walk around
I dodge police 'cause I seen how the bodies piled
Keeping peace when you on the ground leakin', you hard as hell
I keep some wind in my sails, dog, walking down the La Brea
My name ringing bells like it got some mail
Go hard on the paint, I'ma swat the layup if you don't
Roll all of your ankles, I'll pull the trey up just to flaunt
Sweat, peace to my nigga Staples, by the park with his set
Banging, might catch a beatin' like the heart up in your chest
Skatin' away from demons, kept the scars on my flesh fresh
Pour some Henny out for my Benny in the jet, settin' niggas in the stars
Know you gone but you still with us
I pen a song for my real niggas
I seen God in the mirror drinking
I tee off when the spirit hit me
And I don't fear the ending, I could feel the envy
I listen to the past when it whisper to me
Half of it makes sense and half of it riddles to me
Moses with a makeshift staff
Sending ripples through the land and the river's been a plan
But, when I go to grab it, it slither out my hand
On the other hand, I've been handling business
Kinda shabby, my momma told me man up
So now I'm Popeye with the anchor tats
And the spinach, I'ma spaz on a nigga if I have to

[Intro: Young Thug]
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Oh, really? Yeah
Oh, really? Yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I'm scared to break the top (Why?)
I'm scared to make a mess because I'm watched by the cops (Fuck 'em)
I'm scared to count my blessings 'cause I'm being watched by my opps (Foes)
But fuck it, Lethal Weapon, let it rip from out the top of the drop to his scalp
Now he out like a light (Ayy)
Every nigga with me slime and sheisty
Stay on the PJ but I don't sight-see (No cap)
Somebody tell Oprah I want wifey (Call me)
I know that lil' mama tryna fight me (Ayy)
I got slatt engrated in my Nikes
Oh, you caught a body? Doesn't excite me (Fool)
All my niggas murderers, you're tiny

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Runnin' from the cops in a goddamn Rolls (Ayy)
I just cooked a opp on a goddamn stove (Cook him)
Shot up the opp block, and I robbed all they stores (Yeah)
Slime, do you got clocks? Nigga, twenty times four (Let's go)
Robbed him for his dank and his car and gas tank (Let's go)
I'ma rob that bank, I'ma, I'ma rob that bank (I'ma rob the bank)
If I hit New York, I take my shank like a Yankee (On God)
They stabbed him and he died, 'cause it's pointy and they yankin' (Woo)
Runnin' from the cops in a goddamn Rolls (Ayy)
I just cooked a opp on a goddamn stove (Cook him)
Runnin' from the cops in a goddamn Rolls (Ayy)
I just cooked a opp on a goddamn stove (Cook him)

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Straight up out the 6, I don't talk, I just fire (Straight up)
Book me for a show, I put a Glock on my rider (On God)
Niggas clout chasing, they don't want smoke, they wanna go viral (21)
I just cooked the opp block in a deep fryer (Straight up)
We don't go back and forth, dawg, we really shootin' shit (On God)
Y'all riding 'round like killers, nigga, who the fuck you hit? (21)
She let me nut in her jaw, I would've hit raw, but she ain't have walls (21)
This ain't middle school, when you sucking on me, please include the balls (On God)
Thirty hanging off my TEC, gang don't tippy-toe, nigga, we step (21)
Richard Mille cost more than all that cheap ass shit sitting 'round your neck (Pussy)
Buster, I could've booked you for a show same price that I booked this jet (Fool)
12 already know not to interrogate me if he got hit below the neck (Shh)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Runnin' from the cops in a goddamn Rolls (Ayy)
I just cooked a opp on a goddamn stove (Cook him)
Shot up the opp block, and I robbed all they stores (Yeah)
Slime, do you got clocks? Nigga, twenty times four (Let's go)

[Verse 3: Doe Boy]
Yeah, nigga flexing money, if I want it, then I'll take it, yeah (Doe Beezy)
Heard y'all run them faces, you ain't heard? I shoot faces, yeah
Fuck shit, better save it, you ain't heard? We don't play it, uh (No cap)
If a nigga had some beef with us, he met the pavement, uh (Gang gang, gang)
This that ain't no cap at all, I can't hang around no fraud
Niggas hating 'cause I ball, grrah, problem solved
Get your bitch, blow out her walls, I just bust all in her jaws
Bitch, we slimy as they come, my youngin probably snake his dawg (Slatt, slatt)
Cop that Rove' (Woo, woo), and that Rolls (Woo, woo, skrrt)
All my niggas sick, they wipe your nose (Grrt, bah)
Ain't never froze (Nah, nah), I blow my pole (Boom, boom)
Heard you gangster, it don't count no more, you told (Pussy)
No, this rap shit can't change, we just running up them bands (Let's go)
Tryna figure out which opp that's gon' get murdered with my advance (Freebandz)
Pop a pill, it got me geeked up, nigga, catch me when I land (Let's go)
Please don't play like I won't hop right off the jet, jump in a minivan (Oh really?)

[Verse 1]
I got one sip left on my Champange bottle
I feel I ain't gonna let it waste
I'm feeling act real ghetto
I feel I take it back like red light yellow
That's so cosbey
Mr. show ruin Flow like Cosby
Sometimes I even wanna Ride me
Put down, give me all that brocolli
Ice on deck just like hockey
The code 45 don't need a jockey
I'm a ride out like rain get God sea
One time for my strong arm posey
Stayin' getting paid being the life of the party
Act aquí, we don't end 

[?]
Goons on my line and they ball like Shockey
That's right, hold my hands tight, I'm the Benz' type, we're stuntin' just like

[Chorus]
Just like when bottles get empty we refill the game
And keep it pouring (hey!), keep it pouring
They know my name in the street 'cause I don't make it rain
I keep it pouring (hey!), keep it pouring
We fallin' just like the water, fallin' just like the water
Flow forever, Ride forever
We ballin' just like the water, ballin' just like the water
Flow forever, Ride forever

[Verse 2]
Hey momma this is your niño
Your boy, your son, I'm willing like Neno
13 weeks with a number 1 single
Now is Louis 13 from a bottle of Pinot
MGM Grand at the Vegas Casino
Stack my chips all favours the prime goals
In the Phillipines full of black filipinos
Every hood nigga dream's stacking them C notes
Back to my R.O.O.T.S tada got it from jeans dough
Before I had the Coupe I was loosing at bingo
Now I got loot feel as high supremo
Just so fly like I'm high as an eagle
Why make sense, when I make cash
I rather be dumb 'cause I'm pouring a glass
So much class, everything first class
When money come fast, they say it won't last but 'em

[Chorus]
Just like when bottles get empty we refill the game
And keep it pouring (hey!), keep it pouring
They know my name in the street 'cause I don't make it rain
I keep it pouring (hey!), keep it pouring
We fallin' just like the water, fallin' just like the water
Flow forever, Ride forever
We ballin' just like the water, ballin' just like the water
Flow forever, Ride forever

[Verse 3]
He-he-hell, they laughed at the boy sold water to a well
Use to ride buckets, no water in the pell
Say I wasn't nuttin' like the 8 motel
Just one sun 'round 7 females
And I ain't special, at least I know my daddy ain't come from a testube
Ashanti's on the caddy to impress who
Looking at my valleys bring out the best shoe
The sunny, I'm ballin' like the water pockets full of money
I'm falling for your daughter when she sore my heartbeat
She on the first quarter giving me poo-nanny
'Cause that's what it is
A nigga buy a whip before I buy him a crib
My dawgs got grid without the barbacue ribs
That's how we live been stuntin' for years
Tell ya peers who they be frontin' but they wet behind the ears 'cause

[Chorus]
Just like when bottles get empty we refill the game
And keep it pouring (hey!), keep it pouring
They know my name in the street 'cause I don't make it rain
I keep it pouring (hey!), keep it pouring
We fallin' just like the water, fallin' just like the water
Flow forever, Ride forever
We ballin' just like the water, ballin' just like the water
Flow forever, Ride forever

[Chorus]
Do things ever get easier?
Some fall hard, so fast, freeze it, yeah
Sold my bands off it, but champagne sip through
Do things ever get easier?

[Verse 1]
Countin' up bands, and so my neck froze
Runnin' outside and cop a mafro
Rollie on now we're back and now my neck froze
Runnin' outside, I'm another one
Was he all up in it, count another one
Was he in the pussy and am I on?
Here's enough money, let's ball
Here's enough money, let me throw
Drive a Rolls Royce Wraith, that's my everyday
And the money, it falls, then we come away
There's some money now, sippin' on my ice, ayy
There's some money and you might just get your ass kicked, but

[Chorus]
Do things ever get easier?
Some fall hard, so fast, freeze it, yeah
Sold my bands off it, but champagne sip through
Do things ever get easier?

[Verse 2]
Diamonds on me water like they know the call
And I want a 40 and you know the call
It's some in a 40 and you know the call
It's a money 40, that's the protocol
And oh, woah, girl it shouldn't make sense
Since I got my own 40-automatic
And oh, woah, girl, it shouldn't make sense
Send the money with the 40 on the side
Yeah, ayy, let me know, tell me how she go
Put it on my bands and the 20 on my truck
Don't slow me up, baby, slow me up
Diamonds on my bed, she can see them on me matter
You wanna run up on me, but it still ain't happen
Was somewhere on her body, and she's still a mack
He's a run up on me, but it still ain't happen
I remember back in Stoney and I'm in a mansion

[Chorus]
Do things ever get easier?
Some fall hard, so fast, freeze it, yeah
Sold my bands off it, but champagne sip through
Do things ever get easier?

[Bridge]
Ball out my fatty, she call me daddy
See mama fatty, she pop them Xannies
I don't want nothin', see mama fatty
It's on my doney and on my baby
I don't want no-one, want another one
Pistol and her pussy help me though
I don't want no-one, that's the one I want
I don't want no pussy, let me go

[Chorus]
Do things ever get easier?
Some fall hard, so fast, freeze it, yeah
Sold my bands off it, but champagne sip through
Do things ever get easier?

[Intro: A$AP Rocky & Lil Yachty]
Yo, bro, I'ma come clean, bro
If you gon' put me on the spot at least give a nigga a heads-up
Nigga, I ain't have a heads-up myself, my God!
You gone put me under the bus while the bus still moving

[Verse 1]
You gone put me under the bus while the bus still moving
How you gon' stop the beat when my raps still grooving?
How you gon' point the finger, fuck is you doing?
Hows you gon' choose and you ain't no chooser?
How you gon' be snoozin' and you sleepin', bruisin'?
I'm just going in my Jeep, Jeep is cruisin'
I just doze off to sleep, countin' the sheep
Going off to sleep and I be countin' my Zs
All I need to sleep is my beauty rest
Tell that chick that her coochie stretched
All this time I do be blessed
And I deliver like I'm UPS
How y'all know about the boy
Hit 'em with the emergency, need the vitamin C
All these other girls want my vitamin D
In spite of my teeth, I'm smiling so clean
Like how I gleam, she like how I seem
Tell her that, man she can have a nice dream
A wet dream, a sex scene, we sexing
And detexing, caressing
Her best friend want the same thing but I just curved it
Fuck it, y'all niggas be smoking on that sherbert
You don't wanna admit I'm cleaner than detergent
Yes, straight like I left the permit
All my semen started swerming
To her eggs, between her legs
She in the daze, going crazy
I'mma come clean I can't-

[Interlude: Lil Yatchy & A$AP Rocky]
I can't, I can't, don't look at me, I swear to God I can't do it
Yes you can

You just had a scare, so you just gotta relax a lil' bit
Nah bruh, I could never
He had a scare you a lil' tramatized still
Bruh, you rap without stopping
You know why? When you fuck up you keep going
I can never do that
If you like, bro if you fall you gon' get right back up we got you
Oh I like that

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
He said this a smash, I said this a pass

Better get in a cab
Take an LSD, I'm sipping a tab

[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah
Ayy
Listen

[Verse 1: Young Thug & Mac Miller]
S-N-double-O-P, I'm a dizzog
Shit, he was talking brazy, I ain't lie, I knocked the nigga off
I ain't tryna give him a chance to kill me or take the stand on me
He know I just had a hundred thousand Ps Saran'd on me
I had to hand out all the rooms so she can't say I molested
I tried to take back all the watches, rings, and the necklaces
She said I'm takin' full advantage 'cause I'm never stressin'
'Cause I had feelings for this girl that barely owned a residence
Don't get me wrong 'cause it ain't nothing 'bout they money, nigga
I meant to tell you, since a kid, I been gettin' my own figures
I was bringin' in the racks and she was steady shopping
I'm talking big bills, all colors, nigga, Monopoly
I ain't trippin', bitch, I'm sharper than a damn machete
Super different, I even stood out on my own partners
Since a kid, I been a dresser, Thousand Island
I was shittin', my diamonds green, pissy porta-potty, woah (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Bitch talk to me while I'm sleepin', yeah, yeah
Swimmin' in the linen like deep-end, yeah, yeah
All I ever needed was a alibi, yeah, yeah
I don't need a motherfucking reason, yeah
Out of mind, so I keep a pizzy
Everything a hundred, I don't ever leave a fifty, yeah
Did my own half-time, if I was simple
What the fuck you think I'm rich for?
Why you think I'm always talking shit with my hand on my dick?
In the crib, these bitches turned it to a strip show
It's what it is, though
Yeah, yeah, it's what it is, though, yeah, woah
Leave me alone, take your ass home
If it ain't another million, I ain't pickin' up the phone
Phony motherfuckers always sittin' on a throne
All I want's some pussy, baby, give a dog a bone, yeah, yeah
I don't need a lot, but I got a lot
I don't need a lot, but I got a lot, yeah
Two hundred for the whip in the parking lot
Everything cuttin', turn this shit into a barbershop
Swear I'm always shinin', couldn't tell you if it's dark or not
Just a couple things I thought about, yeah, yeah
Life is for the living
Don't sit around on your ass, smokin' grass
That stuff went out a long time ago
Life is for the living
I thought you wanted to see how it could be
When you're in shape and your head plugs into life

Situps and pushups
A-do take energy
And so you run and you swim, at some gym
And then you will agree, that

Life is for the living
Why don't you get up at eight, feelin' so great
Cut out the sweets and start eating three times a day

Life is for the living
I thought you wanted to see how it could be
When you're in shape and your head plugs into

Life is for the living
I thought you wanted to see how it could be
When you're in shape and your head plugs into
Life is for the living
I thought you wanted to see how it could be
When you're in shape and your head plugs into life

Life! Liiiife!
When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to flicker, in the sky
Through the mist of a memory
You wander back to me
Breathing my name, with a sigh
In the still of the night
Once again, I hold you tight
Though you're gone, your love lives on
When moonlight beams

And as long as my heart shall beat
Lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dream

And as long as my heart shall beat
Lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dream
A cigarette butt when you throw it in the water, goes ssth
But the trick but the trick is you shouldn't laugh
Cause if you start laughing you're just a coward
If you start laughing you're just a coward

Everybody wants to live, just once
Everybody's got to see it that way
And see what your life
What your life
What your life can be

There's been songs about celebration
But if you ask me, I can't see why
There's too much pain, too much pain in my heart now
Ooh you're gonna have to prove it to me

Everybody wants to live, just once
Everybody's got to see it that way
And see what your life
What your life
What your life can be
Now some people talk about ecology
Why don't somebody do something about it right now
We're all choking on the air that we breathe now
How could we all just let it slide by?

Everybody wants to live, just once
Everybody's got to see it that way
And see what your life
What your life
What your life can be
Lines, lines around the block
Oh, lines
Now the clock is striking 7:30
Ooh, lines
Lines around the block
Lines, now the clock is striking 8

Walk in, sit down
Previews of the coming show
Now the movie's starting
Oh, the movie's starting kinda slow
But it'll get better

Oh, there's a scene with these two
Oh, he's gonna get her love

He's gonna tell her
She's gonna tell him, too
He's gonna tell her, baby
They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway (on Broadway)
They say there's always magic in the air (on Broadway)
But when you’re walkin' down that street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you’re nowhere (on Broadway)

They say the chicks are something else on Broadway (on Broadway)
But looking at them just gives me the blues (on Broadway)
Cause how ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime?
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes (on Broadway)

They say that I won't last too long on Broadway (on Broadway)
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they say (on Broadway)
But they're dead wrong, I know they are
Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit 'til I'm a star on Broadway (on Broadway)

But they’re dead wrong, I know they are
Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won’t quit 'til I’m a star on Broadway (on Broadway)
On Broadway (on Broadway)
On Broadway (on Broadway)
On Broadway (on Broadway)
On Broadway (on Broadway)
Oh, I love that simple way
People live from day to day
There's a song inside of you
And it gets stronger every day

And it’s trying to say to you
Everything will be alright
That's what we're trying to say to you

Oh, the baseball season’s on
Get your season tickets now
Oh, those athletes work so hard
There's a pitch and the bat goes pow

And it's trying to say to you
Everything will be alright
That's what we're trying to say to you

Batter swings, and the ball goes sailing out in the crowd (out in the crowd)
Round to third, safe at home and the fans start screaming loud:
Baseball's on
Baseball's on
Baseball's on
Baseball’s on
Baseball’s on
Baseball's on

Oh, I love that simple way
People live from day to day
There’s a song inside of you
And it gets stronger every day

And it's trying to say to you
Everything will be alright
That's what we're trying to say to you

[Verse 1]
You've got that smile that only Heaven can make

I'd give my life up for you 'cause you are my dream

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely, girl
'Cause you are the only thing that I got right now

[Chorus]
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you

[Verse 2]
If you had my child (Yodel-lay-ah)
You would make my life complete (Yodel-lay-ah)
Just to have your eyes on little me
That'd be mine forever (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, everything that I have is yours (Oh, everything)
You will never go cold or hungry (Oh)
I'll be there when you're insecure (Insecure)
Let you know that you're always lovely, girl
'Cause you are the only thing that I've got right now

[Chorus]
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you

[Bridge]
We're made for one another (One another), me and you (And you, and you, and you)
And I have no fear, I know we'll make it through
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, whoa-oh

[Chorus]
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us
(Oh-na-na, oh-na-na, oh-na-na)
I'll be standing right next to you
(Oh-na-na, oh-na-na, oh-na-na)
Right next to you
(Oh-na-na, oh-na-na)

[Outro]
You've got that smile that only Heaven can make
I'll pray to God every day to keep you forever

Do you want to go to sleep now?
I’m so tired
You’re so pretty
Please don’t wake me up tomorrow
I’ll be dreaming

You can walk around my bedroom
There’s some candles on the table
One goes in my mouth
The other’s in my eyes
And when you like them
Don’t forget to

Breathe the smoke
Let me choke
Let me float
Upside down
Forever and ever
And ever

Feelings
Go a long way
You’ve been crying
Since last Sunday
And I don’t want it
Don’t want to be free
All I want is
For you to hold me
Change my diaper
Read me stories
Hold my hand and
Make you worry
But you’re rising
On a cloud
Pouring teardrops
Without a sound

So I went down to the bottom
Of the great, great lake
There were hundreds of mothers
They’re waiting for me
And I saw your reflection in my face
That makes me scrub it all around
Until I’m erased

Go away

Choose to ignore blues
Something to get in your way, uh
You choose to stay (You choose to stay)
You choose to stay (You choose to stay)

I want the pussy for free
An arm around me to grieve
A sleep, without sweat and me
My self doubts in a tweet
My mood rests on coffee
Try to understand me
Try to understand me
Nauseas and feeling so weak
Can't smoke if I do not eat
Knees weak at 33
Late nights, but don't text me
Swallow, but want to scream
I want the lifestyle for free

[Verse: Kelsey Lu]
For when she heard the explosion
Her eyes grew wet and wild
She raced through the streets of Birmingham
Calling for her child
She clawed through the bits of glass and brick
Then lifted out a shoe
Oh, here's the shoe my baby wore
But baby, where are you?

[Refrain: Ian Isiah]
My baby, yeah
My baby, where are you?
Oh, oh, oh
My baby, oh, oh-woah
My baby, my baby, where are you? Oh

[Verse]
We address luggage
Was depressed, we protect black women
Keep ya breath, don't project bullshit
Flee the nest, fear of expulsion
Feed the guests, peel them fresh onions
Feet that kept runnin'
See the man tryna split my conscious
But we done handled some bigger monsters
Juanita hands on me irregardless
I had a prayer up with different gods
I know the tapestry is enormous
Patchin' a straw in it
I know the path battle with darkness
I hold a match up and take it all in

[Hook]
Patchin' a straw in it
I know the path battle with darkness

I was frightened when I made it
They called me in
Walked in through the door
They called me weird
Bitch, now I'm a household name

[Chorus]
You've seen the power that I've held
Beauty isn't in the eye of the beholder
It's how you see yourself
You've seen the power that I've held
Now you're about to see what I do next

Every day of my life, yeah
Share the goodness of mercy shall follow me
Every day of my life

[Verse: Dev Hynes]
Naked hot in summertime is messing with my eyes
Time flies when the kush is burning in your eyes
Black skin, white tie, baby came alive
Just in time to recognize your faded alibi
Who will listen when you call? Nobody picks up
Young man, dark tan, blinds tied shut
Pure, clean, dominant, try your luck

[Outro: Aaron Maine]
When I felt it in my head
Just like I remembered it
Then I got away from it
Yeah, just for a little bit
Take a piece out of the tin
Cut a corner off of it
Then I got away from it
Bye, bye
Bye, bye

[Verse 1]
And this is how it starts
You take your shoes off in the back of my van
Yeah my shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back

[Pre-Chorus]
And she said use your hands and my spare time
We’ve got one thing in common, it's this tongue of mine
She's got a boyfriend anyway

[Chorus]
There’s only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to do is talk about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

[Verse 2]
I loved your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face, but I like that cause he still looks cool
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

[Verse 3]
Now we're on the bed in my room
And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say no
You say no
Does he take care of you?
Or could I easily fill his shoes?
But you say no
You say no

[Chorus]
Now we’re just outside of town
And you’re making your way down
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She’s got a boyfriend anyway

[Chorus]
And I'm not trying to stop you, love
If we're gonna do anything we might as well just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She’s got a boyfriend anyway

[Outro]
You've got your tongue pierced anyway
You in your high tops any day
You in your skinny jeans anyway
You and your fit friends anyway
I'd take them all out any day
They've all got back combs anyway
You all got boyfriends anyway

[Verse: MF DOOM]

Yea the whole mask thing
Really ight
Things in my point of view
Starting going to
How things looked like
Opposed what things sound like
Ya know what i mean
Before you didn't know what emcees looked like
When you see em at party rocking
You know so
Most times you em rock at a show
Before you even knew
Know what I'm saying
Before videos pre videos
You know so
You were going off the sound of the record
Straight skills
See once it started getting more publicized
And you know
Once hip hop started getting money making thing
Then you start getting these corporate ideas
Where you want to put what it looks like
To sell what to sounds what it looks like
We dealing with music
So what I did
I came with the angle of
It don't matter what I look like
It don't matter what the artist look like
It's more bout what the artist sound like
Mask really represents the whole rebel
On trying sell a whole human being
More of a sound
At the same time it's something different
You know what I'm saying
It fits with the theme
Of the theme of the rebel of a villain
Where to him
He doesn't care bout the fame none of that shit
That shit has no consequence
You know what i mean
It's more on the message
On what's being said
So it helps people focus more
On what's being said
It's still entertaining it's still like the theater
It has the appeal of you know
Something it can be considered entertaining
That message is still there
That villain represents anybody
Anybody can where the mask
Can be the villain
Male or female any race
So call race
It's about where you coming from
From your heart
What's the message
What you got to say
You know what i mean
That's why i mainly chose to bring the mask
Into the fold

And I'm ready to pimp her, 7 thou' for the Clive Christian
And that's why

[Chorus]
I got me fifty hoes, I'm a young gigolo (Okay)
I got me fifty hoes, I'm a young gigolo (I'ma gigo')
Five-hundred fifty bros and I'm in the middle though (Can't see me)
Didn't go to school too long, but I know the centerfold (Woo)
I got me fifty hoes, I'm a young gigolo (Okay)
I got me fifty hoes, I'm a young gigolo (I'ma gigo')
Five-hundred fifty bros and I'm in the middle though (Can't see me)

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
I got me fifty hoes, I'm a young gigolo (Okay)

Didn't go to school too long, but I know the centerfold (Woo)
I got me fifty hoes, I'm a young gigolo (Okay)
I got me fifty hoes, I'm a young gigolo (I'ma gigo')
Five-hundred fifty bros and I'm in the middle though (Can't see me)
Didn't go to school too long, but I know the centerfold (Woo)
I saw, oh I see
Nothing that is confident to me
Repeat and discreet
Feelings that are not supposed to be
Ooh

Open the door, leave me with arms exposed, oh
Outside, I saw where I belong

What's worse? Ego?
Thinking that it's something that you're owed
2 AM, it's not like it was
Listen to the fears that you hear now (Oh yeah)

Open the door, leave me with arms exposed, oh
Outside, I saw where I belong
Ooh

Obsessed and still stressed
Still stressed and smoke less (Yeah)

So just stick with me
If you know what’s good for you, baby
You will let me teach you a little something
If you know what's good for you, baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Rewind the forces
Take it back to what's, and rewind the forces
Take it back to what’s, and rewind the, rewind the, rewind the forces
Take it back to what's important

[Chorus]
Family scratchin' on the surface when I remind my choices
That I made, take to the grave, it’s really poison
We lift up our voices and holler out
Give me a second, let me settle down, I'm wildin' out
See, that's my problem, always guardin' out

[Pre-Chorus]
Rewind the forces
Take it back to what's, and rewind the forces
Take it back to what's important

[Chorus]
Family scratchin' on the surface when I remind my choices
That I made, take to the grave, it’s really poison
We lift up our voices and holler out
Give me a second, let me settle down, I’m wildin' out
See, that’s my problem, always guardin' out

[Verse]
Devil get up off me 'cause my karma wanna swamp it out
Shovel in my coffin gettin' salty ’cause I'm stronger now
Damn, ain't had this pain since I was little, nigga
Damn, that's why I changed the way I feel, nigga
Been gettin' high with open eyes, and got the same liver
I paid the price to recognize that I'm a made nigga
My baby left me, wasn't careful, got me stressin'
Kinda selfish, had my lessons, always deadly, it's a skill, nigga
I sniped Wesley for chestin' this question
Your blade heaven, then are you destined to mess with
A vampire, don't standby as a passenger, they mad at us
It's satire how they add it up
'Cause I ain't think you really take my breath away
A better day is on the rise
Figure why chase sleep, I'm tryna live a better life
And without you, I feel I'm wastin' time
Self-medicating, self-desperation
You be in my dark thoughts when I'm on vacation
Dev, tell 'em something
Before I sell 'em something
A fairy tale that leads to Hell, I smell the Reaper comin'
You know I'm pissed off, but listen, ain't nothin' funny
My pockets picked on, the love gone, right after fuckin'
I get to lick on, then you cum, right on your tummy
I'm so descriptive, but guess what? We really want it
Flashbacks that I have when I'm thinkin' of ya
I stack bags full of crack just to give you money
Please don't react like a brat, bitch, you know it's nothin'
Still put a gat to your back when I'm sick of lovin'
I'm never cap when I rap, really miss my homies
Can't even nap, damn, I'm trapped, can't you hear me sufferin'?
Seem like you're likin' it, girl, don't be fightin' it
Them Vicodins done got your blinded, dyin', know you're tryin' it
I'm typin' what I'm writin' then recording, hope they buyin' it
Come here, baby, let me cuddle ya
For seven hours, had the power to my heart, and she devoured it
Feelin' crazy, but you lovin' it
Let's take a shower, call a driver to bring you by me for this punishment
See we gon' fuck with no latex, yes
I'm goin' dumb for that make-up sex, I know you feel the same
You broke my trust, bitch, I must confess
Just give me some, and it can even the bet, made it a dirty game
Thought what we had was like a rock, until the top
I never thought that would we drop just like Despot's album
You drown me 'cause you was hot, this heart's poundin'
Repeatedly
Believed you needed me, you feeding me
The sexing with direction, I'm confessin' that it's eatin' me
Alive, I die, correctin' what was killin' me
How do you know when life will choose to fade away?
How do you know if you've been wrong?
Put it down and show you've taken all that fades
Know it'll take too long

And it seems like it's so natural to stay
I say I'm holding on
Would you notice (Would you notice)
If I wrote you something?
Happiness will fade
Happiness will fade
Happiness will fade
Happiness will fade

And it seems like it's so natural to stay
I say I'm holding on, uh, uh
Would you notice (Would you notice)
If I wrote you something?
Happiness will fade
Happiness will fade
Happiness will fade
Happiness will fade
Oh, today

Loose touch and confidence never seems the same
Eyesight stays clearer when selfishness became
Number one and chewing gum, you were afraid
Big mistake in stepping out, nothing good today
Loose touch and confidence never seems the same
Eyesight stays clearer when selfishness became
Number one and chewing gum, you were afraid
Big mistake in stepping out, nothing good today (Today)

Oh, today, today
Today (Today)

[Verse]
Renegade by nature child of the wild
Wrestling with danger right into the arms of the night
Fear ain't going to save you, so run for your life
Let the moment take you right into the arms of the light

[Pre-Chorus]
When thunder roars, the winds will blow
And through the storm, I’ll ride alone

[Chorus]
Walls can't contain me, nothing can chain me
Unbreakable tonight
No tears will I cry, my animal eyes, unbreakable
I'm unbreakable, unbreakable

[Intro: Diddy]
As we proceed to give you what you need
9-5, motherfuckers
Get live, motherfuckers
As we proceed to give you what you need
9-5, motherfuckers
Get live, motherfuckers
As we proceed—

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Who shot ya? Separate the weak from the obsolete
Hard to creep them Brooklyn streets
It’s on nigga—fuck all that bickerin’ beef
I can hear sweat tricklin’ down your cheek
Your heartbeat sound like Sasquatch feet
Thunderin’, shakin’ the concrete
Then the shit stop when I foil the plot
Neighbors call the cops, said they heard mad shots
Saw me in the drop, three and a quarter
Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter
Old school, new school need to learn though
I burn, baby, burn, like “Disco Inferno”
Burn slow like blunts with yayo
Peel more skins than Idaho Potato
The lyrical molesting is taking place
Fucking with B.I.G., it ain’t safe
I make your skin chafe, rashes on them asses
Bumps and bruises, blunts and Land Cruisers
Big Poppa smash fools, bash fools
Niggas mad because I know that cash rules
Everything around me, two Glock 9s
Any motherfucker whispering about mines
And I’m Crooklyn’s finest
You rewind this, Bad Boy’s behind this
Everything around me, two Glock 9s
Any motherfucker whispering about mines
And I’m Crooklyn’s finest
You rewind this, Bad Boy’s behind this

[Interlude: Diddy]
As we proceed to give you what you need
9-5, motherfuckers
Get live, motherfuckers
As we proceed to give you what you need

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
You’ll die slow but calm
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
Brave nigga, turned front page nigga
Brave nigga, turned front page nigga

[Interlude: Diddy]
As we proceed to give you what you need
9-5, motherfuckers
Get live, motherfuckers
As we proceed to give you what you need

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I seen the light excite all the freaks
Stack mad chips, spread love with my peeps
Niggas wanna creep, gotta watch my back
Think the Cognac and indo sack make me slack?
I switches all that, cocksucker G’s up
One false move, get Swiss cheesed up
Clip to TEC, respect I demand it
Slip and break the 11th Commandment
Thou shalt not fuck with nor see Poppa
Feel a thousand deaths when I drop you
I feel for you, like Chaka Khan I’m the don

[Interlude: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Come here, come here
Open your fucking mouth, open your
Didn’t I tell you don't fuck with me?
Huh, didn’t I tell you not to fuck with me?
Look at you now, huh?
Can’t talk with a gun in your mouth, huh?
Bitch-ass nigga, what?
Look at you now, huh?
Can’t talk with a gun in your mouth, huh?
Bitch-ass nigga, what?
What?

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
You’ll die slow but calm
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
Brave nigga, turned front page nigga
Brave nigga, turned front page nigga

[Outro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I smoke the blunts he sips on the Baileys
I smoke the blunts he sips on the Baileys
I smoke the blunts he sips on the Baileys

[Verse 1]
Cripple walks amongst you
All you tired human beings
He's got all the things a cripple has not
Working arms and legs
Vital parts fall from his system
And dissolve in Scottish rain
Vitally, he doesn’t miss them
He's too fucked up to care

[Chorus]
Is that you in front of me?
Coming back for even more of exactly the same
You must be a masochist
To love a modern leper on his last leg, on his last leg

[Verse 2]
I crippled your heart a hundred times
And still can't work out why
See, I’ve got this disease that
I can't shake and I'm just rattling through life
This is how we do things now
This is how the modern stay scared
So I cut out all the good stuff
I cut off my foot to spite my leg

[Chorus]
Is that you in front of me?
Coming back for even more of exactly the same
You must be a masochist
To love a modern leper on his last leg
Well I am ill but I'm not dead
And I don't know which of these I prefer
Because that limb, which I have lost
It was the only thing holding me up, holding me up

[Bridge]
I'm lying on the ground now
And you're walking through the only door
I have lost my eyesight like I said I would
But I still know

[Chorus]
That is you in front of me
Coming back for even more of exactly the same
Well are you a masochist?
To love a modern leper on his last leg
You're not ill, ’cause I’m not dead
Doesn't that make us the perfect pair?
Sit with me, we’ll start again
And you can tell me all about what you did today
What you did today
Today, they mock me
I was thinking of taking it away
Life, fool's gold
I was thinking of fading away

Hanging by a chance
Skipping down the street, in the barrio, waiting
Life on the sand, I was playing
To be staying
Going back and forth
Chasing down the fuse for your stereo
Lighting my fire
Looking for a way to get back home

If I get back to life I will be ready
I will begin again
Most of my life I have been dreaming
So boy, I get it

Oh, my ghost, my love, is a radio
Gone with lies, I was thinking about fading away
Life keeps catching on, I'll be thinking about
All my life I've waited for this moment to choose
I was living up too, that was up in my room
And we're sleeping out of tunes and I cry cry cry
Lonely back home, darling you'll leave my room
Through the hallway soon, I'll be fly fly fly

[Intro]
Stay on my, my mind
My mind, my mind
My mind, my mind
My mind

[Chorus]
You stay on my mind, you stay on my mind
I try to shake you, but you stay on my mind
You stay on my mind, you stay on my mind
I try to shake you, but you stay on my mind
You stay on my mind, you stay on my mind
I try to shake you, but you stay on my mind
You stay on my mind, you stay on my mind
I try to shake you, but you stay on my mind

[Verse]
I been doing so good without you
I can't say I don't think about you
Don't miss all the times that we shared
Sometimes, I feel like you just don't care
I always come back, you always right there
Don't really want you, you don't play fair
No love here, won't shed a tear
Feel so good, I got real fears
I can't feel shit and you take advantage of that
What's the deal with me? Keep it real with me
Try to chill with me, why you still with me?

[Bridge]
We both know we got our own thing goin' on
We both know we got our own thing goin' on
We both know when we link up, we stay 'til the morning
We both know when we link up, we stay 'til the morning

[Chorus]
You stay on my mind, you stay on my mind
I try to shake you, but you stay on my mind
You stay on my mind, you stay on my mind
I try to shake you, but you stay on my mind
You stay on my mind, you stay on my mind
I try to shake you, but you stay on my mind
You stay on my mind, you stay on my mind
I try to shake you, but you stay on my mind

[Intro]
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

[Verse 1]
I picked you up with a cowboy nod at the hotel bar
It was less than eight seconds, girl, you stole my heart
We had drinks and smokes, played your songs on guitar
I was crazy out the gate and you were wild from the start
You hopped in my Bronco and we had the time of our life
We've come a long way since then, girl
But it's been one hell of a ride

[Chorus]
Love is like a rodeo, tryna see how far we go
After one touch, became obsessed with the rush
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall, but we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

[Verse 2]
Girl, there's something kind of dangerous about the way you move
I knew it wouldn't be easy hanging on to you
'Cause when you hit the light, put your lips on mine
It gets hotter than a Houston night

[Chorus]
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, tryna see how far we go
After one touch, became obsessed with the rush
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall, but we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

[Bridge]
You hopped in my Bronco
And we had the time of our life (The time of our life)
We've come a long way since then, girl
But it's been one hell of a ride (One hell of a ride)

[Chorus]
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, tryna see how far we go
After one touch, became obsessed with the rush
Yeah, love is like a rodeo, I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall, but we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

[Outro]
I picked you up with a cowboy nod at the hotel bar
It was less than eight seconds, girl, you stole my heart
Rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

[Verse 1]
Step in, you can step right in any time you like
Run, ride, you can have your bike when you've known what you like
But that don't mean each petal stays green if the sun decides to hide
Well, I won't ask forever, but at least I'll ask tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Where the fog was green, the party screamed
For the man who played the carol
When the chorus rang, I fled the rain
And fell into my pride

[Chorus]
Where I've been lifting the end of an empty beach
Living my life full catastrophe
Holding a rose to the end of a gun
Trying to do it alone

[Verse 2]
Step in, you can step right in any time you like
Tread light, you can ride your bike where you've known that you like
But that don't mean that heaven stays thinking of anyone besides
Well, I won't ask forever but at least I'll ask tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Where the fog was green, the party screamed
At the man who played the carol
When the chorus rang, I sang the scene
The only way I've known to fight

[Chorus]
Where I've been lifting the end of an empty beach
Living my life full catastrophe
Holding a rose to the end of a gun
Trying to do it alone
Where I've been lifting the end of an empty beach
Living my life full catastrophe
Holding a rose to the end of a gun
Trying to do it alone
Well don't come 'round here
Looking for me when your eyes turn me to stone

[Verse 1]
You say it's not going to be that hard
I can tell you I've got to lift up this whole whirlwind
To tell you how it feels coming back

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I'm back right on top again
And this world's trying to push me down
Well if it's down where it wants to be for me
I'm coming up

[Chorus]
Well don't come 'round here
Looking for me when your eyes turn me to stone

[Verse 2]
Well I've been told over and over
Well now that's too bad
I can tell you I've got a pocket full of tricks
For those of you who don't quite know what I'm going through

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I've been awfully sure again
That this world's trying to push me down
Well if it's down where it wants to be for me
I'm coming up

[Chorus]
Well don't come 'round here
Looking for me when your eyes turn me to stone
Well don't come 'round here
Looking for me when your eyes turn me to stone

My love for your love grows infinite and wide

[Verse 1]
Last night in the fog
I let out a stray
Thinking all along
"What a wonderful things that are soon to come my way!"
Last night after all
It's hard to believe
There were times I felt I could really be free

[Chorus]
Broken-hearted, barely started, kick up the dust
Oh what’s gone wrong since we parted?
Lost in it always, still moving up and o'er
Well sometimes we lose a little honey from the comb
Well sometimes we lose a little honey from the comb

[Verse 2]
Last night in the fog
I made a new start
Well I hope that I can stick it out long enough
Though there'll be times we fall apart
Last night after a hard work day
I lit a fire and let the music play
Well you can rap but you can’t rock
A little chimmy like me

[Chorus]
Broken-hearted, barely started, turn off the lights
Well tomorrow's uncharted
Lost in it always, still moving up and o'er
Well sometimes we lose a little honey from the comb
Well sometimes we lose a little honey from the comb

[Verse 1]
Ay-ay-ay, there's a magic boy
Sitting on the front steps near his dad’s old Mustang Ford
Where a love that used to live ain't anymore
Ay-ay-ay, goes the magic boy

[Chorus]
Taking the heat on, of a West Texas July
Burning the freeway in with the dusty night
Home in his new Ford, everything that's left too fast
Not meant to last

[Verse 2]
Ay-ay-ay, there’s the magic boy
Sitting on the front steps of old hook and letter four
Wooden fires out in a heart one once adored
Ay-ay-ay, goes the magic boy

[Chorus]
Taking the heat on, of a West Texas July
Burning the freeway in with the dusty night
Home in his new Ford, everything that's left too fast
Not meant to last

[Verse 3]
Taking his top down, he put a star on scenic drive
Cooling his hands from the rusty firefight
One of these days everything that's left too fast
Will come back at last
Will come back at last

[Intro: Jazze Pha]

Turns me on, oh (Come here)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Hand over your heart if you in love, baby
Kissin' on your body 'til you can't take it
Silencer on the gun, I'm locked and loaded
Pedal to the metal, foot down and floor it
I won't say shit 'cause you hard-headed
As long as we together, whippin' it, ah yeah
Girl, ain't nobody doin' it like papi chulo (Oh-whoa)
It's a fiesta, pollo dresser when we're together (Oh, na, na)

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Ain't no disco, Snoopadellic
With the cryptocash on me, you could smell it (Smell it)
Now breathe it in, wait to exhale, now breathe again
You smell like money, dressed to kill
Wave my wand, we can disappear
In a Cadillac spaceship
Over the hills and palm trees to the Matrix, C.B

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let them tell it, you be actin' funny, babe (Oh)
Do good for yourself and get your money, baby (Oh)
Gon' and put it down (Hey)
What you do is (Ladies)
It really turned me on (On)
Turns me on, ooh
It really turns me on (Oh)
Turns me on, oh (Come here)

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]

Haha, yeah

Chris Brown, Snoop Dogg, oh, ooh
Ah dah dat dat dat, dah dah dat dat
Dah dah dat dat dah

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Verse 2: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie, Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3

Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Verse 1]
I just wanna drink you up
Pour you in a silver cup
You know I like to party
But you know I love your body
So many things I shouldn't do
I hate myself for hurting you
Honestly, I'm reckless
I'm sorry if I'm selfish

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you get too close I run, I run away
And every time you say the words, I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginning, really wish that I could change
I do, I do, I do

[Chorus]
I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

[Verse 2]
Sorry I'm a little scared
But no one ever really cared
I took you for granted
Just a big misunderstanding
I just want to spend the night
Sleeping in your bed tonight
Or watch a little TV
I love it when you need me

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you get too close I run, I run away (I run away)
And every time you say the words I don't know what to say (Say)
Back, back to the beginning, really wish that I could change
I do, I do, I do

[Bridge]
(Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh), I do
(Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh), I do
(Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh), I do
(Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh), I do
I blame it on your love
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I blame it on your love, I do

[Chorus]
I blame it on your love
Every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love
I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do

[Outro]
I blame it on your love
I blame it on your love

[Intro]
Ooh
Na-na, yeah

[Verse 1]
I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

[Verse 2]
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

[Chorus]
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day (So)

[Verse 3]
I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better

[Chorus]
Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

[Chorus]
Save your tears for another day
Ooh, girl, I said (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

[Outro]
Save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

[Part I: Godzilla]

[Intro]
Dear ones, we are looking to bring you enlightenment
To offer illumination in stormy skies
We are here as beings of light
Benevolent, invested in humanity and her evolution

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Turned to a Mothra, bro, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Phantom of the opera, it goes where it goes
My nightmares still haunt me (Dream)
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me (Ooh)
And my nightmares, they haunt me (Ooh ooh)
But I won't let 'em get the best of me (Yeah)

[Part II: Alien]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Alien, magical, flyin', and all
Being, I got her signed on
Beam me up, I'm 'bout to sign off
Dumber now, need to take time off
Dumber now, I don't believe the time
Should have gone, man, I believe they lyin' (Get a mic, huh)
Sign, do you believe in science?
Bigger sign, bet they gon' bleed now

[Verse: Kanye West]
Aliens, double to sign off
Better time, 'bout to take time off
I don't believe in time, I just believe in science
Order a bleeding nine, tell her, "Don't leave tonight"
Alien, being 'bout to fly out
Took her out, order her something with eyes out
They was done, we the one, we just on
Louis thong, Lebanon, we become, what they done?
Duh-na-na, duh, feel it, feel it, feel it
This ain't our planet, that's why I kill it
Kill it, animals, kill it, ozone, kill it
Blood, spill it, somethin' you deal with
Alien, took the time off, I just took time off
Fly up, a pyramid, dunked on, Vesuvius
No bro, serious, I'm dead, serious

[Intro]
Bi-itch
Yeah, now we gonna talk about these hoes for a minute (talk about these, let's talk about these hoes)

[Refrain]

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Bitch, why you looking at my dick?
Acting like you wanna blow a dick
Yeah, I know he know a bitch
Got my homie, and we all out to get laid
Seen this bitch on stage
Live, right, get it goin', don't stop
Panties drop, hit the floor
Don't act like you new to this hoe, I seen you before
Yeah, you don't remember me, cause I ain't have no loot
Now bitch, you tryna act cute
Pull up your skirt, do it like it's ’sposed be done
Ain’t no fun if the homies can't have none
And after we get to ya, get with ya
Get through ya, stick dick to ya
Got my niggas in here motivated
Heated, gang related

[?], and it’s like this

[?] bitch

[Verse 2: Daz]
This is for my homeboys
Let's show 'em how we get-get down
Show 'em how we -get down
Show ’em how we beat it to the beat of Tha Pound
Don't mind, it's just a pimp thang
Money with me every time, it's a grip thang
Short and simp' thang, get it like you want it
With the shake of Dogg on it
Go on do it like you want it
Baby lick it good-
Hip, big tits, shit's so thick
Baby flossin' that kitty, I ain't bullshittin' bitch
Go on, do what ya gotta do, baby lick it so tend'

[Chorus: Snoop]
Do ya see what I see? (hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (see 'em, turn 'em out)
Do ya see what I see? (hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (when you see 'em, turn 'em out)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Trip, now Daz, Luke, Kurupt, and Snoop
Come bangin' all the hoes in ya muthafuckin' group
It's a shame, how my game
Gon' get that pussy for me in a minute mane
There's hoes all over this place, I bumped a hoe from Atlanta
Named Nevanah, and I, ran a, plan up
That I had designed for another bitch named Savannah
Man I, had a lot of hoes in my lifespan
Even had a bitch from Iran named Jan
Not to mention Japan, I had a tight-eyed hoe with dough
Ya know? Fo' sho'
Now ya know I can bump 'em
So when they get out of line I won't hesitate to dump 'em
Cause I was taught not long ago
In order to gain a hoe, you gotta lose a hoe
That's why my stable, keeps me able
To buy nice cars, homes, and cables
Gangsta haters, a question for y'all
Why yo' bitch paws in my draws, holding on my balls?

[Bridge: Kurupt]
You act like you don't do it
But you know ain't nuthin' to it
Don't play like you ain't been through it
Fit to blow dick like ain't nuthin' to it

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
One for the money, two for the hoes
Seen 'em all coming, they coming in rows
Bitches ain't shit, so I suppose
Your bitch is different, in different clothes
Hell nah she ain't, she's just an average hoe
That gives the average dick the average blow
Don't play, don't look at me that way
Don't switch, I know a bitch when I see a bitch
I know a hoe when I see a hoe
DPG done get blowed in some 

[?]

[Verse 5: Daz]
Baby sit back, with your bad self
You ain't never ever had a piece of ass n'em
Once you get it butt-nekkid get to mackin' 'em
And she worked it on a nigga so 

[?]
I get nasty, when you least expect
Get fine drunk hoes to get butt-nekkid
We don't be trippin' when walk inside the club
Find me a freak by the name of love
She love, wants a girl that like that dick
Plus like that clique and like freaky shit
You wonder why we bring these hoes
These types of clothes, so we suppose
Spit this game, once you think you know it
These freaky hoes is good to go

[Chorus: Snoop]
Do ya see what I see? (there's some hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (if ya see 'em, turn 'em out)
Do ya see what I see? (there's some hoes in this house)
All I see is pussy (if ya see 'em, turn 'em out)

[Verse 6: Snoop]
Man, this nigga right back in the club looking for some love
Standing at the bar with a pocket full of dubs
Paying some bitch, to make your dick get hard
Cause you's a muthafuckin' trick
I gets, niggas like you's on the regular
Send a hoe at ya, then look at ya
Right where I want ya at
Make sure you won't get no get-back
I learned from the best pimps in the game
I got hoes all over, my best hoe's Nova
I know ya tried to come over
And get at her, it really didn't matter
I had her, ready to cock back the hammer
And jam her, 9-double-M in your face
While you dance to the boogie of the bass
You chase hoes, I place hoes in they place, nigga

[Outro]
Now let me tell you som' right, a lot of niggas don't understand (nah they don't understand) how real pimps and real players handle their shit (they don't understand, know what I'm talkin' about)
Ya know, aye, me and my man, Dogg (tell 'em), you know we just puttin' hoes in they place, we pimpin' hoes (pimpin' hoes), laying hoes down (slamming Cadillac doors)
You know, a hoe is gonna be a hoe (hoe gon' be a hoe)
Some of y'all niggas don't understand that (yo' hoe be a hoe, let the hoe be a hoe fool)
So, so don't act like you don't do it (cause you know ain't nuttin' to it), cause you know ain't nuttin' to it
Just like we said, aye, hoes gon' be hoes (lay yo' bitch down, lay yo' bitch down, lay yo' bitch down, yuh, yuh), niggas gon' be niggas
We gon' get ours
Aye, y'all hoes gon' be mad

[Refrain: Snoop Dogg]

Just get on down if ya wanna get funky (just get up, get up, get up)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Break it down like, and make it sound like
I'm about to spin, begin it, jump in the mix
Just to keep you in a fix for 1996
Just to do the thangs that I'm normally doin'
It's Snoop Dogg, I'm on the mic and I'm still here pursuin'
I'm climbing the charts, breaking hearts up the way
Just to do the thangs like I do back in the day
I make my pay the same way, I'm on the same type of mission
Leaving niggas in the cold, man I got a story told
Rolled, no need to fold up ya paper yet
I got the music, so use it, to get ya neck wet
I catch ya slippin', dippin', now my  flippin'
Got the whole crowd saying: "boy, bow-wow terrific"
As I kick it, as I'm supposed to
Get you in a twist, and twist like I wants to
And get ya up out ya ways, as the record plays
Put on a little something from back in the days

[Chorus]
We are party people
Dogg Pound Gangstas are party people (ya know, ya know, they say)
We are party people
Dogg Pound Gangstas are party people

Well just get on down

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now, it makes me wanna get up
It makes me wanna sit up
I got the joint in my hand
I light it, now it's lit up
Now I'm 'bouts to write a, better yet, I writ a
It's Snoop up on the microphone and now I'm getting rid of
All these sucka emcee's who be clogging the game up
I'm back on the block but I ain't come with the same stuff
I sacked it up differently, in fact, specifically
Game so cold it left Jack Frost' nose froze
Now, you knows and I knows how the story goes
All the ladies say "hey" and the niggas say "ho"
While they sippin' on a 100 proof
All my niggas in the VIP boo, hollin' "woof"
Cause Snoop is back, back like Return of The Jedi
Nigga don't say shit, cause I
Already said I, be on the red-eye
Ya fat, ya black, ya wack, yo' style is tore up
Plus you got one dead eye
We move mountains and we rain like fountains
Make so much paper we need four accountants
So keep bouncing, bouncing, bouncing
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all

[Chorus]
We are party people
Dogg Pound Gangstas are party people (I said)
We are party people
Dogg Pound Gangsta are party people
Party people

According to my birth certificate, I turn 30 this year. It's weird because part of me still feels 18 and part of me feels 283, but the actual age I currently am is 29. I've heard people say that your thirties are "the most fun!" So I'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when I know. But until then, I thought I'd share some lessons I've learned before reaching 30, because it's 2019 and sharing is caring.

Lesson 1

I learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you aren’t, how you’re failing, or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments off on my posts. That way, I’m showing my friends and fans updates on my life, but I’m training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that I look 🔥🔥🔥. I’m also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to “go die in a hole ho” while I’m having my coffee at nine in the morning. I think it’s healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it, especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment I received once.

Lesson 2

Being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your life’s worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you. Grow a backbone, trust your gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake—only bite if someone steps on you.

Lesson 3

Trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal. It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture (you had to give me one moment of bitterness, come on). BUT THAT SAID, it’s good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. It’s especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. That’s GOOD. We’ll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. That’s not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe you’ll learn from it. Then you’ll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But it’s fine; do you, you’re searching.

Lesson 4

I learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day.

Lesson 5

Banish the drama. You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you, or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number isn’t cruel. It’s just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it.
Lesson 6

I’ve learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we aren’t allowed to age. It’s an impossible standard to meet, and I’ve been loving how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women we’re supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn’t even remotely required of men.

Lesson 7

My biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I’ve ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I’ve witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.

Lesson 8

I learned not to let outside opinions establish the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was “couples goals” based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isn’t real. For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want.

Lesson 9

I learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimm’s cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because…2016.

Lesson 10

I’ve always cooked a LOT, but I found three recipes I know I’ll be making at dinner parties for life: Ina Garten’s Real Meatballs and Spaghetti (I just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat), Nigella Lawson’s Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Oliver’s Chicken Fajitas with Molé Sauce. Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer. I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head. (Which is what I’m pretty sure the internet would call a “weird flex.”)

Lesson 11

Recently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if I’d hung things that way all along. This is not an ad. I just really love Command tape.

Lesson 12
Apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, it’s so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say “I’m sorry, but...” and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships.

Lesson 13

It’s my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying “This happened to me.” It’s something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don’t.

Lesson 14

When tragedy strikes someone you know in a way you’ve never dealt with before, it’s okay to say that you don’t know what to say. Sometimes just saying you’re so sorry is all someone wants to hear. It’s okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you don’t have all the answers. However, it’s not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your support is all someone needs when they’re at their lowest point. Even if you can’t really help the situation, it’s nice for them to know that you would if you could.

Lesson 15

Vitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy.

Lesson 16

Before you jump in headfirst, maybe, I don’t know...get to know someone! All that glitters isn’t gold, and first impressions actually aren’t everything. It’s impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them (I call it a “solid first 15”), but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest, self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show up for you when you need them? Do they still love you after they’ve seen you broken? Or after they’ve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if they’re people? These are things a first impression could never convey.

Lesson 17

After my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner (DO NOT DO IT), I felt like I needed to start being nicer to my skin. I now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because, why can’t I be soft during all the seasons?!

Lesson 18

Realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone. It’s important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them.
Lesson 19

Playing mind games is for the chase. In a real relationship or friendship, you’re shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it. No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize how you feel. This is real life, not chess.

Lesson 20

Learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about “we’re in our young twenties!” hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they’ll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It’s sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you’ll always keep the memories.

Lesson 21

Fashion is all about playful experimentation. If you don’t look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, you’re doing it wrong. See: Bleachella.

Lesson 22

How to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are you’re not trying to hurt the person you love and they aren’t trying to hurt you. If you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from, there’s a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who “won” the fight. I know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say “Hey, same team.” Find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built. They don’t give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers.

Lesson 23

I learned that I have friends and fans in my life who don’t care if I’m #canceled. They were there in the worst times and they’re here now. The fans and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up. I’ll never forget the ones who stuck around.

Lesson 24

I’ve had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. It’s taught me that there are real problems and then there’s everything else. My mom’s cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now.

Lesson 25

I remember people asking me, “What are you gonna write about if you ever get happy?” There’s a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I’m really grateful to have learned this isn’t true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool.

Lesson 26

I make countdowns for things I’m excited about. When I’ve gone through dark, low times, I’ve always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app (they’re free) and adding things I’m looking forward to. Even if they’re not big holidays or anything, it’s good to look toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and it’s good to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things.

Lesson 27

I learned that disarming someone’s petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. In my experience, I’ve come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than I’ve ever felt in my life, but I can’t tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans. It’s the Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a troll’s hateful Instagram comment with “lol.” It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all I’ll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it.

Lesson 28

I’m finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I’m going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year.

Lesson 29

I learned that your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair and now it is STRAIGHT. It’s the straight hair I wished for every day in junior high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, they’ve left me. Please pray for their safe return.

Lesson 30

My mom always tells me that when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because I would punish myself even worse. I’d lock myself in my room and couldn’t forgive myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel I’ve made a mistake, whether it’s self-imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating. I’ve come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone. Step into the daylight and let it go.

That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him

[Bridge]
All of my life

To love me like I love you
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?

[Verse 3]
Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
Go with him

Can't run around, 'cause I'm not free
Whoa, oh, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah

[Bridge 1]
I wanna tell you, pretty baby
I think you're fine
I'd like to love you

Chains of love
Chains of love

[Verse 1]
I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I—I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

[Verse 2]
Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

[Bridge]
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more—misery

[Chorus]
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

[Verse 3]
I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I—I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

And I'm always thinking of you

Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 3: George Harrison]
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (Woo)
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two

[Verse 4: George Harrison]
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (Woo)

[Verse 5: George Harrison]
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 6: George Harrison]
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

[Outro: George Harrison]
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

[Verse 1]
There—
There's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

[Verse 2]
I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"

[Bridge]
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so

[Verse 3]
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

There's a place
There's a place
There's a place

[Chorus]
If you my dawg, then nigga, my dawg
Then we gon' get money together
You go through a trial, you duckin' the law
So fuck it, we duck 'em together
When shit gettin' wild and you kill a nigga
We bury the shovel together

I got you through every endeavor

[Verse 1]
I got you through every endeavor
Fuckin' with you through whatever and ever
'Cause we were freezin' in the cold, my nigga
And we were starvin' in the desert together
And you was quick to pull a Desi whenever
So I was quick to pull the lever whenever
And we was down to bust maneuvers
If you pump fakin', we blockin' the hesi together
I'm whippin' a four in the five, my nigga
These bitches blowin', goin' live
My nigga, we came up out the situation
Niggas sayin' we was supposed to cut the ties with niggas
And I was tryna coincide with 'em
But he trippin' so I let the .9 hit him
If he trippin' on me, I can lie with him
Movin' different on me, I should slide on him
Nigga, I don't take no pills or the Perc'
My piss got Ts on me
We duckin' hoes and the Ds on me
I can't let these hoes put no disease on me
I'm a real nigga from the streets
Homie, I'ma pull up to the top, nigga
Niggas hate to see you when you real
Gettin' and you get it off
For all you dawgs, nigga, I'ma keep shit real

[Chorus]
If you my dawg, then nigga, my dawg
Then we gon' get money together
You go through a trial, you duckin' the law

I got you through every endeavor
If you my dawg, then nigga, my dawg
Then we gon' get money together
You go through a trial, you duckin' the law
So fuck it, we duck 'em together
When shit gettin' wild and you kill a nigga
We bury the shovel together
I got you forever and ever
I got you through every endeavor

[Verse 2]
Through every endeavor
It don't matter the weather, whenever
It's a reason niggas still level together
Pot of gold, we set 'em together
Never settle, we get to the cheddar
No intention of dissin' you ever
We did it together, we better than ever
If a waitress a 100, then you throw a 50
My nigga, we better together
Met that bitch, fucked the walls in it
I'ma a beast, shawty, I'ma dog in it
I can't fall for it, but I fall in it
She a dog with it and she stay shadin'
And I play the game
But lil' mama know a nigga ball in it
I be smokin' pussy like a backwood
Or I'm raws in it, I be gone in it
It's me and my dawgs
Knowin' it's a lot of fuck niggas hatin' on me
Yeah, niggas love seein' me fall
Knowin' I can't fuck no lil' bitty bitches
I have bitches screenin' my call
Know it's a lot of y'all seein' me ball
'Cause if he my dawg, then the nigga gon' shoot it out with me, no legal involved (Yo Tory!)

[Chorus]
If you my dawg, then nigga, my dawg
Then we gon' get money together
You go through a trial, you duckin' the law

When shit gettin' wild and you kill a nigga
We bury the shovel together

I got you through every endeavor
If you my dawg, then nigga, my dawg
Then we gon' get money together
You go through a trial, you duckin' the law
So fuck it, we duck 'em together
When shit gettin' wild and you kill a nigga
We bury the shovel together
I got you forever and ever
I got you through every endeavor, yeah

[Chorus]
(She's got the devil in her heart)
But her eyes, they tantalize
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me

So important to me
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me

No, no, this I can't believe

Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so

Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe

[Verse 1]
Eight tiny lines of cocaine
Left on a copy machine
In an empty corner of a dream
My sleep could not complete

[Verse 2]
There are sirens in the birds
And you and I are too far apart
And my eyes need a shave
What else can go wrong?

[Chorus]
Now that I'm not longed for
Wild life seems wrong
Won't care
Won't stare
You've got family out there

[Verse 3]
The silver black boot
It cracked my front tooth
It's a new kind of truth
I'm getting used to

[Chorus]
Come back lonely
How sad, if only
Don't believe you don't care
You've got family out there

[Verse 4]
Where the power lines are down
Whipping sparks around
Like angels touching down
I see you there

[Chorus]
How sad, if only
Don't believe you don't care
You've got family out there
You've got family out there

[Chorus: Ant Clemons & Kanye West]
Did you ever think of a dream too big to imagine?
Follow your passion, one day you'll face
The law of attraction, be careful what you ask for
Means I got what I asked for, exactly what I asked for

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Put a stack on it, huh, put a MAC on it, huh
In the black on it, huh, bullet tracks on it, huh
And I'm black on ‘em, huh, and we back on ‘em, huh
On a map on ‘em, huh, got a stack on ‘em, oh
Hunnid thou’ on it, huh, hunnid stacks on it, huh
Hunnid been-backs on it, huh, to the max on it, huh
Dealin’ facts on it, huh, now my facts on it, huh
On the dacts on it, huh, all the facts on it, huh

[Chorus: Ant Clemons & Kanye West]
Did you ever think of a dream too big to imagine?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
The world is up for seizin', there's somethin' for a reason
They just talk, don’t read it, I lead on some, nah, don’t lead it
More or so, what you leave with? I got somethin' for you to leave with
What they tell 'em, don't believe it
Tell me what you believe in, tell me what you believe in
Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto, we in a game, we in a game
Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto, we all the same, we all the same
Money ain't real, time ain't real, money ain't real, time ain't real
Money ain't real, time ain't real, guess to what, you never get killed

[Chorus: Ant Clemons & Kanye West]
Did you ever think of a dream too big to imagine?

[Verse 1]
My friends keep saying I'm in love
When  they saw you kiss me on the cheek
Now  everybody thinks you're my girl, oh yeah
If it's alright with you, then it's alright with me

[Chorus]
So can I take a little walk with you?
Maybe  after school, and talk to you
Oh,  baby
The very first time is still on my mind
When  we kissed, you had sugar on your lips
Can I walk with you on the avenue and talk to you?
Oh, baby (Oh)
The very first time that you were on my mind
When  we kissed, you had sugar on your lips

[Verse 2]
I can't wait 'til the school bell rings at three
Ooh, no
To pick up some of your favorite candy
Oh, baby
If I had one wish, I would wish it on you
'Cause you're so fine
Today is my dream come true, so

[Chorus]
Can I take a little walk with you?
Maybe after school, and talk to you
Oh, baby (Oh, girl)
The very first time is still on my mind

Oh, baby (Girl)
The last time you blew my mind, now I know why
You had sugar on your lips (Yeah)

[Bridge]
My heart starts beating fast every time I see you, girl
If I had my way, it would be you kissin' me

[Interlude]
Listen, baby girl
I just wanna say to you
I still remember the day
When you were standin' in front of the school with your friends
I know you special
'Cause when you went to kiss me goodbye
I couldn't even wipe the sugar off my lips

[Chorus]
Can I take another walk with you?
Maybe after school, and talk to you, yeah
Oh, baby
The very first time is still on my mind
When we kissed, you had sugar on your lips
Can I take another walk with you on the avenue and talk to you, baby?
Oh, baby (Oh, girl)
'Cause last time, you blew my mind
When we kissed, you had sugar on your lips (Ooh yeah)

[Outro]
I don't know what I'm feelin', girl
But I know that I can't help myself (Oh, baby)
And I don't care what nobody says
But I hope that you're not with nobody else (You had sugar on your lips)
I can't even do my homework
'Cause I'm always thinkin' of you (Oh, baby)
And I love your hair and the clothes you wear
You got sugar on your lips
Oh
I just wanna kiss you

[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh-woah 
Right  Now Sounds
Woah, yeah

[Chorus]
Last  time, you took me back but

I  know I can't hide the truth, no
Last time, you took me back but (Yeah)
This time, I guessed I messed up
She told me, "Nice try"
I  know I can't hide the truth, ooh

[Verse 1]
We could play for keeps
But you won't keep what you don't need
But you can take it or leave it, huh
You can take me or leave it

[Pre-Chorus]
Been through it one time, there won't be a next time
Whatever it takes for me to get you to open up
Why did I let you close enough? Enough
Been through it once time, there won't be a next time
Whatever it takes for me to get you to open up
Why did I let you close enough? Enough

[Chorus]
Last time, you took me back but
This time, I guessed I messed up
She told me, "Nice try"
I know I can't hide the truth, no
Last time, you took me back but (Yeah)

Been through it once time (Yeah), there won't be a next time
Whatever it takes for me to get you to open up (Ow)
Why did I let you close enough? Enough

[Chorus]
Last time, you took me back but
This time, I guessed I messed up (Ooh-woah)
She told me, "Nice try"
I know I can't hide the truth, no (Ow!)
Last time, you took me back but (Yeah)
This time, I guessed I messed up
She told me, "Nice try"
I know I can't hide the truth, ooh

[Verse 1]
I wish you would have smiled in the bakery
Or sat on a tatty settee
At a mutual friend's gathering
And the more you keep on looking, the more it's hard to take
Love, we're in stalemate
To never meet is surely where we're bound
There's one in every town
Just there to grind you down

[Verse 2]
I wish I would have seen you in the post office
Well, maybe I did and I missed it
Too busy with the mind on clever lines
Why not the rounders pitch or the canteen?
You're slacking, love, where have you been?
Just had to go and wait until tonight

[Bridge]
To give me the invite
Don't worry, it's alright

[Verse 3]
I wish I would have seen you down in the arcade
Sipping on a lemonade
In the paper cup and chewing on the straw
And I wish I'd seen you in the bakery
But if I'd seen you in the bakery
You probably wouldn't have seen me

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Arian Foster]
Well, um‚ I mean‚ you still got a good relationship with him today?
Me and Suge cool as a motherfucker
I'm cool with Suge‚ I'm cool with Master P, Dr. Dre, I'm cool with everybody
Yeah‚ I mean, how could you not be cool with Snoop?
But I had to go get that cool with him
I had to go sit down with Suge

[Verse: Snoop Dogg]
On Crip, that was my nigga
18 years old‚ lost and locin'
Crack money had a nigga open
Hopin' that that rap shit wasn't just cap shit
G'd up, no Dre, okay that's cool
But that's old news to niggas like us
'Cause if so, he would've signed us off top
But bro stayed solid so I'ma stay solid to that
Studio every night to the early morn'
Bloods and Crips all moving on one accord, cuz did that
Took Death Row to the top, my buz did that
Caught that case, came out safe, Bloods did that (Suwoop)
So through the ups and the downs
Real ones know not to kick niggas when they down
Especially when we was down, that nigga picked niggas up
Gangbang on NY stages, hit niggas up (Death Row)
Y'all remember that? (Yup)
Yeah, he did some bullshit, I'm admitting that
But coming at a real Crip like he ain't one
Especially when he helped fucking make one
On the dead homies, I was at the motherfucking top
When I hit my nigga up and said, "You need to grab 'Pac"
Told Daz, "Hook him up," brought straight up out the box
Here's the gang, here's the beats, here's the keys, here's the locks
Then he hit them niggas (Yes, sir), it was us, cuz
Look around, it still is just us, cuz (Yeah)
Dre rich, Nate gone, and Ricky too
And look at me, shit, I'm 'bout to turn 50 soon
You always said I'd be a star in the game
Now I got a star on the fucking Walk of Fame (Yes, sir)
I hopped out and C-walked on my star on the fuckin' Walk of Fame
In that motherfucking Death Row chain, nigga

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
I know you seen that
A lot of motherfuckers don't know
Shit, nigga, we been cool
This man changed my life
Shit, nigga, we made history together
I'm talking about real history, nigga, like
When they write the history books they gonna look at this shit like
The Great Depression
You know, the stock exchange
This shit is historic, man
Death Row Records, man, we did that shit, nigga
Suge Knight, real nigga, man
Think about all the great shit you did, nigga
Let bygones be bygones
Yeah, what up, Dre?
Daz, Kurupt, what up though?
Lady of Rage, RBX, D.O.C
Nate Dogg, rest in peace
Ricky Harris, rest in peace
DJ Warren G, Dr. Dre
City of Compton, City of Long Beach
Death Row Records will go down in history, nigga
We did that, yeah, nigga, we did that
Done

[Verse 1]
I know I do this every time
I walk the line, I play with fire
And I stop myself before the crime
I walk the line, yeah, I play with fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna push you way too much
I don't wanna lean that way too far
I don't wanna ever learn the hard way

[Chorus]
But if you're looking for stable, that'll never be me
If you're looking for faithful, that'll never be me
If you're looking for someone to be all that you need
That'll never be me
(Hard as I try)
That'll never be me
(I play with fire)

[Verse 2]
Dry your tears now, don't you cry
I'm by your side, at least for a while
I know I do this every time
I walk the line, yeah, I play with fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna push you way too much
I don't wanna lean that way too far
I don't wanna ever learn the hard way, no
I don't wanna keep you in the dark
I don't wanna gamble with your heart
I don't wanna ever leave you lonely

[Chorus]
But if you're looking for stable, that'll never be me
If you're looking for faithful, that'll never be me
If you're looking for someone to be all that you need
That'll never be me
(Hard as I try)
That'll never be me
(I play with fire)

[Bridge]
Can't get too close to the sun (Fire)
Baby, you're the only one, oh, I
I'd never lie to you, baby, oh (Fire)
You give me a reason to run from the fire
'Cause baby, you're the only one
Oh, I swear I'd never lie

[Chorus]
If you're looking for stable, that'll never be me
But I hope that I'm able to be all that you need
If you think that I'm someone to give up and leave
That'll never be me, no
If you think that I'm someone to give up and leave
That'll never be me
(Hard as I try)
That'll never be me, no
(I play with fire)
That'll never be me

[Verse 1]
Off the meds, off the head
Niggas soft as bread, niggas soft as bread
Stay off them blogs, they play with y'all thoughts
Made a way from my dawgs that ain't say what they saw
Only the brave, they want us locked in the cage
If you owe me money, I shouldn't have to remind you to pay
Vacheron with my Ralph Lauren
How this bitch a full time leech and still beg on the side?
Off the meds, can't get out of the bed
Paparazzi waitin' like that mall on the Dawn of the Dead
I don't know you, my dawg, step away from the bus
Know they want me to fall, but my balance is just
You weren't with me when them struggles and battles was tough
So I cut your head off 'fore I give you a cut
When they tell me I can't do it, it give me a rush
Ain't got this type of bank account 'less you 50 and up
They on my muhfuckin' dick, all this dirt they tryin' get
Go with whoever, I ain't got no pick
Come through just to get that flick

[Bridge]
Get back, go down
New 'Rari, slow down
Check the score, blow out
I'm a bull like the home town

[Verse 2]
Yeezys on, Yeezy bomber, wear my own designer
Name good, all my bridges open, go wherever, that's power
She came from the club tryna fuck, bitch, get in the shower
You a kid to me, boy, I prolly fucked your mama
Hunnid Ms, you did that? Baddest chick in the world, you hit that?
Took your bitch, you miss that?
All the fake buyers, bitch, get back

[Chorus]
Yeah, get back, get back
Hunnid rounds, no kickback
Mansion party, lil' kickback
Champagne, gon' sip that
Get that, get back
Hunnid rounds, no kickback
Mansion party, lil' kickback
Fake vibes, we ain't with that

[Verse 3]
Look what they doin', look what they sayin'
"That nigga selfish, look at his mansion"
Thirty thousand square feet, secret rooms, look at the plan
Look at the money, look at the bands
I get on my knees, I'm thankin' the man
He said he ain't like that nigga, I just seen him shakin' his hand
I'm shakin' my head, I'm shakin' my head
You like that Benz? They made it in France

[Chorus]
But watch your hands, get back
Get back, get back
Hunnid rounds, no kickback
Mansion party, lil' kickback
Fake vibes, we ain't with that
Champagne, gon' sip that
Hunnid rounds, no kickback
All the fake vibes, I ain't with that

[Outro]
My life a mofo, spot like some UFO
Price tag upon your soul, you sold it, you gotta go
Trade my respect for some attention? Fuck no
Lookin' at these bitches bodies, girl, y'all overdose
Why y'all overdose?
Too bad about sorrows
Too bad about love
There'll be no tomorrow
For all of your love

You said you were sleeping
But I can't forget
The troubles you're leaving
Don't be like that

[Chorus]
Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that
Choose up, lil' junt, I'm finna pack him
When it comes to my bitch, I'm straight active
Dirtball in the coupe smokin' cat piss
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy

[Verse 1]
You know I love it when you talk dirty
Messy, you my orange soda shorty
You act like a lil' me, I wanna fuck you
You the type to kill me, I won't touch you
You want me drop a band on some cute shoes?
You want me be the man you can vent to?
You let me beat it up, you let me practice
Now I'm finna lay you on the mattress

[Chorus]
Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that (Yeah)
Choose up, lil' junt, I'm finna pack him
When it comes to my bitch, I'm straight active
Dirtball in the coupe smokin' cat piss
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy (Ayy, pull up, ayy)

[Verse 2]
My lil' baby low-key a flexer
Six figs on the whip, that's a price tag
Lil' best friend bitch tried to press me
I'm that underground nigga with the check, though
I hate a bitch that I can't impress
When you come see the crib, you better die, ho
Young nigga sneakin' in through your side door
Baby Keem, not a wave, I'm a vibe, ho
Seven fig nigga with the big drip on me (Yeah)
Post on your block with your wish list on me

[Chorus]
Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that
Choose up, lil' junt, I'm finna pack him
When it comes to my bitch, I'm straight active
Dirtball in the coupe smokin' cat piss
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy

[Verse 1 ]
Said I'm tired from cleaning, so come back soon
Some are tired from their well being, oh yeah, oh I mean, I mean
Lord knows it gets harder
When you're scared, wherever you are
I could still have him
I could still have him
I could still have him

[Chorus]
Here we are now, We grew older
I only find you, when you’re sober
I know its hard cuz' she’s your mother
An' he’s your father

[Verse 2]
And some of the times, in magazines
He and I say, your embarrassing
Lord knows it gets harder
If your scared then, come wake you up
I could still have him
I could still have him
I could still have him

[Chorus]
Here we are now, We grew older
I only find you, when you’re sober
I know its hard cuz' she’s your mother
An' he’s your father

Here we are now, We grew older
I only find you, when you’re sober
I know its hard cuz' she’s your mother
An' he’s your father

Here we are now, We grew older
I only find you, when you’re sober
I know its hard cuz' she’s your mother
An' he’s your father

[Verse 1]
Topless models doing Semaphore
Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored
Illuminations on a rainy day
When she walks, her footsteps sing a reckless serenade

[Chorus]
I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine

[Verse 2]
The type of kisses where teeth collide
When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

[Chorus]
I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine

[Bridge]
I left my message but did he fuck get back to me?
And now I'm stuck still wondering how it's meant to be

[Outro]
Singing a reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenade

[Verse 1]
So tangled in the wild
Seeing  myself as something more mean
Out  in the country
Sadness wants me
Further away from the scene

[Chorus]
With  right now, right now
Love  is everywhere
Right now, right now
Love  is everywhere

[Verse 2]
Where the sunlight grabs the lake
It's frozen in the flames
Beneath the sleeping town
With  the riots raining down
It's all yours now
It's all for you

[Chorus]
Right now, right now
Love is everywhere
Right now, right now
Love is everywhere

[Bridge]
So many things I do
I can't explain to you

[Chorus]
Right now, right now
Love is everywhere
With right now, I'm frightened how
Love is here, beware

[Outro]
Our love is everywhere

[Intro: Beyoncé]
If you feel insignificant
You better think again
Better wake up because
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Not just a speck in the universe
Not just some words in a bible verse
You are the living word
Ah, you're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you‚ bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
But now we see it
And it ain't no secret‚ no

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Understand that truth about that question in your soul
Look up‚ don't look down, then watch the answers unfold
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Uh‚ take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise (Rise), the spirit is teachin'
No, I'm not just preachin'‚ I'm takin' my own advice

[Verse: Beyoncé]
Let Mama let you know (Let you know)
Mama's still tryin'
I can't get no days off
I don't get no days off
Truly, I'm feelin' it
I had to say that thing twice (Twice)
Tryin' to be a good wife
Still really hard, I can't lie
But I promised you I would fight, so I fight
If you're feelin' frustrated and (Oh)
You're sinkin', I'm jumpin' in (Oh)
Forgiveness is key because
We're fightin' something way bigger
You'll never lose, we are winners
I'll be the roots, you'll be the tree
Pass on the fruit that was given to me
Legacy, ah
We're part of something way bigger

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
(Yeah) Bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than we
Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
Legacy, oh
You're part of something way bigger

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Let love be the water
I pour into you and you pour into me
There ain't no drought here
Bloom into our actual powers
I'll be your sanctuary
You just don't know it yet
You just don't know it yet
No matter how hard it gets
You got my blood in ya
And you're gonna rise

[Chorus: Beyoncé & RAYE]
You're part of something way bigger
You're part of something way bigger
Bigger than you, bigger than me
Bigger than the picture they paint us to be, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You're part of something way bigger

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Understand that truth about that question in your soul (Bigger)
Look up, don't look down, then watch the answers unfold (Bigger)
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print (Bigger)
Take the pen and rewrite it
Step out your estimate
Step in your essence and know that you're excellent

If you feel insignificant
You better think again
Better wake up because

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Daddy used to take me walkin' down the street
Daddy used to take my hand, say, "Follow me"
Daddy used to lead me back home all the time
I got big enough to run around, Daddy left me outside

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
He said, "Find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back"

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Daddy used to tell me, "Look up at the stars
It's been a long time, but remember who you are
Circle of life, and one day, I might not make it
Circle of life, and one day, I might not make it"

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
"But you just gotta find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back"

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Daddy used to teach me all my moves
Runnin' 'round wild, had to tie my shoes
Itty bitty child with a smile like you
Wild, wild child, look a lot like you
Daddy used to teach me all my tricks
Runnin' 'round wild, had to get my fix
Daddy used to teach me all my plays
On a marathon, have to run my race

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
"Find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back, yeah"

Daddy used to teach me all my plays
On a marathon, told me run my race

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Find your way back

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
If the storm comes
If we burn up
If the wells run dry
You're my reason
To believe in
Another life

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
If it all ends
And it's over
If the sky falls fire
Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
If we wake up
Lose our patience
Or even lose our lives, oh
I'll feel lucky
To say that you've been
A friend of mine

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side

[Verse 1: Tierra Whack]
I was always in the lead
Who you wanna be? I'm who they wanna be
B-E-A-U-T-Y-E, never seen so much rage from a queen
Rage from a queen, queen so strong, thought she was a machine
Girl of your dreams, Synclaire, Regine
Turned to the max, can't forget Maxine
Refer to me as a goddess, I'm tired of being modest
A hundred degrees, the hottest, if we being honest
Ebony and ebonics, black people win
They say we bein' demonic, angel in disguise
I hate I have to disguise it, why you gotta despise it?
Rich in the mind, that's why I'm making deposits
Carry all the power, it's time to realize it
(They'll never, ever take my power)

[Chorus: Nija & Beyonce]
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power

This that rhythm, this that lightning
This that burn, this ain't no perm
This that nappy, this that herb
This that kinfolk, this that skinfolk
This that war, this that bloodline
On the frontline, ready for war
Where you gon' run?
I'ma get loose, get loose, get low, get low
Oh yeah, get loose, get loose, get low, get low
Oh-oh-oh, gotta protect my grace
Keep it locked in the safe
Don't make me get back to my ways
My power, they'll never take

In the third grave
How come you want it? Can't fuck with the bitch
This one ain't fair, this one for family
This one the damn, this one I thank
That's when thought it was safe and it wasn't
Pointer me, Allah, some on your water
I'm callin' your mada, call on the collar
All I saw from where I stood
The sun was smiling down on us
We were lucky, that's for sure
I was yours

Now all I see from where I'm from
Empty auditorium
We were lucky, that's for sure
I was yours
And you didn't mind
Being mine

There was a pop in my ear
As I left the atmosphere
Draggin' behind my mind
It's too late
Don't say it
Don't say...

All I saw from where I stood
Three long mountains and a wood
I'm lucky, that's for sure
I'm yours
And you didn't mind
Being mine

This what kings do, talk paper and skate
You know what this what kings do, lay up and stack in the gate
This what kings do, throw family first it's real
This what kings do, think about flyin' a Persian, yup
This what kings do, vacate lands in Egypt
This what kings do, breakdown plans with speeches
This what kings do, make sure mamma is right, yup
This what kings do, hit Dubai in a night
And this how kings move, yo, hold your money and invest wise
Whether you sellin' buttons, or select pies
A king move, keep it silent, no one else dies
We all Pharaohs and Cameros, flexin' S5s
It's what a king do
This how a king move

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Blood on my hands and it look like candy
How I pay-pay lawyers, and nobody can't stand me

So you might not give a damn
I'm like a hologram
Light is all I am

Time is nothing I can keep
It's the same as when I sleep
If time is just to kill
Then I will

[Verse 3]
Overflowing like a crowd
And I'm freaking the fuck out
I'll try to do my best
I guess

[Verse 4]
High in an old dead tree
That plastic bag is me
That's where I want to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we all in love, just because?

[Chorus]
No, I think it's poetry and magic
Something too big to have a name
And when you get it right, it's still tragic
And when you die, who's to blame?
Did you think everything would be okay?

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we all in love just because?

[Chorus]
No, I think it's poetry and magic

And when you die, who's to blame?
Did you think everything would be okay?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
No, I think it's poetry and magic
Something too big to have a name

When you die, who's to blame?
Do you think everything will be okay?

[Outro]
Okay

[Verse 1]
I don't like
The way you're treating me
Warm, winter rain
I found my keys
Under the snow
An empty page glowing
Alone for days
Behind a quiet door
Sitting in a drift
Us in a car
Arguing, I'd forgive
But I always forget
Which side I'm on

[Chorus]
I never change
You never change

[Verse 2]
It's my fault
There's no decision
Sometimes I'm just a hole
For you to get in

[Chorus]
I never change
You never change

[Bridge]
Somehow we're bright leaves
You and I beneath the old snow
Being set free by the winter rain
And I know it'll never change

[Outro]
You never change
You never change
You never change
You never change
You never change
You're never gonna change
You're never gonna change
You never change
You never change
You never change
You never change
You never change
You're never gonna change
You're never gonna change

[Verse 1]
I'm surprised, staring at the knives
Lying silent in the drawer
I hear the front door ring in my guitar
Empty up against the wall

[Chorus]
Alone with the people who have come before
Alone with the people who have come before
Alone with the people who have come before us
I'm high for the people who have come before
I'm high for the people who have come before
I'm high for the people who have come before us

[Verse 2]
I remember when wars would end
Remember when wars would end?
Now‚ when something's dead
Now‚ when something's dead
We try to kill it again

[Chorus]
Alone with the people who have come before
Alone with the people who have come before
Alone with the people who have come before us

[Verse 1]
I wish too much for you to care
Goldfish I won at the fair
Meet the mother, can't complain
There is no mother like pain

[Chorus]
I'm left with only my desire to change
So what? I stay in bed all day
I can't escape my domain
Two stories high in bed all day
I can't escape my domain

[Verse 2]
You mean too much to me
I'm angry
I could need so much
I'm worried about the way
We're all living
And this is my love song

[Chorus]
I'm left with only my desire to change
So if I stay in bed all day
I won't escape my domain
Two stories high in bed all day
I can't escape my domain
I can't escape my domain
I won't escape my domain
I wish your world was mine
I wish your world was mine
Prayers run along the wires
Honey, no train's gonna come
I have waited my whole life
I've tried, in my way, to love everyone

I wish your world was mine
I wish your world was mine
I have a quiet amplifier
Silence seems more true
Every guitar is denied
I've tried, in my way, to love you

I wish your world was mine
I wish your world was mine
I wouldn't mind feelin' fine
I wish your world was mine

If only your world was mine
If only your world was mine
Shy little stars must shine
Shy little flower on the vine

[Verse 1]
If you're tellin' yourself a story
Where the secrets twist like vines
And you know where the bodies are buried
But you can't remember where you buried the mines

[Chorus]
Oh, no one denies
Everyone hides
Oh‚ oh
Everyone hides

[Verse 2]
If you're sellin' yourself on a tale
Where the details drift with time
Where the point gets lost in the tellin'
And the tellin' was the point all the while

[Chorus]
Deep inside
Everyone hides
Oh‚ oh
Some of the time

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
If you're selling yourself on a vision
A dream of who you are
An idea of how it should be
And a wish upon a star

[Chorus]
Remember
Remember‚ it can't be denied
Oh, oh
Everyone hides

[Chorus]
Oh, no one denies
Everyone hides
Oh‚ oh
Everyone hides

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh‚ oh
A white, wooden cross by the side of the road
One  someone lost that I did not know
What  would I do?
What would I do?
If a white, wooden cross meant that I'd lost you

I  asked myself, "How would I let go?"
And  a thought appeared like a morning dew
And my blood ran cold
My  blood ran cold
As these sad ideas passed through

Tell me no lies
Tell me no lies
Is  it stranger to live?
Is it stranger to die?
What would I do?
What would I do?
If a white, wooden cross meant that I'd lost you

Tell me no lies
Tell me no lies
Is it stranger to live?
Is it stranger to be alive?
For all the people that I am not
And all their prayers and all their thoughts
There's so much more out there
Than here where I stand
I blow my horn for the whole band

[Intro: Big Sean]
Phew, phew, yeah
If  you weigh me down then I gotta remove you
If  you in my way, then I gotta go through you (Don, Don)
Look, look, look, funeral

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't talk shit, bitch, I do it (Huh)
They  say, "All facts," but don't prove shit (Huh)
You  in my way, need to move, bitch (Huh)
Shut the fuck up, no excuses (Huh)
This  a win-win, swear I'm so choosy
Money spread on me like Boosie
Real ones ride for me, no cruise ship

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I don't really sleep or take naps, no snoozin'
All  these burners here hot, but we coolin'
I was playin' dumb, they was thinkin' I'm stupid
My accountant just called, said, "Shit been movin'"
I'm 'posed to have no gun, I got two of 'em
I never remind a nigga what I do for 'em
I was dead broke, sleep on the futon
Now I'm up, now I'm big house, few of 'em
Everyday I'm lit, my life like a re-run
If I take your shit, can't give you no refund
Ten mil' for a deal I agree on
I put on for Atlanta like Deion
Chrome Heart glasses, I can't see 'em
From the apartments to an arena
Where that lil' boy been? I ain't seen him
Look at God's child drivin' the Demon
Fuck what you heard

[Chorus: Big Sean, Lil Wayne, Big Sean & Lil Wayne]
I don't talk shit, bitch, I do it (Huh)
They say, "All facts," but don't prove shit (Huh, yeah)

Shut the fuck up, no excuses (Yeah)
This a win-win, swear I'm so choosy
Money spread on me like Boosie
Real ones ride for me, no cruise ship

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I don't talk shit, bitch, I do shit (I do shit)
Soft top on my car like it's Jewish (It's Jewish)
Catch a body like Ray Lewis (Ray Lewis)
Blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt
Lil Tunechi, I'm in this bitch on the cookie like Lucious (Yeah)
I'm gonna sip, got that purple pollution (Yeah)
I get the checks and just do it no swooshes (Yeah)
Flex on my ex then I flex on my new bitch (Yeah)
No disrespect, I bust down the noose (Yeah)
Put it on my neck, now my neck is a nuisance (Yeah)
I am a mess, I am a mutant (Yeah)
Bullets go through your vest like it's translucent
I smoke the best exclusive
I'm somewhere else secluded (Secluded)
Fly to death, and your bitch just flew in
You a ref, my nigga, you blew it (You blew it)
I don't sketch, but the pistol, I drew it
Told myself to continue my duties
I got money from 2002, that I ain't seen since 2002
Me, Sean, and Brazy, my nigga, we boolin'
Ballin' so brazy, I dribble and shoot it
Just like I play for Emilio Pucci
I treat the Wraith like that bitch is Suzuki
I need a favorite woman like The Fugees
It's me, Sean, and Baby, we lit as Three Stooges
My skate stance is goofy, my bae ass is stupid
No fake asses truly, I'm makin' her moon me
Blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt, blatt

[Chorus: Big Sean, Lil Wayne, Big Sean & Lil Wayne]
I don't talk shit, bitch, I do it (I do it)
They say, "All facts," but don't prove shit (I knew it)
You in my way, need to move, bitch (Move bitch, huh)
Shut the fuck up, no excuses (Yeah, yeah)
This a win-win, swear I'm so choosy (Yeah, yeah)
Money spread on me like Boosie
Real ones ride for me, no cruise ship (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Lil Baby, Lil Wayne, & Big Sean]
I don't really sleep or take naps, no snoozin' (No snoozin')
All of these burners here hot, but we coolin' (Yeah, snorin')
I was playin' dumb, they was thinkin' I'm stupid
My accountant just called, said, "Shit been movin'" (Yeah)
I don't talk shit, bitch, I do it
My accountant just called, said, "Shit been movin'"
Fake money, should keep your two cents (That mulah)
Catch a body like Ray Lewis (Yeah)
If you weigh me down, then I gotta remove you
If you in my way, then I gotta go through you

Go ahead, explore the island
Vibes so real that you can feel it in the air

Oh-oh
Well, we got trouble in the White House
Poverty in the ghetto
When will it end?
Nobody knows!
People are asking now
"How can you spend another dollar on the space race"
"When families at home are starving right in front of your face."
Where is your heart, America?
Thousand of jobless people walking the streets
With no food or place to sleep
What will become of them, America?
I heard some people saying they had a solution
"All we got to do is change the constitution!"
What about air pollution, America?
America!
Don't get me wrong, I still love ya
In spite of all your troubles and woes
In my eyes you're still the greatest of them all!
America!
I ain't ashamed to say that I love ya
There ain't another place on Earth I'd rather be
We won all the battles there were to win
Pray that the war is at an end
That's what people pray
Listen to them, America!
America!
Don't get me wrong, I still love ya
In spite of all your troubles and woes
In my eyes you're still the greatest of them all!
America!
I ain't ashamed to say that I love ya
There ain't another place on Earth I'd rather be

I had a dream when I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union
(But a cold wind blows)
(And a dark rain falls)
And in my heart, it shows
Look what they've done to my dream

One vision!

There's only one direction
One world and one nation
Yeah, one vision

Lock your daddy out of doors

The memories inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
The waiting seems eternity, yeah
The day will dawn of sanity

[Chorus]
Is this a kind of magic? (It's a kind of magic)
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years

This  is "Under Pressure"
Mmm  da de
Dum bum ba be

Pressure  pushing down on me
Pressing  down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits  a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
Ee  day da
De day da
That's okay!

[Chorus]
It’s the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets
Day day day
De de de de day
Okay

Chippin' around, kick my brains around the floor

[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow... high, higher, ohh

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury & (Roger Taylor)]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don’t work
Keep comin' up with love but it's so slashed and torn
(Why?)
Why?
Ohh!
Insanity laughs, under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3]
Why can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro]
'Cause love’s such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet

Without you, when you're gone?

How long can you stand the heat?
Out the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who dares to love forever?
Oh, ohh, oh yeah
Who wants to live forever?
Oh, ohh
When love must die

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
So touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can have forever
Forever is our today

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today
Who waits forever anyway?

Just  a new man!
Yes, you made me live again

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
The  people all stared, didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight
Ooh, whatever came of you and me?
America's new bride to be
Don't worry, baby, I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love you so
Yes you made me live again!
Hey!
Yeah!

[Verse 3]
Ooh, a thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
The beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
A rain running down my face
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye, oh!
Down in the city just Hoople and me, with me

[Instrumental Interlude]
Just you and me, babe!
Give it to me, yeah
Go Johnny!
Go Johnny, go Johnny, yeah
Hey-ey

[Bridge]
Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory with you
Yeah

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & Audience]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me, because
You don't know what it means to me

Don't take it away from me, because
You don't know what it means to me

When I grow older, I will be there at your side, to remind you
How I still love you (I still love you)
You

[Audience Cheering]

[Acoustic Guitar Interlude]

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
We're now done with the difficult bit

[Intro]
Howl at the moon

[Verse 1]
Just think of all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded?
Against our own
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today?
The world that we created

[Verse 2]
You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man, sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Ohh!

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated?
Right to the bone
If there's a God, up in the sky looking down
What must he think of what we've done
To the world that He created?

[Intro: Freddie Mercury]
Everybody, c'mon!
Give it to me!
(Doo wop)

[Verse 1]
You don't like crazy music (Doo wop)

Yes I do, I do, a do, do, do

[Verse 3]
You don't like crazy music (Doo wop)
Don't like rockin', baby (Doo wop)
You just wanna go to a movie show
Sit there holdin' hands

[Chorus/Outro]
You're so square

Baby I don't care, care, care, care
(Doo wop)
Care, care, care, care
Hey!

[Intro]
We're gonna fool around a little more
This is a
A Ricky Nelson song

[Chorus]
I said hello, Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew, Mary Lou we'd never part
So hello, Mary Lou, goodbye heart

[Verse]
Passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
Knew I wanted you forevermore
Now, I'm not one that get's around
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
And oh, I never did see you no more, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Said hello, Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew, Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello, Mary Lou, goodbye heart

One more time
Yes hello, Mary Lou, goodbye heart

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

[Chorus]
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

[Chorus]
Mama, ooh
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 3]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

[Spoken Word Intro]
Hey!
Now it's time for the hammer to fall!

[Verse 1]
Here we stand, here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight

[Chorus]
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
Then it's time for the hammer to fall

[Verse 2]
Every night, every day
A little piece of you is falling away
Lift your face, the Western baby
Build your muscles as your body decays

[Chorus]
Tow the line and play their game
Let the anesthetic cover it all
Until one day they call your name
Then it's time for the hammer to fall

[Bridge]
Rich or poor or famous
For your truth is all the same (oh no, oh no)
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane (oh no!)
Baby, now your struggle's all in vain

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just want to scream it louder and louder

[Chorus]
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you are waiting for the hammer to, hammer to, hammer to fall

[Outro]
Give it to me one more time!

[Chorus]
This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse]
Gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take the back seat, hitch-hike
Take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie!)
Crazy little thing called love

[Chorus]
This thing called love, I just can't handle it
This thing called love, I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Take it

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Oh!
Crazy little thing called love, hey
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Yeah, hey
Crazy, crazy, crazy, baby
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, alright

[Spoken Word Outro]
Thank you!
Goodnight, everybody!

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made them laugh, you made them cry
You made us feel like we could fly (radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Verse 2]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you!

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
(Radio ga ga)

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)
Everybody

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo

All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you!
Ohh!
You! (Yeah!)

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Another red letter day
So  the pound has dropped and the children are created
The  other half ran away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber
Got a pain in the chest
Doctors  on strike, what you need is a rest
It's  so easy, love, 'cause you've got friends you can trust

[Chorus]
Friends will be friends
When  you're in need of love, they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
Friends  will be friends
Right till the end

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
It's a beautiful day
The postman delivered a letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number
As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life without him in your way
It's so easy now, 'cause you got friends you can trust

[Chorus]
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love, they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
Friends will be friends

[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Outro]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions...

...of the world

[Chorus]

Tell baby I'm coming home
Bless me, I've been on my own
You can love me and still do me wrong
I've been hurt but I still remain strong
How many times I show face and shit go south on me?
I had a kickstand last year, but she ain't really love me
Y'all better leave me alone
If I have to pull up, I'll be

[Chorus]
Baby on my hit list, I'm excited (Hey)
Got, got me to forget, it's a Friday

Don't talk fake deep, I don't like it
Don't talk fake deep (To me!), I don't like it

[Verse 2]
I hurt your feelings for a fool
You know the facts, your love is tall
Worth more than millions fold
I save your heart, I play the part
I miss your kisses, okay (Hmm)
Y'all better leave me alone
No one need me
I pop like genie
You don't wanna see me
Duckin' enemies
Ex one look like RiRi
I'm not a weakling

[Chorus]
Baby on my hit list, I'm excited (Hey)
Got, got me to forget, it's a Friday
Don't talk fake deep, I don't like it
Don't talk fake deep (To me!), I don't like it

All pain, no emotion
Grab 'em by the neck, don't let go

No more opinions, I'm done bein' open

Back and forth in a rental
I pray to God that he sent you

[Verse 1]
And she would say I was gold
When  I was covered in grime
And  she would straighten the road
When I was staggerin’ blind

[Pre-Chorus]
“Come on by” she said, “Come on by”
“We’ll  get high, boy, we’ll get high”
You  know that I didn’t mind

[Chorus]
She made love even better than stoned
She  made love even better than stoned
She made love even better than stoned
She shone

[Verse 2]
And when I was in a poor way
She  treated me as a Lord
When I was stranded in doorways
She let me in with a kind word

[Pre-Chorus]
“Come on by,” she said
“Come on by”
“We’ll get high, boy”
“We’ll get high”
You know that I didn’t mind

[Chorus]
She made love even better than stoned
She made love even better than stoned
She made love even better than stoned
She shone
Oh how she shone

[Guitar Solo]

I’ll never come down
I’ll never come down
And I’ll never come down
No I’ll never come down
Oh I’ll never come down
I’ll never come down
Oh, I’ll never come down
I’ll never come down

[Chorus]
She made love even better than stoned
We made love even better than stoned
We made love even better than stoned
She shone

[Verse 1]
Got a problem everywhere she goes
But she doesn't pay mind to it
She keep thirty-three twenties and a five and a one
Not for spendin' but for death when it comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, she dance through it, she dance through it
Got a problem that she tryin' to hide
When she can't do it, she dance through it
Gets her heart beatin' fast all night

[Chorus]
Said she dance through it, she dance through it
Hey, hey
Dance through it, she dance through it
Hey
Dance through it, she dance through it
Hey, hey
Dance through it, she dance through it

[Verse 2]
When she sense that there's a danger near
She doesn't seem to care about it
She's got pretty bad news rainin' down
But she hasn't missed a step all night

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, she dance through it, she dance through it
Got a problem that she tryin' to hide
When she can't do it, she dance through it
Gets her heart beatin' fast all night

[Chorus]
Said she dance through it, she dance through it
Hey, hey
Dance through it, she dance through it
Hey
Dance through it, she dance through it
Hey, hey
Dance through it, she dance through it

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Dance through it, she dance through it
Hey, hey
(Got a problem that she tryin' to hide)
Dance through it, she dance through it
Hey
Dance through it, she dance through it
Hey, hey
(Gets her heart beatin' fast all night)
Dance through it, she dance through it
Dance through it, she dance through it
Hey, hey
Dance through it, she dance through it
What you have you will lose
The sun will set on you too
Though you think they’re your darkest hours
You can sing a new tune if you choose
Out of the black it’ll loom

Pace yourself with the tide
Place your worries aside
Better bag ‘em up tight
Sooner or later you'll find
Down the line, all of the leaves they turn brown
But in time, all of the leaves turn around

[Guitar Solo]

Though their bodies have died
All those tears that you’ve cried
Shining bright in the darkness of the night
Leave a glint in your eye
If we try, flowers will bloom at our sides
You and I, our flowers will bloom down the line

[Verse 1]
It’s too early to bare this cross
Well  it wasn’t long ago that I started feeling lost
You  put up when I’m flat on my face
Saying you was running round all over the place
And last night you forgot your phone
I  thought you’d be here so I opened up the door
To  pick you up and dust you off
We gotta do it all over again now

[Chorus]
It  felt regal, like we were laid in gold
Not to settle in the dust or refuse anymore
And you know from the things we’ve seen
When you roll up to the pack, put yourself back, you’re comin’ with me

[Verse 2]
A  farewell to my old friend
Time will travel on, you can’t stop it to pretend
We’d run the levee when we start to feel strong
But came down thinkin’ that we oughta go home
You’re so sharp, I can tell by your sight
You better sleep good because you ain’t been eating right
And we can sing our favorite songs
Because we won’t feel lonely when it don’t feel wrong

[Chorus]
It was regal and with nothing to show
But never settled in the dust, we just moved with the flow
Before you go and find a place to be
Better run up to the pack, put yourself back, you’re comin’ with me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Picking it up isn’t the easy part
You’ve  been bummin’ around
Bitter  heart of December
Blame it all on the weather
Needless to say, I’m glad it exists
Cigarette  on the boulevard
Another  cigarette, that’s how I make my decision
Find out what you’ve been missin’
Ready  or not, I like you a lot

[Verse 2]
You and I rode so long through the pourin’ rain
I really run my mouth, I rarely use my brain
You and I rode so long I know I’m never the same
Leaves  will fall, the weight of it all
Ready or not, it’s comin’ in hot

[Chorus]
Unfamiliar sun
Just take it as it comes
Hope it never does
Unfamiliar sun
I want to thank you for your light
In my unforgiving life

[Verse 3]
Pickin’ it up through all the hate and the pain
Pickin’ it up since the day I turned 15
Long way down the streets of old town
When it’s gone, it’s tough getting sober
Pickin it up through all the frivolous things
Summer has passed and you’re another year older
Leaves turn over, the bats will get hot
Believe it or not, the Cubs in October

[Chorus]
Unfamiliar sun
Just take it as it comes
Hope it never does
Unfamiliar sun
I want to thank you for your light
In my unforgiving life

[Verse 1]
Fallin out on a midnight
On the tail end of a goodbye
I had a feelin it won't right
Had a feeling like I kicked down a door
Many men like to talk rot
Over whiskey and dreams shot
And I can feel your blood go hot
When you hear another talk like he know

[Pre-Chorus]
Takes too long a time to get to know ya
And it takes too short a time to say goodbye
And if on some sudden night I lost you
You’ll always be a long time on my mind

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
So you wish you were something
Anything other than what you been
So it feels a little late to let love in
Well it’s never too late to try
And I don’t care what you done now
It doesn’t matter, it’s done now
Just as long as this world still has you around
You can always make somebody smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothin’ given matches what I owe ya
So rare a joy to be held in your eye
And if on some sudden night I lost you
I’ll always be a light of yours in mine

[Chorus]
Lookout low
Look out tonight
Look out low
Look out alright
Lookout low
Look out tonight
Look out low
Look out alright

Lookout low
Look out tonight
Look out low
Look out alright
Lookout low
Look out tonight
Since it's too late to stay here
Maybe I could take up a seat
Getting hard to keep walking
With those phrases on repeat
Sure as high times in summer
Going to lead to hard times in fall
If I get over that river, babe
I'll run blindly through it all

[Chorus]
Come on down
Come on down
You might be the only one

It was almost time for bed
And I tried to keep from wandering
Something so close it was too easy to see
The image of that one girl
The one that left me ? down
Showed herself in to keep we gone beneath
And with the motor in my hand
That won't stop running
The hand in my pocket that won't leave me be
And that storm in my belly
You know it just keeps on plunging
And it won't stop, till you drift to me

[Chorus]
So come on down
Come on down
You might be the only one

You're my good luck charm
The smoke that never left my lungs
You're the only one

There's a ferry on the river
Taking me from here to you
And there's a 15 in the 45
It's all you need to know
Two dollars ain't too bad
When you've got nowhere to go
But if I keep on thinking how the hell I got here alone
I may never know what could be
And I won't find out till you drift to me

[Verse 1]
Underneath a smile
It’s the hollow sound of feet stepping on
Underneath a smile
On a dark night so moonless and long

[Chorus]
Won’t you leave a light on?
Won’t you leave a light on, dim?
Out in the night is a rider
Won’t you let a stranger in?

Well the ice in my heart will never melt without a shine
A shine, a shine, a shine
Just imagine how it feels when I look into your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

[Verse 2]
Underneath a smile
It’s the bitter taste of knowin’ the cost
Underneath a smile
When a good thing is so suddenly lost

[Chorus]
Won’t you leave a light on?
Won’t you leave a light on dim?
Out in the night is a rider
Won’t you let a stranger in?

[Guitar Solo]

In the mirror I can tell the two of me is so alone
You’re right, you’re right, you’re right
Got to swallow all the water make sure you can take it home

[?]
Survive, survive, survive

[Chorus]
Won’t you leave a light on?
Won’t you leave a light on dim?
Out in the night is a rider
Won’t you let a stranger in?
Well it’s hot now the river is high
Don’t it smell like an elephant hide?
It’s got me so I can’t sleep at night
Oh don’t let your head dip in
City secrets still lie deep within it
Don’t I know that sickness like a prison
It’s like a prison

Don’t you see all of the things that I see?
Don’t you bleed the same blood I bleed?
When I lie down and let it slowly drown me

And I can picture the discrepancies
When everything just keeps on pressing on you
I don’t believe all of the love is honest

Fire in the firewood
For all the creatures in an empty house
I wanna party when the sun is down

[Guitar Solo]
Well it’s gone now forever inside
Down to my feet under an empty mind
Sunday morning is a bright reminder
Don’t you see all of the things that I do?
Don’t you bleed the same? Blood is blue
I don’t believe I’m that much different than you
Different than you

Fire in the firewood
For all the creatures in an empty house
I wanna party when the sun is down
When a part of me is not around
Walk into the open door
Sink into the ocean floor
Fall in on a summer day
Acid in my Gatorade
When I depart into the other plane
Place me down into the open flame
Saying everything is just the same

[Intro: Kanye West]
Don't go over, I'll be the light

[Intro: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
Yes! It's so crazy right now!
Most incredibly, it's your girl, B

[Interlude: JAY-Z]
It's history in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
"Who he think he is?" look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love your doing no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love

Check it, let's go
Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco
Young B and the R-O-C, uh oh (Oh)
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (Oh no)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony Soprano (oh no)
The ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, If anything I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
Crazy, bring ya whole set
Jay Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, "hey is he insane?" (Oh no)
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova?
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back Young, ever since I made the change over
To platinum the game's been a wrap, one

[Verse 4: Beyoncé]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
Cause baby you got me, you got me, so crazy, baby
HEY!

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love

[Intro]
To be or not to be... Not!
Hold up, bring the beat back
Stop! I ain’t ready yet
Wait! Let me fix my hair, yes, yes
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am
Now pass me my dress, yes

[Verse 1]
I think I’m ready
Been locked up in the house way too long
It’s time to get it
Cause once again he’s out doing wrong
And my girls are so real
Said it’s been a minute since I had some
He’s been acting up
But he won’t be the only one
Cause when he acts up, that’s when you put it on
Get him uptight, this is your song
Hold out your back, time to impress
Pull out your freakum dress

[Hook]
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, every woman got one
Oh, shut it down when the time comes
Oh, pull out the big guns
Oh, and put your freakum dress on

[Verse 2]
Soon as he saw me
Turned on by how the dress was fittin' right
Short and backless
See my silhouette in the moonlight
Such an attraction
Keep tellin' me how my outfit’s so nice
Little did he know
Ha, my man gon' take it off tonight
Cause when he acts up, that’s when you put it on
Get him uptight, this is your song
Hold out your back, time to impress
Pull out your freakum dress

[Hook]
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, every woman got one
Oh, shut it down when the time comes
Oh, pull out the big guns
Oh, and put your freakum dress on

[Verse 3]
All the ladies, you ain't these
All dressed up in your dresses
And your bestest with no reason
Get ready to freakum, freakum
When you put it on it’s an invitation
When they play your theme song, get on up and shake it
Work it out your back, you don’t have to waste it
Spin it all around then take it to the ground and
Cause when he acts up, that’s when you put it on
Get him uptight, this is your song
Hold out your back, time to impress
Pull out your freakum dress

[Hook]
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on
Oh, put your freakum dress on

Oh, every woman got one
Oh, shut it down when the time comes
Oh, pull out the big guns
Oh, and put your freakum dress on

[Interlude]
Ladies look it here
When you been with your man for a long time, oh
Every now and then you gotta go in the back of that closet
And pull out that freakum dress, oh

[Outro]
I got my freakum dress on
I got my freakum dress on, oh
I got my freakum dress on
I got my freakum dress on, oh

[Intro: Beyoncé]
Ay, Ay, Ay
Nobody likes being played
(Oh) Beyoncé, Beyoncé
(Oh) Shakira, Shakira (hey)

[Verse 1: Beyoncé & Shakira]
He said I'm worth it, his one desire
I know things about 'em that you wouldn't want to read about
He kissed me, his one and only, (yes) beautiful liar
Tell me how you tolerate the things that you just found out about

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé & Shakira]
You never know
Why are we the ones who suffer?
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Shakira, both]
(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Can't we laugh about it? (Ha Ha Ha)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without them
Just a beautiful liar

[Verse 2: Beyoncé & Shakira]
I trusted him, but when I followed you, I saw you together
I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing
You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé & Shakira]
We'll never know
When the pain and heartbreak's over
I have to let go
The innocence is gone

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Shakira, both]
(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Can't we laugh about it? (Ha Ha Ha)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without them
Just a beautiful liar

[Bridge: Beyoncé & Shakira, both]
Tell me how to forgive you
When it's me who's ashamed
And I wish could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame

[Break: Beyoncé]
Hey!
Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Shakira, Shakira
Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Shakira, Shakira
(Hey)

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Shakira, both]
(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Can't we laugh about it? (Ha Ha Ha)
(Oh) It's not worth our time
(Oh) We can live without them
Just a beautiful liar

[Intro: Beyoncé]
All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me
To think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream
Of one day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe
That with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete
When you cheat with loose women
It took me some time
But now I moved on
Because I realized I got

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
So controlling, you said
That you love me but you don't
Your family told me
One day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing
With your three kids in my home
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 4: Beyoncé]
Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front
Like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong
Because I realized I got

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
(Got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Hey

(I must have cried a thousand times)
I've cried
All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Hey!
Yeah, you hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again

After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Oh!

(I must have cried a thousand times)
If you've cried a thousand times
Ladies, you will survive!
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah! You hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
I can see the sun shine
I got me, myself, and I

[Chorus: DMX and Faith Evans]
What type of games is bein' played? How's it goin' down? (All I want is you)
It's on 'til it's gone, then I gots to know now (All I want is you)
Is you with me or what? Think I'm trying to get me a nut (All I want is you)
Just 'cause honeys wanna give me the butt, what? (All I want is you)

[Verse 1: DMX]
I'm politickin' with this chicken, wonderin' if I'ma creep her
Little hoodrat bitch from 25th named Tenika
Comin' through, like I do, you know, gettin' my bark on
Knew she was a thug 'cause when I met her she had a scarf on
5411, size 7 in girls
Babyface, would look like she was 11 with curls
Girlfriend, remember me (what?) from way back?
I'm the same cat with the wave cap
That motherfucker that TNT used to blaze at
Still here, so it's all good
Oh, you know my niggas Rich and them
Doin' they thing on 35th? Damn, it's a small hood
And it's all wood, so let me get that number, I get up
Aight? Hit you on the jack later on, see whassup
Talkin' to shorty made me wanna do somethin' nice
Lookin' at that ass made me wanna do somethin' tonight
And I know right when I see right, shorty lookin' like she tight
She bite, better give a nigga the green light, we might…

[Chorus: DMX and Faith Evans]
What type of games is bein' played? How's it goin' down? (All I want is you)
It's on 'til it's gone, then I gots to know now (All I want is you)

Just 'cause honeys wanna give me the butt, what? (All I want is you)

[Verse 2: DMX]
I'm gettin' at shorty like, "What you need? What you want?"
Want for nothin', 'cause I got you, but you front?
I see you with your baby father, but it don't matter
Since you gave me the pussy, that ass is gettin' fatter
Let that nigga play daddy, make moves with me
I'da kept it more than real boo, can't lose with me (True)
Heard he smacked you
'Cause you said my name while y'all was sexin'
Ran up on this cat he thought was me and started flexin'
You know I ain't even with that
So he gon' have to get that just on GP
Try to creep me (What?), leave that nigga sleepy
On the strength of you, that's your kids daddy
I ain't gon' send him on his way, put him up in that big Caddy
But let him know, never mind, yo, I need you to go
Take this snow up to 1-5-0, see Joe
Get that, come back with that, we can split that, sit back
Fuck, puff a L, forget that; you with that?

[Chorus: DMX and Faith Evans]
What type of games is bein' played? How's it goin' down? (All I want is you)

Just 'cause honeys wanna give me the butt, what? (All I want is you)

[Verse 3: DMX]
Ayo, this chicken got me diggin' her moves, 'cause she smooth
Win or lose, whoever she choose, get's the dues
Respect is not expected, but it's given 'cause it's real
Being neglected's the norm, expected, the deal
Lie, cheat, and steal for me
Puttin' somethin' in a nigga's wig if you squeal for me
Kill for me, you're still with me?
'Cause we get down like "What?"
Told you's from the door, it ain't all about a nut
I'm gon' be fair, tryin' to be there, we gon' see then
Hit me with the question, boo, that answer gon' be "Yeah"
See there, somethin' can go wrong, it does
Loved it, let it go, and it came back, that's how strong it was
But she belonged to cuz, couldn't belong to me
She had two kids by this nigga, it was wrong for me
But we gon' always be best of friends, haha
Mad love, boo, to the end, tada!

[Chorus: DMX and Faith Evans]

Seems like you're all alone
Do you feel free?

I can see
More than is clear to me
So come one and open me
Let me feel free

[Interlude: Group, Jacob Collier]
So open up your care
And leave it everywhere

You think of home again (Home again)
Home was always waiting for you

Open up that old window
Open up and let him go

Stay for a minute
Let me hold you in my heart
You love me, don't you baby?
So don't you rush away, rush away

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jacob Collier]
You and I, wide awake
With the sky falling down
As we wait for the morning
Is there a place in the stars
Where the sky goes to sleep?
We got no way of knowing

[Chorus: Lianne La Havas]
You make me feel (When it all falls down)
Feel (Turn it back around)
You make me feel (When it all falls down)
Feel (Turn it back around)
But you, you make me feel so young (So young, so young)
Yeah, you, you make me come alive (Alive)

This I do adore
Stay forever more
Take me to the floor
Leave me wanting more
Never felt this way before
You make me feel like I'm new

[Verse 2: Lianne La Havas]
Breathe for a moment
Let me wash away all your cares
(Let me wash away all your cares)
You know I got you baby
(Know I got you baby)
So don't you rush away, rush away (Rush away)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jacob Collier]
You and I, wide awake
With the sky falling down
In the dark of the morning
Is there a place in the sky
Where the stars go to sleep?
They've got no way of glowing

[Chorus: Lianne La Havas]
You make me feel (When it all falls down)
Feel (Turn it back around)
You make me feel (When it all falls down)
Feel (Turn it back around)

You make me feel

[Verse 1]
I heard you singing underneath the moon
Sleepyhead
Go to bed
I hear your footsteps walkin' by my room
I'm okay, here to stay

[Verse 2]
I saw you making angels in the snow
Late at night
Wonder why
I see you laughing till morning looking all aglow
Meant to be
You and me

[Verse 3]
Said all along you wanted to be free
Don't you cry
Learn to fly
I know you're ready for the light to see
Close your eyes
Say goodnight
Count to three
Follow me

You don’t wanna get too close ‘cause I feel dangerous
You like it
Your heart beat is strong now
Whenever you’re with me, I get so mysterious
You want it (I want it)
There’s a tingling in your fingers

[Verse 2]
You can take off your clothes, I’m so precarious
I like it
My heart beat is strong now (Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)
I never really do this but I’m so delirious
And I like it
Oh, that tingling in my fingers, now

You promised you would never kiss me but it’s glorious (Oh, oh)
You like it (I like it)

That tingling in your fingers

[Verse 1]
The time has come for me to tell you
All  the things I really feel about you
'Cause  lately time's been moving on
And every day we seem to grow a little older, too
The more I think of you the less I seem
To  know the way I feel about you
And  all I think is all I know
And all I know is all I want to think about is you

[Verse 2]
I  used to think I knew it all
And that the love you gave was mine for keeping
I guess I cared too much for you back then
To see the simple magic of it all
I  long to see the things we saw
When we were young and could not see so clearly
When all the world was just a blur of coloured lines
That I'd trace most sincerely back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'd say

[Chorus]
"Time to rest your weary head
Take your wings and go to bed
I know you want to know it all, my darling"
And I'd say
"Set me down and rock me
Rock me to sleep"

[Verse 3]
I see the sparkle in your eyes
You say I'm beautiful and I believe you
And I will never feel more beautiful
Than when I'm wide awake beside you
I'll wander far and wide and wonder
How it feels to fall in love with someone
Without the need to show her everything I've learnt
About the world since you've been gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'd say

[Chorus]
"Time to rest your weary head
Take your wings and go to bed
I know you want to show it all, my darling"
And I'd say
"Set me down and rock me
Rock me to sleep"

[Verse 4]
There was a time it seemed the time itself
Was free and would go on forever
Wanted to cling to it but now I see
Its fading is its greatest treasure, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
And you would say

[Chorus]
"Time to rest my weary head
Take my wings and go to bed
I know you want to feel it all, my darling"
And I'd say
"Sit me down and rock me, oh
Sit me down and rock me, oh darling
Sit me down and rock me
Rock me to sleep"

[Verse 1]
I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm  a bitch in the afternoon
Every  now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle yes indeed
Ever  complex in every way
And  all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

[Hook]
I  don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And  that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

[Verse 2]
I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I mean

[Hook]
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And yes, that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

[Outro]
I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you

[Chorus]
You've got me
(You've got me)
You've got me
(You've got me)
You've got me
(You've got me)
You've got me speechless

[Verse 1]
Where you been baby
Waited for you all day
Waited for you to use the key
That opens my place
My heart starts trembling
As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opened, doorknob turned
There appeared your face

[Pre-Chorus]
Going outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
You've got me!

[Chorus]
You've got me
(You've got me)
You've got me
(You've got me)
Woh -oooh
You've got me
(You've got me)
You've got me speechless

[Verse 2]
Laying so closely
I feel your skin rubbing and touching me
Only sweat between us
Feeling you kissing and pleasing me
I rub your back
I kiss your neck
I know that you love when we touch like that
I can feel you need me
Feels so good to me
Feels so good to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Going outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
You've got me!
(You've got me)

[Chorus]
You've got me
(You've got me)
You've got me
(You've got me)
You've got me
(You've got me)
You've got me speechless

[Outro]
Yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes
Speechless, all I can say is
Yes, yes, yes
All I can say is
Yes, yes, yes, yes
Kiss me
Hold me
You've got me
Speechless

[Refrain]
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!
Don't you ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Verse 1]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Refrain]
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm!
Don't you ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Verse 2]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her
Is what I hate most
I don't want you but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on
He's so arrogant and bold
But she gone love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Bridge]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you
Why would you risk it baby is that the price I that pay?
Cause this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things
(See all the things)
(See all the things)

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type, that like to keep them on a leash though

Don't doubt yourself trust me you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip, or an ego
But what you think they all mad at me for

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I can do for you, what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom, that you're blessed to find your equal
Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me

I'll be the help, whenever you need me
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused, on your focus I can feed you

I be the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (hehe)

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
You my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star
Unless your flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

[Hook: Beyoncé]

[Verse]
If you got it, flaunt it, boy, I know you want it
While I turn around, you watch me check up on it
Ooh, you watchin' me shake it, I see it in ya face
You can't take it, it's blazin', you watch me in amazement
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it

You think that I'm teasin', but I ain't got no reason

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now  I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I  used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now  be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The  audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Baby,  seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes your smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Boy,  I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my- (OH!)

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having Déjà Vu?

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

The group's ninth album in the UK was called simply The Beatles but quickly became better known as 'The White Album'. The double-LP was issued on the fifth anniversary of the release of their second album With The Beatles - 22nd November, 1968.

The Beatles released 34 new tracks in 1968 - returning to the high level of productivity they had maintained from 1963 to 1965. The first music of the year came in March with the arrival of their seventeenth single 'Lady Madonna'. Soon after it was recorded, the Beatles flew to Rishikesh, India for several weeks of mediation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and they enjoyed a prolific period of song writing at this remote location. They began recording these new songs at Abbey Road on 30th May and studio work occupied most of their time until the final session on 16th October. Two songs from this period were released as a single on 30th August, 1968 - 'Hey Jude' and 'Revolution'. It was the first Beatles record to be pressed with the Apple label and the Parlophone imprint was also replaced for the two LP discs comprising The Beatles.

Any expectations of a cover to rival the vivid art work of Sgt. Pepper of Magical Mystery tour were immediately overturned. The outside of the sleeve was completely white was the only lettering consisting of 'The Beatles' embossed on the front and also printed on the spine with the catalogue number. Early copies also had an individual number stamped on the front. However, in contrast to the minimalistic look, some generous inserts were slipped alongside the records. There were four glossy color photographs of the individual Beatles and a large fold out poster displaying a photo collage on one side and lyrics on the other.

Despite being an expensive double album, The Beatles was a huge seller. It entered the UK chart at number one and remained there for a total of eight of the 22 weeks it was listed. In the USA, it topped the charts of nine weeks and stayed in the album chart for an initial run of 65 weeks. As with Sgt. Pepper, no singles were released from 'The White Album' in the UK and USA during the sixties.

Amid the sessions for The Beatles, the animated film Yellow Submarine was given it's UK premier on 17th July. The soundtrack LP featured four new Beatles songs and was in the shops eight weeks after the release of The Beatles.

I'm goin' through it, yeah
I know you see the tragic in it
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it

Us kids don't know what we're talking about
That we're too young to understand how the government works
We call B.S

[Bridge 2: Madonna & Emma Gonzalez]
Freedom's what you choose to do with what's been done to you

Unless you love 'em too

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
'Cause I'm going through it
Yeah, I know you see the tragic in it

To complete the many songs needed for their double-LP, The Beatles recorded regularly during twenty weeks from 30th May to 16th October 1968. The final studio date was a 24-hour marathon session to create the running order for the four sides of the album and the edits and cross-fades between the songs. The sessions mark an important turning point in their recording career because it was during this period that The Beatles first recorded on an eight-track tape machine.

Since 1964, the group had used four-track for all their album albums by but 1966, they found their musical arrangements usually required more tracks than were available. The solution was the create extra ones by copying the first four tracks to a second blank tape and simultaneously mixing some of them together to leave free as many racks as were needed for addition overdubs. 'Bouncing Down' was a time consuming process because the tracks that were being mixed together would form part of the final sound balance of the completed song so it was important to be satisfied with the mix before overdubbing commenced. With eight tracks now available, the problem was eliminated - until even more were needed.

Work began on the album using four tracks and, while some songs could be confined to these, most had to be 'bounced down' to a second, third, or even - as with 'Revolution 1' and 'Ob-LA-Di, Ob-La-Da' - a fourth tape. The Beatles' first experience of using an eight track recording at Abbey Road was during a session on 3rd September for 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. As it had been started  on four-track. the master was transferred to an eight-track machine to allow further overdubbing.

However, 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' was re-recorded on eight-track from scratch two days later with a guest appearance by Eric Clapton. and completed on 6th September with several overdubs. George's decision to ask a friend to play on his song was a significant one. Although The Beatles had previously used other musicians on their sessions, they had been from other areas of music such as classical, jazz or Indian music. For the first time, here was a star musician performing on an instrument already featured in the group.

The album's long sessions would often begin in the afternoon and continue until daybreak the next morning. There were also occastions when two songs were recorded at the same time in separate studios. In July, engineer Geoff Emerick left the sessions and did not work with the group again until nearly a year later the Abbey Road. Ken Scott, who has first sat at the mixing desk for some of the Magical Mystery Tour songs, recored and mixed two thirds of 'The White Album'. For one week, George Matin relinquished his seat in the room so that he could take a holiday and, consequently, his 21-year old production assistant Chris Thomas supervised sessions.

[Outro]
You're alone all the time
Does it ever puzzle you? Have you asked why?
Oh, baby, why fall in love and out again?
Do you really ever love or just pretend, oh, baby?
Or just pretend, oh, baby
Or just pretend, oh, baby
Why, you're alone all the time
Does it ever puzzle you? Have you asked why?
Oh, baby, why fall in love and out again?
Do you really ever love, ever love, ev-ever love?
Do you really ever love, ever love, or just pretend
Oh, baby
I’m sleeping
My fingers stay conscious and weeping
They fall on the keys then they seep in

They tell me their stories
They sound like a forest before trees
They sound like my bedroom before me

I knew her
But just as the tree grows the tumor
And someone else lived in my room first

I’m asking you gently
Why her and all my friends left me
Now they’re just emails I don’t read
Tears fill up my head
We can’t stay on this bed forever

But I sort of thought
When I left your room
You'd come running out
Say I left too soon
But it's 5 am
You should get some sleep
See you in a year
Maybe two or three

Off to college today
My first school without friends
Here’s my chance to start new
Here’s my chance to pretend
That I'm not quite as sad
As my music lets on
And I'm not quite as madly
In love with someone
Who lives oceans away
I could swim if she wanted
But she thinks it’d be best
If we both just moved on
That's not something she’d say
If she hadn’t already
I need something to break
Someone to keep me steady

I pick myself up off another floor now
Set my head upon my neck again
Guess I'll give the world another chance to end
I'll give the world another chance to show me why it probably should
And I saw plenty good
But that was long before you left me here alone
That was long before they set me free to roam
And now I think that maybe if I’d stayed at home

I’d still have a brain that’s not depression-prone
It’s weighed me down since you turned it to stone
I’ll leave it here on the side of the road
One wants not for that of which one does not know
If I lose my mind I'll lose the thought of you
And that's the only option you've left me to choose
So
I’ll stay out of my mind (x14)
I made a friend
My first in a while
He dresses in red
And a sinister smile
But he's sad like the moon
And he's scared like a child

Hate burns in his eyes
As he gently explains
"I was born in the sky
Then thrown in the flame
And if you'd felt the fire
Surely, you'd burn the same"
Am I on your side
Or just on mine?
Are you still there in every way that you were?
Am I on time?

I don't want to watch you fall in love
I don't want to watch you fall in love
Unless you’re in my arms the whole time
Unless you’re in my arms
I’ve been waiting to say that I want you so bad

I say I think your dog knows that you're leaving soon
He’s got a sadness in his eyes that I've seen before
I’d lay my head down too if you left me room
But for now, I'll keep my legs crossed on the floor
Lift me to my feet
And I'll sit back down
Waiting here for you
To come back around
I don't care if you’re
Sitting here right now
If you leave tonight
Then today won't count
Can you hear me now?
I will sprint 'till I see you
On the nearest flight if you tell me, "I need you"
Give me two or three nights then I'll fly back home
Give me two or three fights just so I can feel you
Feeling something for me
Let me know you care
If I'm losing this game
At least make it fair
‘Cause I'll need you around
But you won't be there

There were cold days
Back when I would float like a feather
Moving with the wind it could take me wherever
All my friends stayed knit into a nice warm sweater
It came undone quickly in the stormy weather
Take me somewhere better

Instead it took me here
Tried to find my place
I just found my fears
And I lost some friends
Even lost some tears
I need human touch
I need someone near
It doesn't have to be you
At least not anymore
You know that beggars can't choose
But I'm only a beggar 'cause I want you desperately bad
And I can justify whatever with the fact that I'm sad
But why am I deserving of somebody like that?
It's easier to just avoid the thought and stay on my path
She’s not my friend
She never was
I don't wanna stay till the end
This movie's killed me
Time and again
I don't need my friends this time
She said she's fine
I doubt she lied
She kissed me and she said goodbye
In the moment she cries
I die
I grab her sides
"Here's my shoulder
Bury your head"
She opened up my chest instead
It's been two years since
The last time I cried
I was gone with my friends when my grandmother died
And her youngest son called me
Tears fell from my phone
She planted a garden
And raised him beside it
He played in the soil as his mother's sunlight hit
His face and the flowers
Now they've wilted away

If you get impatient like an angry father
And decide that you want me, decide that you want her
Just come through the front door
Look me in the eyes
I heard that in Heaven bad things don't exist
But I heard the same thing goes for non-existence
So whichever one takes us
We're better off there

And I thought I heard you say
There were no losers, only winners
That's my mistake
But if I'm already a sinner, I might as well
Kill everyone who's ever told me I needed Hell
Don't offer me something I'm able to give myself
While you're up busy being stable, I'll clear the shelves
And all the seats around my table have cleared themselves
My friends are gone, but just for right now
At least I will forget them all eventually
For one who's all-loving
You turned on me quickly
The moment I left you, you turned them against me
In the name of what's right
As if they could know
This imperfect path for these imperfect people
Where you go, they follow
The fire or the steeple
But you never lead them
You simply command

[Intro: Anitta]
Hahahaha
Hey

Wi-fi, all night you my wifey
Put the ring on the finger for life me

I can see you sitting on top of me
Girl, I like it when you drop, drop your bomb on me

[Chorus]
Nanana, nanana, nanana

Nanana, nanana, explosion
Nanana, nanana, nanana
Nanana, nanana, nanana
Nanana, nanana, nanana
Nanana, nanana, explosion
All my friends are making their way
She's in bed and still feels the same
But what’s a feeling to the truth?
And I found no fact in you, in you
But things always leave
Some you'll choose
Some you will grieve
There will be dreams that don't come true
There will be things you thought you knew
Thought you knew
Stay where you are
Now I’m leaving you
But I won't go too far

I grew away from you
You're all alone in a mind made for two
But if the color starts to fade from view
Just put the paintbrush in your hand, your hand
Your hand

This year, I changed in the sense that I didn't
This year, I moved, not by foot but by inch
This year, I learned what she'd do to be smiled at
This year, the shape of my mouth never flinched
This year, the good things were far less appealing
This year, the bad won me over for good
This year, my tongue nearly lost all its feeling
This year, my lips moved much more than they should
This year, I grew till the sky filled my ears
With whispers of sadness I turned into songs
This year, I learned I can sing to a crowd
Much more honestly than I can talk to my mom
This year, I wrote down some notes in my phone
And later heard strangers recite every word
This year, I felt all their eyes and their ears
I don't want to be seen I just want to be heard
Her and all my friends left me a year ago
Maybe more, I heard that time flies when you spend it though
I used to sleep and spawn tears, those are gone
I don't think I'll cry as long as I’ve still got my girlfriend and my songs here
Speaking of the songs, I’d like to thank you for the girlfriend
Speaking of the girlfriend, thanks for staying here so long
Speaking of the friends, I'd like to thank you for the good times
And speaking of the her, I’d like to thank you for the songs

[Spoken Intro]
I love to write songs, it's one of my favorite things to do
It's very spiritual, it's a connection
I'm just the source through which it comes
I'm inspired by a lot of things that is done from the Heavens
I listen to the music and I just create from there
This is the tempo...and this is the melody...
(One, two, three, four)
Ho

[Verse 1]
We're taking over, we have the truth
This is the mission, to see it through
Don't point your finger (Shoo), not dangerous
This is our planet, you're one of us

[Chorus]
We're sending out, a major love
And this is our, message to you (Message to you)
The planets are lining up, we're bringing brighter days
They're all in line, waiting for you, can't you see
You're just another part of me
Hee hee, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Doo-doo-doo-doo
Ooh

[Outro]
Shoo, shoo
Shoo, shoo
Ooh

[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus]
He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus]
She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

[Outro]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar

He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Verse 3]

Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

Fell off so I ain't thought ya
God shames how you looking at me
So I seen you girl but I ain't saw ya

[Hook]
Uh she f*ck with me, she f*ck with me (I'd f*ck with me)
To tell the truth if I was her I'd f*ck with me (I'd f*ck with me)
A body like that she can't f*ck for free (damn)
And that ass so fat you gotta have some cheese (uh)
Do you agree, do you agree? (yes i agree)
She know everything one thousand when she f*ck with me (thousand)
Do you agree, (I agree) do you agree?
She's so fine a married man will tell his wife to leave

[Outro]
Go! Go!

[Intro]
This one's called "Picture to Burn"
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Well, state the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
And by the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
Well, there's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match an all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn
Thank you so much!
Thank you!

[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
Well, I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Da da da da

[Bridge]
Well, I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again
Oh yeah
Oh oh yeah

[Outro]
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
Thank you so much!

[Intro]
You should've said, "No"
You  should've gone home
You  should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me

[Verse 1]
It's  strange to think the songs we used to sing
The  smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even  now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
And Yyu say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You  should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge]
Well, I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me
Thank you

[Intro: Nicki Minaj & DaBaby]

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Drug lord, Griselda, I used to move weight through Delta
So stay in your place 'cause I don't wanna put you in a shelter
I'm cookin' up in the kitchen, you could be my little helper
Go to the table and ask 'em do they want the flat or the seltzer?
I go where I want I'm good, my niggas'll get them goods
So come off the chain and come off the watch, you gotta respect the jux
Queen sleazy era and they never see me ever
'Cause I send my shooters and they introduce us as soon as I pull the lever (Brr)
I say "Choke me," he do it every time that we do it
Nigga packin' like Hewlett, I told him, "Damn, nigga, you lit"
On that D goin' stupid, got my ass-shots from Cupid
You could just ask Ken, he be like, "Hadouken!" (Rrrh)

Don't think that she lied to you, nigga (Bitch)
Get caught with your ho when I'm poppin' 'em both
Now they high just like Bobby and Whitney (Haa)
Say I'm the goat, act like I don't know
But fuck it, I'm obviously winnin'
Don't make me go hit the bank and take out a hundred
To show you our pockets are different (Ha)
I'm out with your bitch and I only want knowledge
She got a lil' mileage, I'm chillin' (Uh)
You disrespect me and I'll beat your ass up
All in front of your partners and children (Ahh, ahh)
I'm the type to let a nigga think that I'm broke
Until I pop out with a million (I pop)
Take 20K and put that on your head
And make one of your partners come kill you (Yeah)
Say he fuckin' with me then he gotta grow up
'Cause this nigga gotta be kiddin' (Kiddin')
This shit, it can't fit in my pocket
I got it, like I hit the lottery, nigga (Hot, hot, hot)
Opp, I'll slap the shit out a nigga
No talkin', I don't like to argue with niggas (I don't)
Ain't gon' be no more laughin'
You see me whip out guns, I'm gon' be done shot me a nigga (No cap)

Yeah, yeah

[Spoken Intro]
So, we're gonna have the band take a little tiny break and I'm gonna play you a song that, uh, I wrote this when I was like thirteen years old and just moved to Nashville, and I knew that I wanted to end up making music and on a record label, but I didn't know how I was going to get there. And I wrote this song about it

[Verse 1]
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Verse 2]
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
I'm feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's OK

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
'Cause I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I  fake a smile so he won't see
That  I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And  she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew  talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That  I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's  the reasons for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
Thank you

[Verse 1]
She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky‚ the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

[Chorus]
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up‚ you were bigger than me
You never did‚ you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh my my my my

[Verse 2]
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said oh my my my

[Chorus]
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh my my my my

[Verse 3]
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me‚ got down on one knee

[Chorus]
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

[Outro]
And I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my my my
Thank you so much!

[Spoken Intro]
This is the song that got it all started for me
It's called "Tim McGraw"

[Verse 1]
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
"Is when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"

[Chorus]
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Ooh, think of me
Mmmm

[Outro]
He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Thank you so much

To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, nigga please don't touch
And keep talking that mess that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And, it's my name that's on that jag
So come move your bags, let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard

So don't you ever for a second get to thinking

[Verse 2]
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' bout, I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Bridge]
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing
Nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you
I won't lose a wink of sleep
Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you is so easy

[Interlude]
To the left, to the left

[Verse 1]
Best thing I ever saw
Was a man who loved his wife
In a place where things were good
I felt peace in the neighbourhood
That feeling in the air
Something was definitely there
It was a time when things were good
I felt peace in the neighbourhood

[Chorus]
I was there, I really was
At the centre of a love vibration
People sharing with their friends
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out

[Verse 2]
Then i woke up from my dream
To see things as they really are
People struggling to survive
How can peace hope to stay alive?

[Chorus]
Well i was there... I felt so good
At the centre of a love vibration
People caring for their world
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out

[Outro]
Best thing I ever saw
I saw a man who loved his wife
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood

[Verse 1]
I will always be hoping, hoping
You will always he holding, holding
My heart in your hand. I will understand
I will understand someday, one day
You will understand always
Always from now until then

[Chorus]
When it will be right, I don't know
What it will be like, I don't know
We live in hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

[Verse 2]
And I wouldn't mind knowing, knowing
That you wouldn't mind going, going along with my plan

[Chorus]
When it will be right, I don't know
What it will be like, I don't know
We live in hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

[Outro]
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance, I will understand
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance, I will understand
Hope of deliverance

[Verse 1]
Step out into the dawn
You pray 'til, you pray 'til the lights come on
And then you feel like you've just been born
Yeah, you come to raise me up
When I'm beaten and broken up
And now I'm back in the arms I love

[Pre-Chorus]
And I think I just died
I think I just died
Yeah, I think I just died
I think I just died

[Chorus]
And went to Heaven
And went to Heaven, whoa

[Verse 2]
Beaten and bathed in blood
I'm hit by, I'm hit by your love and drug
And now you've c-come to raise me up

[Pre-Chorus]
And I think I just died
I think I just died
Yeah, I think I just died

[Chorus]
And went to Heaven
And went to Heaven
Whoa, and went to Heaven

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, oh

[Bridge]
It's such a night, such a beautiful night
It's such a view, such a beautiful sight
I think I just, oh, I think I just died, oh

[Chorus]
And went to Heaven
And went to Heaven
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
We're gonna be birds and fly
We're gonna set the world alight
We're gonna lose ourselves tonight, whoa
We're gonna be birds and fly
We're gonna set the world alight
We're gonna lose ourselves tonight, oh
In Heaven (Heaven)
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may noy last long

We can work it out
We can work it out

Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting my friend
I have always thought, that it's a crime
So I will ask you, once, again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out

Life is very short, and there's no time
For fussing and fighting my friend
I have always thought, that it's a crime
So I will ask you, once, again

Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long

We can work it out
We can work it out

[Chorus 1]
Well, I heard the news
There's good rocking tonight
Well, I heard the news
Everybody rocking tonight

[Chorus 2]
I say, well, why don't you meet me
Behind the barn
Don't you be worried
I'll do you no harm
I want you to bring
Along my rocking shoes
'Cause tonight I'm gonna rock away
All my blues

There's good rocking tonight

[Chorus 3]

[Verse 1]
There was a girl who loved a biker
She used to follow him across america
But the biker didn't like her
She didn't care, she still persisted
Though her brother said she was twisted
And the family said they wouldn't miss her
Anyway

[Chorus]
She loved the biker like an icon
Gazing at his picture everyday
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away

[Verse 2]
She did her best to fix a meeting
She pulled it off one night in hollywood
When he met her he couldn't let her get away
He didn't ask for her permission
He took advantage of her position
But he was always her ambition
Anyway

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away

[Verse 3]
The family tried so hard to find her
They showed her picture across america
But no trace of her sweet face
Was ever found

[Chorus]

[Outro]
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away
She loved the biker like an icon

[Verse]
To lead a better life, I need a love of my own
Here
Making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
I want her everywhere
And if she’s beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to meet her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I will be here, there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere

[Chorus 1]
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
I'm going to Kansas City baby
Kansas City here I come, ah huh
They got some crazy little women there
I'm going to get me one

[Verse 1]
I'm going to be standing on the corner
12th Street and Vine
I'm going to be standing on the corner, baby
12th Street and Vine
With my Kansas City baby and a mug of Kansas City wine

[Chorus 2]
Well, I might take a plane, I might take a train
But if I have to walk, yeah, I'm going just the same

[Chorus 1]
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
I'm going to Kansas City baby
Kansas City here I come, ah huh
They got some crazy little women there
I'm going to get me one

[Chorus 2]
Well, I might take a plane, I might take a train
But if I have to walk, yeah, I'm going just the same

[Chorus 1]
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
I'm going to Kansas City baby
Kansas City here I come, ah huh
They got some crazy little women there
I'm going to get me one

[Han-Tyumi]
Hello
My name is Han-Tyumi
I am a cyborg
Born
If you may call it that
In a world that is dense and black
Created without a desire to draw breath
Without a desire to have being
Without a yearning  just to be
I'd like my desire back
My life back
My soul back
My humanity
Oh how I long for it
In the presence of a mirror
My sensory foax-organs detect discontent on my facial image
I cry a digital tear
Motor fluid
Escaping to the floor, it reflects my silhouette
Frigid, slouched, callous
My smell escapes me
A rancid odour
I am everywhere
I am light
I am a reflection
I am that which I am
And I am violent
And I want it to end
Stillness from the grinding gears
I am a raging droid, with a full tank of propellant
Flick the switch
Turn them off
Standby
Cut the cord
Death is a lamb in a wolf’s clothes
A blessing from the lord satan
I am on the altar
I want it
The saccharine of eternal rest
I wish to consume its sickly syrup and lick it from my many fingers
Take me into the moonless night
I need it
Any way I pass will do
A noble death
Or a coward's death
A hero's death
Or a lonely death
To die in the arms of a lover
Or the arms of an alien
I desire my cache of experience to pulsate through my quasi-synapses
And then to be gone
Expired
Perish
Fallen
Dead
Forevermore
Whoa I said it once babe
Now I'm gonna say it (say it) say it again
To each his own
Do what you want to do

I'm gonna keep on doing what I'm doing
Til I can't do what I'm doin no more
No no
I'm gonna keep on doing what I'm doing
Til I can't do what I'm doin no more
Good god

I'm going straight ahead
Just like I said
I might do some good
I wish I could

I got to keep on doing what I'm doing
Til I can't do it no more
No no
No No no no no
Yeah
Keep on doing what I'm doing
Til I can't do what I'm doing no more
Look out y'all
I'm gonna keep on doing what I'm doing
Til I can't do what I'm doing no more
Keep on doing (get on y'all)
What you're doing
Til I can't
Do what you're doing no more
To the children (Keep on doing)
All over the world (What you doing)
Keep on (Til you can't)
Do what you're doing no more
You know what you doing
But you keep on doing it yeah (keep on doing)
If that's what you're doing children (what you're doing)
Until you can't
Do what you're doing no more

And I like what you do

Keep on doing (all over the world)
What you're doing (let the sunshine in)
Til you can't (yes children)
Do what you're doing no more

Keep on doing
What you're doing (if that's what you're doing children)
Til you can't (as long as you don't let nobody stop you now)
Do it now!

Keep on doing (keep on doing)
What you're doing (lord if it feels good)
Til you can't (oh do it children)
Do what you're doing no more

Keep on doing (if that's what you're doing)
What you're doing (if you want to make love)
Til you can't (do it children)
Do what you're doing no more
Keep on doing (do it children)
What you're doing (lord if it feels good)
Til you can't (go on and do it now)
Do what you're doing no more

[Verse 1]
Cuttin' the page
Things are looking up
That time is out of my range
One drink's what lead to the change
Out on my own
Kicked out of the show
I'll take what's mine and I'll go
It's just like my own brothers used to say

[Chorus]
There's somethin' wrong with this world
I feel it coming on
And contradictions take their toll
Is that where we went wrong?
And somethin' struck me
It struck me deep
It knocked me to my knees
Roddy, step on back from me (Ah)

[Verse 2]
So man in the mirror
Make another home here
You're put together but clear
You're lackin' substance not fear
So come right inside
Welcome to my new life
Separation intwined
And I can't keep it straight inside my head

[Chorus]
There's something wrong with this world
I feel it coming on
And contradictions take their toll
Is that where we went wrong?
And something struck me
It struck me deep
It knocked me to my knees
Roddy, step on back from me (Ah)
(Step on back)

[Outro]
(Amen)
(Amen)
(I said amen
Amen
I said amen)
(Amen)
(Amen)
Ending retrograde
I told you mistakes were made
We're ending retrograde
I told you mistakes were made
We're in
Retrograde
Retrograde

[Verse 1]
Remember when we were young
We dreamt about getting older and driving fancy cars
I wanted you to give me your heart
And you said, "I do" while I was holding you tight
Oh, tonight it's not a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want your love inside my hands with your signature
Oh whoa, oh whoa
And you are the girl I want
You're the one thing that sends me drifting through the sky

[Chorus]
Every time that you fall into my arms
You are the one thing that triggers my heart
Take me to the stars, up, up and away
And it don't matter how far, wherever you are
There is nothing that can keep us apart
We can travel to Mars, up, up and away

[Verse 2]
Remember we would sit and stare
At the sun going down, and the stars are shining, whoa-whoa
And we ain't gotta make-believe because you really love me
So I'ma give you everything I go, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want your love inside my hands with your signature
Oh whoa (Yeah), oh whoa (Yeah)
And you are the girl I want
You're the one thing that sends me drifting through the sky

[Chorus]
Every time that you fall into my arms
You are the one thing that triggers my heart (Oh, oh)
Take me to the stars, up, up and away (Oh-whoa)
(It don't matter)
And it don't matter how far, wherever you are
There is nothing that can keep us apart
We can travel to Mars (Hey), up, up and away (Hey, hey)
Every time that you fall into my arms
You are the one thing that triggers my heart
Take me to the stars, up, up and away
And it don't matter how far, wherever you are
There is nothing that can keep us apart
We can travel to Mars, up, up and away

[Verse]
Hands are tied
Someone's in my ear from the other side
Tellin' me that I should pay you no mind
Wanted you to not be with me all night
Wanted you to not stay with me all night
I know, you know, who that person is to me
Doesn't really change things

[Chorus]
I know you're scared of dating, falling for me
Shorty, surely you know me
Right here for you always
You know, I don't ever change
Right here for you always
You know I don't ever change
Right here for you

[Bridge]
Imaan you make me want to do things, love you
Like I'm supposed to
You make me want to love you
Like I'm supposed to
You make me want to love you
Like I'm supposed to, remind you
Ayy

[Chorus]
I know you're scared of dating, falling for me
Shorty, by now you know me
Right here for you always
You know, I don't ever change
Right here for you always
You know I don't ever change
Right here for you

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow  I'll miss you

[Verse]
I tried to get over you
I tried to find something new
But all i could ever do
Was fill my time
With thoughts of you
I tried to go somewhere old
To search for my pot of gold
But all i could ever hold
Inside my mind
Were thoughts of you

[Chorus 1]
I hear your music
And it's driving me wild
Familiar rhythms
In a different style
I hear your music
And it's driving me wild again

[Chorus 2]
Don't want to let you take me down
Don't want to get hurt second time around
Don't want to walk that lonely road again

[Chorus 1]
I hear your music
And it's driving me wild
Familiar rhythms
In a different style
I hear your music
And it's driving me wild again

[Chorus 2]
Don't want to let you take me down
Don't want to get hurt second time around
Don't want to walk that lonely road again

Don't want to let you take me down
Don't want to get hurt second time around
Don't want to walk that lonely road again

[Chorus]
They were angels with dirty faces
'Til they fell from somebody's graces
They were soldiers without a mission
But they were angels
They had a vision

[Verse 1]
Like Robin Hood they were rebels
Some say they kept their company with the devil
No money, no social graces
But they could make men tremble in higher places

[Chorus]
They were angels with dirty faces
'Til they fell from somebody's graces
They were soldiers without a mission
But they were angels
They had a vision

[Verse 2]
They fought frustration with laughter
Made men forget just what they were running after
Holy life without any purpose
Taught them to trust their feelings beneath the surface

[Chorus]
They were angels with dirty faces
'Til they fell from somebody's graces
They were soldiers without a mission
But they were angels
They had a vision
They had dirty faces
They had dirty faces

[Post-Chorus]
Black is white and day is night
Wrong can be right in the best light
Life is a game, it's a perfect place
For angels with dirty faces, dirty faces

[Chorus]
They were angels with dirty faces
'Til they fell from somebody's graces
They were soldiers without a mission
But they were angels
They had a vision

[Post-Chorus]
Black is white and day is night
Wrong can be right in the best light
Life is a game, it's a perfect place
For angels with dirty faces, dirty faces

[Chorus]
They were angels with dirty faces
'Til they fell from somebody's graces
They were soldiers without a mission
But they were angels
They had a vision
They had dirty faces
Oh-oh-oh
They had dirty faces

[Chorus]
They were angels with dirty faces
'Til they fell from somebody's graces
They were soldiers without a mission
But they were angels
They had a vision
They had dirty faces
Oh-oh-oh
They had dirty faces
Oh-oh-oh

[Dr. Dre]
So materialistic and I love it

Now I was gonna say it nicely
Girl, I changed my mind
I know what you're tryna say
Sunshine brings laughter
Rainclouds brings me down
I know forever after
I need the light, keep me ground
Whoa mama, I get so lonely
In the rain, feel so blue
I want you to remember, I'm your one and only, woman
Hey baby, hey baby, love you true!
Dream boy, on the river
Oh blue skies, on my mind
Ah the fields, seemed to glitter
I know, I know, will bring you down!
Ah baby, I've got some thinking
Whoa mama, strip my mind
Hey baby, I took a drinking
I know, I know come around!
In the light, in the light
Oh girl, stop your crying
Oh woman, dry your eyes
Whoa tomorrow, the sun will be shining
You won't remember all the tears you cried!
Hey baby, I think you wonder
Hey baby, tears of joy
Woman, tears of laughter
Sweet ma, sweet ma, I'm coming home!
's all you got to do yeah!
With the light
Everybody needs the light
The light
's all you got to do now!
Light, light, light, in the light!
Light, light, light, in the light!

[Verse 1]

If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
If it keeps on rainin'‚ levee's goin' to break
When the levee breaks I'll have no place to stay
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Lord mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh well‚ oh well‚ oh well
Don't it make you feel bad
When you're tryin' to find your way home
You don't know which way to go?
If you're goin' down South
They got no work to do
If you don't know about Chicago
Cryin' won't help you prayin' won't do you no good
Now cryin' won't help you prayin' won't do you no good
When the levee breaks mama you got to move
All last night sat on the levee and moaned
All last night sat on the levee and moaned
Thinkin' 'bout me baby and my happy home
Going to Chicago
Going to Chicago
Sorry but I can't take you
Going down, going down now, going down
Going down now‚ going down
Going down, going down, going down
Going down now‚ going down
Going down now, going down
Going down now, going down
Going d-d-d-d-down
Woo, woo
Asked sweet mama, Let me be her kid
She said, "You might get hurt if you don't keep it hid"

Well I know my baby, If I see her in the dark
I said I know my rider, If I see her in the dark

Now, I goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by my side
Still barrelhouse, If it's on the riverside, yeah
I know my baby, Lord, I said, "is really sloppy drunk"
I know my mama, Lord, a brownskin, but she ain't no plum

See my baby, tell her, Tell her hurry home
Had no lovin', since my baby been gone
See my baby, Tell hurry on home
I ain't had, Lord, my right mind, Since my rider's been gone

Hey, she promises, She's my rider
I wanna tell you, She's my rider
I know you're mine, She's my rider
She ain't but sixteen, But she's my rider
I'm goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by side
Anybody argue with me man, I'll keep them satisfied
Well, see my baby, tell her, Tell her the shape I'm in
Ain't had no lovin', Lord, since you know when

Spoken: Why don't you come into my kitchen

She's a kindhearted lady. She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman. She studies evil all the time

Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze it so hard, I'll fall right out of bed
Squeeze my lemon, 'til the juice runs down my leg

Spoken: I wonder if you know what I'm talkin' about

Oh, but the way that you squeeze it girl
I swear I'm gonna fall right out of bed

She's a good rider
She's my kindhearted lady
I'm gonna take my rider by my side
I said her front teeth are lined with gold
She's gotta mortgage on my body, got a lien on my soul
She's my brownskin sugar plum...

[Verse 1]
Bright light almost blinding
Black night still there shining
I can't stop keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew
Had a friend she once told me
"You got love, you ain't lonely"
Now she's gone and left me only
Looking for what I knew

[Verse 2]
Met a man on the roadside dying
Without a friend‚ there's no denying
You're incomplete‚ they'll be no finding
Looking for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs you
Don't let them down‚ altho' it grieves you
Some day you'll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew
Silent woman in the night, you came
Took my seed from my shaking frame
Same old fire, another flame
And the wheel rolls on

Silent woman through the flames, you come
From the deep behind the sun
(?)
Left me barely holding on

With blazing eyes, you see my trembling hand
When we know the time has come
Lose my senses, lose command
Feel your healing rivers run

Is it every time I fall, I think this is the one
In the darkness can you hear me call
Another day has just begun
Another day

Silent woman, my face is changed
Some know in ways to come
Feel my fire needs a brand new flame
And the wheel rolls on
Rolls on
Rolls on
Rolls on...

[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

[Outro]
Combat, I'm ready for combat

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna to tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

Without You
Figure it out Without You
Without You

[Verse 2]
Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna to tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

Without You
Figure it out Without You
Without You
This is the fourth by the four. 'Please, Please Me', 'With The Beatles', 'Hard Day's Night'. That's three. Now...'Beatles For Sale'.

The young men themselves aren't for sale. Money, noisy though it is, doesn't talk that loud. But you can buy this album - you probably have, unless you're just browsing, in which case don't leave any dirty fingerprints on the sleeve!

It isn't all currency or current though. There's priceless history between the covers. None of us is getting any younger. When, in a generation or so, a radio-active, cigar-smoking child, picnicking on Saturn, asks you what The Beatles affair was all about - ;Did you actually know them?'- don't try to explain all about the long hair and the screams! Just play the child a few tracks from this album and he'll probably understand what it is all about. The kids of AD 2000 will draw from this music much the sam sense of well being and warmth we do today.

For the magic of The Beatles is, I suspect, timeless and ageless. It has broken all frontiers and barriers. It has cut through differences of race, age, and class. It is adored by the world.

This album has some lovely samples of Beatles music. It has, for instance, eight new titles wrought by the incomparable John Lennon and Paul Mccartney, and mingling with the new, there are six numbers culled from the rhythmic wealth of the past extraordinary decade; pieces like Kansas City, and Rock and Roll Music. Marvelous.

Many hours and hard day's nights of devoted industry went into the production of this album. It isn't a potboiling quick-sale any-old-thing-will-do-for-christmas mixture.

At least three of the Lennon-Mccartney songs were seriously considered as single releases until John popped up with I Feel Fine. These three were Eight Days A Week, No Reply and I'm A Loser. Each would have topped the charts, but as it is they are an adornment to this LP, and a lesson to other artists. As on other albums, The Beatles have tossed in far more value than the market usually demands.

There are few gimmicks or recording tricks, though for effect, The Beatles and their recording manager George Martin have slipped in some novelties. Like Paul on Hammond organ to introduce drama into Mr. Moonlight, which also, and for the first time, has George Harrison applying a thump to an elderly African drum because Ringo was busy elsewhere in the studio, playing bongos. George's thump remains on the track. The bongos were later dropped. Ringo plays timpani in Every Little Thing, and on the Rock and Roll Music track George Martin joins John and Paul on one piano. On Words of Love, Ringo plays a packing case.

Beyond this, it is a straightforward 1964 disc-making. Quite the best of it's kind in the world. There is little or nothing on the album that cannot be reproduced on stage, which is, as students and critics of pop-music know, not always the case.

Here it is then. The best album yet-quite definitely, says John, Paul, George, and Ringo-full of everything which made the four the biggest attraction the world has ever known. Full of raw John and Melodic Paul; a number from George, and a bonus from Ringo. For those who like to know who does exactly what, there are details alongside each title.

Yeah, woah, woah
I just been feeling like, it's all clickin', ya know?
Hit-Boy
Like it's all working out, and I'm 'bout to work out
Colossal
B.I.G, look

[Verse]
The universe been throwing me all the signs except stop it
Niggas been plotting on me, but here's the plot twist
I can't throw fits no more unless it's profits
Lord, why you keep boxing me in, 'cause I'm God's gift?
I might set my mic back up in the closet, though
Just to give myself that same feeling from '04
When my hunger was more, advice to you and yours
They say it's over for you, that's when you go overboard, okay?
Shit, I didn't take a break, my nigga, I broke
Broke my heart, broke my soul, don't cry for me though
If you don't break nothing down then it's no room to grow
One mental block lead to another, shit it's dominos
Mixtape Sean, but I'm in album mode, ooh
She give me praise, I love her angel face
Ass so fat she could work at TSA (Damn)
I went to school at Cass, Aaliyah went to DSA a mile away
Just letting you know the types of kings and queens my city make and I probably need a parade
All the soldiers with me, this shit like green beret
So legendary, I'ma probably need a day (June 29th)
Forgot I already got one, be dammed if I'm not one
You talking 'bout the hottest in the city, most influential rappin' ass niggas and I'm the top one
Me and Em' knocked down doors for y'all that was locked once
I know they may never get me, I still put on for the city like the Lions first round picked me
I ain't been fucking I been too busy, I got two phones they both business, I got fake ones tryin' to end me
I got real ones gon' defend me like a fucking co-defendant
I got Don Life on my pendant, I’m conditioned to do the distance
And I just set up the pensions, family set like my intentions
Been balancing trying to keep my company with the girls who wanna keep me company
You know the ones who claim they over me but would much rather be under me
Is confident and been through too much just to be done with me
And you know that shit gets stressful right?
Shit taxing, the same thing that got Wesley Snipes
And you know how I'm rocking, rocking Elvis Presley white
You know highlight reelin'
All highlights like we sitting on top of museum ceilings
No more resisting
If you ain't on my frequency, you out of tune and not tuned in
To break the unbreakable, escape the unescapable
'Til you push your fucking limits, you don't even know what's capable
Fuck that shit that you believe in, I believe in me
Talkin' on they phones and PC like they off that PCP
Bitch, I spit that Eazy-E, face to face, Smack DVD
I don't got no time for hanging out and all that E-T-C
Just cut the check, C-T-C, Godbody my physique
I can look inside your eyes and know exactly what you mean
Fuck you mean? Energy the first language that I speak
No facade, I belong in the Palace of Versailles with a queen by my side
In this hot girl summer, I'm just trying to find a wife
Visualizing from every island that's on Hawaii
With my team on each side, like ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
With the last laugh like Kawhi
And you know that you that one when you beat all the other odds
I keep one foot planted at home and the other one on a swivel though
Gotta keep 'em both 'cause this shit get way too pivotal
All the work is analog, all the payment digital
When tempers tend to flare up, I'm the one to be cool since preschool
I know which ones that's been rocking with me, dawg, since the prequel
Just be cool
I know your favorite one, dawg, I'm 'bout to drop the sequel
Nigga, this just the preview
Don

[Outro]
Strike to claim it, a strike to claim it
And he got it
Goddammit, yes, that is why I did it
Another five, are you kidding me?
That's right
Who do you think you are?
I am
You gave me something
I understand
You gave me loving in the palm of my hand

I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you

I want to tell you
And now's the time
I want to tell you that you're going to be mine

I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you

You gave me something
I understand
You gave me loving in the palm of my hand

I can't tell you how I feel
My heart is like a wheel
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Let me roll it
Let me roll it to you
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird fly Blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Thank you

[Chorus 1]
12345 let's go for a drive
678910 let's go there and back again

[Verse 1]
Something's open it's my heart
If something's missing it's when we're apart
If something's good it's when we're back together again
Nothing's wrong it's just insane
Nothing's right until you're back again
Nothing's broken when it's softly spoken
And we're walking slowly down the lane

[Chorus 2]
Why don't we drive in the rain
Straight to the eye of the hurricane
Go for a ride in the driving rain
12345 let's go for a drive
678910 ooh ooh
12345 let's go for a drive
678910 let's go there and back again
Baby baby

[Verse 2]
You come walking through my door
Like the one that i've been waiting for
Letting sunshine in the darkest places when i've been going there again
So why don't we drive in the rain
Straight to the eye of the hurricane

[Chorus 2]
Why don't we drive in the rain
Straight to the eye of the hurricane
Go for a ride in the driving rain
12345 let's go for a drive
678910 ooh ooh
12345 let's go for a drive
678910 let's go there and back again
Baby baby

[Bridge]
In the driving rain
Why don't we drive
In the driving rain

[Chorus 1]
12345 ooh ooh
678910 let's go back again

[Outro]
12345 let's go for a drive
678910 let's go there and back again
You come walking through my door

[Chorus 1]
How can I hope to reach your love
Help  me to discover
What  it is you're thinking of

[Chorus 2]
Because when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity
Inside  your loving flame

[Chorus 3]
What  am I to do
If I don't have you
I'll  be feeling blue
Just sitting here without you
You could be the one
To chase my blues away, away

[Chorus 4]
So  tell me how, how to reach your love
Help me to discover
What it is you're thinking of

[Chorus 2]
Because when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity
Inside your loving flame

[Chorus 3]
What am I to do
If I don't have you
I'll be feeling blue
Just sitting here without you
You could be the one
To chase my blues away, away

[Chorus 2]
Because when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity
Inside your loving flame

[Chorus 4]
So tell me how, how to reach your love
Help me to discover
What it is you're thinking of

[Outro]
How can I hope to reach your love
Here forever in your loving flame

[Verse 1]
Every night, I just want to go out
Get out of my head
Every day, I don't want to get up
Get out of my bed
Every night, I want to play out
And every day, I want to do
But tonight I just want to stay in and be with you, ooh
And be with you

[Chorus]
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-ooh, mm-hmmh
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-ooh, mm-hmmh

[Verse 2]
Every day, I lean on a lamp post
I'm wasting my time
Every night, I lay on a pillow
I'm resting my mind
Every morning brings a new day
And every night, that day is through
But tonight I just want to stay in and be with you, ooh
And be with you

[Outro]
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-ooh, mm-hmmh, believe me mama
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, ah
Oo-ooh, mm-hmmh
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh
Oo-hoo-ooh, mm-hmmh

[Verse 1]
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking 'til I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone

[Chorus]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Verse 2]
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night

[Chorus]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Bridge]
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

[Verse 3]
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

[Chorus]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Bridge]
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

[Verse 4]
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

[Chorus]
We can work it out
We can work it out
And if I said I really knew you well
What would your answer be
If you were here today?
Ooh ooh ooh, here today

Well, knowing you
You'd probably laugh and say that we were worlds apart
If you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, here today

But as for me, I still remember how it was before
And I am holding back the tears no more
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I love you
Ooh, ooh

What about the time we met? (What about the time?)
Well, I suppose that you could say that we were playing hard to get
Didn't understand a thing, but we could always sing
What about the night we cried? (What about the night?)
Because there wasn't any reason left to keep it all inside
Never understood a word, but you were always there with a smile
And if I say I really loved you and was glad you came along
When you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, for you were in my song
Ooh ooh ooh, here today

[Verse 1]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Bridge]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Verse 3]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Refrain]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 1]
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Verse 2]
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Refrain]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 3]
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

[Chorus]
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?

[Intro - Lainie Kazan and Katy Perry]
Look at those beautiful eyes
She reminds me so much of me
Starting out in a brand new world
Who she gonna be?
Will she follow everything that's been said?
Maybe listen to her heart instead
Maybe she needs to be free
She got that from me

[Verse 1]
What you get is what you see
It's a fantasy life, but it's real to me
And I'll do what I want when I want to do it
I didn't want to live in a box or mansion fault with doors and locks so I never let anyone put me through it

[Chorus]
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Give it up to you
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Do it all for you

[Verse Two]
They all talk, talk, talking at me
Telling me who I am, what to do with my body
And I'll do what I want when I want to do it
Grandma, soon I'll see you too when I overdose, tripping on my shoes
Be the next Queen of Pop

[Chorus]
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Give it up to you
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Do it all for you

[Bridge]
(Instrumental chimes and hymns)
Give it up to you
Do it all for you

[Chorus]
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Give it up to you
Freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it (Spirit)
Do it all for you

[Outro]
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
Can't you see?
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
That's all I want from me

[Verse 1]
I don't care what you did before
Tonight, girl, you, I’ma give you what you been waitin' for
I'll break it down, me on you
I just came here to get it started on the dancefloor
Ooh, your body, I’m feeling it under my skin, in my bones
Craving you, oh my God
I don't wanna see you leaving, so

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, you, girl
You're the one that I need
Can you take my hand
And dance with me?

[Chorus]
So we can party and dance
Leave a little for me, girl
Won't you party and dance?
Leave a little for me, girl

[Intro]
To lead a better life I need my love to be here

[Verse 1]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

[Verse 2]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus]
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Chorus]
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

[Outro]
I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere

[Verse 1]
It was written that I would love you
From the moment I opened my eyes
And the minute when I first saw you
Gave me life under calico skies

[Chorus]
I will hold you for as long as you'd like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
Always looking for ways to love you
Never failing to fight at your side
While the angels of love protect us
From the inner most secrets we hide

[Chorus]
I'll hold you for as long as you'd like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life

[Verse 3]
Long live all of us crazy soldiers
Who were born under calico skies
May we never be called to handle
All the weapons of war we despise

[Chorus]
I'll hold you for as long as you'd like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life
I'll hold you for as long as you'd like
I'll love you for the rest of my
For the rest of my life

[Intro]
Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle

[Chorus]
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

[Verse 1]
I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand

[Chorus]
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

[Verse 2]
I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see
Oh, what you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean

[Bridge]
I love you

[Verse 3]
I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm telling you so you'll understand

[Chorus]
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

[Outro]
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle

[Verse 1]
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way, the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight

[Hook]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S.S.R (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Been away so long, I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey, disconnect the phone

[Hook]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Chorus]
Well, the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
Oh, come on!

[Guitar Solo: Paul McCartney]

[Hook]
Yeah, I'm back in the U.S.S.R

That Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind

[Verse 3]
Show me round your snow-peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm

[Hook]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R. (hey)
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

[Outro]
Oh, let me tell you, honey
Hey, I'm back, I'm back in the U.S.S.R
Hey, it's so good to be here
Yeah, back in the U.S.S.R

[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
And maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time
You hung me on a line
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

[Bridge]
Baby, I'm a man, and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Maybe I'm a man, and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me to understand?
Ooh-ah

[Guitar solo: Paul McCartney]

[Bridge]
Baby, I'm a man, and maybe I'm a lonely man
Who's in the middle of something
That he doesn't really understand
Maybe I'm a man, and maybe you're the only woman
Who could ever help me
Baby, won't you help me to understand?
Ooh-ah

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time
And maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song
You right me when I'm wrong
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

Oh, oh, oh
Hey-hey-hey!
Oh, oh
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh

[Guitar solo: Paul McCartney]

[Verse 1]
And when I go away
I know my heart can stay with my love
It's understood, it's in the hands of my love
And my love does it good

Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good

[Verse 2]
And when the cupboard's bare
I'll still find something there with my love
It's understood, it's everywhere with my love
And my love does it good

Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good

[Chorus]
Oh, I love, oh, my love
Only my love holds the other key to me
Oh, my love, oh, my love
Only my love does it good to me
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good

[Verse 3]
Don't ever ask me why
I never say goodbye to my love
It's understood, it's everywhere with my love
And my love, she does it good

Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good

He lets me wear the crown
I do my best to make him proud

[Pre-Chorus]
Now all my super ladies, I got my baby
If you got your baby, baby (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body

Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air (Oh, oh, oh)
Move your body, move your body

My rock is shining bright
Even if he ain't by my side
He makes sure that I glow
I make sure everybody knows

[Bridge]
Step up, step up, let your hair down
Pop, drop, and lock it, go all out
If, if he rocks, tear up the crowd
Dance for your papi

Move your body
Llégale, llégale
Suéltate el pelo
Levántate, cae y asegúralo
Ve con todo
Si él es lo máximo, azota baldosa
Baila para tu papi

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh)
Don't ask for permission
Bon appétit
Sometimes I can't be friendly
Copperhead, copperhead
I just don't got it in me
But I heard what you said, I heard what you said

My dead idols sprawled all over the floor
Some young bossa girl telling me to want more
I'm saving this for next time
I'm saving this for next time
I'm saving this for next time and you wonder why

Sometimes I can't be friendly
Copperhead, copperhead
I just don't got it in me
But I heard what you said, I heard what you said

The lay of the land has become a chore
Hit me with your lips and I start to see more
I'm saving you for next time
I'm saving you for next time
I'm saving you for next time and you wonder why
Don't ask for permission
Bon appétit
Bon appétit
Bon appétit
Bon appétit
Can you pick me up?
I will be taken for a ride
Do you still taste of fire
And do you still provide

Burns in the first degree
The first degree
Burns in the first degree
In desire
Fantasy has never stopped them
You don't think about the rules
You forgot them


Who has time to think about what hurts?
I said no no no
I do it for a sport


Supermoon

Smiling in the mirror bright
I wish I could put on the

Who's that handsome devil on the other side
Oh that's right
Walking the tile floor
Seems like forever plus one more
I just wanna smoke on the street outside
But I'm hypnotized by the black and white

Who has time to think about what hurts?
I said no no no
I do it for a sport

Supermoon

Smiling in the mirror bright
I wish I could put on the

[Intro]
You know my brothers and I was raised in Cincinnati
Cincinnati Ohio
And I remember when we were kids we used to walk to the woods
And go black berry picking
Swinging our baskets on our arms
Skipping down the road, you know
And Kelly used to have an expression, you used to say back then
We made a song out of that expression
I remember the words of it
It used to go a little like this

The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
He said these words
The blacker the berry he said the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry sweeter the juice

You know he digged black berries so much
And everywhere he would go he would use that as his excuse you know
Staying out late at night
And my brother Rudolph he used to like strawberries, if I remember correctly, at the time
And at the time my thing was wild cherries
I remember the three of us used to steal tomatoes
And lay on the ground and peel all kind of ice potatoes 

[?]
Saying
The blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice
Alright
Lord have mercy

Yeah, yeah
We used to strip down bananas
And throw the peelings away at the same time in the street, you know
And when it got hot we just drank all the lemonade we could get
Til we knocked ourselves clean off our feet
And we walked along
Singing the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
Come on y'all
Black berry
The sweeter the juice
Help me sing this song
Black berries
The sweeter, the sweet the juice
Now how would you look eating a green berry, you know
What's the use
Swing you basket on your arm
Sing it sing it sing this song
The blacker the berry
The blacker the berry
Yeah yeah
The sweeter the juice
I like black berries
And everywhere I go, that's my excuse
I can still hear them singing the song
If you listen hard enough you'll hear
The sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry
Blacker the berry
I like black berries
That's my excuse

Black black black
Sweeter the juice
Sing it one more time
Little baby
The sweeter the juice

I like black berries
I like black berries
That's my excuse

Sing, sing sing the song
Blacker the berry
Sweeter the juice
Blacker the berries
Sweeter the juice

I like black berries
I like black berries
That's my excuse

We would wander along
Sing sing sing the song
I like black berries
I like black berries
That's my excuse
You never call me about the good news
I'm down in the city, so what's the use

Traffic oh yeah‚ alright

The barometric pressure is out of control
I can't wake up when it's like this
The raindrops just let me go‚ let me go

I'd stage tage a coup to get to you‚ alright
I'd stage a coup to get to you

Inconvertible...I can't get through
My denim is soaked, is this a big joke
I'm calling direct to you

I'd stage a coup to get to you, alright
I'd stage a coup to get to you‚ alright
I'd stage a coup to get to you, alright
I'd stage a coup to get to you, alright
Is there another?
Is there another?
Tell me better‚ is there another?
Is there another?
Tell me better
Is there another?
Is there another?

So how are you?

[Prince]
How are you?

(Vanessa)
Fine

[Prince]
Fine
(Vanessa)
Excuse me, but ah, what's up with your voice?

[Prince]
It's a special phone, a tone box

(Vanessa)
A tongue box. Oh, l-like in the movie Barbarella

[Prince]
Yeah, gives me courage, you know
Like a veil I can hide behind
It talks at, around, through her

(Vanessa)
Okay, so why are you giving me an interview?

[Prince]
Because I want you

(Vanessa)
Pardon me?

[Prince]
To tell the truth
(Vanessa)
Oh - well, I will if you will
For example, the first song of your opera

[Prince]
Ah, the opera

(Vanessa)
Why don't you tell me your real name

[Prince]
My name is Victor

(Vanessa)
That is not the truth and you know it
How old are you?

[Prince]
I'm into my 5th soul now so that makes me three hundred

(Vanessa)
Why do you pretend to be amazed?

[Prince]
And twenty
I'm amazed at your beauty
I saw you on television
(Vanessa)
320 hmm, don't sweat it honey, I'm too young for you
Although rumor has it that the crown princess of Cairo
Is now a member of the NPG
Are you there?

[Prince]
Ahem

(Vanessa)
Do you know that the princess is 16 years old?
How 'bout this for a story: "320 year old robs the cradle"
What a scandal

[Prince]
Scandal

(Vanessa)
You know, if you don't give me the real story
I'll have to make one up of my own
So why don't you tell me the truth - the truth - the truth
Why don't you tell me the truth?

[Verse 1]
I said babe I get my feet wet
If  you have money too
You  might not be upset
No I’ll take a rain check
If you drive them I’m gonna be sick sick

[Chorus]
She  said if you’re looking
You’ve  got a type One of the same
But it’s taking awhile
What’s  a type What’s a type
What’s a type What’s a type
I don’t know

[Verse 2]
Hey

I  guess we’ll 

[?] Close to the heat
You can’t shake what you see
I better be better be what’s coming to me
Taking a ride
Taking a ride

[Chorus]
She said if you’re looking
You’ve got a type One of the same
But it’s taking awhile
What’s a type What’s a type
What’s a type What’s a type
I don’t know

[Verse 1]
You said to meet
At the center of Lenox square
I'm drenched in sweat and you can bet
You can bet I'm already there
You look good in the daytime
You look good do you need a ride?

[Chorus]
To the Southbound Station
You know the one where we met
Southbound Station
You know the one where the sights and people mix
You forget to pay your rent
And I don't feel a thing
I'm just waiting on a vibration

[Verse 2]
You said to meet at the corner of boulevard
I've been thinking about the last time
You and I used the car
You look in the daytime
You look better than you did last night

[Chorus]
At the Southbound Station
You know the one where we met
Southbound Station
You know the one where the sights and people just mix
You forget to pay your rent
And I don't feel a thing
I'm just waiting on a vibration

[Verse 1]
Choking on a couple of words
Yeah they kinda fly like the birds
Are you gonna tell me what's next?
Now I'm sure I've got enough for the rest

[Hook]
If you buy her those shoes

[Verse 2]
Don't you know that she ran away?
Some seemed to think that she'd stay
Take a deep breath, it's not so toxic
And remind yourself of all your logic

[Hook]
If you buy her those boots
She'll step on your neck
Choke

[Verse 3]
Choking on some of your words
Yeah they fly away like the birds
Take a deep breath, it's not so toxic
And remind yourself of all your logic

[Hook]
If you buy her those boots
She'll step on your neck
Choke

[Verse 1]
I’m out like a sensation
Receive  your invitation

[Pre-Chorus]
You’ve  been living in a world forgotten
Saving receipts cause you got them
I can’t drink the punch now
I’m  blinded to the wealth

[Verse 2]
I’m  out in the lonely light
Retrieve me for your own tonight

[Chorus]
R.  S. V. P
Where did you intend to be?

[Verse 3]
Tuck out the back with me
Down the street for a drink
Speak  out and say what you mean
Without a part in the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
You’ve been living in a world forgotten
Saving receipts cause you got them 

[2x]

[Chorus]
R. S. V. P
Where did you intend to be?

[Bridge]
Tuxedo blues
You’ve got the move
Tuxedo blues
What’s your move
{Verse 1}
No, I never thought anyone could pull the wool over my eyes, yeah
But you're not just anyone, you're a master of disguise, oh yeah
I swear you put on one hell of a performance
'Cause you were just using me to get what you wanted
And I ain't see it coming, no, I couldn't see it coming

{Pre-Chorus}
'Cause you had me fooled thinking that you were the one for me
Thinking that you were the one I need, when I'm alone

{Chorus}
I was just, I was just
Loving a stranger, loving a stranger
Loving, loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving a stranger

{Verse 2}
Oh, how you feel my heart, if this is how you do me?
I told you that I loved you, oh
And that's not something I say loosely
That's not something I say loosely
Oh no
{Pre-Chorus}
But you had me fooled thinking that you were the one for me
Thinking that you were the one I need, when I'm alone

{Chorus}
I was just, I was just
Loving a stranger, loving a stranger
Loving, loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving a stranger

{Bridge}
Maybe it's karma, maybe it's bad luck, maybe it's all coincidence
Maybe I gave you confidence, maybe
I'll forgive you, already miss you
But right now, I ain't got time for that
No Super Bowl, I ain't running back, no
You crossed that line when you walked outside when I said goodbye
Victim of your crimes, taking back what's mine, when I cry inside
Wish I could rewind, but I know that I can't take back time
I can't take back time, can't take back time, so

{Chorus}
I'm hoping that you learn how it feels to be loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving, loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving a stranger

Riktigt proffsigt att stryka lite grejer
Yeah 
Yeah 
Jag tänker det här, det hör inte riktigt hemma här

We are right now in the beginning of a climate and ecological crisis
And  we need to call it what it is
An  emergency
We must acknowledge that we do not have the situation under control
And  that we don't have all the solutions yet
Unless those solutions mean that we simply stop doing certain things
We must admit that we are losing this battle
We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed
All  political movements in their present form have failed
But Homo sapiens have not yet failed
Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around
We can still fix this
We still have everything in our own hands
But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems
We most probably don't stand a chance
We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people
And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say
Now is the time to speak clearly
Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that Homo sapiens have ever faced
The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it
We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases
And either we do that, or we don't
You say that nothing in life is black or white
But that is a lie, a very dangerous lie
Either we prevent a 1.5 degree of warming, or we don't
Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, or we don't
Either we choose to go on as our civilization, or we don't
That is as black or white as it gets
Because there are no grey areas when it comes to survival

Now, we all have a choice
We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations
Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail
That is up to you and me
And yes, we need a system change rather than individual change
But you cannot have one without the other
If you look through history
All the big changes in society have been started by people at the grassroots level
People like you and me
So, I ask you to please wake up and make the changes required possible
To do your best is no longer good enough
We must all do the seemingly impossible
Today, we use about 100 million barrels of oil every single day
There are no politics to change that
There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground
So, we can no longer save the world by playing by the rules
Because the rules have to be changed
Everything needs to change, and it has to start today
So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience
It is time to rebel

When you were young and your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changing world in which we're living
Makes you give in and cry

[Chorus]
Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)

[Verse 2]
What does it matter to you?
When you got a job to do
You got to do it well
You got to give the other fellow hell

[Verse 1]
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever changing world in which we're living
Makes you give in and cry

Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)

You used to say "Live and let live" yeah

When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 2]
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree

For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer

The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear

I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears

Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back
To the long and winding road
You left me standing here

A long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to you door

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back
To the long and winding road
You left me standing here

A long‚ long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting)
Lead me to your door

Yeah‚ yeah‚ yeah, yeah

And you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there?

And I, I could see
That before too long

Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away

Life is a mystery
Everyone  must stand alone
I  hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's  like a little prayer
I'm  down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In  the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1]
I  hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there

Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control

No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Reprise]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there
Your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer
Your voice can take me there

[Intro]
Cherish, cherish

[Verse 1]
So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny
I can't let go, baby, can't you see?
Cupid, please take your aim at me

[Chorus]
Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would

[Verse 2]
I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need
For two hearts that bleed with burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

[Chorus]
I cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
Oh baby, I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would

[Bridge]
Can't get away, I won't let you
I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

[Verse 1]
You are my destiny
I can't let go, baby, can't you see?
Cupid, please take your aim at me

[Chorus]
Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
Keep singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
Oh baby, I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would

[Bridge]
Can't get away, I won't let you
I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

[Chorus]
Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
Oh baby, I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would
I Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
Singing I cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
Oh baby, I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
Tell me, why do we argue so often?

[Intro]
Uh-du-du, uh-du-du‚ uh-du-du‚ uh-du-du
Hey‚ remember the time you drove all night?
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Night, night‚ night, night, yeah‚ yeah
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
They say love is blind, I can't do the time
I want a watch, this kind, but they don't know buyin'
With a bottle of Synthroid, can I buy it? I don't know
Ayy, hey, ayy
When I came up the top, when I came up from the bottom
And you was right there, I tell you, I saw you
And all of my diamonds shinin' even when I was
Was stuck in the dirt, you said it was
Ayy, they said it wouldn't hurt when you go
But I don't even know anymore
I'm so gone on a forty, yeah, you know
Yeah, ayy, hey
It's a moonshine, it's a moon-vibe
I was on my grind all the damn time
When I was away, you was on my mind

[Chorus]
Ayy, I gotta do what I gotta do
But I'ma, I'ma come home soon
I'ma come home soon, I'ma come
Ayy, I gotta do, yeah
Ayy, gotta do what I gotta do
I'ma come home, I'ma come home soon
Believe that's true
Ayy

[Verse 2]
Ooh, why, ooh, why you gotta leave me without some love?
If it's all the same to you
If it's on the way, you know I'm dancin'
Jumpin' out the frame, ooh
I walk in cabanas, ooh, I'ma call my mans, ooh
Dealin' with your cans, hoe, never call my name, hoe
I ain't gotta do this shit, I don't wanna say no
Sippin' on it, drinkin' slow
It take away my pain, yo
It's something that's on the lane, yeah
Then I hear me on the radio, ayy, yeah
I remember, I remember
I remember when you said it was the same
And you wrong, oh no, no, no
But I don't think it all, all the same
No, why

[Outro]
Ahh, why, why-y
Ooh, ooh-ooh
The same thing as before
I know you understand that you in my heart, oh no, no, oh no
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My momma say don't let go
I won't let go when you say you'll come home
I might be going when I say I'll come home
My, yeah, oh yeah, oh, ahh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I don't wanna go now

[Intro: Big Sean]
Yeah, what happens when it's too good to throw away?
You either let it go bad or go away
(I need to pray)

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]
Take my time (Part two), take my time, I'ma take my time
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Look)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Uh)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I'm single again (Single again)
Told her we'll be better off friends (Uh)
Baby, I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again (Single again)
Told 'em that we better off friends (Off friends)
Blaming you is just so easy (Woah)
But maybe the problem's me
I'm single again (Single again)
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Gon' be)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (On me)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me (On me)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Instead of blaming all my old girls when I leave (What?)
Instead of calling up these fake hoes that I don't need (What?)
Old relationships turn to new déjà vus
Got me feeling like, "I don't fuck with you"
Oh nah, nah, that's the old me
You fucking with the new me (Yeah)
Honestly, all the disrespect had damn near ruined me (Damn near)
All the trust gone, seems like all you say is, "Prove it to me" (Straight)
And you know I suck at lying, don't, don't do it to me (Don't)
Maybe 'cause my mom had never worked it out with my dad (Damn)
Maybe 'cause he had insecurities and she had 'em back (Uh-huh)
Maybe 'cause single parent love was all I ever had
Who knows? (Who knows?)

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, Big Sean]
I'm single again (Single again)
Told her we'll be better off friends (Off friends)
Maybe I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again (Single again)
Told 'em that we better off friends (Off friends)
Blaming you is just so easy (Uh-huh)
But maybe the problem's me (Straight up)
I'm single again (Single again)
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Yeah, yeah)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (On me)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me

[Post-Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time
Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time

[Verse 2: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]
What have you done for yourself?
What have you done for your mental health? (Yeah, yeah)
I even tried the drugs and they didn't help
Short term fix, that breaks everything else (Oh, oh)
And my bros keep throwing me these random girls in stallions
I need the best advice, went across the street to Khaled (Oh)
He said the major key is to be strong on your own
Lose your other half, you're never off balance (Oh)
Lookin' for the love in somebody else
That I probably should've gave to myself
Cycles I need to break in myself
If I'm alone, I'm second to no one else, so (Yeah)

[Chorus: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm single again (Oh)
Told her we'll be better off friends (Better off friends)
Maybe I should just focus on me (On me)
And slow down, don't rush romance
I'm single again
Told 'em that we better off friends (Oh, yeah)
Blaming you is just so easy (Oh)
But maybe the problem's me (Ooh)
I'm single again
Guess that's just the way it's gon' be (Way)
Maybe I should spend this time on me (Way)
Maybe I should spend this cash on me (Ooh)

[Post-Chorus: Big Sean]
Take my time, take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Take my time, I'ma take my time, yeah
Even if I'm late, I'ma take my time

[Outro: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah
Stay on this grind
(Oh, oh, ayy)
(Dolla $ign)
(Oh)

[Verse 1]
I'm losing my self control
Yeah, you're starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
Guess it's never really over
Guess it's never really over
Guess it's never really over
Guess it's never really over

[Verse 2]
I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over
Guess it's never really over
Guess it's never really over
Guess it's never really over
Guess it's never really over

Listen, Flex, we just met but I know it don't seem
Like R Kelly wet dreams, I always keep 16's, nigga
Me and Flex looking in the index
For buff net niggas just for some hot butt sex, mmm
What—What made you go with that verse?
I don't-
What made you go with that verse?
I got a little cousin, when I die, he'll prolly take my estate
I always tell him, "Be himself, and always strive to be great"
Hmm, no, hmm
My momma a dealer, her son crack, nigga
What's that, nigga? Facts, nigga, hmm
Why when they mention black businesses, they never mention me, dawg?
I don't know, please, see man
'Cause if they talkin' M's, GOLF did seventeen in '18, mothafucka
And that's just one season, huh
Stocks that I own, how much stocks do I own?
All of it, the whole bird, that's my broth in the bowl, nigga
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Gimme a topic, Flex

Don't even look at my engine, bitch, you can't afford this
That's that muhfuckin' McLaren, that's five hundred made
Got the fuckin' window tinted, 'cause I needed the shade
And that E30 Bimmer, that you ain't seen since you a teen
Uh, back in '91, when they was doin' E and PMD at the arena
Macarena, Hayna, Jayna, Shayda, Raida, Aida
I'm back from LA, with Mexicans, they love the Raiders
But I don't watch football, I just watch the crooks ball
With them fuckin' eight balls, sellin' inside the hall of the high school
I was not cool, niggas thought that I was weird and shit, they kept they space
But it's cool, 'cause now I got they amazin' grace, nigga
How many M's? It don't matter how much I make
Just know what it is, when you see face, the gap-tooth nigga, the big ears
And them shoes you ain't seen yet
And, yes, if you like 'em nigga, I did design it, nigga
How many figures Converse gimme for that?
Well, I don't know, but out in Bel-Air I just copped the new flat
And the flat top, on the top of the hat
The one with the G, the store did a couple M's this week
Stop talkin' to me, dawg, niggas playin' around
This is right off the top, this is right off the cock
Me and Flex gon' go 'round the block, and he gon' get—
He always slips up then he gets a little—a little aggressive
Pause
Right, a little aggressive
He always slips up when gets a little aggressive
It makes your ears and your eyebrows go up
Uh, okay, um, listen
They bringin' up my past, I don't hide it
Goblin out now, bitch, buy it
Lookin' for them tweets, bitch? Find it
The cancel couch is fake and I recline it
Man, I just don't know
Niggas try to come for me, dawg, they confidence low, dawg
What's goin' on? Mmm
I don't got much else to say, so I'ma end this shit
'Cause I got a lil' date with this dude real quick
We gon' go prolly get some ice cream, and do, oh, wait a minute
He just got off his damn last shift
And he said that his momma can't do the dishes
So he gotta go help her
So I'm gonna go and weep, and go look for someone on Yelp
But that's not a dating app
So what you use? Tinder, Grindr?
Get with all your niggas, and get right behind 'em
What, you gon' do me like your DM, and slide 'em? Hmm
Flex send me emoji
No, there was no emoji, I ain't send an emoji, wait a minute
Now, Flex, why are you lyin'?
Why you tryna play me like change and 50 Cent when he was dyin'?
Tryin' just to get it, get it, I split it
I read it in it, and intended, your head was in it, um, mwah, I kiss it, nigga
Scooby Doobie, oobie the lubie
Me and Flex was cuddled up watchin' Scooby Doo, eatin' Scooby snacks
He said he, "Wanted my boobies"
I said, "I don't got 'em"
He said, "Whatever, nigga, I rock 'em"
We stock-a-bock 'em, ocka-rock 'em, tacka-dock 'em
He don't eat pork, I thought this nigga was a Salaama Lakim

Whatever I gotta do, I go get the cheddar
And I don't even like pizza, but, whatever, more the better, nigga
My ex bitch is wetter, nigga
Nah, she dry as fuck, she like the canyon
My niggas in Laurel Canyon (Man)
All these white kids, they got the fandom
His ex is gonna be lookin' at this in, like, a year
Think that I'm funny because I'm random
We could be together like a tandem
Man, this weird as fuck
I keep flirting with Flex and he ain’t tryna fuck
Now I’m confused, I'ma leave, I just think that he hate me
I thought I came here so he’d date me
He talking about a freestyle
Ugh, nigga, fuck rap, fuck that
I was tryna take him back and take off that hat
And we could be like mwah, mwah, mwah on the lips
But that’s weird as fuck man, I’m talkin' ‘bout dick (Pause, pause)
Pause, pause, pause, nigga, pause, pause (Pause)
When we leave you gon’ give me your info so I call

But I don't mean it in the "Pause" way, I mean no homo
Glitter on my nails, glitter on my neck
Niggas bitter as hell, they shit don't sell
I'm doin' so well, man, they really hate to see me win
Especially 'cause the gap tooth, and I'm dark skinned
But my shit clearer than that ball from Space Jam
I'm that man, I'm that man
See them diamonds on my hand, why am I talkin' material shit?
I don't even care, but I'm just freestylin' this bitch, man
Niggas ain't mad, they look

He baited me for it, right, he baited me for it

아침이 와도 like glue
태양보다 더 뜨겁지 me and you
하루 종일 like glue
사랑하지 that's all we do
여름이 와도 like glue
태양보다 더 뜨겁지 me and you

[Verse 1]
When its one of those days
Give you space
Hear me out
Lean on me, lean all the way
Hold it down
Something could break
Like if there's something at stake
Or we got something that's sticking
Even that's stronger than tape
I said its thicker than money
You're trying to throw in my face
Even thicker than thunder thighs
That be running that ways
No mistake‚ I'm a stay
No‚ I got nothing to say
Cause when you hate me
You hate me more than the Bay to LA

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m running late
Yo hear me out
Forgot my manners on a
Better day I'm on the couch
I’ve never bounced
We’ve never bounced
Dont ever doubt we’ve never doubt
We’re superglued to ride
This weather out

[Chorus: HEIZE]
하루 종일 like glue
사랑하지 that's all we do
아침이 와도 like glue
태양보다 더 뜨겁지 me and you
하루 종일 like glue
사랑하지 that's all we do
여름이 와도 like glue
태양보다 더 뜨겁지 me and you

[Post-Chorus: HEIZE]
We stick it thru
We tight as glue

[Verse 2]
Before we sittin' it out
It's eminent that we winning it now
Better than trippin' and having a fit
We sippin' it and we figure it out
Two of us fussin' like tit for tat
No this for that we ain't fit for that
Work like a muscle‚ we ripped in fact
Yo, watch the chin, I'm lifting that
Stay true
While we toast the soju
Far East got me now
T-A knockin now‚ we ain't stopping
Untill we own the avenue
Stay true
How'd we even make it thru?
Keepin' this tight like glue
Thicker than stew
Nothin' can ever cut up my crew

[Bridge: HEIZE]
너 없이 사는법은 나 몰라
너말고 난 다른건 잘 못봐
너하고 나말고는 다 똑같아
너 없이 사는법은 나 몰라
너말고 난 다른건 잘 못봐
너하고 나말고는 다 똑같아
And we stuck like

[Chorus: HEIZE]
하루 종일 like glue
사랑하지 that's all we do
아침이 와도 like glue
태양보다 더 뜨겁지 me and you
하루 종일 like glue
사랑하지 that's all we do
여름이 와도 like glue
태양보다 더 뜨겁지 me and you
We stick it thru
We tight as glue

[Verse 1]
I like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day I woke up like
"Maybe  I'll do it differently"

[Pre-Chorus]
So I moved to California‚ but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it‚ I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

[Verse 2]
I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

[Pre-Chorus]
You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby‚ wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

[Bridge]
It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, braids in my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Fuck it, I love you (I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind)
Fuck it, I love you (It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie)
Fuck it, I love you (Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine)
I really do (It's killing me slowly)

[Outro]
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time

[Verse 1]
I miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancing with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
Dennis' last stop before Kokomo

[Pre-Chorus]
Those nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall

[Chorus]
And I'm wasted
Don't leave‚ I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signing off after all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends‚ we miss rock 'n' roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
When‚ baby, I was doing nothin' the most of all

[Pre-Chorus]
The culture is lit, and if this is it‚ I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

[Chorus]
I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

[Outro]
If this is it, I'm signing off
Miss doing nothin' the most of all
Hawaii just missed that fireball
L.A. is in flames‚ it's getting hot
Kanye West is blond and gone
"Life on Mars?" ain't just a song
I hope the live stream's almost on

[Verse 1]
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

[Verse 2]
I told that girl that my prospects were good
And she said baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

[Verse 3]
I told that girl I can start right away
When she said listen, babe, I got something to say
I got no car and it's breakin' my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you

[Outro]
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!

[Chorus]
Jet!
Jet!

[Verse 1]
Jet, I can almost remember their funny faces
That time you told 'em that you were gonna be marrying soon

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And Jet, I thought the only lonely place was on the moon

[Chorus]
Jet! (ooh)
Jet! (ooh)

[Verse 2]
Jet, was your father as bold as a Sergeant Major?
Oh, how come he told you that you were hardly old enough yet?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And Jet, I thought the Major was a Lady Suffragette

[Chorus]
Jet! (ooh)
Jet! (ooh)

[Bridge]
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later
Jet!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And Jet, I thought the Major was a little Lady Suffragette

[Chorus]
Jet! (ooh)
Jet! (ooh)

[Bridge]
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later

[Verse 3]
Jet, with the wind in your hair of a thousand laces
Climb on the back, and we'll go for a ride in the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
And Jet, I thought that the Major was a little Lady Suffragette

[Chorus]
Jet! (ooh)
Jet! (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And Jet, you know I thought you was a little Lady Suffragette

[Outro]
Jet! (ooh)
A little lady
My little lady, yes, oh

[Verse 1]
Well, I was found in the transit lounge
Of a dirty airport town
What was I doing on the road to ruin
Well my mama laid me down
My mama laid me down
Around my hand was a plastic band
With a picture of my face
I was crying, left to die
In this godforsaken place
This godforsaken place

[Chorus]
Only Mama knows
What she laid me down
In this godforsaken town
She was running too
What she was running from
I always wondered
I never knew
Only Mama knows
Only Mama knows

[Verse 2]
I'm passing through
I'm on my way
On the road, no ETA
I'm passing through
No fixed abode
And that is why
I need to try
To hold on
I've got to hold on

[x3]

[Bridge]
Was it planned as a one night stand
Or did she live in disgrace
Well, I never
Will I ever
See my father's face

[x2]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Got to hold on... 

[x4]

[Intro: Brian & The System]
(Oooh-ooh-ooh)
Yo that sound's good
Won't you turn that up?
Oooh-ooh-ooh yeah
Oooh-ooh-ooh, baby-eh-eh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh yeah
Listen

[Verse 1: Brian with AJ]
Pay attention
Are you listening?
Hey you're my favorite girl
Excuse me for a moment
I'm in another world
On a mountain, by a fountain
Flowers blooming everywhere
With Venus and with Cupid
The picture's very clear

[Chorus: All & Howie]
Hang the sign up on the door
I say don’t disturb this groove
All I need is just me and you
Just a way to say that I’m so into you
Just someone who understood
And the feeling’s so real
Don’t disturb this groove

[Verse 2: AJ with Brian, Nick with Brian]
Erotic whispers for the listener
Let the music fill the air
Excuse me for a moment
I'm at a loss of words
By election you're perfection
And as if these eyes would care
Your heart is in the right place
So don't you go and change
Baby over and over
The passion starts again
And the lollipops and everything
With a little taste of sin
Causing fire and desire
In this mortal soul to live
'Til the angels fall from heaven
And the day the Earth stands still

[Chorus: All with Nick, Howie]
Hang the sign up on the door
I say don’t disturb this groove
All I need is just me and you
Just a way to say that I’m so into you
Just someone who understood
And the feeling’s so real
Don’t disturb this groove
All I need is just me and you
'Cause I want to say that I’m so into you
Just someone who understood
And the feeling’s so real
Don’t disturb this groove

[Bridge: All]
Close your eyes and let the music
Put you in the mood
Oooh baby just lock the door and turn the phone off
It's time for me and you

[Chorus: All with AJ & Nick, Howie]
Hang the sign up on the door
I say don’t disturb this groove
All I need is just me and you
Just a way to say that I’m so into you
Just someone who understood
And the feeling’s so real
Don’t disturb this groove
All I need is just me and you
'Cause I want to say that I’m so into you
Just someone who understood
And the feeling’s so real
Don’t disturb this groove

[Outro: Nick with Howie, All]
It's the feeling girl, it's the feeling girl
It's the feeling girl, it's the feeling girl
It's the feeling girl, it's the feeling girl
It's the feeling girl, it's the feeling girl
(All I need is just me and you)
It's the feeling girl, it's the feeling girl
(Just someone who understood)
It's the feeling girl, it's the feeling girl
(All I need is just me and you)
It's the feeling girl, it's the feeling girl
(Just someone who understood)
It's the feeling girl, it's the feeling girl

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Who you loyal to? Me or us?
Who you trust the most? Me or us?

[Verse 1: Young Thug & Post Malone]
Ayy, hey, ayy

And  you said you were doin' it, you're doin' it, you're doin' it
You say that what you're doin', you're doin', you're doin'
You told me that what, what you're doin', you're doin', you're doin'
What would you do?
If your brother left you, what would you do?
If them niggas came for you, you better pursue (watch out)
I just spent 10 racks on a dog from Germany, no Purdue
Oops, I meant Dupri, jewelry sitting on A/C
Ayy, they said it wouldn't hurt when you go
But I don't even know anymore
It's a gone on a forty, yeah, you know

I might be going when I say I'll come home
My, yeah, oh, oh yeah, oh, ahh, ooh-ooh

Throw my ticket in the wind
Throw  my mattress out there too
Draw  my letters in the sand
'cause you got to understand
That tonight I'll be staying here with you

I  could have left this town by noon
By  tonight I'd been to someplace new
But I was feeling a little bit scattered
And  your love was all that mattered
So tonight I'll be staying here with you, get ready
Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you

Is it really any wonder
The  changes we put on each other's heads
You came down on me like rolling thunder

I left my dreams on the riverbed
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowin'
I hear them semis rolling too
If there's a driver on the road
Let him have my load
Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowin'
I hear them semis rolling too
If there's a driver on this road
Then let him have my load
'cause tonight I'll be staying here with you
'cause tonight I'll be staying here with you

[Intro: YG]
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: NAV]
Got rackity-rack-rack-racks in my knapity-sack-sack-sack (Racks)
Ever since Tap-Tap-Tap, I feel like the brown boy back-back-back (I'm back)
Prada shoes with the strap, in every color, I'm proud of that (Proud of that)
All they see is success but they don't know where I started at
I can't take no days off, I got money I gotta get (No)
Hit the gas and I take off, pipes be cracklin' when I shift (Skrrt)
It's clear as you can see, got a big bankroll on me
Got a coupe, got power seats three months before release

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Tattoos under my sleeve (Yeah)
Got nigga old girl on her knees (Yeah)
I spent a hundred thousand dollars on trees
I spent a whole 'nother hundred on tees (Woo)
She got hair all down to her knees
Now I call her Maybelline (No cap)
I got a cougar bitch in my driveway
Tryna make a nigga pay her lease (Swear)
Trap, trappin', trappin'
Whole lot of bales and bricks, Ikea
Woah, woah, woah
I just been sippin' on lean, I don't see us
I would never trap, I was tryna rob him and his dealer
Never goin' back, switchin' my shit like Ron Artest
(Switch it up)
Rickity-rack-rack-racks
Throwin' off the Maybach hatch-hatch-hatch
I've been on set-set-set
Throw it down the field, no crack back-back-back, ooh
Ran up my sack-sack-sack
I done went and bought all the set-set-sets (Slatt)
Duck tape the patch-patch-patch
Three hundred horse on the Cadillac, woah

[Chorus: NAV]
Got rackity-rack-rack-racks in my knapity-sack-sack-sack (Racks)
Ever since Tap-Tap-Tap, I feel like the brown boy back-back-back (I'm back)
Prada shoes with the strap, in every color, I'm proud of that (Proud of that)
All they see is success but they don't know where I started at
I can't take no days off, I got money I gotta get (No)
Hit the gas and I take off, pipes be cracklin' when I shift (Skrrt)
It's clear as you can see, got a big bankroll on me
Got a coupe, got power seats three months before release

[Verse 2: NAV]
Rackin' up Krispy Kreme
Every day I wear crispy tee
I know you ain't gettin' no cheese
Your shoe tongue ain't got no C's
All my diamonds cold, on freeze
Got designer A to Z
I know B's and I know C's
Make your bitch fall in love with a G
Now I don't wanna wear no J's
Pointers in the Cartiers on my face
Stackin' up for my future, came up livin' day to day
Should I buy a new watch? I just made a hundred racks today
Gucci my tube socks, I got a different pair for every day
I can't get no sleep, I got some habits I gotta kick
I been drippin' all week, minimum three thousand on my 'fit
When you work for a boss like me, there's lots of advantages
In my wildest dreams, I don't think that I could imagine this

[Chorus: NAV]
Got rackity-rack-rack-racks in my knapity-sack-sack-sack (Racks)
Ever since Tap-Tap-Tap, I feel like the brown boy back-back-back (I'm back)
Prada shoes with the strap, in every color, I'm proud of that (Proud of that)
All they see is success but they don't know where I started at
I can't take no days off, I got money I gotta get (No)
Hit the gas and I take off, pipes be cracklin' when I shift (Skrrt)
It's clear as you can see, got a big bankroll on me
Got a coupe, got power seats three months before release

[Verse 1]
Days go by and I still don’t know how and why
I still make my way without you, without you
Days go by and I still don’t know how and why
I still make my way and hang through, hang through

[Chorus]
One more week, losing lottery, oh I
Try to find some sort of mockery, oh I

[Verse 2]
Days go by and I still don’t know how and why
I still make way without you, without you

[Chorus]
One more week, losing lottery, oh I
Try to find some sort of mockery, oh I

[Verse 1]
Motion blurred dream visions and kindred faces
Thoughts  like bursts of youth taking me places
Living  the best outcome of myself
‘Cause I do remember where I come from

[Chorus]
I’m happy my home found me
By  which force I do not know
I  found my home and it grows by me in beauty

[Verse 2]
I feel air from another planet akin
Like  a sense of truth that comes from within
A budding sapling reaching through
Giving rise to higher fruit and view

[Chorus]
I’m happy my home found me
By  which force I do not know
I found my home and it grows by me in beauty
I’m happy my home found me
By which force I do not know
I found my home and it grows by me in beauty

[Verse 1]
You wrap my feet in coloured blankets
So I stay here all night
You keep the one with many moons and stars
It’s always for my shoulders

[Chorus]
So I stay here till waking hours
Tell me how do you make everything feel a little easier
So I stay here till waking hours
Who could ever be this good to me
I just can’t help but wonder

[Verse 2]
You put a shirt on the ceiling light
So the room won’t be too bright
You give me time to be what I can be
You’re never ahead, never behind me

[Chorus]
So I stay here till waking hours
Tell me how do you make everything feel a little easier
So I stay here till waking hours
Who could ever be this good to me
I just can’t help but wonder

[Verse]
I recall polar days like these by the Zora river
Before heading nearby to quench my thirst
Writers and few musicians among the local drunk
Tentative relief, together blank

[Pre-Chorus]
So I dream about C.R.E.A.M. tonight
White flag night
Wicked night
'Cause

[Chorus]
I miss October nights in Parc
Miss the corner store small talk
Smoke indoors past four
Come on Jean-Talon

[Chorus]
I miss October nights in Parc
Miss the corner store small talk
Smoke indoors past four
Come on Jean-Talon

[Intro]
Bae, you’re leaving again?
It’s rainy outside, you know
Don’t wanna get cold

[Verse 1]
Bae, you’re leaving again?
It’s rainy outside, you know
Don’t wanna get cold
“Bye, I’m running late”
Didn’t say where she went
God knows

[Chorus]
Bae, you’re running away
Lost in the eye of men
You’re roaming your way
And he waits
While she is so close to home
Warmed up so that she stays
His bae

[Verse 2]
He told her "Bae, the porch is unlocked
Even though no one else
Comes by the front
Now, I sense why the men
Who live in these empty lands
Don’t use them"

[Bridge]
Singing "she moves
By deserted pines
Who stand tall unstirred"
Ran out of milk
Wearing her nice shoes
She likes coffee dark

[Chorus]
He said "Bae, you’re running away
Lost in the eye of men
You’re roaming your way"
And he waits
While she is so close
Warmed up so that she stays
His bae

[Chorus]
Pierre, you’re not lone
Say, I hope you understand?
Pierre, you’re my friend
There’s a place you can call home

[Verse 1]
Those eyes
Tell me something’s odd
You’re there but you’re not here
You understand?
You care
It might not look this way
Couldn’t be less true
You understand

[Chorus]
Pierre, you’re not lone
Say, I hope you understand?
Pierre, you’re my friend
There’s a place you still call home

[Verse 2]
My friend
You have a vivid quill
A gift you need to use
To feel alive
Those hands
Look like crooked roots
Pour them the right stuff
And feel alive

[Verse 1]
I need some air
Vampire town
No one out

[Verse 2]
You were there and cold
Didn’t smoke
Made it count

[Chorus]
So I thought you could come over mine sometime
Our loneliness now gone
So I thought you could come over mine sometime
Have we ever been old friends?

[Verse 3]
I didn’t think
Late in time
We’d meet again

[Verse 4]
You looked a bit old
In this cold
You stood out

[Chorus]
So I thought you could come over mine sometime
Our loneliness now gone
So I thought you could come over mine sometime
Have we ever been old friends?

[Verse 1]
Mumbling
“Edelweiss“ 
I  couldn’t catch
Your eyes
“Mama
What  went wrong?
Forgot  why I’m still here
Silent calls”

[Chorus]
You  slowly bend over the table
Our sleepless bodies tumbling down
Still watching scenes from 1994
I don’t feel anything at all

[Verse 2]
Morning 
Red like wine
Got me trapped under
Venetian blinds
One more
Piece of cake
Round and round they go
I’m porcelain

[Chorus]
You slowly bend over the table
Our sleepless bodies tumbling down
Still watching scenes from 1994
I don’t feel anything at all

[Verse 1]
Fall of joyful fights
Left  me dreaming so long
Hiding  in my sleep
Twenty of your hands left on
Must be something in water

[Chorus]
In  this land with no sea
Hoping  time forgot me
‘Cause I can’t hold your love
Only  your full weight on me
Must be something in water

[Verse 2]
I should go away
Far from the Dashoa
Far  from the same stairs
Your bathroom drawn in fake vanilla smell
Knowing I don’t want better

[Chorus]
In this land with no sea
Hoping time forgot me
‘Cause I don’t need your love
Only your full weight...

The Versace Experience

[Verse 1]
After  a month of just being alone he said, "I wonder what L.A.'s thinking"
Streets  he roamed in search of a poem amongst the wild and drinking
When he sees cool dark skin in hot virgin white
The search was over at least for tonight
When  she co-signed and then told him she was ...

[Chorus]
Shy  - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy  - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight
Ooh baby, don't you want to be alone tonight?
Shy - Yeah (Oh yes)
Shy (Shy)
Shy  - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight

[Verse 1]
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
Well, it's been so long

[Chorus]
And I’ve been putting out fire
With gasoline

[Verse 2]
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

[Verse 3]
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
Well, you wouldn't believe what I’ve been through
You've been so long
Well, it's been so long

[Chorus]
And I've been putting out the fire
With gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline

[Verse 4]
See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through​
Well, you've been so long
It's been so long

[Chorus]
And I’ve been putting out fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline

[Outro]
Putting out the fire
I’ve been putting out fire
Well, she's so long, so long
Yes, indeed, so long
I’ve been putting out fire
Been putting out fire
Yeah, yeah, putting out fire
Been putting out fire
Yeah, putting out fire
Putting out fire
It's been so long
It's been so long
And I've been putting out fire
I’ve been putting out fire

[Verse 1]
Isn't it strange that you used to know me?
All the highs and lows and in-betweens
And now you see me and just say, "Hey"
Isn't it weird that you've seen me naked?
We had conversations 'bout forever
Now it's 'bout the weather‚ okay

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
Yeah

[Chorus]
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk

[Verse 2]
Isn't it wild that I know your weakness?
And everybody at the party thinks
That you're the best since sliced bread
And isn't it awkward I got a new somebody?
And honestly it'll probably be a while before we can just be friends

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
(Small talk)

[Chorus]
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been (Hands haven't been)
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk

[Post-Chorus]
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Nothing left‚ nothing left‚ baby)
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Nah)
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Oh no)
Now there's nothing left but small talk

[Bridge]
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers

[Chorus]
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been (Oh)
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk
(Now there's nothing left but small talk)

[Post-Chorus]
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Blah-blah-blah)
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk (Now there's nothing left)
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Small talk)
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk

She tryna ride on my dick like some pegs
Don't wanna fuck her, I just want the head
Hunnid racks under the bed
I'll put that shit on your head
I'm on a Percocet, meds
Pull up with choppers and dreads
Air your ass out with the lead
Your head what the B-E-O said

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Okay, okay, okay, I'm bossy

I'm bossy, I been gettin' this cash since a jit

Bloodied up, red flag on my chin like a hen

[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, baby
You don't ever have to go faster than your fastest pace
Or faster than my fastest cars

[Pre-Chorus]
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out, but I never said a thing
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you, but I didn't say a thing
(Two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long

[Verse 2]
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, and, honey
You don't ever have to act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars

[Pre-Chorus]
You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
Changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The Santa Ana moves you
(Two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long

[Outro]
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up

[Verse 1]
Sugar mama, sugar mama, sugar mama
Where  you been?
Sugar  mama, sugar mama, sugar mama
Where you been?
Sugar mama, sugar mama

[Chorus]
Say  you love me sugar mama
I'll  never let you go

[Verse 2]
Sugar mama, sugar mama, sugar mama
Love  you, babe
Sugar mama, sugar mama, sugar mama
Drive me insane
Sugar mama gonna love you all I can

[Chorus]
Say  you love me sugar mama
I'll never let you go
Say you love me sugar mama
I'll never let you go

[Verse 1]
Forgotten eyes are the ones which we lose
Forgotten hands are the ones which we choose
To let go of, but it is no less a bruise
On the collective arm keeping us high and gone
Forgotten dance is the one left at birth
Forgotten plants in the fossils of earth
And they've long passed but they are no less the dirt
Of the common soil keeping us dry and warm

[Chorus]
The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and deserves protection‚ hmm-mm

[Verse 2]
Hollow-eyed on Eddie Street‚ no sirens to hear
Just trash and soiled needles clawing the veneer
And no crying but it is no less a tear
On the common cheek with which we smile
Hollow-eyed on Eddie‚ is it they or is it I?
Is it me who is more hollow as I'm quickly passing by?
And the poison is killing them, but then so am I
As I turn away

[Chorus]
The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and deserves protection, hmm-mm

[Outro]
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten tongue

[Intro: bearface]
Out on the deck like I'm wildin' for respect
It's a three-peat, see-see
Bitch, you in the D-League
Boy, you fucked up
Can't come around here, this shit is gated
We made it, happy belated, I see the rage hit

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
It's better if I try not to talk about the shit that's always on my mind
Money on my mind (That's right), couple hunnids at a time
Try to fuck me blind, duckin' down, hear me whine (Ooh)
We outside now (That's right), milk carton in the back
We don't like to fuck around with them niggas in the back
Pullin' triggers in the 'Lac (That's right)
May the praise stay bad
Ayy, Dad, Hercules want his fuckin' waves back, stay strapped (Ooh, I like that, that's right)
Dancin' like a bad bitch, love on top my mattress
Hope the good Lord catch this, I ain't tellin' backwards
Lie just like an actor, Hollywood is batshit
Mama in the South still, gold all in my mouth still
Rappin' 'bout dick still, and I lease a house still
Move my nigga out, still need my nephew out here
God gave me a good deal
Miss my little niggas down low like a big wheel
Bitch, I wanna hit still
This shit for my partna 'nem, Devil keep on robbin' them
Express and feel myself, like I'm fuckin' Dennis Rodman (That's right)

[Verse 2:  Merlyn Wood]
Like I'm Dennis Rodman
Diamond dentures for my partna 'dem (That's right)
Golden rubbers from my pocket, friend
Ain't no answer, that's my partna 'dem (That's right)
She so bad, I let her touch my butt (Yeah)
Merlyn, what the fuck?

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Line 'em-line 'em-line 'em up, you know that I'm shootin' (That's right)
It ain't no one business who or what we doin’ (That's right)
Hit this gas, they break the glass and keep it movin’
To you basic bitches I know I'm a nuisance

[Verse 4: Joba]
Sugar, yeah, gimme some
Gimme dome, I'ma smoke some
Y'all ain't want the smoke, been smokin'
Garden gnome shrooms, y'all, who is y'all?
This what it mean to ball?
Okay, Chateau Marmont, Shangri-La
Valet park it, drive a shit whip
But I ain't broke, bitch
Write my own shit, hit my own switch
Watched the clock tick, never ran and hid
Tell it like it is
Dead on the nail, call me hammerhead
Texas 'til I'm dead
BBQ and cornbread, like 'em corn fed
Here we go again, hit 'em one mo' 'gain
Screwed up from The Woodlands
Number six, been through Hell, think I'm Heaven-sent
Ask the preacher man, said I need Jesus, like I ain't know
Guess I found him, I am blessed, man
Rake in dividends, let the money stack, see you copycats
I ain't trippin', but copy that
It's a wrap, keep my distance
Where's Waldo, but we winnin'
Me and my dogs ain't finished (That's right)
The real know, what's a billfold?
You can't fold, I stay grinnin'
No peekin'

[Bridge: Henock Sileshi]
Go ahead and try harder
You ain't gotta ask to put up with nobody
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves
Get on your damn knees
And pray sometimes with your muhfuckin' ass
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves
Get yo' muhfuckin' ass on out there
That's all you gon' be, a muhfucker
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves

[Outro: Matt Champion]
S-s-send 'em out the door

They ain't-they ain't knockin' no more

They-they-they ain't knockin' no more
They ain't-they ain't knockin' no more

[Intro]
When I was a kid, back in kindergarten
That's when I was a kid, you know? What does it mean?
Yeah, yeah, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
Yeah, um, do you—
Yeah, damn

[Verse 1]
We been doin' this since you was still in diapers
Keep it movin' like the wipers, cameras shoot us like a sniper
I had dreams of fuckin' me an R&B bitch
I am the melody, who's tellin' me where harmony is?
It's all been a trip like dollars that I drop on my whip
I keep a girl, but when I'm with my friends, I call her my bitch
(Asshole) I'ma need a evolution, just illusion
I'm out in space, there's no one left but Houston
I'm at the studio, I'll prolly take some acid after, but
Right now, me, Evan Adams watchin' battle rappers
Filet with every flow, you more like kale, bruh
Illest since I've been in it, don't know what else I can tell ya
And I don't watch TV shows no more
'Cause I got too much on my plate, I'm never home no more
I'm smokin' cigarettes, they fuckin' up my vocal cords
(A'ight, right after that)

[Chorus]
I like me 'xactly how I is, yeah
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is

[Verse 2]
And I, and I, and I, I been the hardest since kindergarten kickball
Feelin' such a drug and I've been goin' through the withdrawl
I'm involved with shit that'd kill y'all if you would try it
They worry about my crazy ass, but nah, I'm just a riot
Flow is ultraviolet, I alter minds up when I open up
Cold as fuck, literally stuck in bed, pneumonia
I'm Obi-Wan Kinobi, bruh, surroundin' sound like Dolby does
Fisherman, slangin' bitches dick, I got the Moby plug
Some is built to last, some is built to crumble
And I ain't sayin' I ain't lyin' in the jungle
I'm in Tribeca chillin', feelin' like the daily double
Who you playin' with? I came for trouble
And I send my bitch runnin' to the store real quick
Told her bring me somethin' good, none of that healthy shit
Who else you know that's out here raisin' hell like Lyft?
I can only be myself, that's it

[Chorus]
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is
I like me 'xactly how I is

[Verse 1]
You turn your dial to 93.7
Broadway acts like he's 11
Self-proclaimed
Say's he's the worst mistake ever to land in Michigan
I'm just a singer of country songs
Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
But if you listen to just one thing I say

[Chorus]
You should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called "Tim McGraw"
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard

[Verse 2]
Daisy's from a trailer park in St. Louis
Growing up not wearing any shoes
Prettiest hillbilly girl you'll see all day
Growing up the other trailer park girls
Couldn't hide their jealousy
Because she had the only phone for miles
Now she uses it as a DJ

[Chorus]
So you should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called "Tim McGraw"
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on
Rain in the forest
Rain on the trees
Raining down on me
Rainclouds hide the sun
Rainclouds hide the sun

Clouds in the valley
Clouds in the sky
Clouds, please‚ pass me by

Sail the ocean‚ sail across the sea (sail across the sea)
Send a card to me (send a card to me)
Wind's gonna blow (wind's gonna blow)
And if you go (o-o-o-o-o-oh)
Leave the sun for me (me-ee-ee)

Talkin' 'bout sun in the desert (sun in the desert)
Sun in my ears (sun in my ears)
Sun dries up my tears
Rainclouds hide the sun (rainclouds hide the sun)
Rainclouds hide the sun (rainclouds hide the sun)
Rain in the forest (rain in the forest)
Rain on the trees (rain on the trees)
Raining down on me
Rainclouds hide the sun‚ pretty woman, in the morning
(rainclouds hide the sun)
Rainclouds hide the sun (rainclouds hide the sun)

Rain in the forest (rainclouds hide the sun)
Rain on the trees (rainclouds hide the sun)
Rainclouds hide the sun

[Chorus]
Yvonne’s the one I’ve been counting on
She said, "hold on, you’re not the only one"
And so I said so long Yvonne

[Verse 1]
When I first saw Yvonne, volcanoes erupted
And laughter flowed into my life
She seemed all right, nothing wrong
Everything about her was so strong
But I know no one’s gonna keep us apart

[Chorus]
Yvonne’s the one I’ve been counting on
She said, "hold on, you’re not the only one"
And so I said so long Yvonne

[Verse 2]
When I saw her again, I was caught in a landslide
But I didn’t dare let it show
Her ruby lips were teasing me
But jealousy would never let us be
So always gonna keep us apart

[Bridge]
She never knew how much I loved her
I never got to tell her
We never found a way to say farewell
Yvonne

Yvonne

[Verse 3]
When I last saw Yvonne, she was covered in roses
But sadness had ended her life
She walked so tall, she looked so tan
Everything about her was so grand
But what you get is not what you see
So long, Yvonne, you’re not fooling me

[Chorus]
Yvonne, Yvonne’s the one I’ve been counting on
She said, "hold on, you’re not the only one"
And so I said so long Yvonne

Yvonne, Yvonne’s the one I’ve been counting on
She said, "hold on, you’re not the only one"
And so I said so long Yvonne

[Outro]
So long Yvonne

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
I don't know where I'm goin'
If  I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I  ain't tryna get like all up in your head again, Montana, 'Lanta
Maybe I should just go mosey my ass over to your house
Bewildered by the sight of you up on the couch, so cozy
Lowly  lit lights, rosy cheeks, oh, you so cozy with somebody else
Get  nervous, my stomach churnin', burnin'
I'm beat, ready to knock some teeth out of his ass
Late  night corner, we pass
Lick that Swisher, get red
Used to skip rocks 'round that bend
We don't go there no more
We  don't see sun no more
Baby wanna raid the whole apartment like the FBI
Takin' everything, from pots and pans to fans to Goldeneye
Everything 'cept the dog
Everything in the drawers
Used to be so perfect, but it's never gettin' solved

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Do I matter? I'm ecstatic, I'm depressed
More like God's special mess, never had no halo
Trippy, I can barely hike it out of bed
Time bomb under it, persuading you to hop in
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options

[Pre-Chorus: Deb Never & Kevin Abstract]
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Used to fight all my night terrors, now I smoke through the dreams
The pressure put me into places where I'm stuck in the seams
They sealed my mouth and said the only way to breathe is to scream
Pop the stitches from society and fall to my knees
The machines weavin' our fate are gettin' harder to please
But I believe to an extreme
(That we all can find a way)
To anybody listenin' that's in between
(That we all can find a way)

[Verse 4: Joba]
Went to church for the hell of it, stumbled in drunk as shit
Been goin' through it again
Been talkin' to myself, wonderin' who I am
Been thinkin' I am better than Him
In times like these, I just need to believe it's all part of a plan
Lost a part of me, but I am still here

[Bridge: bearface]
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute)
But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go)
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute)
But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go)

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help me when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help me when my

[Intro: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Ooh

[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Watch  'nother Richard
It's  a million plus three reasons I lied
I couldn't admit it
And I just don't want you to waste my time
'Cause  I'm tryna get with ya
I  be feelin' down but I'm fine when I'm with ya
You be thinkin' I be lyin' when I say I miss you
Girl,  you know I'm on your body, on your body like a tissue
They be callin' you Illuminati when I'm with you (Illuminati when I'm with you)
I say, "Maybe, it's your third eye," I love your mental (Third eye, I love your mental)
VVS's on me look like Now and Laters, lick you up
I  bet you never go back to the guy that was with you (Guy that was with you)
She got every pair of Chanel out of SoHo
Tribeca, hit the city to show off
And when you get dressed up, you take hours
Baby girl, you know you can do whatever, you got...

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, I've been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place, mmh, nah
It's crowded
In LA, but I'll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say you're down, I could show you around if you're really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?
What do you say?

[Chorus: Khalid]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Verse 3: Khalid]
Saved
Got the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded
But if that's not the vibe, yeah, it's cool
We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, we've been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love
If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Bridge: Khalid]
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (Bring it back to me, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (Bring it back to me, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (No no, no, oh yeah)

[Chorus: Khalid]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right

[Spoken Intro]
In the beginning, there was the Sun, nothing but the Sun moving through the heavens. Covering the surfs of the Earth were seas, and the seas were turmoil. With civilization there came the surfer with his urge to conquer these moving walls of water.

["Doin' Time" Snippet]
Summertime,  and the livin's easy
Bradley's  on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
Me,  me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And  dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

["Venice Bitch" Snippet]
Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's  me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
You're in the yard, I light the fire
And  as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay

["Mariners Apartment Complex" Snippet]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am

["Norman Fucking Rockwell" Snippet]
Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said ''I love you"
You're fun and you're wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can't change that, and I can't change your mood

[Spoken Outro]
The greatest journey is the journey of the mind since this is what determines the journey of life. Have you ever had the feeling that your mind is on a journey? A voyage of discovery? That sometimes it has to make long passages on dark, uncharted seas? And at other times it discovers bright islands of beauty or of truth. Islands it will know from this day forward, that it can always steer for and find in the storm while the gales of life blow themselves out and the enormous seas of misfortune, or pain, or sorrow, or doubt subside in the calm. Well, if you'll come, I'd like to take you with me on such a voyage of the mind.

[Verse 1]
Can I try for something, far from a lie
Can I speak without you taming my mind
Industry could take the best of me
This industry could swallow all of me

[Chorus]
Hold on little sailor, it will be alright
I know you'll be braver, best behavior tonight
We got so close to the fame and the life
Watching the stars tonight
Little sailor, let's sail tonight

[Verse 2]
Can I live inside a bubble we call home?
Willing to do anything, if I write a hit song
And I'll ride this tide, I'll put some make-up on
And I'll shock the crowd, cause it will sell my song

[Chorus]
Hold on little sailor, it will be alright
I know you'll be braver, best behavior tonight
We got so close to the fame and the life
Watching the stars tonight
Little sailor, let's sail tonight

[Verse 3]
Six different managers, all filled with good intent
They promised me the world, I ain't seen nothing yet
Work hard to stay alive, work hard to pay the rent
Still need my mom and dad, they must be heaven sent

[Chorus}
Hold on little sailor, it will be alright
I know you'll be braver, best behavior tonight
We got so close to the fame and the life
Watching the stars tonight
Little sailor, let's sail tonight

Jabari, me paddy

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Everybody  ask me how I deal with my depression
Man  look, man, I don't got the answer to your question
If I did, you would probably never hear from me again
That's a promise, not a threat and it ain't no half-steppin' (Hey)
Can't  let it compromise the pace I'm settin' (Hey)
Grandma  told me don't forget to count my blessings (Woo)
Breakin' up botanicals to ease my stressin'
Was  the one that you needed but you weren't expectin'
Game need refreshin' (Hey), what you been suggestin'? (Hey)
Wrote a new constitution, we don't need amendin' (Hey)
I go Johnnie Cochran when I'm raisin' my defenses (Yeah)
Man,  I feel like Michael Keaton when a nigga start ascendin' (Hey)
Never second-guessin' (Hey), had to do a lot of restin' (Hey)
Like I played for Popovich, tryna fine our new direction (Woo)
Listen, I ain't for the shelvin', what you niggas tellin'?
My team been rebellin' from wherever you were headin', goddam

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Man, this shit bump like a belly when it's pregnant (Mhm)

Swift feet cheetah, that's a real big kitty
Who made y'all judges? That's a real ass feeling
I don't like the sly ones, forget 'em and I dead 'em (Yeah)
Always off the shit like a constipated reverend (Alright)
Y'all don't like to shit talk, dumb pun, all fun
But I make your bitch crack a giggle with the next one (Oh)
Goofy ass boy, look like Elmer Fudd's cousin (Sheesh)
Heavy-ass feet, bet Pluto heard you comin' (Shit)
Actin' like Regina, you a lil' bit dramatic (George)
I been in the cockpit, I been in the cabin (Right)
Take the ego out, just revolve around the planet (Right)
Damn, I'm like Kirby, man, I don't take damage
Oh, so hot, so, sst, get branded
I'm just havin' fun, cops hit me, goddamn it

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
Trauma got me fucked up, my mama got me fucked up
My lil' nigga locked up, it's like Hakuna Matata
Never liked sci-fi, empathetic wifi
Keep it in the back room, hidin' with my dry eye
Put it in the vacuum, I got love for my label
Fifteen million on the table, none of my niggas is stable
Need a personal connection, I just wanna feel you, baby
Bein' sober made me realize how poorly I been behavin', uh

[Chorus: Matt Champion & Merlyn Wood]
My bitch, she so pretty, pretty (Mmh)
I get cash like really, really
Tell the DJ, man, he ain't slick
'Cause he ain't playin' hits, he silly, silly (Mmh)
My bitch is so pretty, pretty (Mmh)
I get cash like really, really (Get it)
Tell the DJ, man, he ain't slick
'Cause he ain't playin' hits, he silly, silly (Boy, bye)

[Verse 4: bearface]
Ring in their ears like a bark
Always feel left in the dark
Trauma the price for the patience
Character shift like an arc
Move like my shit stay in park
Don't feel the love or respect
Grip like a hand on my neck
This is the year, place your bets
Boy, bye

[Outro: Joba & Merlyn Wood]
Ooh, ooh, beautiful and bashful
Ooh (Mmm), ooh, ooh (Mmm)
I'm beautiful and bashful
Boy, bye
Goddamn (Sheesh)
Boy, bye
Boy, bye
Goddamn
I'm beautiful and bashful

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes I need you to stay away from me
Sometimes I'm in disbelief I didn't know
Somehow, I need you to go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Don't stay (forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
What you were changing me into (Just give me myself back and) don't stay
(Forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
Take all your faithlessness with you (Just give me myself back and) don't stay

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself
Sometimes I'm in disbelief I didn't know
Somehow, I need to be alone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Don't stay (forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
What you were changing me into (Just give me myself back and) don't stay
(Forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
Take all your faithlessness with you (Just give me myself back and) don't stay

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day of you wasting me away
I don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day of you wasting me away
With no apologies

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Don't stay (forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
What you were changing me into (Just give me myself back and) don't stay
(Forget our memories, forget our possibilities)
Take all your faithlessness with you (Just give me myself back and) don't stay

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Don't stay
Don't stay

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
You guys feelin' kinda warm right now?
I want you guys to take those shirts off and put 'em over your head
Put 'em up like this, y'all
Let's go‚ come on!
Put 'em up‚ y'all!
Put 'em up‚ y'all!
Yes!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Nothin' ever stops all these thoughts
And the pain attached to them
Sometimes, I wonder why this is happenin'
It's like nothin' I could do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
'Cause from the infinite words I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
And didn't realize, instead of settin' it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me

[Pre-Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
It never goes away‚ it never goes away
And now…

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You've become a part of me, you'll always be right here
You've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me‚ I've let myself become you

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Come on

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Hearin' your name, the memory comes back again
I remember when it started happenin'
I'd see you in every thought I had, and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away, I was committin' myself to 'em
Every day, I regret sayin' those things
'Cause now, I see that I took what I hated and made it a part of me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
Never goes away, it never goes away
And now…

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You've become a part of me, you'll always be right here
You've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington, both]
Put 'em up, y'all
You ready?
Put 'em up, y'all
Put 'em up, y'all
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up! (Get away from me)
Gimme my space back, you gotta just (Go)
Everything comes down to memories of (You)
I kept it in, but now I'm lettin' you (Know)
I let you go, so get away from me
Gimme my space back, you gotta just (Go)
Everything comes down to memories of (You)
Kept it in, but now I'm lettin' you (Know)
I've let you go (And now…)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You've become a part of me, you'll always be right here
You've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've let myself become you
I've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become

[Spoken outro: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
That was pretty great, you guys!
People in the pit, you're doin' it now, huh?
This dude's got a shirt on that says, "I'm here to mosh."
Heh
He's my favorite guy in the crowd. What's up, homie?
Pit master right there
You guys ready to start this pit?
You ready to get this pit goin'?
Put 'em up if you're ready to get the pit goin'!
Come on!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I  woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
And  put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A  little taste of hypocrisy
And  I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're  still so distant and I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted  on my memories
Even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong, I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So even though you're close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm with you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I, I can't wait to see tomorrow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see, keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see, even when I close my eyes

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily façade‚ but then
I just end up getting hurt again

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself)‚ I ask why
But in my mind‚ I find I can't rely on myself
(Myself), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything‚ watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them‚ I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself
(Myself), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid that I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside
Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking

[Verse 1]
I love you
It's  obvious, but people can change
We  got bruised
We left things undecided and now we're two people
We're standing in the city rain
But  we're brand new
We  turn our backs and walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though we're through
I'm  always here for you
I know you feel it too
I'm telling you the truth

[Chorus]
Some nights‚ I go back there
Right  back where we used to love
Think I messed up somewhere
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know why I keep running
Don't know why I keep running

[Verse 2]
So far
I'm on the other side of the globe
With new friends
With someone else asleep in the sheets
But I got you‚ yeah
Locked up in a part of my brain
Forever‚ yeah
I can't forget my memories, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though we're through
I'm always here for you
I know you feel it too
I'm telling you the truth

[Chorus]
Some nights, I go back there
Right back where we used to love
Think I messed up somewhere
Don't know what I keep running from

[Bridge]
Sometimes‚ I miss you when I'm all alone
And even though we both moved on
Sometimes I play your favourite song
I play it on and on
And I, I miss you when I'm all alone
And even though we both moved on
Sometimes I play your favourite song
I play it on and on and on

[Verse 2]
Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books for the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat for some clothes and a rep
With her chin up, she scolded "All you all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step"
And step she did to the straight A's
Then college, a master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work for free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are trifling?
They just don't know
She said "Mama didn't tell'em what she told me
'Girl, you need Pussy Control'"

[Chorus]
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)

[Verse 3]
Verse 3
Pussy got bank in her pockets
Before she got dick in her drawers
If brother didn't have good and plenty of his own
In love Pussy never did fall
And this fool named Trick want to stick her
Uh, talking more shit than a bit
About how he going to make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit
Pussy said "Nigga, you crazy if you don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak (Pussy)
You can go platinum four times
Still couldn't make what I make in a week (Pussy)
So push up on somebody that want hear that
Cuz this somebody here don't want to know (Pussy)
Boy, you better act like you understand
When you roll with Pussy Control"

I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, they better not dare
Shhh - we gotta break it on down

[Verse]
In the daytime, ha, I think not!
I'd rather do you after school like some homework
Ah... am I getting you hot?
(Hot)
In my bedroom (No!) 'cause then we'd have to stop
(Please don't stop)
I'd rather wait until everyone's fast asleep
Then do it in the kitchen on the table top, oh!
We gotta break it on down (down, down, down)
Can you hear me girl?

[Chorus]
Shhh - break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds

I never thought that you would be the one
After all the things that we've been through
You gave your body to another in the name of fun
I hope you had some baby, if not, boo hoo

[Chorus]
It's so sad but I hate you

Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (Undone)
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek (At us)

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Sex (Sex) on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep ​*horn honks*​
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (Uh!)
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie

[Intro]
Killer cars
Cars
Killer cars

[Verse 1]
Too hard on the brakes again
What if these brakes just give in?
What if they don't get out of the way?
What if there's someone overtaking?
I'm going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
There could be an idiot on the road
The only kick in life is pumping his steel

[Chorus]
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive

[Verse 2]
Don't die on the motorway
The moon would freeze, the plants would die
I couldn't cope if you crashed today
All the things I forgot to say
I'm going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
What if the car loses control?
What if there's someone overtaking?

[Chorus]
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive Killer cars

[Instrumental + reporting noises]

[Chorus]
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind and drunk
No they won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive killer cars
They all drive killer cars
They all drive killer cars

[Outro]
Killer cars
Killer cars
Ah, killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars

[Verse 1]
Hey there, little boys and girls
Hey there, little boys and girls (Mmkay?)
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob
(Huh?) Say hi Bob! ("Hi, Bob!")
Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job
'Cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark
And fake like he walks his dog, drag 'em in the woods
And go straight to the chopping blocks
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face
And said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said: "Knock it off!"
But Bob wouldn't knock it off
'Cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
(AAH!) And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any—it's bad for you

[Hook]
The kids, the kids!
Don't forget about the kids, the kids!
Shady, what about the kids, the kids?
(?) The kids, the kids!
Shady, what about the kids, the kids?
You gotta save the kids!

[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck no, you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Hehehehe!)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy, it's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends
At a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys (C'mon!)
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull {​​​*blblblblblb*}​​​
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal, barfin' {​​​*BLEH*}​​​
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"H- hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting the money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders
Hunched up like he's practicin' yoga (*gasp*)
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class
'Cause it's bad for you

[Hook: Teacher]
The kids, the kids!
Shady, what about the kids-
Don't forget about the kids, the kids!

[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humungous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure
They pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it- put it- put it- put it- put it-

[Intro]
Like my man Yau' will I use a fork?
But never, ever, ever, am I eating fucking pork

[Chorus: Beastie Boys]
Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
(Mike D, come and rock the sure shot)

[Verse 1: Mike D]
I've got the brand new doo-doo, guaranteed like Yoo-hoo
I'm on like Dr. John, yeah, Mr. Zu Zu
I'm a newlywed, not a divorcee (yeah)
And everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey

[Verse 2: Ad-Rock]
Well it's the taking of the Pelham 1, 2, 3
If you want a doody rhyme, then come see me
I've got the savior faire with the unique rhymin'
I keep it on and on, it's never quitting time and

[Verse 3: MCA]
Strictly handheld is the style I go
Never rock the mic with the pantyhose
I strap on my ear goggles and I'm ready to go
‘Cause at the boards is the man, they call the Mario, we-oh

[Verse 4: Mike D]
You pull up at the function and you know I Kojak
To all the party people that are on my Bozac
I've got more action than my man, John Woo
And I've got mad hits like I was Rod Carew (yeah)

[Chorus: Beastie Boys]
Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop

(Ad-Rock, come and rock the sure shot)

[Verse 5: Ad-Rock]
Hurra-, Hurra-
Cane will cross fade on your ass and bust your eardrums
Listen everybody cause I'm shifting gears
I'm fresh like Dougie when I get my specs
And on the microphone, I come correct

[Verse 6: MCA]
Timing like a clock when I rock the hip-hop
Top notch is my stock on the soapbox
I've got more rhymes than I've got gray hairs
And that's a lot because I've got my share (oohh, weee)

[Verse 7: Mike D]
I've got a hole in my head and there's no one to fix it
I gotta straighten my thoughts
I'm thinking too much (yeah) sick shit
Everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes
I'll have to step back, I gotta contemplate

[Verse 8: Ad-Rock]
Well, I'm like Lee Perry, I'm very on
Rock the microphone, and then I'm gone
I'm like Vaughn Bode, I'm a Cheech Wizard
Never quittin', so won't you listen

[Chorus: Beastie Boys]
Because you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Because you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
(MCA, come and rock the sure shot)

[Verse 9: MCA]
I want to say a little something that's long overdue
The disrespect to women has got to be through
To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends
I want to offer my love and respect to the end

[Verse 10: Mike D]
Well, you say I'm twenty-something and I should be slacking
But I'm working harder than ever and you could call it macking
So I'm supposed to sit upon my couch just watching my TV
I'm still listening to wax, I'm not using the CD

[Verse 11: Ad-Rock]
Well, I'm that kid in the corner all fucked up and I wanna
So I'm gonna (yeah) take a piece of the pie
Why not, I'm not quittin'
Think I'm-a change up my style just to fit in

[Verse 12: MCA]
I keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic
I use a bullshit mic that's made out of plastic
To send my rhymes out to all the nations
Like Ma Bell, I got the ill communication

[Chorus: Beastie Boys]
Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Because you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop

[Verse 1]
Brand new Bugatti
Hoes droppin' they toppy
Hop in the Rari, damn
Gas got me high as safari, phew
Pass me the molly
Pass me the Uzi, I catch me a body
Sittin' in the 'Gatti (God)
Man, they can't save the lil' boy
His mama, she worried (Fah)
First he was a goon, now she on the news
She breakin' the rules
That's a 2015, got it sittin' in the parkin' lot
Top off like a hottie, top off like a skripper, nigga
28, sold the truck, big dipper, nigga
Came with me, I'ma help a nigga
Yeah, but-but-but-but, if you listen I can help a nigga
Yeah, yeah, I can tip a nigga
I'm wearin' ice, no 'cicle, nigga
Plus I'm a purple ape sipper, nigga
Ah, came from the projects with a drop head
Lookin' like a sped, hey
Hol' up, wait, babe
Slow it down, don't speed
Three bitches with me; Ed, Edd and Eddy
I fuck her good with no latex
She never hit with no latex
And I love her for that

[Verse 2]
New coupe, uh, I'm higher, my crew higher
I'm the rich the kid, buy ya nigga, who try ya?
My desire, your desire, we a empire, yeah
Man I'm bleedin' like a vampire
All my diamonds flat black like a vampire
Put some in that nature, hitchhiker
My bitches are sideswipers
Really wanna put the bands on you
Have you ever took a loss for a 50, then 12 hit the spot and put the band on her?
Have you ever hit the road with a hunnid whole bales, now the windows got saran on it?
Man, I'm the god damn man, y'all niggas are boys
Man, I'm the god damn man, y'all niggas are boys
Ah, with the dope, Jackie Chan on it
I can whip a half a bird with no hand, homie
I know it well, I can whip it with no land, homie
I blew that, blew that, paper like a fan on it
Yeah, he a man and you a boy
Even though all my weed is loud, I'm bringin' that noise

[Intro: Mike Posner]
David Banner, they
Good  mornin'
This  that alarm clock song
I made it for you to wake up to
Ah

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
You  know I came to rip the scene apart
My  whole life is a piece of art (Oh)
And this is just a brush stroke (Oh)
I  made it in the biz they said was cutthroat (Oh)
I'm gettin' where I wanna be, but honestly
I can't even tell if that's really where I wanna be
I'm not a commodity, I am on a odyssey
Used  to be a wannabe, now I'm what I wanted to be, woo
I'm a underdog, dawg, I'm Ralph Naderin'
Followin' my intuition now and that's a major win
I'm Taylor Swift mixed with Ruth Bader Gins'
Liberation is the flavor that I'm savorin', it's mmm
Fake breasts and makeup, they don't turn me on
Life is a game and, yes, the journey's long
Growing my beard was just like me puttin' my jersey on
Coach K saw the light in me early on

[Interlude: Mike Posner & Coach K]
Oh, you don't believe?
Mike Posner, boy, is he talented, I mean
That's from '08
Yeah, he's so talented
What up, Nolan?
Jon, go get 'em, woo

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
We 'bout to take it to a new level
Even when I'm sad, I give 'em hell, I'm a Blue Devil
Her boyfriend wrote a book, I was unimpressed
I don't care about her man if it wasn't Hesse (Oh)
I might do Everest, you never know (Oh)
And change is like a metronome (Oh)
I never read The Untethered Soul (Oh)
I already got an untethered soul (Oh)
I wasted years tryna become better known (Oh)
Right when I gave that up is when I became better known (Oh)
Oh, this is that Michigan December flow
I got two lifetimes worth of ideas in my Evernote (Oh)
Old soul, Fender Rhodes (Oh)
Complimented outwardly now from my inner glow (Oh)
And since I've seen
I changed my look to see who really loves me
I'm Prince Akeem

[Interlude: Wiz Khalifa]
See, when I was comin' up
I was always one of them niggas who did what the fuck I want
Smokin' weed on TV wasn't even cool
Now that shit legal
So back then, from causin' trouble to right now
I'm a motherfuckin' businessman, hahahahaha

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, too rich to ever fit in
You wait in front, I get in
You talk too much, I listen
You blind, I got the vision
The day I worked for myself, that was the best decision
You livin' check-to-check, I check to see what checks I'm gettin'
You get no respect until respect is given
I live with no regret, you regret where you livin'
Still got the yellow car, we in the house chillin'
You think the air is on, I'm heir to the throne
So many diamonds, people stare when I put 'em on
But they don't walk up, my pockets thick like Ms. Parker
And I got the Benz parked, sparkin' up (Sparkin' up)
And I got a '64 that's hard as fuck (Hard as fuck)
But don't get in over your head
Supposed to be stackin' instead of spendin' most of your bread (Bread)
Don't get in over your head
Supposed to be stackin' instead of spendin' most of your bread (Bread)

[Outro: Billy Joel]
It's just a half a mile away
Ooh, ooh, yeah
It's just a half a mile away
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Intro]
Yo, let me tell you 'bout a crew I know
The crash unit had to come and steal the show
Whenever nervous wrecks and therapists come
To take you back, you know the job ain't done
And I know, oh yes, I know, I know because I'm Therapist son
Yo, check this out
At the high house
Work, yo

[Verse 1]
I appeal to the criminal minds
You've been blinded, this shit is so timeless
You need to open your eyes, you cat-napping
My squad blasts tracks, see proof, back tracking (Therapist)
Now what you know about ill flows, you not go (Ah)
You'se a suck off, bitch I'm a hard stroke
Etching my name in the payments so mistake forever
I'm paying dues, make more moves than the game of checkers (Checkers)
So get your back sticks
And when you come here, act like you have sense
Don't talk out your ass bitch
My raps is classic and crafted, I know the ropes
Sucker MC's never make it up the totem pole
Who knows and goes
Crash, you niggas starving now
Any faggot talking out his ass, better crumble down
'Cause I'm all about drama, my crowd too big to swallow
So trust me, when my mood swings, my pistol follow
What? After all weight turns out
Tools get burned out, your rhymes is run out
I immediately come out raw, ready to blast out (Birds)
Don't boast my roast, my very last nerve
I give the last word and the last how, ha
Tryna laugh past you, rap asses
Now sit back, relax and jack your safety buckles
The caskets tryna make me stumble, they just make me chuckle
I hate to break your bubble but I'm the freshest
Don't even try to test this
You only touch kids that's child molesters, I'm a lesson
Cat's like you, dime a dozen, you just play hard
Panic rapping, just don't quit your day job
My rap control is insane when I say rhymes
These goon walls can't hold a flame to mine
And as an MC on this dope record
Time that we break for a second

[Interlude]
(Man speaks)

[Verse 2]
Yo, break is over, we taking over
Let's ride through your home spot, I be the controller
You can't grab hold of
Your catch is field mice, I'll be King Cobra
The ride of rude rebels, at level fifteen
The ends boosted up to ten, you know what I mean
It seems you got some bitch within you
My peoples stare down the whole damn venue
Not a part, not a fractional so what
Crackled ceilings and crumbled walls
Long terrain, immune to the pain
We save enough, y'all putting money down in vain
You ain't no big dawg, no pay day
You pay, them hoes pop, you get your wig peeled
You ain't no big dawg, you not no big dick
You paid, them hoes po, you get your wig picked
You pray my logo, I heard you pitch well
You tryna bug out, I sit still
Yo, I feel like you should both come to terms
Even though I can't smah up your concerns
Hypothetically or in reality
Taking you out, is a small technicality
Rhymes like these or rhymes like this up
While I diss 'em, soft, silly, low budget sucker like yourself
I got the style, you couldn't eat at my household
I labeled it sucker boy style
I like to do it once in a while

[Outro]
(Static speaking)

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I Am Not A Human Being
Part 2, Check me out

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, Uh
I fell in love with a pedestrian
'Cause she walked right over me
I should run over that bitch at a crosswalk
In my new Mercedes, I forgot to dance when she played me like a ukelele
Huh, just another sad love song
Like Toni Braxton, should've played you like a saxophone
At least we coulda made music, instead of trippin'
I bought the bitch a dozen roses with eleven missin'
Huh, she said she wanna be a lifeguard
Bitch, you can't even save yourself, fuck you talkin' 'bout?
Huh, I park my dick up in her garage
But I shoulda treated that pussy like a parking lot
Yeah, the players fucked up
She was loose as a goose but I should've ducked
Her, and sure, I still hit her up, but only to say I fuckin' hate you, bitch

[Chorus: Ben]
I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face (Yeah)
And now my life is lookin' up now (I-I fuckin' hate when I'm insecure)
And she's already been replaced (Fuck)
I don't need her, you know I don't need her
I don't need her anymore (I fuckin' feel like I'm about to cry)
No, I don't need her
She know I don't need her (Like when Tom Hanks lost Wilson on Castaway)
But now she's seemin' insecure (Damn)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, okay I got a new one
And she never pissed me off
That's a toilet bowl, no urine
And I used to think about you when I be wit' her
Oh, now you fly?
Bitch I knew you when you were a caterpillar
And homicide, crosses my mind
Once or twice I admit
I feel like an asshole, that ain't never have shit
Now some say love is a drug I beg to differ
'Cause I sniffed her, and I smelt another dick on her breath
And still kissed her
Fuck I'm stupid
I kidnap cupid
And teach him how to hate
Then teach him how to skate
No, you ain't on my calendar, but at least I got a date
To drown you out I buy a house, buy a beach and buy a lake
I fell defeat to my mistakes, but who doesn't?
I heard your man was gay
Does that mean you have 2 husbands?
You fuckin' slut
I'd do better fuckin' sluts up the butt
Then let you come and kiss the shit out my dick, pucker up
Ha

[Chorus 2: Ben]
I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face
And now my life is lookin' up now
And she's already been replaced
I don't need her, you know I don't need her
I don't need her anymore
No, I don't need her
She know I don't need her
But now she's seemin' insecure
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
See, when times get hard
So does my dick
And for some funny reason
I think of you
And um
I just wanna grab a rifle and
Shoot myself in the head because
I-I-I just can't get rid of the thoughts
Bitch

[Chorus 3 / Outro: Ben & Lil Wayne]
I gave her flowers, but they weren't roses
So she threw them back in my face
And now my life is lookin' up now As a matter of fact, let me take that rifle
And she's already been replaced And I'ma um
I don't need her, you know I don't need her I'ma swing by your crib
I don't need her anymore And um
No, I don't need her I hope your man is there
She know I don't need her I-I still got that key
But now she's seemin' insecure That you gave me
Yeah, yeah, yeah Ha
Hold up, hold up
Let me find that key
Alright, I got it
Yo, fuck both of y'all
Yeah... Shady
Haha  (Wooo)
50  Cent... GgGgG G Unit
Haha (Here we go again)
Yeah Uh huh (Haha)

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Does  it make you mad when I switch my flow
You  can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent I'm on fire 'cause Shady said so... I'm On Fire

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Everybodys  in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
Ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me I'm better off just left alone
And  I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what up keep steppin' and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons‚ jail
And livin' wreckless‚ but if you would check my belt
You may see something else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and
Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more I don't got to
Got under cover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line
But this motherfucker Ja must've lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin' to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael?
Just keep singing the same song recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you don't really want to step inside no mic booth
Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
I'll hurt your pride dog and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya
Killin' you faster
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it
You'd bump this shit too if we didn't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So what's the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog
How come you didn't say you had a problem then
When you was standin' there with all you men
We could've solved it then I'm a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow
Another one of them lil x pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you want to be (Cmon)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
You couldn't slug me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
Ja‚ you Stuart Little, shells will lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol
I clap at yo ass with this chrome 38
And put 6 through your hats a 7 and 3/8's
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you Shook Knight
I put my knife in ya wind pipe
Then freeze on this turn pike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got robbed two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with Steven Segal

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Yo fuck that I'm tired of waiting
These industry niggas starting to get out of hand
Like I won't find your whereabouts by stomping em out your man
We killin' New York even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised‚ blowin' chocolate up out the van and
They see me pop up more icy because I could
You been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood, good
Least when your paranoid its hard to make a song
How you want it with us and half of your artists got makeup on
Every magazine I open you on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even get shot yet you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' bout what pain is sucker
I put your ass in the ground like a train conductor motherfucker

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
Yeah nigga
Shady Aftermath
G Unit
Fuck you think they call us G Unit for?
'Cause we move units
Uh huh
And don't think we ain't billin' you for this motherfuckin' studio time
Matter fact keep em on 50
We call it even. Ha

[Intro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Marshall! Sounds like an SOS
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!
To the Rapmobile—let's go!
(Marshall! Marshall!)
Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!
Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducing the star of our show
His name is (Marshall!)
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You're 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear, fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, "Holy bat syllables!"
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around round here
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah!)

[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Outro: Eminem]
So there you have it, folks
(Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away
Until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time, friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night, everyone!
Thank you for coming! Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
Oh! Heh

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm a pacifist, unless there’s ass to kick
It'll be tragic miss, If I don't fuck you bitch
You can take the dick you little cunt
Lick it than pass it like a blunt
But I’m sober now I'm done with drugs
That was the last chapter this is the next one
My place in the game is big, son
I'm somewhere between God, Godzilla, and King Kong
A Monster, yeah like his dick is
They say I'm hung like a bear, so run, run bitches
The chainsaw can give you staple stitches
If your unfaithful, just kill your wife than rape your mistress
And if that don't work your a fucking retard
I'm sick of playing games, I'm here for revenge, Dee Barnes
Slapping up Dre for what he start-
Ed, long time ago and it left him scarred

[Chorus: Eminem]
Everybody knows I'm crazy
This game isn’t gonna change me
There’s nothing else to say, see
You already know I'm Shady
Everybody knows I’m crazy
This game isn't gonna change me
There's nothing else to say, see
You already know I'm Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
I’m assuming you don't want to battle
That will be your dying day
Into your house bullets will rattle
You just cannot win this fray
Don't believe me ask Ray (Cornrows)
(I heard he thinks he's gangsta), but he's really not though
(so don't fuck with Slim), that's the goal
(he'll burn your house down), and relocate you to the motorhomes
Holdin' pullin' moldin' chrome
Oldest, dopest, grossest flow
Killer, father, loving home
Family jealous of all this gold
Everybody wants a million from Shady
Even the goddamn motherfuckers who hate me
But I stays crazy, and sprayz AKs at babys
Me and Drezy (Yeah Slim your Shady)

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Mothefucker I told you I was (crazy)
The game done helped (shape me)
The only thing left to (say b)
Is hey (Slim your Shady)
Mothefucker I told you I was (Crazy)
The game done helped (Shape me)
The only thing left to (Say b)
Is hey (Slim your Shady)

[Outro: Eminem]
Relapse 2 mothafuckas
Fuck you and your mothas
Dre grab the gat *gunshots*

[Refrain 1: Eminem]
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round  the outside, 'round the outside
Two  trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside‚ 'round the outside

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back‚ back again
Shady's  back‚ tell a friend
Guess  who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess  who's back‚ guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady‚ I'm chopped liver
Well,  if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!"
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the Winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, "Attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking "this shit, that shit"
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
20,000,000 other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Outro: Eminem]
Hum dei dei la la, la la la la la

Kids!

[Intro: Eminem, DJ Butter & Bizarre]
I am not a gay basher (bash faggots)
Shit happens y'all
The rap game, hip-hop 101
The hardest nice to five you'll ever have
You can't remember shit in no history book
You ready to rap motherfucker?
You ready to sell your soul?
Ha, ha, ha, ha
The rap game will fuck you

[Verse 1: D12 Member]
I'm a disrupted nigga, you made me crazy
You shoulda slayed me as a baby
Behavin' shadier the Wes Craven
And you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me, punk it's over, you'll faint fast
I've never fucked up to where I can't whoop your ass
You'll neck'll will get snapped with bare hands, fuck music
Is he rappin'? It's cool but fools, just don't confuse it
What happens, these dudes get rude, then I lose it
I m scandalous, I blow your two kids off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger then Godzilla's back, nigga
You are not realer, in fact you'll feel the effects
Of a crack dealer, y'all president since we smacked
And got a Mac-10 with it, so I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that, don't mistakin' me black
'Cause you'll be stankin' in the back of a fuckin' Cadillac

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm a get snuffed, 'cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I pipe down when the White House is wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dyke get sniped out
Lights out, bitch, adios, goodnight
Now put that in your little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute 'cause the hype had died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America, fuck the government
Tell that seed Deloris, tell the slut to suck a dick
Motherfucker ducked, what the fuck? Son of a bitch
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade, with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword and since he
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that utslay itchbay
Ucksay my icknay, 'scuse my igpay atinlay
But uckfay, it pays

[Chorus: Eminem & D12 Member]
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm tellin you, no, it ain't happening
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
This rap game, this rap game

[Verse 3: D12 Member]
I bet ya lovin me (??), drink and drown in my own iniquity
But fuck that, I m gonna rap till y all get sick of me
And clutch my last sack, it s been all who big on me
I'm pickin a rot mix, fuck the dog who single me
I m saying you motherfuckers, don't know ith, who playin'
If I m broke, then I m brakin open the place where you layin'
You know, same she every nigga done in his life
I livin this why (??), speak long (??), what I blow when I write
So why, should i, ever fear another man, if he bleed like I bleed
Take a piss when he stand, ok you win, you can say we can't rap
But no shots (??), never me (??), you never (??), and I don t wanna (??)
When they say it was wack...

[Verse 4:]
I walk in the party and just start bustin
Right after I hear the last of self destruction
This liquer makes me wanna blast the chrome
To let you know that time without morse dangerom (??), (nigga)
I low down and shifty, quickly call swifty
To do a drive-by on the ten speed with fifty
You feelin lucky squeeze, I catch you outside of chucky cheese
With you see (??) who be unlucky g, my lifestyle is unstable
A partyin addict, they said no fightin in the club
So I brought me a matic, coughin the static
I jump nigga's call me a rabbit
Pop in the tavern and guns are so just irratic...

[Chorus...]
Believe me, we run this rap shit forchezy
Make makin millions look easy
Everywhere you turn you see me
You hear me

Believe me, you see my pistol and three dead
No time to call the peace treaty
Dial 911 cause you need the...,
Police to help you, believe me

[Verse 5:]
I haft to tunnel from the side walk and piss on the curve
This is obserde, these street nigga s twistin my words
We finally could say goodbye to hollywood
Cause boots and shine pants, is nothin in commin
The nasty been with gasoline cans (??)
We never bow down to be a flashin a pig (??)
No one must, fuck this statue dawg
Nothin to do with hands when I clap with yall
Put your job on the ground (??), then the dog in the pound (??)
Then I m goin out of town, for the law come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle gats
Matter a fact we can battle with placks

(eminem)

This rap game

[Verse 6: Bizarre]
I m too fuckin retarted, I don t give a fuck about my dick
Thats why I m date in raymond bobbet
My crew had a arguement who was the largest
Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist
Plus I made the beat to all the raps
Well I really didn't but I did according to this contract
I was thrown in the snow with no where to go
Freezin 20 below forced to join, bail shit, then blow (??)
My little girl, she should nt listen to these lyrics
Thats why I glued here headphones to her ears
To make sure she hear it
If rap don't work I m startin a group with garth brooks
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
This ain't the hook... (??)

[Chorus: Eminem & D12 Member]
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm tellin you, no, it ain't happening
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
This rap game, this rap game

Wanna lick the diamond, wanna lick the diamonds

Hmm, hmm

[Verse 1]
When I look out my window
Many sights to see
And when I look in my window
So many different people to be

[Pre-Chorus]
They're strange, so strange
It's very strange to me

[Chorus]
You've got to pick up every stitch (Gonna be)
You've got to pick up every stitch (Gonna be, gonna be)
You've got to pick up every stitch
Oh no, must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch

[Post-Chorus]
(Gonna be)

[Verse 2]
When I look over my shoulder (What happens then?)
What do you think I see? (Mmm)
Some other cat looking over (Shadoop, shadoop)
Over the shoulder at me (Ah, at me)

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's strange, so strange (So strange)
He's very strange to me

[Chorus]
You've got to pick up every stitch (Gonna be)
You've got to pick up every stitch (Gonna be, gonna be)
Beatniks are out to make it rich
Oh no, must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch

[Bridge]
Witch, witch
Said it must be the season, must be the season, must be the season (Witch)
Said it must be the season, must be the season, must be the season (Of the witch)
Said it must be the season, must be
