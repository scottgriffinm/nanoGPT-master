ay that you will be by my side?
To see me through, until my life is through

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I

I am glad at least in my life I found someone
Who may not be here forever to see me through
But I found strength in you

I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

Cause in my mind, you will stay here always
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
In my mind we can conquer the world
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I

Saviour
Hah hah ah yeah
Saviour

[Chorus]
You say that I'm lost and you can help me find
But I don't want to be a saviour, no
I wish that you could tell me something to change my mind
But you don't want to be my saviour (no)

[Verse 1]
She wants to feel me (feel me)
She wants to find a way to heal me (heal me)
But I bet she'll never find the real me, hah hah oh yeah

And that she thinks that I can make her feel less lonely (lonely)
She said she's got so much to show me, hah hah oh yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up and I've been down

(I know) I'll never be the one for you
(I know) It doesn't matter what you're going through
I'm gonna keep on singing

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up and I've been down
Watching life go 'round and 'round

(I know) 'Cause I don't want to listen anymore
I'm gonna keep on singing

[Outro]

[CALL]
I don't wanna be a leader, I just wanna be a friend

I don't wanna be a preacher, I just wanna be a man
I won't let you exaltate me, just keep me as I am

[RESPONSE]
You don't wanna be my saviour, you don't wanna close that door

That's right, niggas gon' lose (lose)

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign & Lupe Fiasco]

Be a mothafuckin' winner, never gotta worry 'bout nothin'
But some niggas gon' lose
Yeah, so niggas don't lose
And it's fucked up, some niggas gon' lose
Ayy, you wake up 'cause you hear shots
Mean another nigga got his tear drops
And you call his phone and ain't pickin' up
And your stomach hurtin', that fear drops
I hope a nigga ain't lose

I'm a Multi-Millionaire
Multi-Millionaire La Flare nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Struttin' on the stage, centre of the lights
Trippin' smiles ain't coming down
Take your seat now

[Chorus]
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I'll put on a private show
We’ll be wiling out on the low
Work it, work it, boy, watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy, watch me work it

All my feelings are, about to erupt
All my tricks, they're spectacular

Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Struttin' on the stage, centre of the lights
Trippin' smiles ain't coming down
Take your seat now

[Chorus]
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I'll put on a private show
We’ll be wiling out on the low
Work it, work it, boy, watch me work it

Rose gold watch, but my bottle pink gold
Three red hoes walking round in red robes

Take a white girl out a trailer make her Iggy
Take a black bitch outta Magic make her Nicki
Pissy yellow Rollie, baby pissy in her feelings

Brown skin chick and she love to wear purple
Her nails purple, lips purple, pussy hair purple
Big titty Amazon in my black Benz
I'm rich black man got a couple white friends

[Chorus: Young Thug & Gucci Mane]
Dream, it's a young nigga dream, yeah

Old rich ass nigga, I got everything

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
My teeth white like a toilet tissue
Stop the cappin', boy you know you miss her

Lil' mama crazy she gon' try to kill you

Boss man from the 1248
For the clan, nigga 12, 40 plays

Pockets full of money, Master P, ay

Flood your ears, your neck, your wrist, your fingers
And put it all on the rocks
Say Guwop home and yeah it’s official, grab some tissues
Wasting my time
Resting my mind
And I’ll never pine
For the sad days and the bad days
When we was workin’ from nine to five
And if you don’t mind
I’ll spend my time
Here by the fire side
In the warm light and the love in her eyes

And if you don’t mind
I’ll spend my time
Here by the fire side
In the warm light of her eyes

[Verse 1]
The path you tread is narrow
And the drop is shear and very high
The ravens all are watching
From a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping
Like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end
Will the final couplet rhyme

[Chorus]
And it’s high time
Cymbaline
It’s high time
Cymbaline
Please wake me

[Verse 2]
A butterfly with broken wings
Is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in
And there’s nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent
Are both busy on the phone
Selling coloured photographs
To magazines back home

[Chorus]
And it’s high time
Cymbaline
It’s high time
Cymbaline
Please wake me

[Verse 3]
The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you
That they’re moving into range
Doctor Strange is always changing size

[Chorus]
And it’s high time
Cymbaline
It’s high time
Cymbaline
Please wake me
And it’s high time
Cymbaline
It’s high time
Cymbaline
Please wake me
Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore

She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions of her playing
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her cry ev’ry time

Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned

[Intro]
(Here)
(Hey)
Fighting f- calls
(Here)

[Verse 1]
I’m not a stranger
Let’s pick up the pace love
Your drinks are paid for
Jump up that palm tree
Let’s spark on the roof top oh
What personality?
All I see is lip gloss
Lost in your color scheme
Look what we started oh no is that what we’re on

[Hook]
That’s when I felt your heart
Lessons from the karma sutra
Don’t make me love to quick (uh)
Stop
Let’s SWITCH-UP
Let’s SWITCH-UP

[Bridge]
Love is just a straight away (Come here)
Right before the heartbreak (You 

[?])
Fighting for the right calls (My dear)
Wouldn’t have it any other way

[Verse 2]
What’s the occasion?
Like we ever needed one
We’ve all been patient
Let’s just get started maybe your girlfriend can watch

[Hook]
That’s when I felt your heart
Lessons from the karma sutra
Don’t make me love to quick (uh)
Stop
Let’s SWITCH-UP
Let’s SWITCH-UP

[Outro]
Love is just a straight away
Right before the heartbreak
Fighting for the right calls
Wouldn’t have it any other way
Love is just a straight away (Come here)
Right before the heartbreak (You sweating)
Fighting for the right calls (My dear)
Wouldn’t have it any other way
(Come here)
(My dear)
(Come here)

[Verse 1]
I can't stop listening to this
Voice in my head
Got me tearing through the covers
On this rusty spring bed

Bust through the doors
Flames kissing my back
That's all I remember
And then everything's black

You know, it sounds so familiar
Some place hot in my soul
Hello, transmission:
Now you're in control

[Chorus]
I look up (Ooh)
I look down (Ooh)
Everybody's bathing in Holy Water
Ain't enough going around
Raise their cups (Ooh)
Wear their crowns (Ooh)
You're sitting on a gold-stained altar
Feel the jungle youth sound, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I woke in a fever
Taste the blood in my mouth
My eyes bruised shiny purple
And I'm riddled with doubt

It feels so peculiar
Boiling hot in my soul
Farewell, transmission:
Not meant for this world

[Chorus]
I look up (Ooh)
I look down (Ooh)
Everybody's bathing in Holy Water
Ain't enough going around

Raise their cups (Ooh)
Wear their crowns (Ooh)
You're sitting on a gold-stained altar
Feel the jungle youth sound, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
Tonight
Drifted off to sleep
Tonight
Must be having a bad dream, when...

[Chorus]
I look up (Ooh)
I look down (Ooh)
Everybody's bathing in Holy Water
Ain't enough going around

Raise their cups (Ooh)
Wear their crowns (Ooh)
You're sitting on a gold-stained altar
Feel the jungle youth sound, ooh, ooh

Mike WiLL Made It

[Chorus]
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Fuck the feds, fuck the police, fuck the DEA (DEA)
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Ex-drug dealer, used to sell a brick a day
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Recovering drug addict, I used to drink a pint a day
(pint a day)
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Recovering drug addict, I used to smoke a pound a day (pound a day)

[Interlude]

Zwizzop

[Verse]
When the sun comes out it takes the rain away
But just like Noah it been rainin' the last 40 days
Takin' pain pills, tryna take the pain away
Sold my first 8-ball and bought me my first pair of J's
Momma cussing out these disrespectful ass J's
They knockin' on the door, know I'm just in the 7th grade
I'm mixin' codeine pills and molly in a lemonade
I feel like Price, get so damn high, might just die any day (purple)
For all you junkies that's addicted, please don't get offended
I'm a recovering drug addict and that's not my intention
That OG gas hit my mailbox like a magazine subscription
My doctor in the feds for writing bad prescriptions
I got so drunk I left Privé and I crashed a Bentley
I'm a mathematician
I'm too stoned to miss it
I got the best intentions but I made rash decisions
Throwin' cash at bitches
Spend like half a chicken
Before I started rapping I was worth half a ticket
Took your stash to get it
Or spent it so fast it's silly
I drop the top on my Rolls Royce, I ride past the prison
They hate with a passion, I guess that's the new fashion, is it

[Chorus]
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Fuck the feds, fuck the police, fuck the DEA (DEA)
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Ex-drug dealer, used to sell a brick a day (brick a day)
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Recovering drug addict, I used to drink a pint a day
(pint a day)
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Recovering drug addict, I used to smoke a pound a day (pound a day)

[Outro]
Fuck the feds, fuck the police, fuck the DEA (DEA)
I can't even sleep, I can't even sleep, I can't even sleep

[Intro]
Turn me, turn the, turn the beat down a little bit
Now I'm not just sayin' that shit just for the intro
Yeah, yeah, I sound good
Fix the pre, yeah
I'm sippin' on Jupiña and Patron, nigga
Some shit like that, you know
Uh, yeah

[Verse]
Yeah, I swear I'm feelin' like my greatest ever
Niggas like a cuban link the way we stay together
Shout out all my exes, y'all just made me better
I had a couple of your friends rock my favorite sweaters
Strip club or sun and rain. the way we change the weather
We ain't pay together
I feel like I got mob ties the way I made forever
Fuck them bitches
They ain't gotta run no numbers my nigga, so up in digits
We done paid dogs, made money, made sauce
Niggas got a feelin' nigga, not a single day off, nah
Supposed to attend the Juno's but I'm out with Uno
Said fuck story, cut a track with Rory
They want me up in Liv, this shit like 50 bands
They got the money but fuck 'em dog, if they can't afford me
Out in Europe on tour, bitches can't ignore me
Ain't gotta save no video to my phone
Them bitches out there would 'gram it for me
It's so crazy
I done came from beggin' niggas for Js
To sellin' out all my shows like I'm HOV, Jay Z
My flow so pimp like hoe, pay me
I've been ballin' out these shows
Gettin' money all day, stylin' on these hoes
Feelin' like I'm in New Orleans and hoes look at me like Mr. Carter at the 'Grove
Trap star killin' shit, slaughter at the stove
Miss me with the bullshit, I started like I'm Rose
Pissin' off fathers, got they daughters at the shows
Set the standards high, so I went and copped the Rolls
Went and copped the Wraith when I shoulda bought the Ghost
And Tice just walked in, man, he hot up off the stove
Killin' radio, I guess that shit we got in common
A 150k in a week, fuck a comment
No blog can stop me, no dog can stop me
Menace to society, O-dog's beside me
Check 'em, he might pull out, woah dog he's grimy
I was in the hall sellin' dog-dog in real life
Jump shot ugly but I ball dog in real life
I give the game insight to my trill life
Then I pick and roll this shit like a give and go
James Brown, mixtape, album, I give 'em soul
Plan to go diamond while a nigga give 'em gold
Shit is gettin' realer and my niggas gettin' triller
At the BET like, "How they give my shit to Tiller?"
I mean that's my nigga but I came up from the skrilla
And I want that shit the hardest, every artist gotta feel, though
(How you like that, babe?)
My flow is like vargas in vanilla
Have 'em all shook, give 'em Parkinsons and kill ya
(How you like that, babe?)
I'm movin' like Marcy and Matilda
Flow so cold, they could do it nigga, sly me
Screw face, capital nigga, we from the grimy
Shooters Dej Loaf, they don't let a nigga try me
Stretchin' a brick
Bitches they connected to my dick
I swear you woulda had to call 'em hoes siamese
At Hong Shing niggas cookin' with the Chinese
Hood bitch from Brooklyn, had her lookin' like a dime piece
Camp David sessions got me goin' in with Johann
Ex conversations nigga, I ain't tryna prolong
My flow so strong, nigga, the dough so long
Shooters that come with all the machines like Voltron
Niggas faker than the shit that got sold on
And they gettin' jealous, the flow is just so embellished
Niggas got it switched like somehow we made each other
XXL pissed, somehow I ain't take they cover
So they writin' blog shit, taunt me and say I'm wrong
Like damn, Vanessa, dog, I thought we was fuckin' dogs
When I was fuckin' off, these niggas was uninvolved
They hate they gotta blog me, they hate that I come in charge
(How you like that, babe?)
I got problems that I gotta come resolve
'Til them pussy niggas check me, I'll be stuntin' with my dogs
Wassup

[Outro]
They not gon' like me dog, I Told You. But niggas gotta respect me though. We run the city in our joggin' pants nigga
Nigga like Fargo, he keep it cooler than Teddy Pendergrass in a snowstorm sippin' milkshake with his throw on, nigg,. Jahlil, what up nigga? Canada

Flintstones, meet the Flintstones
They're a modern stone age family
(Stone age family)

From the town of Bedrock
They're a page right out of history

Let's ride with the family down the street
Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet

When you're with the Flintstones
Have a yabba dabba doo old time

Flintstones. Meet the Flintstones
They're a modern stone age family

From the town of Bedrock
They're a page right out of history

Let's ride with the family down the street
Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet
When you're with the Flintstones
Have a yabba yabba doo time
Have a yabba doo time
We're gonna have a gay old time

[?]
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah...

[Instrumental Break]

Now it's time to meet the Flinstones

[Chorus]
Flintstones, meet the Flintstones
They're a modern stone age family

From the town of Bedrock
They're a page right out of history

Someday, maybe Fred will win the fight
And that cat will stay out for the night

When you're with the Flintstones
Have a yabba yabba doo time
We'll have a gay old time

[Intro]
Yo, remember back on the boule when cats used to harmonize like
Yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen, the Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!

[Verse 1]
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again (x3)

[Hook]
Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Verse 2]
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen)
Let's not pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within? (x3)
Come again (x3)

[Bridge (x3)]
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

[Hooks]
Girls you know you’d better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Guys you know you’d better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Girls you know you’d better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

"Well, who is 'Biggie Smalls'?"

[Intro]
Notorious Biggie Smalls in full effect
Got my DJ Fifty Grand in the house, you know what I'm saying
I'ma nice long rhyme on this funky track
You know how we get down, yo

[Verse 1]
Shake your head and say damn (yeah!)
When the words from Big-man
Explode like an ash-can
While DJ Fifty Grand
Kick beats like Van Damme
That fighting ass nigga?
Introducing the supreme Bigga, nigga!
Yes, it's the B
I break with the bonus
Bumrush bums and bitch-ass opponents
Bucks plug out ya brain
Break your back bone
Send ya back home
Back to the wack zone
Try to underrate the heavy weight
But when I dominate, you couldn’t wait to play me on your tape
Press rewind, maybe two times or three times
Here to rhyme, to blind your mind like Moonshine
Biggie Smalls got bitches in Brazil, boy
Use a rubber if the bitch is on the pill, boy
The complete opposite of a kill-joy
Stick-ups, shoot-outs, hustling, I get ill, boy
Niggas run up, they say "Big, I wanna battle ya!
I think I could burn ya!" from where, Attica?
Look at you, you're shaking like a pair of dice!
And when I rip ya, rob ya, roast ya then you'll say I'm trice!
Man, don't try to gas me or juice me
Smoke you like a loosie
I pack a MAC, you pack a deuce-deuce, G
So press up
Before you messed up
That's your best luck
The kinda sort, run you over in the 4 by 4
And the tag on your toe will read Derelict
Pass the blunt, I take a hit
Pass the drink, I take a sip
Pass the skins, I take a dip
Pass my loot, before I flip
Man, brother, man, brother man!
I thought you knew the pedigree of the B.I.G
Cut emcees like lumberjacks cutting trees
Rip microphones like Freddy rip kids
Like car rigs do bids
My burner's always there
To the back, to the side, to the front
Smoke a blunt, break ya like Ivana broke Trump
You little young chump
Yeah, reach for your gun
Make sure you get done
Be a ghost like Michael Landon
And the rhyme keeps flowing
Like the rabbit with the drum, I keep going and going
And showing MC's how to flow, yo
I smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the yayo
"Be slow bro!
Slow down before you get slowed down, quick!"
Which burner you wanna get hit with, pick!
I'm the wrong nigga to be fucking with
So sit back and admit, Biggie Smalls got that hype shit!

[Chorus]
Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!
Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!
Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!
Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!

[Verse 2]
Lyric enhancement is a must
That's why I bust
Dope raps like a burner bust caps
I'm used to making tracks
That's why my rap sounds like that
I get my props and all my pats on the back
B-I, double G-I-E Smalls
Who the nigga in the place? Watch him fall
Check all the pockets for some loot
Take the girl, knock the boots
If she's cute, I'm the pimp, she's the prostitute
Hey! Sippin' on the heineken
Ain't a rapper finer than
The B.I.G and Fifty Grand
Suckers better try again
Before you get lifted and twisted
You better smoke a spliff, kid I'm gifted
Fill it to the tip, with the dope shit
Nigga, fifty-shot clip to my hip
Skip to my lou, special shout-outs to my crew
Fifty Grand and the OGB flucture through
I'm dynamite, out of sight on the mic
Three and two, Frank got ya sleeping with the night light
So wake up and smell the coffee
You're nothing but a softie
Rappers screaming "Biggie, get off me!"
Don't have me go off, G
Cause I'm just lukewarm
And I'm not the type to toot my own horn
But uh, toot toot!
I take my timbo boots
And just lose it
You fucking piece of bowel movement!
My tec got a long clip
Biggie Smalls got the hype shit!

[Chorus]
Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!
Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!
Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!
Biggie got the hype shit!
He got the hype shit!

[Outro]
Yo, special shout outs to Junior M.A.F.I.A, y'all know what time it is
My man Fifty Grand, and his man
Ayo, my man Big O in the house, you know what I'm sayin'
Recognize the pedi', that OGB in full effect
I'm out
Uh
Yo, chainsaw tight like a wrapped up mic
I'm an ill motherfucker and I only drink snake bite
Get yourself right, lock you in the fucking coffin
Bury you alive and there ain't no way I'm fuckin' stoppin'

You're a sad bitch, but I'm a bad bitch
Got more cheese than your motherfuckin' sandwich
Speak another language, your boy will never understand me
Roll deep, with the guns and their fucking candy

I'm on the Japanese hardcore
Fuck you up quick with a hammer and a hacksaw
Uh, your bitches know I'm so gnarly
Beating up the track like, ow ow Charli

It's a motherfucking murder scene
I'm the serial killer, only 18
Yeah, yeah it's a underage wet dream
Uh, but that bitch so sexy
But that bitch so sexy
But that bitch so sexy
But that bitch so sexy
But that bitch so sexy

Yo, uh, you don't fuck with me
I'll smash you up with a fuckin' chainsaw
Lock you in a dungeon
Suck out your blood through a fuckin' straw
Put it in a cocktail and serve it to your mother
Uh, peace
2016, Edited VersionKanye: OK, dope. You still got the Nashville number?
Taylor: I still have the Nashville area code but I had to change it
Kanye: For all my south side niggas that know me best, I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.
Taylor: I'm, like, this close to overexposure.
Kanye: Oh well this one is, uh — I think this is a really cool thing to have.
Taylor: I know! I mean it's like a compliment kind of.
Kanye: What I give a fuck about is just you as a person, and as a friend.
Taylor: That's sweet.
Kanye: I want things that make you feel good. I don't wanna do rap that makes people feel bad.
Taylor: Um, yea. I mean, go with whatever line you think is better. It's obviously very tongue in cheek either way.
Taylor: And I really appreciate you telling me about it, that's really nice!
Kanye: Yea. I just felt I had a responsibility to you as a friend. I mean, thanks for being so cool about it.
Taylor: Aw, thanks! Yeah I really appreciate it. Like, the heads up is so nice!
Taylor: …things without like even asking or seeing if I'd be OK with it. And I just really appreciate it.
Taylor: I'd never expect you to tell me about a line in your song.
Taylor: And then the flowers that you sent me, I Instagrammed a picture of them and it's the most Instagram likes I've ever gotten.
Kanye: Relationships are more important than punchlines, you know.
Taylor: Yea. I mean, I don't think anybody would listen to that and be like, Oh, that's a real diss. Like, she must be crying about…
Taylor: You gotta tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it. Like you honestly didn't know who I was before that.
Taylor: It doesn't matter if I sold 7 million of that album before you did that, which is what happened. You didn't know who I was before that.
Taylor: … that I can make these things happen and I have the ideas to do it and I create these things and concepts. And, like, I'm always gonna respect you.
Taylor: And I'm really glad you had the respect to call me and tell me that as a friend, about the song. It's just a really cool thing to do, and a really good show of friendship. So thank you.
Kanye: Thank you too.
Taylor: And you know, if people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, Look, he called me and told me about the line before it came out. Like, joke's on you guys, we're fine.
Taylor: You guys wanna call this a feud, you wanna call this throwing shade. But right after the song comes out I'm gonna be on a Grammy red carpet and they're gonna ask me about it and I'm gonna be like, he called me.
Taylor: …awesome that you're so outspoken and it's gonna be like, Yea, she does, it made her famous! It's more provocative to say, Might still have sex.
Taylor: …it's not. It doesn't matter to me. there's not one
that hurts my feelings and one that doesn't.2020 LeakKanye: —old school s—, yeah. I’m doing great. I feel so awesome about the music. The album’s coming out Feb. 11. I’m doing the fashion show Feb. 11 at Madison Square Garden and dropping the album Feb. 12, that morning. It’s like …. yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Aw thank you so, so much. Thank you. It feels like, real. I don’t know, just ‘Ye, Apple, Steve Jobs-type music. Like, so my next single, I wanted you to tweet it … so that’s why I’m calling you. I wanted you to put the song out.

Taylor: What would people … I guess it would just be, people would be like, “Why is this happening?” And I had something to do with it, probably.

Kanye: The reason why it would happen is because it has a very controversial line at the beginning of the song about you.

Taylor: What does it say? 

[nervous laughter]

Kanye: It says, and the song is so, so dope, and I literally sat with my wife, with my whole manager team, with everything, and try to rework this line. I’ve thought about this line for eight months, I’ve had this line and tried to rework it every which way, and the original way that I thought about it is the best way, but it’s the most controversial, so it’s gonna go Eminem a little bit, so can you brace yourself for a second?

Taylor: Yeah…

Kanye: Okay, alright. It says—wait a second, you sound sad.

Taylor: Well, is it gonna be mean?

Kanye: No, I don’t think it’s mean.

Taylor: Okay, then let me hear it.

Kanye: Okay, um … and the funny thing is when I first played it and my wife heard it, she was like “Huh? What? That’s too crazy, blah, blah, blah.” And when Ninja from Die Antwoord heard it, he was like, “Oh God, this is the craziest sh—! This is why I love Kanye,” that kind of thing. It’s like my wife’s favorite f—ing line. I just wanted to give you some premise of that, right?

Taylor: Okay.

Kanye: So it says, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex.” 

[chuckles]
Taylor: 

[chuckles] That’s not mean.

Kanye: Okay. Yeah, well, this is the thing why I’m calling you because you got an army. You own a country of motherfucking two billion people, basically, that if you felt that it’s funny and cool and like hip hop and felt like, you know, just The College Dropout and the artist like, ‘Ye that you love, then I think that people would be like way into it, and that’s why I think it’s super genius to have you be the one that says, ‘Oh, I like this song a lot, like, yeah, whatever. This is cool. Whatever, it’s like, I got like s— on my album where I’m like, “I bet me and Ray J will be friends if we ain’t love the same bitch.”

Taylor: Oh my 

[laughs]. I mean, I need to think about it because you hear something for the first time, you need to think about it because it is absolutely crazy. I’m glad it’s not mean though. It doesn’t feel mean, but like, oh my God, the build-up you gave it. I thought it was gonna be like that stupid dumb bitch, like, but it’s not. Um, so I don’t know. I mean, the launch thing, I think it would be kind of confusing to people, but I definitely like, I definitely think that when I’m asked about, of course I’m gonna be like, “Yeah, I’m his biggest fan. I love that. I think it’s hilarious,” but um, I’ll think about it.

Kanye: Yeah, you don’t have to do—you don’t have to do the launch and retweet. That’s just an extra idea that I had, like, but if you think that that’s cool, then that’s cool. If not, we are launching the shit like on just GOOD Fridays, on Soundcloud, the site, shit like that.

Taylor: You know, the thing about me is like, anything that I do becomes a feminist think-piece, and if I launch it, they’re gonna be like, “Wow,” like this thing—like they’ll just turn it into something that … I think if I launch it, it honestly like, it’ll be less cool ‘cause I think if I launch it, it adds this level of criticism, ‘cause having that many followers and having that many eyeballs on me right now, people are just looking for me to do something dumb or stupid or lame, and it’s like almost … I don't know, like I kind of feel like people would try to make it negative if it came from me. Do you know what I mean?

Kanye: Yeah.

Taylor:  I try to be super self-aware about where I am, and I feel like, I feel like right now I’m like this close to overexposure.

Kanye: Oh, well, this one is uh, I think this is a really cool thing to have.

Taylor: I know, it’s like a compliment, kind of 

[laughs].

Kanye: I had this line where I said—and my wife really didn’t like this one because we tried to make it nicer. So I said, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,” and my wife was really not with that one. She was way more into “She owes you sex,” but then the owe, the owe part was like the feminist group-type s— that I was like, “Ahhh.”

Taylor: That’s the part that I’m kind of—I mean, they’re both really edgy, but that’s the only thing about that line is that it’s like gonna … It's just, the feminists are gonna come out, but I mean, you don’t give a fuck, so…

Kanye: Yeah, basically. Well, what I give a fuck about is just you as a person and as a friend. I want things that make—

Taylor: That’s sweet.
Kanye: —you feel good. I don’t wanna do rap that makes people feel bad, like of course like I’m mad at Nike, so people think like, “Oh, he’s a bully. He ran on stage with Taylor. He’s bullying Nike now, this $50 billion company.”

Taylor: Why are people saying you’re bullying Nike?

Kanye: Because on “Facts” I said like, “Yeezy, Nike out here bad, they can’t give shit away.”

Taylor: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that’s just what you do though.

Kanye: 

[laughs]

Taylor: 

[laughs] I mean, I wouldn’t say that it’s like possible to bully a company like Nike where—I mean, um, yeah, I mean …
Search

Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song? It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009.

[Verse 1]
Stick and stones
I won't hide from you no more
And in time
I find what I've been searching for
Heard your voice
Calling out to me
I'm on my way
To where I can be free

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And if she won't wait for me, do it right, don't look back
Keep my heart on the future
On the soles of my shoes all the places I've been
That I've known since I knew her

[Chorus]
'Cause it's you, don't you know
That you're making me guess
That you're the one for me
That it's you that I guess
That I wanted to know all along
Girl, it's you that I want
That makes me complete
Cause you're the one for me
It's thanks to you that I guess
That I want you to know I belong

[Verse 2]
Every time
I lose my feeling true
I'll still work
To lead me back to you
In my dreams
I'm calling out your name, yeah
You're my beacon
Burning like a flame, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But as I fly on my wings through the night, don't look back
Now I don't wanna lose her
In the sky, all the sounds of the night, now I know
That I couldn't refuse her

[Chorus]
'Cause it's you, don't you know
That you're making me guess
That you're the one for me
That it's you that I guess
That I wanted to know all along
Girl, it's you that I want
That makes me complete
Cause you're the one for me
It's thanks to you that I guess
That I want you to know I belong

[Instrumental Solo]

[Verse 3]
Up above
The universe aglow
And the world
Is turning down below
Through the day and
Through the coldest night
Light my way
Give me strength to burn bright

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Now take me up to the sky, off my mind
Far away from the heavens below me
Make the storm in my soul
Give me strength in my bones
Now you're comin' to save me

[Chorus]
'Cause it's you, don't you know
That you're making me guess
That you're the one for me
That it's you that I guess
That I wanted to know all along
Girl, it's you that I want
That makes me complete
Cause you're the one for me
It's thanks to you that I guess
That I want you to know I belong

[Intro: Tom Misch]
Crazy dream (x8)

[Hook: Tom Misch]
And as I wake up from this crazy dream
I hope that things remain as they seem
Cause as I wake up from this crazy dream
From this dream

[Verse 1: Loyle Carner]
I had a dream about you last night
And we were listening to Pharcyde
Something to something started spinning in the past life
So I kept the singing to the bar side, we were on the last ride
Saying it's the past but the present moving fast I ain't thinking bout the last time
It's fine, but they were saying did you ask my
Brothers if I'm ready for the last line
Never in the way you move with
It's bugging me out
I kept squeak, left feet don't trouble me now
It gets peaked if the D starts loving the sound
But we were running from the beast, start fucking around
Cos if I break the singular jack, cause a little bit of trouble fill a fifth of the yack
It's not that quick to react if I finish the pact we move forward now, I'm bringing it back

[Hook: Tom Misch]
And as I wake up from this crazy dream
I hope that things remain as they seem
Cause as I wake up from this crazy dream
From this dream
Crazy dream (x8)

[Bridge: Loyle Carner]
She was saying
Don't start but we feel it at the same time
Won't part, but repeat it in the same shine
So dark gotta kneel it in the rain, it's fine
Lost part but she's reeling 'n the blame is mine
Is mine, mine, mine

[Hook: Tom Misch]
And as I wake up from this crazy dream
I hope that things remain as they seem
Cause as I wake up from this crazy dream
From this dream
And as I wake up from this crazy dream
I hope that things remain as they seem
Cause as I wake up from this crazy dream
From this dream
Crazy dream (x10)

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth & Post Malone]
This woman next to me is foreign, in her birthday suit
I'm talkin' clothes is missin'
I don't mind it, I'd just like to sit and view it
Let me sit with you and help you catch a vision
Human submarine, I send her lower (Lower)
In the city where they say it slower (Slower)
Diamonds messin' up my neck and shoulders (Shoulders)
Got me arctic, feelin' like a polar (Polar)
Told her trunk do stand up like a tower
For the ones who tipped they final hour
Double cup and sippin' on that Houston power
Yeah, I keep a rocket like my name was Howard
I am not alone, I got the city with me
King off in these streets, no way you can forgive me
I got money comin' faster than the wiki
It'll be that way 'til someone come and get me
Oohhh

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Playtime’s over when the man comes around (Comes around)
Shake that ass and pick them ones off the ground (Off the ground)

Something doesn't feel quite right
My lips are dry, my shoes are too tight

Til I'm home
She's waiting there alone
And it feels like it's the end
When everything falls in again
It's just

Kissing, hugging, making love and
Waking up and getting high
Kissing, hugging, making love and
Waking up and getting - I wanna get
Kissing, hugging, making love and

Passing it back and forth until it's out

Sliding under the covers with our head
In our bed

I've never been alone
Long enough to know
If I ever was a child

I was tied up like a boat
Unbuttoned like a coat
Set free for a while
Well I jumped to jolt my clumsy blood
While my white, green eyes
Cry like a window pane
Can my cold heart change
Even out of spite?

I slump behind my brain
A haunted stain never fades
I hunt for the kind of pain I can take

And I cry like a window pane
Can my cold heart change
Over night?
So I won't ever want to touch
Your heart too much
Or hold you too tight
I slump behind my brain
A haunted stain will never fade
I hunt for the kind of pain I can take

I never was alone
Long enough to know
If I ever was a child

[Intro]
Way, lemon
Way, way, way, way, way
Wop, wop
It's Gucci! Wizop

[Chorus]
Ridin' in the 'Bach with the seat way back
This white on white Maybach, I call it payback
Yeah you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back
I'd rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track
Catch me flushin' down the street with the top way back
I had to give these bad bitches somethin' to wave at
Man y'all know I fuck with Mike Will, we go way back
Now let's bring the trap back nigga, Gucci Mane back nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm the bestest, I'm the freshest ever stepped on the scene
I mean what I say, I say what I mean
Keep a rocket in my pocket like my name was Hakeem
Somebody had the picture, she thought it was a dream
A college chick dream big man on campus
All these folks impersonate me like Elvis
Too much sauce and I'm not selfish
I rule with a iron fist wrapped in Velvet
The seat way back and the top laid back
Her waist real small but that ass real fat
She get turnt up and you can't turn back
She make my dick stand up, I push them legs way back

[Chorus]
Ridin' in the 'Bach with the seat way back
This white on white Maybach, I call it payback
Yeah you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back
I'd rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track
Catch me flushin' down the street with the top way back
I had to give these bad bitches somethin' to wave at
Man y'all know I fuck with Mike Will, we go way back
Now let's bring the trap back nigga, Gucci Mane back nigga

[Verse 2]
I'm the slickest, I'm the richest ever rapped on the track
In the S600 with the seat way back
1017 mob boss, I don't play that
I'll get your whole head knocked off if you say that
I had a long-nosed .38 way way back
I sent a nigga to the pearly gates way-way back
They thought that Gucci Mane was soft now they don't think that
Please get that devilish juice away from me, I don't drink that
My own clothing line Delantic man, yeah I run that
You heard Atlantic dropped Gucci? Why would they do that?
I lost 200k in Vegas, yeah man I blew racks
Man get these broke ass niggas away from me, they ain't worth two stacks
It's Gucci

[Chorus]
Ridin' in the 'Bach with the seat way back
This white on white Maybach, I call it payback
Yeah you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back
I'd rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track
Catch me flushin' down the street with the top way back
I had to give these bad bitches somethin' to wave at
Man y'all know I fuck with Mike Will, we go way back
Now let's bring the trap back nigga, Gucci Mane back nigga

I'm flexing hard on my boost mobile flip phone
I'm flexing hard, trapping in these streets
Whipping on the stove
Know just how it go
I'm flexing hard on my boost mobile flip phone
I'm flexing hard, when I'm on a roll
Girl you should know
Know just how it go

[Verse]
Okay, okay
My neck on ice cold, chill
It's real gold, not stain steel
Your bitch know how it feel
I keep shit for real
I'm balling like a Knick
My dog on fight, I'm Vick
Got guap inside these ricks
I might nut in your bitch
And make you raise that shit
It's Yachty from the 6
Got no love for no bitch
You know I'm with my clique
And free the love
Yaaah

I'm flexing hard on my boost mobile flip phone

[Verse 1]
Give the weekend all the stress it brings
Into that hectic life of yours
And try to see what I can do for you
When you drive into that packed city

So look at your mind
And you'll find a whole new reason to be loving me
It's different now
Cause we've kissed on other lovers
And we know it doesn't matter anymore

[Chorus]
You say you'll come back in two years
I can do that if you want me to
I can live there
With you in your flat

[Verse 1]
I won't go out tonight
I'll hang some pictures up
From when we were outside
And drinking from our cups
Of oranges and liqueur
That made us feel so warm
In our bodies and our all out our mouth

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
The hanging of the frame
An empty space remains
A note to remind us
That summer will decay
Push the glass away
From your mouth tonight
And call me over soon to your house

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Lost in my mind
I was stuck in my mind

When you go, you go, you go
I'm a sunless sky
When you go, you go, you go
I'm a sunless sky
When you go, you go, you go
I'm a sunless sky

[Verse 2]
I miss the way
We laughed that day
When you were mine
When you were mine
Still stuck in my mind

I miss the thrill
Stays with me still
All of the time
All of the time
Still stuck in my mind

[Hook]
When you go, you go, you go
I'm a sunless sky
When you go, you go, you go
I'm a sunless sky
When you go, you go, you go
I'm a sunless sky

[Intro: Big Sean]
Uh, yeah, look

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it' the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying "Hi Britney" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some xxx girls
Pussy get wet as an s-curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
(The number you dialed has been disconnected)
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like, "I got some hoes, hit me back," fuck it

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh I could
Let you down
I don't know why
You keep my mind
Racing again
You kiss my lips
When you trip
I'll take you anywhere
I'll take you

[Post-Chorus: Jeremih]
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kinda world
I'm glad I got my girl
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kinda world
I'm glad I got my girl

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You be the momma, you be the daddy
Baby, we could play house, I'll change your addy
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I don't have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause Simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Yeah, oh I could
Let you down
I don't know why
You keep my mind
Racing again
You kiss my lips
When you trip
I'll take you anywhere
I'll take you

[Post-Chorus: Jeremih & Chance the Rapper]
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kinda world
I'm glad I got my girl
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kinda world
I'm glad I got my girl

[Verse 3: Smino]
Pink caddy, Pepto-Bismobile
Ting named Cali, that ass on sunset hill
A beautiful view, unusual, I'm hooked on the real
And you would be too, I'm pookie bout that coochie, for real
Okay cool, I guess I love the way you
Nourish the soul, you know that ass look like a fuckin' grapefruit
Hitting them push-ups so when I'm up in that what's up, what's up you get whooped up
Arch that thing like where I'm from, been on my brain, miss serotonin
Living la vida with my Lavita, feel like Ceddy
Liberate your limbs eliminate your limits, let me
You feel just like lemonade on ice when I'm all sweaty
She said, "Smino, boy I get it all ready"

[Post-Chorus: Jeremih]
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kind of world
I'm glad I've got my girl
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kind of world
I'm glad I've got my girl
Locator sees me swaying through the catacombs
Locator hears me whispering in my home
Even when the waves are falling
Beat me into diamonds
Even when the wheels are whining
Even when the wheels are whining
Something in the sky can find me
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide

Here below, here below, here below, here below

Oh no, locator it is I

Even when I run I'm crawling
Even through the walls and blinds and
Even when the wheels are whining
Even when the wheels are whining
Something in the sky can find me
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide
Here below, here below, here below, here below

I love locator everywhere I go
I tell locator everything it wants to know

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uhh, I just need a minute to replenish who I am
And who I am is so dependent on exactly where we stand
I stand in any pose, anythin' but tippy-toes
Don't want you to feel smaller, always taller
Now I'm a cheerleader, she a baller
The difference in height isn't aight, I left my ego at the altar
Now every ring's a sting and everythin' I taught ya
Is comin' back around to me, just like revolvers
And every single click is just hammerin' it home
Who knew Russian Roulette involved answerin' the phone?
Until my signal dwindles or my channel is in roam
Or my cellphone dies or it's cancer in my dome
And dear nix the tone, as I pour my fuckin’ pain out
One of your short nodes, might blow my fuckin' brains out
But you ain't even pick up
Talkin' to myself, exactly what you sick of

[Pre-Chorus: Sebastian Lundberg & Lupe Fiasco]
Feeling kinda restless
Did you get my message?
It's swirling around and so (yeah, c'mon!)
No, don't tell me that you care (uh huh)
When I know you're standing there (yeah)
I left the story of my life on your answering machine (what's up? Yeah)

[Chorus: Sebastian Lundberg & Lupe Fiasco]
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, are you there?
Hello, would you pick up the phone?
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, are you there? (yeah, are you there? Are you there? Are you there?)
Hello, would you pick up the fuckin' phone?

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
We were like, if a tree falls in the forest and
No one is around, does it really make a sound?
That's romantic and profound, but now
We're like lumberjacks holdin' the axes that brung it down
So I'm now on your message, talkin' 'bout "Remember?"
Silence in return, that sound like 'Timber!"
There's some that can't see the forest because they're liars
But I can't see the forest 'cause of the fire
And in our prehistorics, the flowers was rootin' for us
Brontosaurus ate the flowers, T-Rex ate the Brontosaurus
And then the T-Rex turned around and ate the florist
That's why I lost my FTD endorsements
But that's really not important
My sadness' a snitch, my melancholy informant
Despair wears a wire, my longin' rappin' a song
My worry is a rat, my lonely tappin' the phone

[Pre-Chorus: Sebastian Lundberg & Lupe Fiasco]
Feeling kinda restless
Did you get my message?
It's swirling around and so (uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)
I wanna give you reasons (yeah)
Tell you what I'm feeling
But none of these lines are secure (nah)
No, don't tell me that you care (uh huh)
When I know you're standing there (yeah)
I left the story of my life on your answering machine (what else? Uh huh)
My tears run off your shoes (yeah)
Like waters from a goose (uh)
You try to wash off all the dirt
But your hands aren't getting clean

[Chorus: Sebastian Lundberg & Lupe Fiasco]
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, are you there?
Hello, would you pick up the phone?
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, are you there? (are you there? Are you there? Are you there?)
Hello, would you pick up the fuckin' phone?

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
The make-believers on receivers as you sit back and observe
As the rubber curly cord just absorbs all my words
Will you collect us then connect us or neglect us on the whole?
Into the wall, then cross the wires on the telephone poles
Then bounces off the towers, then up into the satellites
Then falls down back to Earth to bring a broken heart back to life
Happens all the time, lost an appetite and lack of sleep
If it's dead and flatten line, I'll leave a message at the beep

[Chorus: Sebastian Lundberg & Lupe Fiasco]
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello, are you there? (Hello, are you there? Yeah)
Hello, would you pick up the phone? (Come on)
Hello, can you hear me? (Come on)
Hello, are you there? (Come on)
Hello, would you pick up the phone?
Would you pick up the phone?
Would you pick up the phone?
Hello, would you pick up the fuckin' phone?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm a walking lick, I look like a robber
You niggas ain't mobbin', you know you got a problem
You niggas ain't legit, see Gucci with the shit
You keep on talking slick then I'mma go and get the stick
Gutta as it get, still the talking brick
Used to have them ninety-six impalas sitting on blades chopped
And that was ninety-six, they treat me like a prince
When I was behind the fence you was acting like a bitch
So I might slap you like a pimp, my chef is cooking shrimp
The haters tryna' knock me off my throne but they can't do it it's like the thirtieth attempt
And you look like a wimp, and I don't even associate with niggas
Who associates don't have at least a M

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Have at least a M
I don't even associate with niggas who associates don't have at least a M

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]

I'm from BC, Bouldercrest and I be skrapped up to the T
I used to have them P's, I got em' from AZ
And I used to pay like one for em' sell em' for the three
RIP to E
How you let a nigga in a motherfucking wheelchair beat you to the cheese
You deserve a D
Y'all ain't really flunk but you punks gettin' a lil' money but ain't get money like me
I'm steady pushing three
Or you can call it age, but ain't no need to call me unless you got ninety G's
I'm tryna' make a B
You tryna' make a play but get the fuck up out my face cause nigga you the F.E.D.'s

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Have at least a M
I don't even associate with niggas who associates don't have at least a M

I don't even associate with niggas whose associates don't have at least a M

[Interlude: Gucci Mane, Zaytoven & Mike WiLL Made It]
I mean like, would I need a nigga around me whose associates don't have at least a M
You ain't got to be rich to talk to Gucci, but you gotta' be part of something!
So you mean to tell me your daddy, your momma, your brother, your partner
Ain't nobody getting no money?
So everybody around you broke? (ha ha ha)
Nah! I ain't fucking with that man! (Oh hell no)
Nah for real, I'm with you Gucc'
I thought, you know I thought your uncle or something played for the Hawks
Ain't nobody play no pro ball or nothing? Ain't nobody got nothing?
Oh shit my phone's ringing, this gotta' be some money right here
( Hello! )

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

Any fine bitch with an ass, boy I'm after ya

Pussy nigga got behind the wheel and tried to race with Boat, well that's a cruise for a wreck
Stay with the Tec, gotta check on my neck

Brother locked up for the blow
Fuck you pussies, bitch, I skipped bein' rookie
What you want a cookie 'cause you got connect?
Nigga play hooky when they see it's Boat time
Ice on my wrist got you thinkin' it's cold time
Dunk on that bitch make you lean on your shoulder
Tripled my views now you thinkin' it's over
Skirt-skirt that Rover I spent a whole six up in Dover
Margiela my collar, I look like my father
Why'd u even bother? I'm richer I'm better
26 shit, I dropped it on my sweater
Just cause it's real leather, Versace my feathers
King sized set with the pillows
Dick in her pussy, she call me her hero
Dick in her mouth like a motherfuckin' churro
Knot so fat like a fuckin' burrito
Shout out taketa her pussy much sweeter

Then kick it right on to my brother

Bitch I'm so fly I can float on a cover
Now I see why you mad, cause I made it over night

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Bitch it's G Herbo, swervin' so much
Watch them start callin' me Swervo
In the M6 two door drop with the turbo
Engine from Russia, my Balmains for Bergdorf
My lil' ho from Merlow
Killas like Marlo
Come to your block, shoot it up with no sorrows
Still ride with Glocks and them chops over lanos
Let off them shells have you duckin' your taco and come back tomorrow
Maison Like Capo, Rollie a Bimmer, my bracelet a Tahoe
Riding an i8s in a race through Chicago
Remember I used to rock Echo and Pac on that Balmain where I go
Blunts full of posto
Remember I used to get free bands like Rocko
Got a white bitch snortin' lines, they El Chapo
Loadin' up .30's and countin' up guapo get top in my auto
Oops, I mean mobile, on the way home to my house in Herbo Hills
Remember them nights I was servin' with no deals
Lil' bro on Ess, know he lurkin', he gon' kill, rollin' off four pills
My life is so trill, I made a name off my block like I'm O'Neal
Get face to face with them cops and I don't squeal
Snitch did a bid but he would've did more years
Niggas a ho still
Wake up, get more bills
Rich with my squad in Chiraq like I'm Bo Deal
While in Miami we ridin' on four wheels
Block 100 deep, got the opps hidin' for years
Pop out, go trill
Glock color oatmeal
Know what I mean, bitch it's brown, it ain't no steel
Ridin', we lurkin', you better keep your steel
You gotta be ready to use it in broad day
You know little bro will

[Outro: G Herbo]
Ayy, G Herbo 150 dream team, bitch, shout out Coach

[Intro]
(Hey D33J)
Lil Boat!

[Verse 1]
Baby girl this ain't a dream
I keep like 6 in my jeans
Everything ain't what it seems
But I'm really rich, what you mean?
Oh baby come blow a young fellow like cello
I wanna stuff you then lick you and stick you
Just like a lil rello
I'm too complex, shoulda, called me Marc Ecko
Hunnits all over the floor like rose petals
Chains on my neck like I won a gold medal
I'll pop her shit just like kettle
Fuckin' with me, you'll get lost in the sauce like... oh oh
I got 22 diamonds, they're brighter
I stay with my shooter and he'll put that heat to your head like hairdryer
Nigga never been a liar
No, no
Free all my real niggas locked up
Bitches come 'round when the stock's up
I give a fuck if you're not us
I give a fuck if you're not us
I thought you knew I ain't give a fuck
Ice on my neck cost a Tonka truck
Please do not call up my phone if it's not 'bout bucks
I ain't ever been a runner up no
Cry me a river, bitch get out
Nut on her face, that's my kids' house
I'm from the South like a slave's house
We just count money and fuck on these hoes
We just count money and fuck on these hoes
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
If you ain't gettin' money, you broke, bitch
I ain't never fuck with no broke bitch
Fangs on my teeth like a fork, pitch
I mean pitchfork, damn
I'm gettin' brain like a dork
Young nigga hopped off the porch
My bitch do white like Scott Storch
Ain't no nigga gonna extort me
Beam at his head like Hindu
Beat up that pussy like Ryu
Pussy so bald just like Caillou
He'll pay a band to get by you
Young nigga, I do not tie shoes
I really don't give a fuck
I'll drop that nut on her butt
Young nigga nasty as fuck
Chrome to his head like Daft Punk
Don't make me open my trunk
Bro got the gas like a skunk
He been servin' from the jump, oh

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do, it do
Life goes on

[Verse 1: Cook Laflare]
I had a hard, hard life, ayy
It's been that way all my life, ayy
I had to earn my stripes, ayy
Had to pay my part, ayy
I know what you're goin' through, ayy
You just want someone to love you, ayy
Feel like there's no one on your team
Had to hit the block when I was 14, ayy
Ayy, since I was a young nigga, I knew what I wanted to be
Like Martin I had a dream, like Martin I had a dream
Watch out for 12, might have to move the trap, heard it's a sting
How could I fold? It's nothin' but solid niggas on my team
Had to weed out the rats, so I can roll up a bag
These broke niggas leeches, just wanna run up a tab
But so long, I'm so gone
Life goes on, life goes on

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it

Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do, it do
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I remember bein' broke
Couple dollars in my pocket, I could barely cop a soda
I didn't know what to do
A college kid lost just like everybody else
Up late tryna figure out myself
Mama had no job so I got a 9 to 5
Just when I thought we lost it all
She said, "Boy be strong, God gon' keep us in our home"
Blessings come true, I swear they do
You might be down at the moment
But stay there and you'll be up soon
I know you're tired of the bus
Stack up and pull off like vroom
Stay consistent and watch how your money moves
And watch how your old friends hate on you
But fuck 'em because

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on

[Hook 1]
I know you know I know I need you here
That's probably why you're never ever here
You left my heart froze like cold turkey
All my diamonds cold like cold soda
Uh, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You'll probably never know the real story
You said your homeboy raps, can he afford me?
Cause I'm not doin' favors no more
You left my heart on the floor
Bitch, you cannot play me, I'm a lord
Trap 6, pop your spinal cords, woah
I broke your best friend's headboard
Dick so good, turn that hoe to George
That means she get curious
Hoe from 619, she mysterious
Pussy tsunami gang got me delirious
Oh, oh, but I don't need her
If she go hungry, I'm the first person to feed her
Yeah, yeah, shit is gettin' too real
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Hook 2]
Woah, I know you know I need you here
That's probably why you're never here
Oh, that's probably why you're never here

[Bridge]
I dropped the ball, yeah I fumbled
I dropped the ball, yeah I fumbled
I dropped the ball, yeah I fumbled
I dropped the ball, yeah I fumbled
I'm mature enough to say it
I'm mature enough to own up to it
I'm mature enough to say it
I'm mature enough to own up to it

[Hook 2]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, that's probably why you're never here

[Verse 2]
Damn, I know I messed up our love
But trust me, baby girl, I'm worth it
I'm just hopin' that you heard this
I'm just hopin' that you serve this
She said just give me room, room, room
All she want is room, room, room
Fine
But you'll be runnin' through my mind
I think about you all the time
Damn

[Interlude]
Baby, why you doin' me like this?
Why the fuck you not answerin' your phone?
What's up? What's really good?
Like, for real, are you fuckin' them hoes again?
Is that what's really goin' on after all we've... we've had?
Are you fucking serious, Miles?
Oh my God, like, let me find out
Let me find out that you an ain't-shit-ass nigga
Let me find that out though
You know what, it's cool, it's all good
Nigga call me back

Banana clip for Orangutan
Monkey ass nigga tried to take my figures

[Verse 2: Offset]
The bitch got good brain, she got a doctorate
Lookin' down, my diamonds hangin' on me like an ornament
Remember when niggas they left me behind like an orphanage
They didn't want to open doors so we had to kick it in
Ridin' round in a coupe with no ceilin' in
Got your bitch and she suckin' on my dick again
Bakin' soda with the coca, we gon' mix it in
These fuck nigga really sweet like some cinnamon
Had a mili, lost a mili, got it back
Your bitch ran off, where she goin'? Where she at?
A cappella freedom, oh the fans singin' that
I am not the same
Drop the top, on no lamborghini brain
Fuckin' these bitches, I'm fuckin' up these bitches' brain
Diamonds hittin' like Jackie Chain
Yeah, I'm a rock star, I don't care and I pop my shit like Ric Flair
Long money I got stocks and shares
I'm fuckin' with the pretty women
Ridin' round with a life sentence
Same chopper but we got two different clippings
Young nigga, we gon' take it to the 9th innin'
After we done we gon' go and put a knife in it

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Yeah, you
Dipset (skrrt), young nigga Dipset (young nigga Dipset)

Young nigga never been fronted on (never been fronted on)

Bet that lil bitch sing us every song (she gon' sing every song)
Bet that lil bitch come right out her thong (oh-oh-oh)

Bet that lil bitch sing us every song (every song)
Bet that lil bitch come right out her thong-ong-ong (gang)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I stroll through cities, gang they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
Every dream I seem to have is always 'bout you
Oh...

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Beautiful soul with good energy, I kept it real with you
Never pretended to be anything that I was not
I just want you at my spot, I just want you with me now
Where are you now? Tell me what town
Fly you up out of your city, just so that I can look at you
And tell you you pretty, you know
So many thoughts that I have
Just wanna take you and show yo ass off to my city
You lookin' so pretty, you act so sadity
I love when you with me, you shittin' on bitches
Oh, you shittin' on bitches, and when we together
We shittin' on every Mr. and Mrs
Ain't no bitch nowhere that could replace your kisses
You put Lil Boat in his zone, I'll never leave you alone
Pack up your bags and come to my city
I'll move you right into my home
And I fuck with you cause baby girl
You is never running through my phone

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I stroll through cities, gang they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you (like you)
Every dream I seem to have is always 'bout you
Oh...

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I know you done been through a lot
But trust me when I say that I’m there for you
I know you done been through the pain and the struggle
So baby just let me take care of you
We can go fly off to Paris
We could double date with Perry
We can make love on a ferry
Buy you the shoes where the heels red like cherries
And when you havin a bad day
I hold you tight, straight through the night
Cheer you up when you be down, we can go run up the town
I work so hard, just so that we can flex on 'em
Like look at me now
Tried to shit on me back then
That was back then, I remember when
Fuck 'em we ball it's just me and you
Never need nobody, pull off in big body
Queen of my life girl I see you, girl I promise that I need you

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I stroll through cities, gang they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
Every dream I seem to have is always 'bout you
Oh...

[Verse 3: Burberry Perry]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Let me take care of you
We should make, one and one equal two
Woah woah woah, never been a fan of goodbye
Rather put two and two together like x and y
Want you there every morning to tie my ties
'Cause being with you is like being on a wild roller coaster ride
How many nights can I go without seeing your pretty face
We could do it anywhere, you pick the time and the place
You’re my little freak, I always want you in my space
Every moment I spend with you, there's nothing I'd erase

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I stroll through cities, gang they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
Every dream I seem to have is always 'bout you
Ohh

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Don't you fall on me, baby girl
Stand tall for me, baby girl
Don't you evolve on me, baby girl
Oh, oh
Please don't you fall on me, baby girl
Please stand tall for me, baby girl
Don't you evolve on me, baby girl
Oh, oh, oh

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Yeah, I see everything that happens
You know what I’m sayin'?

Niggas ain’t me, bruh, niggas can’t be me
Nigga won't be, you feel me?
I know you niggas wanna be part of the game, but you niggas can’t be me

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Nigga you ain't Uzi, you ain't Carti, damn sure not me
Never on the scene, what you mean? Nigga, yadda mean
Ballin' like Yao Ming, paint her face, nigga, just like Sting
Came up poppin' beans, then I dropped it 'cause I'm not a fiend
All you niggas wanna be me, rub the pussy for a genie
Your bank account lookin' teeny, Tina Turner, big burner
Young nigga too rich for a fight, new crib on a kite
Penthouse, living large, youse a broke boy rapping 'bout a dream
You ain't never shot the steam, stop lyin' to the teens
Big Benz, too clean, three thousand dollar jeans
Three times three, nine in the jeans, spent that on my sister
Ghost ride the old Fisker, ball hard like Derek Fisher
Ridin' 'round with my niggas, ridin' 'round with my niggas
All my niggas do is

[Chorus: Sailing Team]
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Niggas sneaky like mice
Just got a new bitch, white with a little black like dice
Niggas think I'm too nice, I'll still slap a nigga next year
Wait 'til I switch the gear, nigga never checked the rear
Nah, cause I'm only going one way, one way, bitch, on the runway
Six bitches want me, nigga, thats a fun day
All my niggas with me they keep gunplay, gunplay
Lil Boat

[Chorus: Sailing Team]
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof
Shoot out the roof, shoot out the roof

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
We no longer live the same life no more
I remember nights we slept on the floor
Now we can buy 'bout anything when we please
We survived through the breeze with such ease
We no longer live the same life no more
I remember nights we slept on the floor
Now we can buy 'bout anything when we please
We survived through the breeze with such ease
Such ease
We survived through the breeze
Such ease
We survived through the breeze

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
That's my brother, could've been my own mother's son
Told my brother just keep working, we gon' leave 'em all stunned
Look at us now
Lil Boat, Lil Perry are on the prowl
Got the crowd goin' wild
Niggas been stealin' our style, I'll take it as compliments
Lil Boat the king of the teens, I need me a monument
Our niggas been puttin' in work, I know you see evidence
All of my bitches be heaven sent, all of my bitches be oh
I know we make it look easy
I know we make it look cool
But niggas can't do what we do
But niggas can't do what we do

[Hook: Lil Yachty & Tyler Royale]
We no longer live the same life no more

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Brrr
Hey, RD bruh, it's Boat, yeah
Hey man you know that nigga Yachty that went on the God damn mornin' show
Niggas try to freestyle
Niggas tryna act like a nigga ain't got it
Like a nigga ain't still got it
Like a nigga ain't really countin' up hundred dollar bills every motherfuckin' day
Like I ain't bossed up bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Stop all that flexin'
Woke up all my niggas, like stop all that restin'
Might have my OG comin' do a little pressing
You niggas is pussy
I see it, I feel it, I know it, I smell it, it's clear
Fuck I look like sippin' beer?
I got 32 bitches back home waitin' on me
Give 32 fucks to a nigga hatin' on me
Got so much ice you'd think my jeweler flaked on me, God damn
Hold on, money so old, check his colon
Knot so fat Ben Franklin like who is you foldin'
Whips so new got these coppers thinkin' it's stolen
So they pull me over and see my teeth golden
It's over, bro keep the chopper on his shoulder
Just paid cash for a Benz, and Moms, a new Rover
Still the youngest nigga sober
Still the richest nigga over on my side of town
I'm still the king with the crown
King of the teens
Show some respect and bow down
Nigga talkin' crazy, he get shot down
Ay, ooh, yeah, ay, ah
How many times I'ma tell ya?
Young nigga I told ya, I told ya, I told ya
I told ya that RD up next
I told you that Boat keep a check
That Yachty could flex, lil bitch
Watch how I flip it
These niggas get mad cause that weight, I just skipped it
Overnight shawty, that pussy, I dipped it
I had to slow it down cause niggas don't get it
Watch how I do it and watch how I did it
Just copped a new watch and, oh boy, have I shitted
Richer than ever
More wise and more clever
Ball so hard I need a letter, put that on my sweater
Lil bitch, lil bitch
Lil nigga, you hate how I switched
26 shit, I dropped that on my wrist
I'm the richest out the group, just like Kris Jenner
All of these niggas beginners
Fuck on that bitch then I skrrt off with spinners in spinners
All of my whips got spinners
Lil Boat, Lil Boat

[Verse 2: JBan$2Turnt]
JBan$, JBan$
Bitch, stop all that flexin'
Spent 10 on my necklace
Name droppin', we pressure
Bitch don't want no pressure
Eat pussy for breakfast
That bitch actin' reckless, drop her off in Texas
My plug, he like Messi
Got bricks out like sushi, nigga you a rookie
Empire, no Cookie
Saw his chain and I took it
Catch you off in traffic, bitch don't want no static
Then don't play like Magic lil bitch
I ball like I'm Kobe but it's 20, Ginobili
My niggas not foldin', talk down, cut you open
My neck is on frozen, Olaf
He put diamonds forever
We shinin', JBan$, he might blind ya, bitch
Talk down and we find ya, bitch
JBan$ keep that iron, bitch
October 30th like Mike Myers, bitch
G-wagon sit on the big tires, bitch
Bitch, bitch, JBan$

[Verse 3: Byou]
Never, never, never, never
Never ate the box like RD and Jimmy
I shoot with the semi, one eye like I’m Fetty
I look out the scope, just give me the scoop
Whenever you ready, his chest like spaghetti
That nigga gon' fold just like a futon
Would tell her jump on my dick but it's too long
I just bought a bunch of groupies with Groupon
Tell me what you want?
Told 'em, told 'em, I told 'em, I told 'em, I told 'em, I told 'em
Hey, hey, I told 'em, I told 'em
Hey, I keep the chrome in my jeans
Hey, just like a chromosome
Hey, popped it with calicorn
Hey, when I get on, I'ma fuck me a Capricorn
Hey, yuh, yuh, ah, ah
Chubba!

[Verse 4: BigBruthaChubba]
All of my whips got spinners
Chop the brick in half like it's the winter, December
Put ah nigga in a blender
All these niggas be pretenders
Pretendin', pretendin'
These niggas ain't winnin'
We still on that mission to get all the blue cheese
We got them clips just like a movie
She suck me up just like a smoothie

[Verse 5: Lil Yachty]
Pussy so gooey, she lick me up after she do me
It's Boat from the Sixer, I'm cut like some scissors
I'm gone off the sizzurp, I hit her from the back
Then hit on that back like she bizzurp
Eat on that pussy like it was some dessert
Minister, sailing team, take him to chizzurch
I don't fuck with these niggas, these niggas be snitches
They just want my riches, they just wanna fuck on my bitches
These niggas, they can't

Pull up with a sword like 21
Hit the strip club and throw bands just for fun

All in, yeah I'm all in, I'm all in

Why do they hate on me?

You should want me to be great, homie

Why do they hate on me?

Why you givin' that hatred?
Stop all the hatred

Woah, woah

[Intro: Big Sean & DJ Khaled]
(This is, this is...)
Doing what I gotta do, aaaa
What up though?
We the best music...
I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'ma go, aaaa
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man
Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'ma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple
They can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre
Except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement
With you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key

[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix

[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
Oh yeah, mhm yeah
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key

[Outro: Betty Wright]
Holy, Holy key, holy

[Intro: Post Malone]
(Oh)
(Ooh)
'Cause I can't take it no more
No, you ain't like them bitches, tell them hoes, "Adios"
And you can drop your panties, leave them shits at the door
Dior falls on the floor, I swear we been here before

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I'm tryna see you from my own perspective
You all in my section, tryna come to my session
We rollin' up pressure, you know that we flexin'
We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl, this a confession, I'm not like your exes
I came up from Texas and now that we textin'
You can fly in whenever, now you undressin'
Panties on the dresser, your hair gettin' messed up
The feelin' we catchin', my love is a blessin'
Made love in a Lexus, made love in a Lexus
I know you remember (I know you remember)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Tell me, is that déjà vu? (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause you want me and I want you (Ooh-ooh)
Tell me, is that déjà vu? (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause, baby, it ain't nothin' new, nah
Tell me, is that déjà vu? (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause you want me and I want you (Ooh-ooh)
Tell me, is that déjà vu? (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause, baby, this ain't nothin' new, oh

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Oh, you actin' reckless (Actin' reckless)
I told you that I need affection (Need affection)
So let me point you in the right direction (Right direction)
It's so important that you get the message (Oh), yeah
Yeah, I gotta say, gotta say somethin' to you-you-you
I'm gonna roll, I'm gonna roll out in that new-new-new
If you wanna do what I wanna do, well, mm-mm-mm
But I guess that it's just déjà vu

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Tell me, is that déjà vu? (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause you want me and I want you (Ooh-ooh)
Tell me, is that déjà vu? (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause, baby, it ain't nothin' new, nah

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Tell me if you want it, baby
'Cause I know I could drive you crazy

Oh-ah, oh-ah

You already know I'm faded
Girl, I been thinkin' 'bout you lately
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Tell me, is that déjà vu? (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause you want me and I want you (Ooh-ooh)

No, you ain't like them bitches, tell them hoes, "Adios"
And you can drop your panties, leave them shits at the door

[Verse]
All I want is head game
30 thousand dollars worth of diamonds like a gumball
Playin' with my money, that's gon' turn a nigga AWOL
Ay, ay, oh, ay
All my dogs biting like a motherfuckin' pit though
Fight 'em like I'm Vick though
Winter time, fur coat
My bitches rock butt flaps
Whip so damn stupid could've parked in handicap
Ay, ay, ay
Chop gon' kick like a bitch that need to kick back
Ay, ay
Niggas want the fame but all these niggas do is kick back
Just met a groovy white bitch at the Shake Shack
Dunkin' in that pussy just like Shaq attack
Ay, hol on, ay, ay
Huh, ay, huh, ay, huh

[Verse 1]
If I ain't a millionaire then my lil boy can grow a pussy
If Guwop ain't bout his business then Popeye must be a sissy
And if you ain't getting money I don't wanna talk to ya
Cause how you let a nigga in the feds out do you
I'm not politically correct cause bitch I ain't no politician
I can't hang round none of you niggas cause you niggas might be snitchin'
But I ain't gotta deal with you, nigga I don't eat with you
But how you bitches let these bogus ass niggas sleep with you?
I can't live with you, lay with you, take that pussy with you
I can't put up with you, play with you, ain't got free dick to give you
They tried to be cool with ya, chill with ya, take no pictures
What the fuck I look like standing by you police ass niggas?

[Hook]
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
Your pockets in the red and I don't wanna talk to you
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?

[Verse 2]
I'm laughing to myself cause these rappers so broke
They sold no dope they don’t want no smoke
How they let a nigga in the feds out do em
I ain't got no rap, I let my chopper talk to em
A nigga need me, I don't need no nigga
I'm the shooter and the boss, I don't need no killer
The money that he make don't make me richer
I'm the slickest nigga walkin' I don't need no feature
Sittin on the hood of my brand new Bentley
Old neighborhood with some brand new jewelry
Big diamond rings like a old school preacher
Bitch let a nigga out the feds come beat ya

[Hook]
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
How you let a nigga in the feds?
(Damn)
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?
Your pockets in the red and I don't wanna talk to you
How you let a nigga in the feds out do you?

[Hook: Drake]
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

[Verse 1: Drake]
To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try to say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those the strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga, what am I about?
You gon’ really feel it now
I’m out here…

[Hook: Drake]

[Verse 2: Drake]
All you boys doing fake "Controlla"'s wanna be me a little
All your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave you the whole money play and y'all still broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, Now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here
I’m not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…

[Hook: Drake]
Looking for revenge

There's whiskey inside my veins
I'm feeling heavy and I can't explain
How I feel for you
You got me dizzy and feeling blue

Let's go walking in the city tonight
You'll wear that dress that makes you look so nice
Like my fancy shoes?
I wore them just for you

Tell me why all the good ones go
Well I don't know
But I want it to somehow change
I'll be a better man if you just stay

But I'm a prisoner inside these walls
My bed is colder and I'm feeling small
If you're not sleeping with me
Then I'll get no sleep at all

Tell me why all the good ones go
Well I don't know
But I want it to somehow change
I'll be a better man if you just stay

[Lyrics from Snippet]

'Cause I want it
Every time I see you
Right now, Santa Clause
Comin' down the chimney
Can you come down?
Santa Clause coming down
Eating yo cookies tonight

[Chorus]
I'm hearing rumors that my label 'bout to drop Gucci
In my convertible 'Rari, they call me Drop Gucci
Rappers having conventions on how to stop Gucci
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
My choppers sing all my hooks and I call it rock music

[Verse 1]
The studio in the house, so we making house music
Come ride with me through the six and see how the South do it
Cause I got old 'anna, but I'm on old Candler
But I'm so East Atlanta, still got all my old hammers
Take my .44 handle, shot through the door panel
Fuck all that rap beef, let's have a gun battle

[Chorus]
I'm hearing rumors that my label 'bout to drop Gucci
In my convertible 'Rari, they call me Drop Gucci
Rappers having conventions on how to stop Gucci
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
My choppers sing all my hooks and I call it rock music

[Verse 2]
I think it's funny how y'all think cause y'all don't really know
These niggas acting like they ballin' but they really broke
The trap God, I make it rain and I make it snow
I use my money as a blanket, it was bitter cold
In Buckhead in a drop head, pulled me over Lenox Road
Versace slippers with the matching sunglasses and robe
I bulletproofed the sprinter cause I got a hundred foes
I spent a million, so how the fuck am I not gonna get parole?
I feel like Lester Coke
Cause I don't touch the dope
You feel like Lester man
You took the oath and told the folks (snitches)
Don't think that I don't know they wish I was on death row
But imagine how these crackers feel that I moved next door

[Chorus]
I'm hearing rumors that my label 'bout to drop Gucci
In my convertible 'Rari, they call me Drop Gucci
Rappers having conventions on how to stop Gucci
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
My choppers sing all my hooks and I call it rock music

Real talk when that light turn green (Let go)
Give me what I asked for, I got a passport
Mr. International, I hit the airport
If you knew the kind of work that I transport
That Rihanna do me dirt to the crash course
I like the cleanest, greenest, leanest
Serena, Venus, Flo a Genius, smokin' Phoenix
You never seen this
I have her dream this that 200 on the dash, got me feenin'

Grab the stripes, then the 500 bye bye

Shot it to the first nigga sold me a deuce
Yeah the first nigga sold me a deuce

[Hook]

2002 I was wild as hell
Trapper and a rapper I'mma sign myself
A lotta people didn’t believe time would tell
Had this dark skin girl she was fine as hell
22 years old 90 days in jail
The only thing I'm tryna do is buy a red Chevelle
This money on my head cause I robbed a well
Burned all my bridges time to sink or swim
You's a man or a mouse hammer head or brim
Bitch I'm a hard head cause I'm hard to kill
They say Gucci Mane's a cutthroat, he probably is
He'll rob, steal and kill and he probably will
They say Gucci Mane's a jackboy, he probably is
He'll rob steal and kill and he gone off them pills
Gucci

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
He was talking that on stream
He was talking that online
You can say whatever you want
But you ain't talking that right now
Maybe you can tell yourself exactly how to take this game back
Save you from these combos, maybe help you out these frame traps
Moment 37 you to heaven with the Quickness
1-800-EX-TATSU call me if you whiff it
V-in-trigger, stands for Valle, now let's get to business
Evolution we just brought you up in here to witness

It's about to go crazy turn the lights off
Done killing him and I'll come and be fighting y'all

Bitches talking bout my house, I think they tryna climb the fence
They say that when my dick come out that it's a big event
Pool in my backyard, do you like to swim?

Waist deep up shit creek

What you kill what you eat
What you sow what you reap
What you learn what you teach
What you see you repeat
W-I-Z-O-P, Wizop
Hmm, start over
(Zaytoven)

[Verse 1]
I'm the T-R-A-P-G-O-D
In the A with an FNH on me
Know the feds want to build another case on me
Eight hunnid got a nigga whole safe on me
And I'm marching with the bands, FAMU on me
It's a battle of the bands in the VIP
And she say she go to Clark but she dance at Tease
I dare anybody here to put their hands on me
Put the stick up, kids want to kidnap me
Got a SIG on me, are you kidding me?
A little freak lied and tried to put a kid on me
And my own homeboys called the pigs on me
But my faith got stronger and my money grew longer
Sold all my artists now, Gucci Mane a fucking loner
I'm a part-time​ rapper, I'm a full time owner
Breaking rules and bending corners, crack your head with a Corona
Wop!

[Hook]
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces
When it all falls apart, we pick up the pieces
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces
Just hit the streets, hit my jeweler and picked up the pieces
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces
Break a brick down then pick up the pieces
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces
When it all falls apart, we pick up the pieces

[Verse 2]
I got a FNH on side of me
Case my enemies feel they want to ride on me
'Bout to throw up in this club, all this Ace inside of me
Bad bitch in front of me, these weak hoes can't front on me
Ugly hoes can't sell pussy, rich niggas can't fuck for free
Barely standing in VIP, we run off in luxury
Throwing money ain't nothing to me
I'm just giving these broke hoes something to see
2Pac, yeah, "All Eyez On Me," 2 Chainz, yeah, "Feds Watching" me
2 Live Crew, Gucci two times, hit one too many bitch and I might be
Haters talking don't worry me, all they do is encourage me
I'm a worldwide executive, neighborhood celebrity
And ain't nothing in this world gon' stop me from getting currency
These bad bitches cherish me, lil' niggas look up to me
Put my AP and my Rollie on when they bury me
Scared of me, you better be, tell me who ain't heard of me
I just offed another hundred piece, bought a watch for eighty G

[Hook]
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces
When it all falls apart, we pick up the pieces
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces
Just hit the streets, hit my jeweler and picked up the pieces
Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces

Pick up the pieces, pick up the pieces
When it all falls apart, we pick up the pieces

I still think about the day that I was robbed
Young and invincible, I thought that I was hard
But ain't no games getting played in Mountain Park (nope)
That shit get ugly down there like Bubba Sparxxx
They'll take the food off your plate and you'll starve
In East Atlanta even robbers getting robbed
Them niggas hungry and they need a meal card
They make a kingpin get a real job
I done robbed niggas, I done got robbed
I done sold soft, and I done sold hard
I done got away, and I done got caught
So if I'm crazy, then it ain't my fault

They ridin' 'round looking for people to rob
Rob!

[Verse 2]
I remember when I hit my first lick (first lick)
Door came off with the first kick (first kick)
I had a chick named Angel so thick
She watched me come up from a crumb to a brick
I know that karma is a bitch, real shit (huh)
But I don't rob one nigga, I rob cliques
The niggas I came up with got no sense (no sense)
Break in your house, ask them they don't know shit (no)
They snatch you up and make you call your folks
And tell them go and get all your dough
Don't bring em to em, then your throat slit
Man I ain't playin' no games, my four slick

[Hook]
I reminisce about the day I got robbed (got robbed)
Ain't ashamed to say I got robbed (got robbed)
It's a beautiful day, someone gon' get robbed (got robbed)
They ridin' 'round looking for people to rob (got robbed)
I reminisce about the day I got robbed (got robbed)
Ain't ashamed to say I got robbed (got robbed)
It's a beautiful day, someone gon' get robbed (got robbed)
They ridin' 'round looking for people to rob
Rob!

No way to tell us no, no fear
They try to reach us but they don't know
What you fighting for? What side you on?
Ah if I had my way I'd motivate some peace and change
If I had my way we'd all spread love, there'd be no hate
Now scream it out one time
I don't want to fear one time
Yeah, yeah
They fuckin' with the kid, kid
Ain't tryna let us live, yeah
Break the mold to keep your mind clear

The truth, they don't want us to see it

[Interlude]
America has accomplished so much in these last few years. Whether it's been rebuilding our economy or serving the calls of freedom in the world. What we've been able to achieve has been done with your help, with us working together as a nation united

[Verse 2]
Fuck up out of here
Happiness comes from all this
Most of us ain't gotta care
They'll never understand us
Anybody got a problem, say something
Anytime you got a problem, face 'em
Their parents want to know what is going on here

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah
They fuckin' with the kid, kid
Ain't tryna let us live, live
The real, they don't want us to be it
Yeah, yeah
They fuckin' with the kid, kid
Ain't tryna let us live, live
The truth, they don't want us to see it

[Bridge: Ninja]
B-B-Baby girl, you been there for me
Through thick and thin with cool energy
You cared for me, yeah, defended me
Helped me defeat my e-e-enemies
Life is weird, it keeps testing me
No other girl in the world impressing me
Like you do, you voodoo fresh to me
You just wanna be different, get the best of me
Everything's meant to be, you were sent to me
You and me got wild destiny
You're like a little angel won't ever pressure me
E-e-everything you do's so zef to me

'Cause everyday I feel blessed to be
The one chillin' with you right next to me

Egg beater shawty make the crack rock cook it
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Egg beater shawty make the crack rock cookies

[Verse 1]
Shows ever slow up, trap always bunking
Stupid guap stupid dope, fat, always cooking
Folks in our business the feds keep lookin'
Linebacker goons hit hoes like Keith Brooking
Don’t call my phone pussy nigga that shit took
I’m a crook, I can get ya knocked off for a rock
I put pills on the block, got them deals on the blocks
In the kitchen over egg beater standing over pots
When I drop it one time, Man I call that shit the drop
63 grams dawg come and get it while its hot
60 hours later and a nigga still cooking
Couple million dollars later and a nigga still crooked

[Hook]
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'

Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'
Egg beater shawty make the crack rock cookies

[Verse 2]
Another club gone another eighteen bands
The trap house so hot need eighteen fans
Push so much dope I need eighteen hands
18 years old working 18 pans, 18 grand, times one times ten
Got 18 blocks then I got my ass in
If they put me in the pen then I’mma try to jump the fence
Cooking dope like a fool got some off white tan
And some bricked up white and some straight drop glass
Give a stretch to a blast it’ll put you on your ass
Give a brick for the cash charge you seventeen bands

[Hook]
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cookin'

Egg beater shawty make the crack rock cookies

[Verse 3]
I feel like I live club trapping got me iced up
Digi scales right up, Jacob watch bright up
Old clique right up, club owners invite us
Gucci king midas, call me your highness
Cooking up a nine up, Gucci Mane love to re up
Early morning d up, whipping up a three some
Gucci stepped it up dog, but its still powder
Cooked up crack got the money and the power

[Hook]
Whatcha feel like man I feel like cooking

[Refrain: EARTHGANG]
Can't call it, can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, uh, can't call it
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, yeah, I can't call it

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)

[Verse: J. Cole]
Tables do turn and labels do burn
The second they ask you to sell your soul
Don't you do it, don't you fold, say "Fuck that shit" and be bold
Cause all them stories you told on records worth more than gold
And if you never go gold again, at least you would know
The end of your road was chose, by you and not companies
Who control our remote control, and hide the truth on my no
But don't mind me, I'm just high again
Smokin' weed to get by again
No, actually I'm lyin' 'cause smokin' ain't got me smilin'
And rhyming like I rhyme way back when I would play the violin
Thought that shit wasn't cool
Momma sorry, I just stopped tryin' it
Paid for your house in hopes, there'd be no more reason for cryin'
That shows you how stupid I am 'cause niggas is out here dying
From police that flash the siren and pull up and just start firin'
Niggas murkin' each other in murky water, I try and swim
How the fuck do I look when I brag to you 'bout some diamond?
Said all that I could say, now I play with thoughts of retirement

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)

Can't call it, can't call it

Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, uh, can't call it
Yeah, can't call it, I can't call it
I never came from deep pockets
Why can't I make a deposit?
Can't call it, yeah, I can't call it

D-D-DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Uh
Pat them down count the money, let 'em see the work, yeah
That's the definition of a major key alert
Another nigga gotta die, won't be the first, nah
Won't be the last, all we see is cash, yeah
Your real story don't match what you rappin' 'bout (liar)
So keep the movies in, stop actin' out
And I ain't talking 'bout no watch or no cars neither
Everything will get copped at Allah's leisure
Was a crack monster, I had the hard fever
Switch from the bald head to the dark Caesar
Used to be the capsules, now they love the plastics
I ain't tryna get caught up in this thug-rap shit (never)
Rather be bumper to bumper in drug traffic
Cash on deck whenever the plug ask kid
You don't sweat the small things, they become drastic
Next thing is cremation or a casket
Fuck fallin' back, I need all of that
I need my name in the cocaine almanac, Jada
Real dope boy put me in the hall of smack
Went to job interviews, they ain't call us back (hahaha)
Either way I ain't never evil
Why do you think the streets love me? I ain't never leave 'em (never)
Heart stops, but the words are forever breathing (forever)
You hatin' cause we the best, find a better reason

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
First thing first don't ever play yourself (ever)
Oh another thing, I ain't ever play myself (never)
Even when they all changed up, I stayed myself (it's me)
Did what worked for me, then bossed up and paid myself (woo)
See I’m showing the Piguet off, gave the Rollie a day off
Still got that work, I don't know about no layoffs (nah)
Team still ballin' so I guess we in the playoffs (swish)
Team full of baddies, all my bitches in a slayoff (ahh)
See we be in the party wasted, no part of fake shit (yeah)
Nothin' but love 'round me, Cartier bracelets (oh)
I feel like Frank White walkin' into Arty Clay shit (oh)
You niggas got fat while everybody starved
My city don't sleep, I ain't ever noddin' off
When you're in the Benz, it piss everybody off
So I ain't stall, I do me, I ain't y'all (nah)
This New York nigga let 'em hang, giant balls (ahh)
Odell Beckham, respect him, you can't check him (you can't)
Blindside hoes hit me when I don't expect 'em (hey bighead)
Then I hit 'em with the curve from the major league (hol' up)
Gotta wait your turn, that's a major key

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Mami yellin' I'm the greatest
Back to back with the slow cum
In the lane, I got her so strung, I don't even know her
Every night I meet a new wife
Now ask your wife what this dick like
Balmain Joe, every time you see, a nigga flee
Mr. Officer, I was only grabbin' ID
Mami only listen to Romeo
Wild cowboy, I be speakin' through the yayo
Bout to let the cans go, woah
Fuck your bitch and let your mans know, so
Yeah, now it's the Don in the Don, couple laughs in the Uber
Only drivin' Uber cause I'm franchised in Cuba
This is big money talk and you tied to the sideline
Brian Scalabrine, niggas always tryna high five
Gotta stay away from they driftin', all sauce
Every day Vera Wang, nigga, cloth talk

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
(The Conglomerate)
Now I'm takin' over everything like that's my callin'
Wakin' up in pussy like beautiful Sunday mornin'
Now we swimmin' in the money like a line of dolphins (closed caskets, nigga)
Prepare for killin', now please line up all of the coffins (Closed caskets, nigga)
Think we playin'? Niggas think it's funny?
Pop you in your shit, brotha
Now make room for the money, MOVE!
If you don't make room, I'll beat a nigga past painful
Make a fool of yourself, I'll beat you past shameful
I get this bread and shine like an angel
One of the last with bars, you niggas better be grateful
(Thank you so much)
I Diddy bop and drop on you niggas
I count bread and take it to the top on you niggas (Mountaintop)
Blah blah blah blah, you sound alike, my niggas
Blah, blah, but when I do it, I finesse, I got it locked, my niggas
I give you new brand shit, fuck you gon' do?
And know we love the boom bap, oh yeah we do this too
Yeah, fuck with the realer side, oh you against us, nigga?
You better run and hide, until I'm finished, nigga
Don't play yourself
Play yourself and lay yourself dead in a casket
Pray yourself, end in a basket
Hate yourself
Cause you ain't ask if you could possess you a heater
Or you could be you a leader for the people
You talk a lot, I've seen the truth like Sevyn Streeter
Don't you ever play yourself

[Verse 5: Kent Jones]
I saw a lot of niggas fade out right after I put my tape out
I offered to help you shape up
I see that you'd rather flake out
Sellin' stories on them tracks
That nobody can seem to make out
That's why I keep a good head and shoulders
To keep all the flakes out
Seen a lot of singles chart on and off durin' the climb up
I bet if I had the clippers, they prolly all had a line up
You worried 'bout your followers, so hurt when I follow up
It's the ones with the most pride end up bein' the swallowers
Fuck a beat for a verse when I could do all three
No pop artist but pop is what you rappers do call me
A lot of washed out niggas tryna find hope in
I'm just tryna raise a son like my blinds' open
I know the hood well, but glad I ain't stuck in the streets
I'm pop chartin' but hood niggas got my song on repeat
I'm still loaded with illest ammo up under the seat
I'm playin' hopscotch with all the charts up under my feet
While you do it for the 'Gram, I do it for my Grammy
Fuck a gold trophy, I'm talkin' my mom's mammy (haha)
You gotta finish bigger than you start
Or fall victim to bench stories, you ain't even part of it all
Start from the bottom or oh, please, don't start at all
I build a ship just to survive my own flood, I feel like Noah
Cause all he had was little rocks, an ark, and saw
Road to riches, I'm still in gear while you park your car
Your baby wanna get nailed in the sprinter Lexus
Text back and told her
"Please be hammered so you can sex us"
My arm strong, if Louisiana then tell her Texas
And if it's not immediate then don't even send a message
FYI I'll be free 'round 2 or 3
And two things you gotta be, New Orleans
I'm an organ donor, I'm alive with no heart in me
So never say my name in vain
Cause bitch there's no arteries
Jones

Yo, he ain't messin' with no average chick, pop, pop

Every baller tryna score, check them shot clocks
But I hit 'em with them 'Bron-Iguodala blocks
Eat the cake and he suck on my toes, yes

Type to cop me diamonds, he can miss me with them bags

Calamari dinners, got you eatin' raw sushi
Still in the trap, but I like my bitches bougie
Two cups of styrofoam, excuse me lil' mama

You want watches, new Versaces, you want Céline (Ugh!)
Top back, screamin' money ain't a ting (Boss)

Do you wanna be running after money
Or be home hanging with your honey?
Now come here, show me how you’re loving me

All work and no play
Tell em it’s your birthday

Ali I haven’t even seen you since we left Calais
You’ve been so busy
It’s driving me crazy

You know I gotta be grinding
Sorry if I’m flaking
All this money that I be taking
I’m just shaking what Im making
I’m sending bread and bacon
Back home so they can
Fix what's broken
So baby don’t be hating
If you need vacation
Please be patient
I’m thinking generation
Coz it’s my obligation
All work and no play
I think we need a holiday
It's M I A yeah!
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Don’t bring your gun there
Don’t bother bother me
You can’t take me
You want me, pay me
You can’t 2Pac me
You can’t Biggie me
I’ve got a pikini with a bikini in Bequia
They wanna stop me
Galliano sack me
I’ll keep on coming back
Like your freaking acne
I am pro active
Brand new perspective
Back on a mac tip with matching red lipstick

[Hook]
Baby got back, I got front
You got a stack, I got a trunk
You got some junk, throw it in the bank
You think you get this but this ain’t what you think
All my people say!

[Verse 2]
I’m not on seven, I’m on eleven
The difference is kinda like Devon and Yemen
When I go Oman I say "Yeah Man"
I open up a club and fill it strictly full of woman
My mama go to church she says "Amen"
She also says "Why are men teaming up with Demon?"
I love all men they all take me heaven
I can’t keep myself in check like a mormon

[Hook]
Baby got back, I got front
You got a stack, I got a trunk
You got some junk, throw it in the bank
You think you get this but this ain’t what you think
All my people say!

[Verse 3]
Can’t be got I’m a
Cyber dog I
Fight the bots I
Free up a lot like
Chinese a chop chop
Put it in your hip hop pop
Encrypt and code it and I put it on your laptop
Bubble up poc poc
In my new bop bop
E’d up head up and I gon' beat a body up
This is immediate
We don’t need no media
Feel it, reel it, pull it
We gon' light the city up
We gon' light the city up
We gon' light the city up
All my people say!

Gators from lake placid baby
Crazy colored carrot Jakey
Matrix reloaded the bracelet
Damn I'm hurting these niggas faces
My mama call me Gucci
But you (?) Radric Davis
Radric Davis, write it down, I still probably wouldn’t claim yo baby
Hood like a hot wing
Hood like box ring
Hood like a charger on 4’s painted lime green
Half a million on me, not counting jewelry
If I add my jewelry, it would be 1.3
Six feet on beamer drop-top and its nasty
Two junkies washing it for free, man thats priceless
Never met a nigga in a world so shiesty
The fuck boys hate him but dope boys like him
Never met a nigga in a world so shiesty
The fuck boys hate him but dope boys like him

[Hook : Gucci Mane]

[Verse 1]
You can do it
Just walk in a straight line
And rise above it
Get drunk in the daytime
I'm ridin' 'round my side of town, my hair in the breeze
Life for me is drinkin beer and smokin up' weed

[Verse 2]
"What's your problem?"
They're all in my head, man
"Where's your money?"
I swear that's all that I had, man
Ducking from the boys and getting mugged by yourself
Waking up and wishing you were somebody else

[Bridge]
Imagine dreaming about dying every day
Then I get drunk and all my problems seem okay
I often wonder what my friend David would say
We weren't that close, but what's it like to fade away?

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Nas]
A divine leader, shine brighter, bonita mami meeter
Line sniffer, never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer
Ebony empress getter
Celebrity Apprentice a devil show, big up to Africa, Mexico
Hennessy, margarita, venison eater
So dear, spread 'em here, don't be actin' innocent either
Dome me, relax me, it's only to the nasty
I'm just a phony assassin, a lot of niggas owe me, I'ma tax 'em
A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic
‘Cause the rosary and gold flashy
Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code
Now everywhere all I see is Pablo, Esco
Last time I checked I was still breathin', my neck was still freezin'
Now everybody got an Escobar Season
To every baby on the album cover existin'
This trend I was settin', it came to fruition
I'm assistin' to push the culture forward
To all my ghost supporters, go support us
Like a local Black-owned grocery store
‘Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood
It's a dub on that, we get government aid
Spend it at they stores, puttin' they kids through college
We need balance so we can lease and own deeds in our projects
So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets
The racial economic inequality, let's try to solve it

[Chorus: Nas]
My signature fade with the Bevel blade, that's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that, that's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself, that's a major key
What Tony had on the table, it's like us, we a major key

[Verse 2: Nas]
Still underestimated, every mistake a lesson
Mercury retrograde, so if that planet spin backwards
Up in the heavens maybe
It's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately
I'm playin' chess with babies, niggas is nursery
Niggas impersonatin', rehearsin' me
Nothin' like me, I'm the first of me and that's quite certainly
So official, come get this issue, some women crazy
I like a woman to show me wisdom
These hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy
With a loaded pistol; y'all ain't meant to be played
Says the brother with the signature fade
Still paid, stackin', new stash
Went from hangin' with shooters and clappers
To computer hackers, check the fashion in Monaco
Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats
Khaled called me when I was in album mode
So I put it on hold for the Major Key
My album done, niggas, wait and see

[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic

[Chorus: Nas]
My signature fade with the Bevel blade, that's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that, that's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself, that's a major key
What Tony had on the table, it's like us, we a major key

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Another one!
DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
I'm here to right my wrongs
I've made a mess again
I'd like to apologize
I'm tryna make amends
Forgive me, father
I'm only human
That wasn't who I am
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Forgive me, father
Those were my demons

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Don't even look back on it
You ready for change, better act on it
They look up to you so don't slack on it
It's a blessing, you know that you're talented
Some people don't know what their talent is
What's sad is they don't know what balance is
I ain't been the same since I had a kid
Look out for him and protect where I live
I done got famous for what I did
Rollin' up papers and showin' love, we all in the same
Now the bank come to where I live
Don't hate on another man, no that ain't part of the game
Did it all for the fame
And don't call it a game
Started small every day
We worked hard, and now they call us bosses

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
And I done seen so many people slow down
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
And I done seen so many people change up
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
When you doin' good, somebody wanna see you doin' bad
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
Just movin' forward, so why they wanna talk about the past?
I can't relate, I can't relate, no

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
I'm here to right my wrongs
I've made a mess again
I'd like to apologize
I'm tryna make amends
Forgive me, father
I'm only human
That wasn't who I am
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Forgive me, father
Those were my demons

[Verse 2: Wale]
Major, yeah!
I got visions, I miss fortune all day
What I'm sayin', I, tryna tell y'all
I shake these nightmares all day
How can I give you my mind?
When I try to think, it just race
How can I give you my heart?
When I call on it, it just breaks
I put the city on top
District, V.A. all day
PG MoCo on their sweaters
Guess who made their MDMA?
Amy Wine to Cobain
Qur'an, Bible or fate
Try not to feel like I'm Robin Will'
Would a hook change my fate?
Why you make me this way?

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
I'm here to right my wrongs
I've made a mess of it
I'd like to apologize
I'm tryna make amends
Forgive me, father
I'm only human
That wasn't who I am
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Forgive me, father
Those were my demons

What's this show about? What am I talking about?  To summarize the show though, "Me! Me! Me!" But, if you take one thing away from my show, I hope it's a T-shirt. We're selling them out there, and at boburnham.com. This is all a front for the brand. But what's this show about? What do you think, industrial piping?

(Pipe hisses)

Close

(Second pipe hisses)

Stay out of it! It's about...mute this. But for real.

What is it about? It’s about performing. I try to make my show about other things but it always ends up becoming about performing. I started performing very young - as a teenager. Y’know, professionally. And as a comedian what you’re supposed to do is talk about what you know. And what I knew, always, was performing - so to talk about traffic or laundry felt incredibly disingenuous.

But I worried that making a show about performing would be too meta – it wouldn’t be relatable to people that aren’t performers. But what I found is that - I don’t think anyone isn’t.
Can we get the house lights up for a second, and could you - let the lights on stage – let the artifice fade away. Now we’re all the same. I mean, you’re all facing this way still. Y’know, I look at it - I look out at you and it’s a very diverse crowd. I mean, more European than I would have hoped but we’ll get there. I look at the young people. Y’know, and I feel like I was born in 1990 and I was sort of raised in America when it was a cult of self expression, and I was just taught, y’know, express myself and have things to say and everyone will care about them. And I think everyone was taught that, and most of us found out no-one gives a shit what we think. So we flock to performers by the thousands ‘cause we’re the few that have found an audience, and then I’m supposed to get up here and say follow your dreams - as if this is a meritocracy? It is not, okay? I had a privileged life, and I got lucky, and I’m unhappy.

They say it’s like the ‘me’ generation. It’s not. The arrogance is taught, or it was cultivated. It’s self-conscious. That’s what it is. It’s conscious of self. Social media - it’s just the market’s answer to a generation that demanded to perform so the market said, here - perform. Perform everything to each other, all the time for no reason. It’s prison - its horrific. It’s performer and audience melded together. What do we want more than to lie in our bed at the end of the day and just watch our life as a satisfied audience member. I know very little about anything. But what I do know is that if you can live your life without an audience, you should do it.

And now you’re thinking, how the fuck are you gonna dig the show outta this weird hole?

Oh, you want me to be funny and make a point? Nah, nah nah nah nah nah nah.
Batman.
So how do we do it? We do it like this...

[Intro: Yo-landi & Ninja]
Come to the dark side, we have candy
Yes, but do you have coffee?
Sure we have coffee, how do you take it?
Black, like my soul

[Chorus]
He likes his coffee black, like his soul
He drinks it scorching hot, like a fucking psycho
He like coffee a lot and he like his coffee now
Fifty cups of coffee and you know it's on

[Verse 1: Yo-landi & Ninja]
Bang, motherfucker, bang
Ja! Jy's n fokken mal gat
Dumbfucks can't even handle my slang
Skiet jou in jou moeder fokken poes want jy praat kak
Celebrity fuckboy rappers can't hang
Ja! Met n vinger in jou hol in!
Step the fuck back you, whack motherfucker
Like Kanye Kardashian
Yo, I like rats and coffee and weed
And sing whatever the fuck I want to the beat
And I like gats and money and speed
And drivin' like a poes down the motherfuckin' street
And all I wanna do is zoom, zoom, zoom
Bass pump in the trunk, boom, boom, boom
Pitch-black windows
You wanna see me, but you can't
Sippin' on champagne
Puffin' on a blunt

[Spoken Interlude: Yo-landi & Ninja]
So, how do you feel now that you have your new dark powers?
Aah, feel pretty good, not eh, not scared at all, I just feel kind of, I feel kind of invincible

[Verse 2: Yo-landi & Ninja]
I non-stop motherfucker
I'm too ill to chill
Too dope to cope
Too lit to quit
You fuck with peanut butter and jelly
She talks shit
My foot kicks your ass
My fists split your lip
My mommy she shut me up with duct tape
Now I get paid for talking all day
Kidding, fok it, let's go full retard
Aw, fuck's sakes, who ate my last cupcake?
I love coffee, but not a fuck
When I drink Starbucks, 'cause Starbucks sucks
Ja! Daai shit proe soos kak! Ek kannie!
Oh man, I'm makin' so much motherfuckin' money
It's making my brain go funny
You put the money in the wallet
Fok it, I can't think, I need more coffee
Kidding, fok it, let's go full retard
No more motherfuckin' milk or sugar, because

[Chorus]
He likes his coffee black, like his soul
He drinks it scorching hot, like a fucking psycho
He like coffee a lot and he like his coffee now
Fifty cups of coffee and you know it's on

[Spoken Interlude: Yo-landi]
But, sometimes I get sad, and I cut myself
A piece of cake!

[Outro: Yo-landi & Ninja]
Yo, 'cause, I get the mother fuckin' munchies
Oh, motherfucker, I need someone to eat
Flesh so yummy, bones so nice and crunchy
Hehehe, I dare you to fuck with me
Ah, aren't you just such a cute little lollipop?
Triple-dipped in psycho

[Hook 1: Yolandi]
Daddy, daddy, please buy me a sweet

In my mother-fucking tummy
Come on daddy, buy me that chocolate
Bunny, I know you got money

[Chorus: Ninja & (Sen Dog)]
Everybody wanna be a gangster

Jumpin' right at the speed of light, make you go to sleep
Wake up nose bleeding and you got no teeth

[Chorus: Ninja & (Sen Dog)]
Everybody wanna be a gangster

(Yeah- Put up or shut up)
Shit just got real up in this bitch

[Verse 2: Ninja]
This one time me and Yolandi was
Driving down the road smoking some herb
Through the fucking streets of Johannesburg
When I'm zef side I always roll strapped
In a matte black Scubie with a matte black gat
Subwoofer in the trunk, kicking to the bass
Now I got this fuckin .38 stickin in my waist
So I pull out my gat and I leave it on my lap
On the zef side of town now speeding to the left
Stop at the light round the corner from my pad
Who's this knocking at my window?
Nigga pointing at my front wheel says I got a flat
My window's real mother fucking black
So I can see him but he can't see me back
He put a gun on my window and go tap tap tap
So I picked up the matte black gat on my lap
And I said 'Yolandi, can you please lean back?'

[Verse 3: Yolandi & (Ninja)]
Jy, jou ma se poes
Jy’s ‘n fokken naai
Tsek, jy gat vrek
Ja you gonna die
Wat die fok is aan die gang binne in jou kop?
Fokkol! Bra, jy’s 'n fokken flop
Jy’s 'n brak

[Chorus: Ninja & (Sen Dog)] x2
Everybody wanna be a gangster

Dear God, when I wake up, please can I have wings on my penis? Amen

Uh! Yo! Huh! Yeah! Let's do this!

Will I ever stop drawing penises? Never!
Yo! Will I ever stop cursing? Maybe! NOT!
If you don't like it, fuck you!

[Hook: Jack Black]
Rats, rats, everywhere you look, everywhere you turn, there's rats
Rats, rats, eating all your books, looking at your photographs
Rats, rats, nesting in your closets, hiding underneath your socks
Living in your living rooms, sleeping by your bedroom clocks
There must be a couple million and more are coming every day
Soon, there could be a couple billion, how will you make us go away?

[Interlude: Lil Tommy Terror, his mother, and Yolandi]
Ew, those dirty rats, they're ruining everything! There must be some way to get rid of them! Ew, kill them with poison!
Fuck, shut up, bitch! Hou jou bek, we're going to fuck you up!

[Verse: Ninja and Yolandi]
Yo, yo, we back with the R to the A to the T
To the T to the R to the A to the P
When the rats wanna rap, they say
"Yo, gimme that rat trap! Rat trap!" Say it again
Yo, gimme that rat trap!
I'm a bad rat, not a good rat
You catch me hanging with hood rats
But actually, you never catch me
'Cause I'm a fast rat, I'm a fast rat
My accent is fucking epic
I'm happenin', you a has-been
Don't want me 'round when I snap back
Don't point at me, I'm an attack rat
I'm the dap strap, motherfuckin' matte rat
Yolandi's the black rat in the rat pack
You spitting, you fat rap
We're rolling with Jack Black
When the rap stap, the people go clap-clap
The club always jam packed
Little sex rats, you wanna get backstage
To hang with the Zef rats?
Little white rats, little black rats
Oh, fuck, what a dope butt, let me smack that
She giggly, wriggly, why? 'Cause I'm sniffing her ass crack
Yo, I'd tap that

Stab you in the back if you act whack

Motherfucker, yo, that's sick, slap my hand!
Wanna get high, man? I wanna get spastic
Aye, yo, that shit's fuckin' rap shit, rap shit, get that bat, shit

[Interlude: Lil Tommy Terror and his mother]
Die, fuck! Motherfucker! That stupid fuck!
No! Cut it out! They're in my ass, there’s a rat in my ass! There’s a rat in my ass, oh, my God!

[Hook: Jack Black]
Rats are all that you can think of, the only thing that you discuss
You can try and find a rat solution, but you'll never get rid of us
Rats, rats, you think that we're disgusting, but actually we're really cool
Us rats started in the gutter, but in the end, the rats shall rule

[Outro: Jack Black and Yolandi]
In the end, the rats shall rule
Yeah, rats rule, motherfucker

[Verse: Ninja]

There's cum squirting out your nostrils!

[Skit: Ninja, Yolandi, God]
Dude what are you doing?

What are you talking about?

But not, uh, fuck, dude, it's like if you, I'm saying like the chick
What are you saying?
Uh, like the chick, like skill like a girl who can give deep throat
Nah, I don't get it, God what do you think? God? Do you think it sounds gay?

[Chorus]
(Stoopid rich)
I got dough, I got steeze
I got fucking champagne, I got weed
Big house on the hill in amongst the trees
I got anything you want, anything you need

Got a little baby daughter so I go hard
When they see how I'm living they go "Oh my god"
I got the fucking wild lifestyle you can't afford

[Chorus]
(Stoopid rich)
I, I got dough, I got steeze

Got a little baby daughter so I go hard
When they see how I'm living they go "Oh my god"
Yeah, welcome to my life baby
(Stoopid rich)
Uh, let's get more money
Remember when we had no money?

In your mother fucking face bitch!

[Chorus]

(Stoopid rich)
Yeah, I'm stoopid rich!
Stoned in the fucking mall buying stupid shit
The illest little asshole in the rap game
Chilling in the lambo sipping champagne!
Yeah, and everything I got, I got on my own
Yep I've been a little crazy fuck on the microphone
I'm just a stupid rich kid, I'm so fucking high
And if you don't like it- fuck off and die!

[Chorus]
(Stoopid rich)
I got dough, I got steeze
I'm sipping on champagne, and smoking weed
Big house on the hill in amongst the trees
I got anything you want, anything you need

And if I don't got it, I can get it
I got the bills, not a problem just forget it
My baby call me Mount Ninji cause I'm her rock
Hater's gonna hate

(Stoopid rich)

Yeah lets get more money
Remember when we had no money?
Now we got rich and we gonna stay rich
In your mother fucking face bitch!
(Stoopid rich)
Yo, I was at the club just chilling and shit
And this pretty little mama, Alana, pick the paddy up
Outside, people smoking marijuana
Sweet talking anna, zero fucking drama
I'm dressed fresh, got my best tracksuit on, people be like, "Where'd you get that dope tracksuit from?"

Yo, every time I rock this shit people bug out, my tracksuit on, itchy and scratchy the fuck out
All of the sudden there's a fucking light in my face, dumb fuck with the camera, right in my face
Dude's like, "look who's all up in the club with a onesie, look at me everybody I'm in a onesie"
This fat fuck mad drunk all brave and shit
Obviously jealous on this fucking hater shit

Cell phone in my face shouting loud as he can, so I snatched his fucking cell phone out of his hand
His little video must look fucking sick when I stuck his phone in my pants and rubbed it on my dick, uh, dude was dumbstruck handed the phone back to this dumb fuck
Motherfuck nearly had a heart attack,  now your flustered, tripping out all disgusted, I'm holding his phone out but he doesn't want it back, it's like fuck it, popped his phone back into his pocket

"What's wrong with you man, are you fucking crazy?" I replied "Yes, totally fucking crazy" gold teeth flashing, smiling, Alana, my little 'nana, trying to cool down the drama

"I'll fuck you up man!" Tonight was a special night, now this fat fuck was screaming, like you wanna fight, so I said, "You gon' bark all night, huh, little doggy? Or you gonna bite?"

Motherfuck was still steaming, making a big scene, screaming, has to get himself kicked out
He just peanut butter and jealous, peanut butter and jelly, calling an uber with the smell of dick on his cellie

[Chrous]
I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me

[Verse 1]
Long ago I was a little girl yet I was never ever able to fit in
My teachers at school would try to tell me what to do but, yo I would never listen
'Cause I was high all the time, stoned out of my little fucking mind
Misunderstood, lost and confused looking for a sign
All the popular kids at school were always super mean to me and made me cry
I never knew what I should do so I just walked away and said "Fuck off and die"
They said that I'm weird, that I'm ugly, and that I suck
I knew that one day all of those kids would grow up to be boring as fuck

[Chrous]
I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me
I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me

[Verse 2]
I close my eyes and float into the night I like to let my mind drift
Make a jump into a new dimension
Thank God I got that gift
Ever since I was a little kid
Always on that next shit
These whack copycat ball bags can suck my motherfucking dick
Sometimes it feels like coming from this planet people are so sick and twisted
I don't wanna fit in anyway, I'd rather be a misfit
Fuck a normal life, that's lame, me I'm insane in the brain
They laugh at me because I'm different, I laugh at them because they're all the same

[Chrous]
I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me

I am a alien
No matter how hard I try I don't fit in
Always all on my own, sad and lonely
All I want is for someone to play with me

[Hook]
Underneath the streetlight, now, waiting for the shit to go down
Oh, no, there's gonna be a murder, oh god, when the street go down

[Verse 1]
In Africa everything broken
Ch'Yeah boy, no money no friends
Just live to fight another day
At night the rats come out to play
In the trash, empty streets where rattys rolling thick as thieves
Take your money if you rich
Take your life and rape your bitch

10pm - no body, in the streets just yolandi and me night walking sipping wine, feeling fine, killing time
Night life wild if you feel like fun, some reason didn't bring my gun
My tipsy, giggly and taking selfies, making up rhymes that made me wealthy
Sense the threat, from behind, we stop underneath the street light look past these 6 motherfuckers yep, 6 rattys rolling up on us

[Hook]
Underneath the streetlight, no, waiting for the shit to go down, oh, god
There's gunna be blood on the streets, so much blood on the streets girl, when the shit go down, oh, oh god

[Verse 2]
Fuck, we getting rolled on
Wait, don’t run, just hold on
Didn’t wanna run away into the dark
Six rattys rolled up on us hard, they stick a knife against my guts
They take my phone, who gives a fuck?
Take what you want, I keep calm
Some one ratty grabs Yolandi’s arm
‘Nother rat pull a GAT, but it didn’t go blaow
Motherfucker ratty’s only pull a GAT now
Yolandi starts to fucking kick and make me lose my fucking shit
I busted the motherfuckin’ rat with the GAT
I kicked and hit and bit this guy
Stuck my finger in his eye
Took the ratty’s gun away
No bullets so the ratty’s run away
Set the ratty over there
He dragging my girl by the hair
She’s tryin' her best to get away
He punching my girl in the face
What the fucking fuck, then quick
I smashed a bottle on a brick
Watch a motherfucker like a wild animal

[Bridge]
Blood, blood so much blood, oh, oh no, oh no no
What did I just do, oh my god? oh, jesus fucking christ
Blood, blood so much blood, oh, oh no, please forgive me
What did I just do, oh my god? I didn't mean to kill a man, oh no

[Hook]
Underneath the street light, oh, that's where the shit went down, oh, oh, oh, god, your mama gonna cry tonight, girl, when she hear about the shit that went down, oh, oh, father forgive me

[Outro]

[Verse 1: Yolandi]
Just a little baby girl, didn't ask to get born into this crazy world
Sometimes I get sad because I didn't even know who my daddy was
My mommy held me tight, rocked me side to side as she sang a lullaby
Then my mommy cried and my mommy said goodbye
She brought me into this life but I don't know why
Mommy didn't want me, mommy didn't want me

[Verse 2: Yolandi]
Just a little baby girl, didn't ask to get born into this crazy world
Sometimes I get sad because I didn't even know who my mommy was
Maybe I was born bad, maybe I need help
'Cause sometimes I get sad and I wanna kill myself
But when I sing my momma's lullaby, I don't wanna die but I don't know why, why
Mommy didn't want me

[Verse 3: Yolandi x2]
Toemaar, toemaar baba, moenie huil nie
Mamma moet nou weggaan, maar moenie worry nie
Al is jy arm, of al is jy ryk
Die Here sal vir ewig en altyd na jou kyk

[Verse 4: Yolandi]
Just a little baby girl, didn't ask to get born into this crazy world
Sometimes I get sad because, I didn't know who my mommy or my daddy was
They told me my mommy held me tight, rocked me side to side as she sung a lullaby
Then my mommy cried and my mommy said goodbye
She brought me into this life but I don't know why
Mommy didn't want me

[Verse 5: Yolandi]

I'm touchin' triple digits, now it's tangible
I'm touchin' M's now my life is pandemonium
I go and re-up on you, new Aventadors
Everything around me too colossal
You niggas old news like a fossil
Every single night I got a bad bitch
She didn't come alone, she came with another bad one
I done caught a vibe and a wave, double jeopardy
They know I'm the king of these melodies
You know I was in the bando, smellin' like a half a key
You can smell the molly comin' off me when you next to me
Put it in my cup and let me medicate
And it all started off with foreplay (with foreplay)
Cappuccino vodkas in Santa Monica (Santa Monica)
We was best friends until the fall out
Now I got the lawyers goin' all out

Okay, hey, I got my dollas, my cash up
They wanna see me on my last one (Last one)
They tell you things you don't wanna hear
They don't wanna see me with a bad one
No, or see you in a Benz wagon
With your new bag on
The bag that these hatin' bitches
Only spend a hundred plus tax on
The one we spent five racks on
And I love to get on tracks that I can rap and spit facts on
I'm the one that niggas love to turn they backs on
Yeah, that's cool with me, that's cool with me
Another one

Ayo Neil, bless up
I got, everything what you want with me
I do, everything he does times three
And he don't gotta know, I got you on the floor
Doing things you never thought you'd do
Baby leave them high heel shoes
'Cause I love it when you're lookin' down at me
I'm lookin' up at you
And I don't give a damn shorty, watch me knock them boots off
Baby leave them high heel shoes
'Cause I love it when you're lookin' down at me
I'm lookin' up at you
And I don't give a damn shorty, watch me knock them boots off

I just wanna take you there
He don't got to go away
Does he touch you here like this?
Let me take the friction from your lips

I got, everything what you want with me
I do, everything he does times three
And he don't gotta know, I got you on the floor
Doing things you never thought you'd do
Baby leave them high heel shoes
'Cause I love it when you're lookin' down at me
I'm lookin' up at you
And I don't give a damn shorty, watch me knock them boots off

I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you need

He's what you want
He's what you want
He's what you want

[Verse 1]
Boy, when I left you you were young
I was gone, but not my love
You were clearly meant for more
Than a life lost in the war

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

[Chorus]
Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right

[Verse 2]
Boy, now your life is back-to-front
But you'll see that's not for long
'Cause I know you'll feel the ghost
Of some memories so warm

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

[Chorus]
Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit dappy

[Chorus]
Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right
I'll make you...

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, I want you to be happy
Free to run, get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit...

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
I was 15 attending summer school at Hawthorne High, spending most of my nights trying to find any snippets of the album on various German sites. Then 7/25/06 came. IMM ranges in different styles and sounds and I believe that's why I gravitated to it so much. The upright bassline on “Can I Have It Like That” or the buckets on “How Does It Feel”. Off the wall MJ on “Number 1″. I still to this day don't think I can make a song better than “That Girl”. And “I Really Like You Girl” is easily the best song on this album with your best Timberlake impersonation and Stevie harmonica. IMM also includes “Raspy Shit” which is the worst song in your discography I hate that song so much you are so gross for that. But the one that stood out was “You Can Do It Too”. The sade bassline, the string pad with chords that you claim only Q-Tip, you and I like, the Jamie Cullum outro!

Being 15 black not really “interested” in what the majority of my peers were into, it made me feel safe. I was optimistic, always daydreaming and setting goals so I felt you were directly speaking to me. I remember clancy telling me how Jimmy Iovine thought this album was a “complete fucking failure it didnt work”. But see, it did, just not on the kids he was looking at. The ones who just existed; used the popular slang; listened to what was thrown at them; dressed in clothing that was trending at the time. Not saying that's bad but of course this wouldn't work on them. But it worked on me and I created Odd Future that same summer. I was actually naive enough to believe you and thought I could do all these amazing things if I really tried.

Where I grew up, niggas get stuck and never make it out. Jail, dead, shit jobs, not really growing. It seems like at a certain age, ideas; original thoughts are no longer a thing; I didnt fall into that cycle. I’m now a young entrepreneur all because I believed you when you said I could be. You were the first person I contacted when I pulled off that McLaren dealership!

This is getting long so uhhh, hbd IMM. I never had brothers, uncles or my father around so thank you for being the male figure I gravitated to. Allowing me to embrace being different and trusting my ideas.

[Verse 1]
Drop me off at the Copacabana
You're my one true love, aren't you man, ah?
I'm your little Super 8 movie
You know I'm in love with ya truly, yeah
So when, baby, if you
Don't get down (ah ah ah)
Don't get down

[Chorus 1]
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
Its finally time to make a safe get away
I could not be happier

[Verse 2]
Drop me off, Santo Casino
I got an idea, why don't we go to Mexico?
Like we said we would, and you, don’t want, want to
But I think, I think it'd be good for you, Billy
You never want to do nothing anymore and I
Remember the days when you used to sway and you'd

[Chorus 2]
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
It's finally time to make a safe get away
I love you, baby

[Verse 3]
What happened to us? Me and you?
I was funny once and you were funny, too
One day, we woke up and I found that we had grew
And only I wasn't me, I had come out blue
And you, I don't know what to make of you
You're not a color, you're more of a shape
Of your former self, like they say, babe
I remember the days when you'd

[Chorus 3]
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
And I'll continue always to keep that way

[Bridge]
Yellow, red or blue
Don't matter to me if it don't matter to you
We'll just keep on trucking and see what we do and
I remember every way that you love me, baby

[Chorus 4]
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
Top down, howlin' "Vegas" all the way
We almost had it all, didn't we, baby?

[AMNERIS]
I may leave a great impression
As I race through a succession
Of the latest crazes, chase the newest fad
I feel better when beguiling
Find that fashion keeps me smiling
But in my heart I know it's rather sad

[AIDA]
That a life of great potential
Is dismissed, inconsequential

[AMNERIS]
And only ever seen as being cute
So I'll flutter to deceive

[AIDA]
Oh no you must believe
That one day you're bound to find

[BOTH]
A stronger suit

[AIDA]
We all lead such elaborate lives
Wild ambitions in our sights
How an affair of the heart survives
Days apart and hurried nights
Seems quite unbelievable to me

I don't want to live like that
Seems quite unbelievable to me
I don't want to love like that
I just want our time to be
Slower and gentler, wiser, free

We all live in extravagant times
Playing games we can't  all win
Unintended emotional crimes
Take some out take others in

Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to live like that
Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to love like that
I just want to keep your heart
May this confession be the start
I know you'll give me courage
To face what I must face
With all these complications
In another time and place

[AIDA/RADAMES]
We all lead such elaborate lives
We don't know whose words are true
An affair of the heart survives
All the pain this world can do

[RADAMES]
I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to live like that

[AIDA]
I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to love like that
I just want to be with you
Now and forever peaceful, true

[Intro:]
Trapacohols
It's Gucci

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I’m so fucking careless
I talk real grizzy and in my wrist freezy
And I don’t really care bitch
I’m riding in a 2 seater but I'm by myself
Because I’m so fucking selfish
I’m ride in the town and I’m smoking by the pound
Because I don’t like to share shit
And I got the things on the low
I can put you on
Talking to your square bitch

[Verse 1: Future]
I never talk to bitches, they always talk to me
They never walking to me when they see me always run on me
What kind of future
It ain't no saving me
Im too american, im living
But girls inside my belt
Young future need some help
The realist nigga left
And I stay fresh to death
Beverly hills
And i dont need no studies
My niggas still
So very selfish, but she is so fucking

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]

[?] numbers
Got versace put jumpers
And my 

[?] of buggatti
I had in a valley, on a back of buggatti
I'm in love with the drink
Went to sleep with the pain
Had the dream about money
And woke up in the bame
I'm not to
So i can see what you saying
You jumping real waters
I just to the club
I drink my 

[?] in you srills
Look in my watch that why your girlfriend in love
I drove my car in the summer
They say it's just the begining
But Gucci think he's doing numbers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chill Will]
Yeah, ah
She might say just a
He might take just a minute
I'm counting money, he gonna take the whole 

[?]
She went on in my zone
I just come she alone
See me put in

Bitches say that I'km selfish
Because I'm often a
Smoking weed I'm selfish
When they see me put in

[?]
Bitch dont look behind you
Ice came
Everythime I come throw
Money always come throw
Bitch dont look behind you
Ice came
4026 is where real niggas come through

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
When I'd ask why the painting was deadly
Nobody could pick up my sign
'Cept for the cook, she was always friendly
But she'd only ask, "What's on your mind?"
She'd say that especially when it was raining
I'd say "Oh, I don't know"
But then she'd press and I'd say, "You see that painting?
Do you think it's been done by Van Gogh?"

[Verse 2]
The cook she said call her Maria
She'd always point for the same boy to come forth
Saying, "He trades cattle, it's his own idea
And he also makes trips to the North
Have you ever seen his naked calf bleed?"
I'd say, "Oh no, why does it show?"
And she'd whisper in my ear that he's a half-breed
And I'd say, "Fine, but can he paint like Van Gogh?"

[Verse 3]
I can't remember his name he never gave it
But I always figured he could go home
Til when he'd gave me his card and said, "Save it"
I could see by his eyes he was alone
But it was sad how his four leaf clover
Drawn on his calling card showed
That it was given back to him a-many times over
And it most definitely was not done by Van Gogh

[Verse 4]
It was either she or the maid just to please me
Though I sensed she could not understand
And she made a thing out of it by saying, "Go easy
He's a straight, but he's a very crooked straight man."
And I'd say, "Does the girl in the calendar doubt it?
And by the way is it Marilyn Monroe?"
But she'd just speak softly and say, "Why you wanna know about it?"
And I'd say, "I was just wondering if she ever sat for Van Gogh."

[Verse 5]
It was either her or the straight man who introduced me
To Jeanette, Camilla's friend
Who later on falsely accused me of stealing her locket and pen
When I said "I don't have the locket"
She said "You steal pictures of everybody's mother I know"
And I said "There's no locket
No picture of any mother I would pocket
Unless it's been done by Van Gogh."

[Verse 6]
Camilla's house stood on the outskirts
How strange to see the chandeliers destroyed
While 

[?] beneath the velvet carpet
Of fox hunts and love far before

[Verse 1]
Don't know when we going home but your friend could come along
I'm thinking why not, baby, why not? Ooh
I'm looking good, don't wanna blink, mirror tells me I'm a king
I'm thinking why not, baby, why not? Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Take a sip, take a sip now, take it down, take it down now
Say ah, say ah, say ah, say ah
Oh, do your dance, do your dance now
Sing it loud with me right now
Say ah, say ah, say ah, say ah

[Chorus]
'Cause I believe we can fly now, woo
Spread your wings and kiss the sky, woo
Yeah, I believe we can fly now, woo
Spread your wings, we're miles high, woo
So we can kiss the sky

My new girl headline the news but my ex still coming through
And I'm thinking why not, baby, why not? Yeah
Ain't nothing gon' stop the funk, I'm gon' make you pop your trunk
I'm thinking why not, baby, why not? Oh (Why not)

[Pre-Chorus]
Take a sip, take a sip now, take it down, take it down now
Say ah, say ah, say ah, say ah (just say ah)
Oh, do your dance, do your dance now
Sing it loud with me right now
Say ah, say ah, say ah, say ah

[Chorus]
'Cause I believe we can fly now, woo
Spread your wings and kiss the sky, woo (spread your wings and kiss the sky)
Yeah, I believe we can fly now, woo
Spread your wings, we're miles high, woo
So we can kiss the sky
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (woo)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (ooh, kiss the sky)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (na-na-na-na-na)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Bridge]
Oh, come on kiss it, oh
Ooh, tell you all my deepest, darkest secrets
If you let me funk you, if you let me funk you
I just wanna let you, baby
I just bought a mansion, you can keep it
If you let me funk you, if you let me funk you, yeah, oh
Top down all day, got that broccoli
Six girls, G6, head to Miami
Tell you all my deepest, darkest secrets, oh
If you let me funk you, funk you

[Chorus]
'Cause I believe we can fly now, woo (fly now)
Spread your wings and kiss the sky, woo (woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
Yeah, I believe we can fly now, woo (I believe, I believe, baby)
Spread your wings, we're miles high, woo

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (we're way too high to not do it, babe)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (do it, babe)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (oh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (only with Derulo, baby, yeah)
We can kiss the sky
Kissing the sky
Kissing the sky, yeah
Why do you come here?
Why do you tear me apart?
I don't know why you're so...
Made of material parts

Why do you love fear
Carried around in a cart?
I don't know why your soul
Cloaks a mysterious heart

Dwell in the dark, oh...
Dwell in the dark, oh...
Dwell in the dark, oh...
Dwell in the dark, oh...

When you were little
You used to keep on the light
You grew up and grew in
Swallowed the spite

And it won't be long now
Your body's wasting away
What's the point of this shell
Crafted in caves
Dwell in the dark, oh...
Dwell in the dark, oh...
Dwell in the dark, oh...
Dwell in the dark, oh...

And now can you open...
A mind that's been broken down
Illuminate the ocean floor
Make all the creatures bow
You'll come around when you're tired
Of being denied

Dwell in the dark, oh...
Dwell in the dark, oh...
Dwell in the dark, oh...
Dwell in the dark, oh...

Dwell in the dark, oh...
You dwell in the dark, oh...
You dwell in the dark, oh, woh...
You dwell-yeah...

You dwell in the dark, ah...
You dwell yehe...
You dwell in the dark
Die in the dark
I’ve been waiting patiently here
With a porters love song, a bottle of beer
A dream, I keep, alive in my sleep

I’ve been treading dark deep through the night
Beyond the brave, the wild tiki light
Turning moons over, away I run

Well give me some rain, wash me away
Wake me up easy, I might be okay
Give me some time, give me some time away from home
Give me some time to let things go

I’ve been looking out over the roam
Shadowed in mountain, afraid to move on
It’s hard to think I’ve been at this for days

Well I don’t know if I’ll ever get home
Beside the fire, young foot in the stone
I feel that breeze, it’s calling my name
Well give me some rain, wash me away
Wake me up easy, I might be okay
Give me some time, give me some time away from home
Give me some time to let things go

[Verse 1: Jake]
I saw a cigarette contend
It was the smell of death that kept strolling in
Maybe that henna'd back of yours
That held me back, back from keeping score

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
There goes that moonboy
Looking jungly
With all his leaves a-growing
Split down that long back
He would’ve thought that
If you got to know him
True blue with your fists up
You little kiss up
Wishin' things were heavy
That's fine in the end though
Where'd all our friends go
We can dip if you're ready

[Verse 2: Jake]
I bet you take me for a fool
Nothing like, like rules the cool sensation of Pollock and Jules
Some weird abandon in sheets
Though the tongue tastes good
My grammar's falling from the cheeks

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
There goes that moonboy
Looking jungly
With all his leaves a-growing
Split down that long back
He would’ve thought that
If you got to know him
True blue with your fists up
You little kiss up
Wishin' things were heavy
That's fine in the end though
Where'd all our friends go
We can dip if you're ready

[Refrain: Jake]
I was wrong
You were a friendly kid
I was wrong
You were a friendly kid

[Bridge: Jake]
Fill the rafters
Right field dances
Baseball diamonds
Take our chances out

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
There's somethin' fiction 'bout the way that reality's going
Seems like the chakras playing hopscotch
Anxiety a-growin'
Some cordial framework of the sunset
A yellow made out of gray
My bones are tired of the body
That woke me up today

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
There goes that moonboy
Looking jungly
With all his leaves a-growing
Split down that long back
He would’ve thought that
If you got to know him
True blue with your fists up
You little kiss up
Wishin' things were heavy
That's fine in the end though
Where'd all our friends go
We can dip if you're ready

[Outro]
I was wrong
You were a friendly kid
I was wrong
You were a friendly kid
I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong

[Verse 1]
The tidewing's singing common things to us
Lift up your heart and kiss who you want
I know that you said you'd rather leave instead
With things you wrote and the things you said

[Chorus]
When I saw you whoa-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh
When I saw you whoa-oh-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh
When I saw you whoa-oh-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh
When I saw you whoa-oh-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh

[Verse 2]
The bitter cold is wild place
The sweat on your brow streaming down your face
Take the lie, it's a matter 

[?] of mine
Pick your fight, it's a matter of just taking your time

[Chorus]
I still love ya
I still love ya
I still love ya
And I still love ya
I still love ya
I still love ya

[Interlude]

[Outro]
In the life I've found is a malapropism
Ipso facto
You have already come down
In the life I’ve found is a malapropism
Ipso facto
You have already come down
Ipso facto
You have already come down

[Verse 1]
This conviction, not commitment
You're a better man than I
But no better than a lie
A conviction, full of fiction
What's the point in trying to hide it
What's point in trying to hide

[Chorus]
We strain ourselves to the bones to see
The things we value eternally
Now what was it that you want from me
I'm not the boy that I used to be

[Verse 2]
Stop craving over hope that's not enough to change
In his pocket, found a spot of keeping up with things
To get the feeling the your nothing wasn’t worth the trade
Bet on, bet on nothing, waste your life away
I saw your silence, your sadness was a living thing
I shot it down, a sound that didn’t ring
Like a 

[?] of a guy that you couldn’t see
Tone deaf, solid beating in reality

[Verse 3]
From the sea to the city
We got golden hearts
Flower turning on the past
Time to make a mark
I was dying for it
I was dying for it

[Verse 4]
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I never really doubted all that I had

[Chorus]
We strain ourselves to the bones to see
The things we value eternally
Now what was it that you want from me
I'm not the boy that I used to be

[Verse 5]
Your veins are crimson, I long to see
The kiss inspired 

[?]
So bow your head, meditate with me
And miss the world as we

[Interlude]

[Outro]
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

[Verse 1: Jake]
Sometimes they call it a Tuesday
Sometimes they call it the best day of my life
Maybe that was a Friday
Making conversation with a box of wine

[Chorus: Jake]
Oh, love, I'll only call you when I'm drunk
On Tuesday
On Tuesday

[Verse 2: Jake]
Sometimes I think I'm mundane
Sometimes I think I'm better off like my dad
Maybe that's progressive
Or maybe that's the working class

[Chorus: Jake]
Oh, love, I'll only call you when I'm drunk
On Tuesday
On Tuesday

[Bridge: Jake]
My friends say we are the lucky ones
In terms of our relationship
Alcoholic tendencies underneath our fingertips
I think I love you
I think I know you
Or is it only liquor speak?
I want to love you
I wanna know you

[Chorus/Outro: Jake]
Sometimes they call it a Tuesday
Sometimes I think I am doing fine
Sometimes they call it a Tuesday
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day of my life
Sometimes it's the best day

[Chorus]
Did I
Fuck around and drop the top on niggas
When them niggas thought I wouldn't
Did I
Fuck your bitch or something
What I did to ya, why you fronting on me
Did I
Hit the trap and have it jumping
Turning nothing into something
Peeling off the corner flexing on them niggas
Shawty know a nigga came here from nothing

[Verse 1]
I got the gas on me
Being broke was the reason why all of these females would pass on me
Now I pull up in that S550 and I dash on 'em
And you know I don't spend any cash on 'em

[Refrain]
When I'm pulling up inside that thing you know I do my thing
And I drop the top on all these niggas in the way
And this is for the times a nigga shitted on me
You shitted on me, now you see the tables turning my way

[Pre-Chorus]
So I gotta flex, I gotta flex, I gotta flex on you
For all of the times when I was a mess
And you tried to flex on me too
So I gotta flex, and I gotta flex, and flexing on you too
I know I'm wrong
Tell me what I did to you

[Chorus]
Did I
Fuck around and drop the top on niggas
When them niggas thought I wouldn't
Did I

What I did to ya, why you fronting on me
Did I
Hit the trap and have it jumping
Turning nothing into something
Peeling off the corner flexing on them niggas
Shawty know a nigga came here from nothing
(Fuck can you say to me?)
(Fuck can you say to me?)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh
A young nigga gotta hop out and do some
Gotta let the top down to prove some
Nigga, you know I-I-I got news for you
Everybody know I'm paid only you fronted
The fame made a nigga lose a lot of friendships
The fame made these niggas do a lot fuck shit
Couple good girls that I lost to the cause
I gotta face facts we don't talk no more
Young rich nigga on his way up
My niggas up and I hope that we stay up
You know the devil working gotta pray up
And I just pray that all my niggas paid up and ball like lay up
I’m calling, shawty calling
I do this often, don't know what to call it
This shit exhausting but you know I'm all in
Drop the top on that thing when it's gwanin’

[Refrain]
When I'm pulling up inside that thing, you know I do my thing
And I drop the top on all these niggas in the way
And this is for the times a nigga shitted on me
You shitted on me, now you see the tables turning my way

[Pre-Chorus]
So I gotta flex, I gotta flex, I gotta flex on you
For all of the times when I was a mess
And you tried to flex on me too
So I gotta flex, and I gotta flex, and flexing on you too
I know I'm wrong
Tell me what I did to you

[Chorus]
Did I
Fuck around and drop the top on niggas
When them niggas thought I wouldn't
Did I

What I did to ya, why you fronting on me
Did I
Hit the trap and have it jumping
Turning nothing into something
Peeling off the corner flexing on them niggas
Shawty know a nigga came here from nothing
(Fuck can you say to me?)
(Fuck can you say to me?)

[Outro]
Can't believe when I look back at how I did it
Fuck around and made something, I made something
Made something
Made something of myself
I made something

[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I can't keep on
Losin' you over complications
Gone too soon, wait!
We was just hangin'
I can't seem to hold onto
Dang

The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losin' you
I can't keep on losin' you

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Anderson .Paak]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
How many mistakes do it take 'til you leave
And I'm left with my hand on my face, all red
In the face, lookin' at you like "wait!"
I know I ain't a saint, if it ain't too late, well...
(I can't keep on losin' you) Don't run away so fast
Know my heart like gold, but it break like glass
Know my shit get old and I act so young
Baby, you so cold, never have no sun
You don't wanna grow up, yeah, that shit no fun
So when I get home, I'ma give you some
Make you feel like (Woo) when I hit that drum
Yeah, the dick ain't free, I don't give no fucks
Yeah, it's complicated, got you frustrated
Get home late and you don't trust me, baby
Way too drunk, you don't know what I'm sayin'
You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy
Complicated, got you frustrated
Every single night I keep you waitin'
You say you don't care, that's what you sayin'?
We both know that's some bullshit
Okay, we be fightin', we be reunitin'
Kiss me, touch me, tease me, me excited
God, the devil, who is who?
Tryna get through to you because...

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I can't keep on
Losin' you over complications
Gone too soon, wait!
We was just hangin'
I can't seem to hold onto
Dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losin' you

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Well
You can't go away, girl, I'ma need you
Play your games like they my ticket to an Ivy League school
Won't get Hall of Fame dick from a minor league dude
I just eat pussy, other people need food (Hahaha)
Only got a little time and I ain't tryna spend it
Arguin' about who ain't givin' who attention
Startin' up the engine, need to reboot
I just eat pussy, other people need food
And I use every bone in my body
Keep on holdin' on to your trust
I know you don't want nuttin' to do with me
But just one more time, let's make love
One more time, it ain't much, fuck 'em all, let's be us
Summer's soft sweetness
Call late drunk, you hang up
What a mess I made us, sense, I make none
It's complicated, keepin' me up late
Can't concentrate, you're always on my brain
If it's love, then why the fuck it come with pain?
I just think that's some bullshit
Okay, it seem invitin', trust me, she's a titan
This week she like him, next week they fightin'
Need protection, all your dresses bulletproof
You're safe with me, girl

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak &  Mac Miller]
I can't keep on losin' you
Where the hell you goin'?
Where you takin' this trip to? Wait!
Don't move, don't stay, too
I can't keep on losin' you
Where the hell you goin'?
Wait!
Where the hell you goin'?

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I can't keep on
Losin' you over complications
Gone too soon, wait!
We was just hangin'
I can't seem to hold onto
Dang
The people that know me best
The key that I won't forget, too soon
I can't keep on losin' you

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you
Can't keep losin' you

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Woo

[Verse 1]
Standing there looking at you from a long way
Passing me notes sayin' let's get gone
Class in session while we're in the hallway
Skip this class, let's get gone

[Chorus]
I'm rollin' this blunt up, baby
But touchin' your body feels like I'm high
Keep rollin' that weed up, baby
But touchin' your body feels like I'm high

[Verse 2]
And I ain't here giving this shit to nobody
This feeling that feels electrifying
I can feel it, baby, would you let me ride?
Feel it, baby, you on my mind

[Chorus]
I'm rollin' this blunt up, baby
But touchin' your body feels like I'm high
Keep rollin' that weed up, baby (Baby)
But touchin' your body feels like I'm high

[Verse 3]
Take my money, take my time
I've been off these streets, all damn night
Now it's time I get back to you
And this is what we'll do

[Chorus]
I'm rollin' this blunt up, baby
But touchin' your body feels like I'm high
Keep rollin' that weed up, baby
But touchin' your body feels like I'm high
Part I: I Told You

[Verse 1]
It's the year 2008, I'm getting kicked up out the crib
Steady contemplating where the fuck I'm 'bout to live
Mama died same year my sister had the kid
It was either feed the fam or get killed
So a nigga said fuck it
Five of us puttin' up for one room, landlord straight buggin'
Roaches on the ceiling, living room straight thuggin'
Should've been left but the trap stayed bunkin', nigga, yeah yeah, Big time, big time
Ring so swole you would think it did time
Swear I told you niggas for the fifth time
I'ma get mine, yeah
I got a ring so big, call the shit big time
She don't wanna fuck me, man, that bitch lyin'
I've been on the get a billion dollar, rich grind
In the studio, I'm skating like a inline
Sorry I went Kristi Yamaguchi with the dope
Teachers called me stupid, now I'm stupid with the flow
Stupid with the whip game, stupid bankroll
Stupid ass nigga, getting stupid paid shows
I've been on the road
Now a nigga know my way around, yeah yeah
Big time, cuban chain weigh me down, yeah yeah
Flying private, I could turn the plane around, yeah yeah
These niggas pissy that we stayed around, yeah yeah
Part II: Another One

[Chorus]
Hop in another one, nigga
Get back in another one, nigga
Then back in another one, nigga, woah
Hop in another one, nigga
We back with another one, nigga
Came back in another one, nigga, woah
I told, I told you all

Hop in another one, nigga
Then hop out another one, nigga
Then back in another one, nigga, woah
Hop in another one, nigga

[Verse 2]
My wrist is froze like Kristi Yamaguchi
Skating on 'em, Kristi Yamaguchi
We wash a nigga talkin' at us loosely
Skating on 'em, Kristi Yamaguchi
Uh, you love the sound, uh, don't fuck around, nah
458, I dropped it in the winter
Big homie asked a nigga what I'm down for
Looked him in the eye and said to do it 'til I'm bigger than ya
I'm whopping xans off, kicked out the house in Brampton
Had a nigga trappin' out in Danforth
Taking TTC to get the figures, just me and my little nigga
Ain't have no hittas with us
Was with the thugs, dealers, plugs, killers with slugs
All my niggas was plugs, all my bitches was dubs
Left me out when I was tryna make it did what it does
Can't forget about the drought when they put six in my plug
Only thing I gotta do is get my mom out the mud
Only thing I gotta do is get it poppin' and blow it
Only thing I gotta do is hit my wrist with the soda
Niggas thought it was over, but bitch I live by the slogan
I told you

[Chorus]
Hop in another one, nigga
Get back in another one, nigga
Then back in another one, nigga, woah
Hop in another one, nigga
We back with another one, nigga
Came back in another one, nigga, woah
I told, I told you all
I know I'ma get mine
I told, I told you all (Fargo)
I know, I know

[Verse 3]
It's a 70/30 chance I won't fuck with you niggas
It's a 70/30 chance I might fuck up them digits
In the bottom where them niggas they ain't fuck with you, nigga
Now you're up and they feel like they should be up with you, nigga
I remember nights when I was starving and hungry and ballin' and bummy
And busted cause my car wasn't running and woah
Doggy, all I want is a onion
The game it was callin' me audibly like someone confronted, but no
Niggas never gave a nigga nothing
Fuck I look like giving niggas something?
Made 100K this week, that's on my dead mama
Spend a 117 and I ain't even know it
Dawg I swear my coldest nights it wasn't even snowing
Mama told me since a youngin' I would be a soldier
I played the watch out on the block you used to see me scopin'
Respect the shooters that said "Youngin' go, we about to blow this"

[Chorus]
Hop in another one, nigga
Then hop out another one, nigga
Then back in another one, nigga, woah
Hop in another one, nigga
We back with another one, nigga
Then back in another one, nigga, woah
I told, I told you all
I know I'ma get mine
I told, I told you all
I know, I know

[Beat Changes]

[Verse 4]
It's the year 2009 and I done found myself a crib
I ain't got no dough, but I done found myself a bitch
Dollars and success is what my niggas tryna get
Young as fuck but fake ID gon' get me in the VIP
I done said fuck school, fuck the teachers and the public
I'd rather count this money with the thuggers and the junkies
The teachers used to tell me "Boy you ain't gon' 'mount to nothin'"
The only love I felt was from the dealers and the hustlers
We gon' do the most, so tell them niggas GABOS
Seen my nigga Harvey, he went and copped him a Ghost
Through the windshield, the centerfold on the door
Ten below on you hoes, getting dough on you folks
Getting dough on these fours, gettin' money it show
These checks are looking silly, I'm gettin' funny on hoes
Funny how I'm stuntin' in somethin' flooded in stones
Put them hunnids on hold, put them runners on go
Secure the bag

[Verse 1]
I gotta ask where you been hiding
You're like a tweety karat diamond
The finer things in life were shining
How 'bout that late night wine and dining?

[Pre-Hook]
You want that expensive clutch
And I'mma give that 5-star experience
Yeah, show you the kinda love
That you can only get when you give enough

[Hook]
I spend it all on you, baby baby, just watch
A BMW, a Bugatti, thick rock
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire
I'll spend it all on shoes for you, take your own pick
McQueen or Jimmy Choo and I'll get 'em real quick
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire
(That was perfect)

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna work it to impress you
Get you that dress and then undress you
Oh, we'll do things only the best do
Do what you want because I'll let you

[Pre-Hook]
You want that expensive clutch
And I'mma give that 5-star experience
Yeah, show you the kinda love
That you can only get when you get enough

[Hook]
I spend it all on you, baby baby, just watch
A BMW, a Bugatti, thick rock
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire

McQueen or Jimmy Choo and I'll get 'em real quick
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire

[Bridge]
Abracadabra, I got the magic
I hope you can handle
Living this lavish
Let's blow a zillion, zillion, baby
If you got a passion for fashion
Engines and platinum
I got the answers to questions
So let me tell you what's happening, baby

[Hook]
I spend it all on you, baby baby, just watch
A BMW, a Bugatti, thick rock
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire
I'll spend it all on shoes for you, take your own pick
McQueen or Jimmy Choo and I'll get 'em real quick
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire
A little bit of you, yeah
A little bit of me, yeah
A little bit of you, yeah
When I become a zillionaire
A little bit of you
When I become a zillionaire

[Verse 1]
What if I told you
You're like the bullet to my holster
Dangerous but I wanna hold you, baby
You're there when I go through the motions, you
What if I told you
I could sling you over my shoulder
Just like a shotgun to a soldier
I bought you all these guns and roses

[Refrain]
And baby, don't hold nothing back from me
I want all your guns and roses

[Chorus]
She shot me right down
She shot me right away
She shot me right down
She shot me right away
She shot me right down
She shot me right away
She shot me right down

[Verse 2]
What if I told you
When we make love it's like war is going on
Don't leave me wounded in this battlefield
This fight for love is for sure to prolong
What if I told you
You're my morning cup of Folgers
Would you sting me with the steam, baby
Or be my guns and roses

[Refrain]
Don't hold nothing back from me
I want all your guns and roses

[Chorus]
She shot me right down
She shot me right away
She shot me right down
She shot me right away
She shot me right down
She shot me right away
She shot me right down
She shot me right away

[Post-Chorus]
Don't hold
(She shot me right away)
Nothing back from me
(She shot me right away)
I will hold
(She shot me right away)
Your guns and roses

[Outro]
Don't leave me alone, baby
Shot me now I'm down weak
Don't leave me alone, baby
I'm alone and I need another round
Don't leave me alone, baby
Shot me now I'm down weak
Don't leave me alone, baby
I'm alone and I need another round

[Intro]
Give me just a little bit longer
Give me just a little bit stronger (Goin' down)
Give me just a little big longer
Give me just one more try

[Verse 1]
Uh, oh look at how these niggas tryna ho a young nigga
I came from the bottom of the O
Never had a pot to piss in but I had the stove and got richer
Nigga, you know what we doin', I've been hustlin' to get myself a Cuban
It was all about the butter, I ain't stutter, ain't no Ruben
I got lot of money in the Balmain
Mixing with the Zara anytime I'm steppin' on the go, dog
Tell me why these niggas always hatin', why I always gotta be the one catch it on the low, dog
Nigga down to hit it with the four, dog
Got some O dogs, gotta hit 'em with the road, dog
Double Cartier on my floor, dog
I could say it under oath, dog
Niggas already know
Been the realest, I'ma stay the realest 'til the day I go, dog

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me just a little bit longer
Give me just a little bit stronger
Give me just a little big longer
Give me just one more try

[Chorus]
I dropped us down in the Mulsanne, baby
I swear I always wanted one of these, baby
Remember when I didn't have a thing, baby
I swear man all I had to do was, all I, all I had to do was
Dream baby, dream baby, dream baby
All I had to do was
Dream baby, dream baby, dream baby
All I had to do was

[Verse 2]
Look at the flick of the wrist
I don't see you niggas getting no bigger than this
I got money and it depicting the pic
Women love to fuck a nigga, wanted the kid with the hit
Rollie with the black diamond got the ties in it
I got a first class ticket to put the pies in it
I put a couple of bitches in King of Diamonds
'Cause shit when a nigga ice hit the light it'll hypnotize ya bitch, uh
Niggas need to get they shit straight
Niggas need to get they motherfuckin' shit straight
Niggas love to say I’m broke, how?
I was running around 50 thou' plus a feature named Bieber on the mixtape
I got the glass walls for the crib's sake
I gotta hit her that'll make the crib shake
I gotta take advantage of the chance that I'm granted just to see these hatin' niggas make the sick face, oh
How you love a nigga?
It's either leave it or pimp it if she be fucking niggas
I keep a oven to open over these suckas
I ain't fucking with these niggas
That hated but they say they love a nigga, no
Ain't no time for cosigns
Niggas wasn't givin' it, these niggas was livin' it up
Droppin' the rock, I'm pickin' it up
Robbin' the game, I’m stickin' it up
Flow stingin' like spillin' perox, still in the cut
Still in the cut for niggas think I'm givin' a fuck
Not never, I'm probably the hottest ever
Years nigga, I been on this obscure level
That niggas could never meddle with
We are not the same that's why we could never settle it
Lambo dark gray metal tint, it's evident
I don’t wanna fuck with niggas I know I'm better than
So I think you niggas better just

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me just a little bit longer
Give me just a little bit stronger
Give me just a little big longer
Give me just one more try

[Chorus]
I dropped us down in the Mulsanne, baby
I swear I always wanted one of these, baby
Remember when I didn't have a thing, baby
I swear man all I had to do was, all I, all I had to do was
Dream baby, dream baby, dream baby
All I had to do was
Dream baby, dream baby, dream baby
All I had to do was

[Outro]
I said all I wanna do, is
Come up in that coupe
That new Wraith, it got the stars in the roof, ya bitch
All I wanna do, I said all I wanna do
I said all I wanna do (Shawty, know what I want), is
Come up in that coupe (I pull up inside)
That new Wraith, it got the stars in the roof (You know, you know what I want), ya bitch
All I wanna do, I said all I wanna do
I said all I wanna do (Shawty, know what I want), is
Come up in that coupe (I pull up inside)
That new Wraith, it got the stars in the roof (You know, you know what I want), ya bitch
All I wanna do, I said all I wanna do
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' 'round town
I've been rollin', cops patrollin', strollin' 'round town
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' 'round
I've been rollin', cops patrollin', we keep rollin' down
Part I

[Verse 1]

*Shots busting*

Part II

[Verse 2]
Me and the homie pull off the corner
Inside of a old Honda Accord
The feeling felt like a torture
The nigga that we just robbed just popped one in his shoulder
It led to me pulling over, to check him and tell him, dawg
Just take the passenger seat and I'll hit the road
'Cause it's way too many police out here to feel like we low
My back windshield broke and the driver seat soaked
From the blood that was previously leaking from his coat
We switch sides while I put this shit to drive
At 80 some odd miles, I'm shiftin the gear to 5
Hopin' that them 5-0 pigs don't see the ride
'Cause normally I ain't scared, tonight it's fear in my eyes
My phone blingin' 'cause my girl at home clingin'
And unaware of the problem this night on the road bringin'
Then I pick up the phone and tell her I'm speedin' home
As soon as I drop my dawg at the emergency room

[Chorus]
I wanna get them draws from ya
Tonight I'm goin' hard for ya
Tonight she takin' all of me, yeah
Fargo
I wanna get them draws from ya
Speedin' from the law for ya
We fuck like friends with benefits
I wanna get them draws from ya
Tonight I'm goin' hard for ya
Tonight she takin' all of me, yeah
Fargo
I wanna get them draws from ya
Speedin' from the law for ya
We fuck like friends with benefits

[Post-Chorus]
All night, all night
With your hands high, hands high
Screamin' fuck them girls, fuck them girls
On the other side, other side
Know that you been
All night, all night
With your hands high, hands high
Screamin' fuck them girls, fuck them girls
On the other side, other side

[Verse 1]
Ooh, you gettin' off work late, well it's okay
It's gettin'...
Ooh, you callin' all your friends
To get them ready 'cause you get...
So many Indica, so much endo smoke
It's hard to breathe
Ooh, you don't get this turnt, oh not usually
But today

[Refrain]
I just landed in MIA (MIA)
And she just fuckin' up a check (Oh, she do)
Got a nigga she don't gotta sweat (No, she don't)
Sad to know, I gotta say it (Sad, I know)
I'm bleeping out, I hit the beach now
From LA I gotta leave now
Just let me pop it 'fore I gotta jet (I gotta jet)
Girl, you got somethin' I just gotta get (I gotta get)

[Chorus]
I wanna get them draws from ya
Tonight I'm goin' hard for ya
Tonight she takin' all of me, yeah
Fargo
I wanna get them draws from ya
Speedin' from the law for ya
We fuck like friends with benefits

[Post-Chorus]
All night, all night

Screamin' fuck them girls, fuck them girls
On the other side, other side
I know that you've been all night, all night
With your hands high, hands high
Screamin' fuck them girls, fuck them girls
On the other side, other side

[Verse 2]
Ooh you always get me lit, that late, late night
'Cause you get...
Yeah, you leave the house party without your friends
Just to get...
So many Indica, so much endo smoke
I'm tryna rage
Said I got this feelin', and this shit feel great
So fuck what they say

[Refrain]
I just landed in MIA (MIA)
And she just fuckin' up a check (Oh, she do)
Got a nigga she don't gotta sweat (No, she don't)
Sad to know, I gotta say it (Sad, I gotta say)
I'm bleeping out, I hit the beach now
From LA I gotta leave now
Just let me pop it 'fore I gotta jet (I gotta jet)
Girl, you got somethin' I just gotta get (I gotta get)

[Bridge]
I can't just let you go
You're all that's on my mind
I wasted time, I know
Wish I could just rewind
While I was gone you left
Gone away for good
Least you could've done was let me know
Guess I misunderstood
This time I waited too long
This time the feeling's too strong
Anticipated too long
There's only one thing I want

[Chorus]
I wanna get them draws from ya
Tonight I'm goin' hard for ya
Tonight she takin' all of me, yeah
Fargo
I wanna get them draws from ya
Speedin' from the law for ya
We fuck like friends with benefits

[Verse 1]
So you took a chance with me 'cause you heard I'm cool
Well let me show you why what you heard is true
And you're supposed to feel like it's all for you
And this is what we 'bout to do here
I dance around my house to your favorite song
It's electrifying when you got my t-shirt on
And I wanna touch but I just stay cool
And this is what we 'bout to do

[Pre-Chorus]
It don't take a lot to keep it unpredictable
As long as you let me love your heart and touch your soul
And when you give it up to me, you give your all
'Cause all that I give in return is

[Chorus]
Cold, hard, hard love
Cold, hard, hard love

[Verse 2]
Put your records on, hot sex all up in the air
Wakin' up my fingers all up in your hair
Those eyes you do make my world blue
And what we 'bout to do is
Now take hold of me, baby, I feel it too
Never been this far from safe but I won't hold you
'Cause there's nothing left to hold true

[Pre-Chorus]
It don't take a lot to keep it unpredictable
As long as you let me love your heart and touch your soul
And when you give it up to me, you give your all
'Cause all that I give in return is

[Chorus]
Cold, hard, hard love
Cold, hard, hard love

[Verse 3]
Uh, what if I told you I ain’t know love
And all the chicks I'm with I don't love
Shit still getting harder for me when I'm trying to find it alone
But I know I'm supposed to be grown up
It might be time a nigga owned up for the shit I once did
Games that I once played, shit I once said
No one's turning back on me now
Don't turn your back on me now
I need you more than ever
You make me wanna put this TV off of sound
And pull these covers over us and take it slow forever
We go together, we so forever
Put the sunny in the stormy weather
I spent forever trying to figure out how I can fit up in your endeavors
You know I love you like a bow and arrow
Cupid shootin', who he aiming at?
Who laying the body down and where the statement at?
When love is lost who gonna show you where to claim it at?
You always told me you could show me how to claim it back, uh

[Outro]
Cold hard love
Cold hard love
There's nothing in this world that I
Nothing in this world, that I
Part I

[Verse 1]
Money on my mind
All the time, all the time, oh
Slangin', sellin', niggas tellin'
Catchin' feelings, on the low
Friends switchin', different women
With you every night, woah
Prayin', sinnin', sinnin', prayin'
That the Lord, take my soul
Money on my mind
All the time, all the time, oh
Slangin', sellin', niggas tellin'
Catchin' feelings, on the low
Friends switchin', different women
With you every night, woah
Prayin', sinnin', sinnin', prayin'
That the Lord, take my soul

Part II

[Intro]
Fargo
The wolves come out at night, nigga
Uh

[Chorus]
Dirty money, all I know is dirty money
Millionaire, 30 under 30 money
That my brother, but he down to murder someone
Jae my brother, but he down the way

[Post-Chorus]
It's dirty and I don't know where it came from
It's dirty and I don't know where the name from
New extended .30 in this hand gun
And touchin' millis ain't gon' change where we came from
I can't let no fuck niggas 'round me
I can't let no fuck niggas 'round me

[Verse 2]
Uh, my little nigga got a problem, we gon' go to work
I bent the corner in that 7, I was smokin' purp
He said he's 'bout to do a body told me hold his work
He nearly fell up out the window, had to hold his shirt, woah
I can't let no fuck niggas 'round me
Got this .30 and my young nigga 'bout it, yeah
Put that on my mama, I won't die no fuck nigga
When you start get commas, that's when they want fuck with you
When you starvin', who gon' come pick that re-up with you?
Niggas left you out for dead and never stuck with you
You had to feed the family, that's a first
Make them pussy niggas understand ya, that's a first
Rich and switch, 20 bands for a verse
Rich and switch, 20 bands for a course
I can't let no fuck niggas 'round me
But I'm 'bout it like these young niggas 'round me, yeah
Liberace steady drippin' off my wrist
Slip in Versace, then I mix it with the kitchen
I lost my conscious day I fucked up with them chickens
A lot of bread that we done fucked off on these bitches
I know it's wrong, I know it's wrong, I know I'm selfish
I see that Fendi, see Chanel and I can't help it
Got all this pain and I'm just tryna dodge the devil
We shot Diego then they gave Speedy double
It hurt my heart when niggas immigrated Karo
He down to let them bitches fly, no Furtado
He down to let them bitches sing, no vibrato
He gon' let them bitches

[Outro]
I got the liquor, the pour up, and shawty she got all the dope I could roll with
We run the city and I get the money from all the bitches I roll with
Hop in the Phantom, I hop in the Phantom
I hop in that bitch, I'm like woah, woah
Don't tell me you at it, don't tell me you at it
Don't tell me you back at that bitch, yeah
Yeah
I can't let no fuck niggas 'round me
I can't let no fuck niggas 'round me
For life, nigga

[Chorus: Brianna Cash]
Question is, can you forgive, baby?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
I love you from a distance
It got me so persistent
I love you from a distance
It got me so persistent

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
My shorty had an abortion for me like three times
As hard is that to say that to y'all
I think it's much harder to keep it silent
I hide emotion behind a face that's devoted
To only winnin' this race and this pussy, money, and violence
How could I be so selfish and need this time for myself?
Needing time for your health to recover, I'm on some other
I'm out there sellin' soap to these fiends, hopin' for dough for myself
23 like is there hope for myself?
'Cause if I never have a kid again, I'll be pissed but I deserve it
I been cursed with all these man-made ways
In this earth that I been livin' in
Sorry for the present problems that I put you on and get you in
Father God, take my soul if I can't play my role
'Cause I know what I'm doin', it ain't right, it ain't wrong but
In mid decisions, takin' life just ain't the way of life
'Cause day and night, I pray to Christ
In all hopes that you'll forgive me, shawty

[Chorus: Brianna Cash & Tory Lanez]
Question is, can you forgive, baby? (Yeah)
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Hopped off the phone with my dad, niggas barely do speak
But I'm sending Western Union wires every two weeks
I got a brand new brother and sister I never do see
He might call to send me a blessing and tell me do me
But shit, I been doin' me since 14
Four court cases, court scene, four courses caught clean
Corner boy fortune, unfortunate dope fiends
That got a nigga cuffed in the court with these lawyer fees
And I just felt the game callin' me "A"
Felt like Mitch in Paid in Full
In a world that's gon' pay me full
Dropped out of school, them teachers just called me "fool"
Packed the black bag up, I'm back on my bull
You always told me these problems would soon catch up to me
And shit is catchin' up and fuckin' me up
Fourth quarter hustlin', I'm 'bout to sell a three up
If the Ds come, I'm gone
Pop, please forgive me for this song, gotta understand

[Chorus: Brianna Cash]
Question is, can you forgive, baby?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
I really contemplated killin' you
Grippin' and cluthin' on side this pistol in my hand
Used to be my fam, dawg, you used to be my man
Solely out respect for your mom, I say your name, but I can't, look
Niggas would say they love and wanna kill you
This feeling's feelin' familiar, I felt it for way too long
Feelin' like the feelin' you felt was just way too strong
It felt like jealousy was just weighin' in on your dome
Should've cut ties, man I should've cut ties
Lord please, Lord please forgive my young eyes
I was young and unwise, I was just so naive
I was tryin' just believe, I was tryin' just perceive
But them niggas, they was greed, they was livin' outta greed
Now I'm livin' out a dream, cookin' kitchen outta steam
And you gotta feel me
Yacht master on a yacht looking filthy
That's why they do not feel me
You dig?

[Chorus: Brianna Cash]
Question is, can you forgive, baby?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent

[Intro]
You got ya mind rocked, rollin' down Loners Blvd
You've got dreams, keep on dreaming

[Verse 1]
High school team, never got accepted
Guess it didn't get to go how I expected
Now a nigga pissed
Steady lookin' at the bottom of the list like
"Where the fuck are my projections?"
Niggas like, "Next year Tory
It's all good, you'll be next year's story"
Then I said "Man, you don't even understand
Man, I'm droppin' out now, win it next year for me"
So I left, bus route to the bench down 53
Took the last dollar that I had for this dream
And I spent it on some 99 cents Micky D's
Shit wasn't doin' too fine
Then I made a call to this nigga named Rimes
Said he had a little studio and it wasn't top-notch
But could damn near do the whole nine
So I said "Cool," made a few songs in this shit
Stayed too long in this shit
But by the month, man, I was there so much niggas had to lay futons in this shit
Owe it to my aunt Suzanne
Drove to my first shows in your new Jetta
Always said one day I would be the man
I would just laugh like, "Who are you tellin', me?"
I'ma go far
I could still dream in this world full of stars
I could still scheme in this world full of narcs
If they could still scheme in them unmarked cars, so
I'ma dream, I'ma dream, dream
I'ma dream, dream like you said to me
Best words that was said to me
Best words that was said to me

[Chorus: Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Ten long miles, from a long way home
I'm headed downtown 'cause I'm workin' on this lil' mixtape
No fillers, no throwaway songs
Hopin' that this shit just go
Sadly for me, this shit didn't
So I make another mixtape and another mixtape and another mixtape
'Til them niggas start sayin' shit's hittin'
Then I meet a guy named Sascha
Tells me he's thinkin' 'bout takin' up management
Say he got a million dollar empire on his mind, he just need the artist to plan it with
He also say he throw shows out in Texas and maybe I should open up for one
And I say "Cool man," he books me the next flight out like I'm showin' up for somethin'
I land down in Houston around nine, warehouse live
Was my worst show ever
Niggas damn near got booed off stage
I performed like my first show ever
Women in the crowd wouldn't scream for a nigga
Niggas in the crowd they was kotched up down
Bad enough niggas let Bun B watch
But I felt like I let Sascha down, this shit was live on stage, dog
That night felt like a nigga had the whole world on my shoulders
Twenty years old tryna find a warm spot in this world gettin' colder
Then he came to me like, "Dog, I could put money on this, bet a hundred on this"
Gives me a few tips for the next night setlist
Says, "Dog, you gon' run it on this" and it all works out

[Chorus: Instrumental]

[Outro]
It's a big world
The bigger your dream, the bigger you're livin' it
It's all in your mind
Don't let nobody fuck up your high
It's a big world
The bigger your dream, the bigger you're livin' it
It's all in your mind
Don't let nobody fuck up your high

[Phone Voicemail]
Father, I lift up my son, I lift up anyone that travels with him and by his speed I pray that you go ahead of him...I assign angels right now to this assignment and I declare Father that they will go before you to make straight his path, I command that every crooked path would be made straight, every rough place would be made smooth, every obstacle, every barricade, every blockade, every conspiracy, every trap, right now is destroyed and removed out of his way in the name of Jesus. And I thank you that it is written that goodness and love and mercy, form all the things of our life...

[Intro]
Out of all the damn girls in the world, I done ended up with you
I'm talkin' all the bad bitches in the world and I ended up with you
Now I ain't still dwellin' on them girls but I know it's true
I could've been far along with someone else than you

[Verse 1]
Uh, and I wish there was a drug for this
But it don't seem to be no sort of medication
Even though we signed up for this
Ooh, I know it's gotta be a better way
We supposed to be
Lovin' but we fightin' over shit we shouldn't be
And I got a lot of girls that I could see
But you don't see...

[Pre-Chorus]
Out of all the damn girls in the world, I done ended up with you
I'm talkin' all the bad bitches in the world and I ended up with you
Now I ain't still dwellin' on them girls, but I know it's true
I could've been far along with someone else than you

[Chorus]
So I wanna love tonight
I wanna trust tonight
I wanna care tonight
You ain't been loved this good in a long time
I wanna love tonight
I wanna trust tonight
I wanna care tonight
You ain't been loved this good in a long time
I wanna love

[Verse 2]
Yeah, a nigga know a lot about it, yeah, a lot about it
Yeah, I had to take some time from it, yeah, I thought about it
Yeah, though I know you're wrong for the shit you did
I don't want you to get this wrong, you know you can always get this, wait
I been on a mission, dodgin' hoes and duckin' bitches
I ain't worried 'bout no fuckin', I know that shit come with ditchin'
Man, I been on the road, waitin' for some hoes
To come through to the condo, way up in Toronto
Let's get it poppin', ain't shit could stop it
I know I fucked up with them hoes, that shit was nothin'
So when I'm callin' up your phone, that late at night
You know a nigga wouldn't say it unless I say it right

[Chorus]
So I wanna love tonight
I wanna trust tonight
I wanna care tonight
You ain't been loved this good in a long time
I wanna love tonight
I wanna trust tonight
I wanna care tonight
You ain't been loved this good in a long time
I wanna love

[Verse 3]
I wanna love tonight
I wanna trust
I wanna care tonight
I wanna love tonight
I wanna trust tonight
Is there anyone tonight?
Who wanna love tonight?
I said who wanna love tonight?
Who wanna trust tonight?
Who don't wanna lie tonight?
Who wanna try tonight?
Who wanna care tonight?
Who gon' be there tonight?
Who gon' be by my side?
By my side

[Chorus]
Out of all the damn girls in the world, I done ended up with you
I'm talkin' all the bad bitches in the world and I ended up with you
Now I ain't still dwellin' on them girls but I know it's true
I could've been far along with someone else than you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ahem
Wayne's world, party time, excellent
She might be a tourist or a terrorist
A Hell's Angel actin' like she heaven-sent, Lord
We can go sight seein' and all that
She can be wifey and all that
She's the tourist, I'm her tour guide
Cause he just bullshit, I hit bullseye
The weed got her lightheaded, red eyes
I told her, "Don't worry, we stay high"
Plus there's a bed on my tour bus
So you can get fucked as we pull out, Lord
I pull out like skrrt in New Orleans
I pull up her skirt and get gnarly
She come to Wayne's world just to party
And all of my tourists is foreign

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (woo!)
(Bust a trip, come and be my tour—!)
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
(Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my for—!)
How does it feel, my nigga? (How does it feel?)
Damn, it feel great (damn, it feel great!) (straight up!)
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (ayy!) (straight up!)

Amen

I'm gone
Bust a trip and come and be my tourist

That’s not love
That’s not love
(On the real side)
That’s not love, (You dig)
Not real true love

[Verse: 1]
Snakes in the grass, so I stay on the pavement
Survived the battle when Adam was a cavemen
And dead animals and dead men
I’m all in and my only friend is Amen
Keep your mouth closed, you wanna know why you die?
The answer’s right under your nose
Expose to the streets, in the game I don’t cheat
I had to play my position, get MVP
I get money don't shit come free
It's my life and i'm runin' even with numb feet
Keep my business in my pocket, don't wash with bleach
And I never show my hand, not even to me, you see

[Hook]
That’s not love
That’s not love

[Verse: 2]
Look, as the crooked world revolves
Love spelled backwards is evolve
The evil spelled backward was just live or live
And When death comes you better have life to give
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs
And rats die ugly, die with kids
These niggas stitchin' and still livin'
I hope my words are like razor's to them bitches
Niggas pretend like they there to dig in
But when they go down and fuck around and be them
That blood live for millon when it's leakin'
If you scared go see a deacon, nigga
That ain't love

[Hook]
That’s not love
That’s not love
1 Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers
That told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin'
In front of that called the police on me when I was just tryin'
To make some money to feed my daughter
To all my peoples in the struggle, you know what I'm sayin'?
8 It's all good baby, baby, check it

9 It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl

13 Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade

17 Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
21 Now honies play me close like butter played toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak

25 Livin' life without fear
Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school

Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood

30 We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirsty

34Damn right I like the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all, it's all good

I'm a trap nigga and I need trap pussy
Had a white bitch but the ho kept snitchin'
Pull up in a Benz, you Uber in a Civic
No fingerprints but I finger bang the pussy
Flipper, I'm Gucci, I'm Louis, I'm Groovy
Your homie, your girlfriend's a groupie
She opened up her mouth so wide, scary movie
Went to 7-11, she beggin' for a slurpie
Fuck her in the car, drop her off at Wendy's
Ride no tint, I just seen the enemy
It's 2 AM, somebody got shot
When niggas gettin' money, niggas wanna call the cops
I get it a lot, I get it a lot
I'm lookin' like a dope dealer, fresh off the pot
Lobster tail for my eighties bitches
Fat Burger for my nineties bitches
Don't be trippin' you get all the attention
Them long ass legs but the pussy terrific
I must admit it, put my tongue up in it
Ocean's eleven, the pipe be leakin'
Ice cream man with the sprinkle filling
Make my bitches sisters, now we call them "Pippen"
Maestros, I'm the master splinter
Dick too big, told her scream in a pillow
Fuck it, I'm illin', fuckin' sicko
Super model, she a super nympho

[Hook]
I'm a trap nigga and I need trap pussy
I get it a lot
I'm a trap nigga and I need trap pussy
I get it a lot...trap pussy
I'm a trap nigga and I need trap pussy
I get it a lot...trap pussy
I'm a trap nigga...yeah...
I'm a trap nigga and I need trap pussy

[Verse 2]
Cherry on top, whip cream in the middle
Expect like a tempo, I'll put two in your temple
Pimpin' our mental was easy like rentals
My car game, drive away like limos
I told the bitch, don't come back
If the check ain't twice what I spent on gas
Fifteen thou for the private jet, don't gasp
I like my new bitch but the shit won't last
Ha, I'm just being realistic
Get dick, get dismissed, it's just business
Personal, we don't get intricate
Shout out my ex, I been meeting bitches
Yeah, I put that on wax
You a rat, it's a trap
Cheese bar at the bank, I snatch
Brand new, I still wear the tags
She lookin' over here like daddy back
I'm the ghost daddy, ride the Phantom black
Ha, Santa black, my gifts in fact
Pussy and gats within her 

[?]
Fucking her tummy flat, skeet on her back
Eww, nasty nigga, stay with the raps
Never chase that bitch again
Ha, fuck it then, let's get it man
Put you in your place like Running Man
Bitch I'm the shit, had to shit on 'em again
Haha, and again

[Hook]
I'm a trap nigga and I need trap pussy
I get it a lot
I'm a trap nigga and I need trap pussy

We've been around the world 305 times
Going for 306

[Verse 1: Mark Morrison]
Ever since you went away
My life ain't been the same
Even though they know my name
They don't know full my pain
Cause you were the best I had
Even though I did you bad
You know I loved you bad
And now my life is sad
The things I said to you
The things I made you do
When you said we were through
Why didn't I stop you?
From going out the door
Instead I (?)
And I don't know what for
Cause now I miss you more

Spotted you on the beach, she the baddest on Collins
Making love in my Phantom, all the things she would holler

One kiss and she feel the fluid
Now you runnin' with winners where all we drive is the newest

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
They know I'ma ride with you
Pull up on the avenue in something hardly average
Hope I got no problems with you
Cause I know to bag mine like Ralphs at the fast line
Seventy for a verse, bought a purse and a feature
Shawty said she love my long hair, look like Jesus
I blow through the hundred pack with you baby

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]
I still run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
You never stuntin' 'til you met a nigga like me
Don't you disagree, I gave you everything you need

[Post-Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I run through a hundred pack with you baby, baby, oh
Keep it nine, keep it ninety nine degrees, keep it a hundred
I don't want a cheap bitch whinin' 'til she hit a hundred
We get bitches by the dozen, we get bitches by the dozen
That's my breezy, breezy, breezy, that's my breezy that's my buzzin'
Threw the racks for the chains and the watch came flooded

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]
I still run through a hundred pack with you baby

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I made you look better than you was
Run up a stack thicker than some Bloods
Took you straight out the hood, took you out the mud
Just because
You a young hustler, I love how you get it
Go get it, you'll watch how I flip it
You see how I did it, but that's history
You get a million dollar kiss from me
You a diamond, every other bad bitch in this world is more just like a six to me
So come and be rich with me, ride on a Six with me
I run through a hundred pack with you just to let you know that I'm with you

Keep it nine, keep it ninety nine degrees, keep it a hundred
I run through a hundred pack with you baby
You never stuntin' 'til you met a nigga like me
Don't you disagree, I gave you everything you need

[Chorus]
Don't you need me
Oh baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise

[Verse 1]
Baby, now my head is on backwards
And my feet at funny angles
And every time I take a step
We're moving forwards faster
And lately, I can't take it
Baby, now my body's intact and
In an ordinary fashion
And everything I tried to leave behind
Is still beside us
And lately, I can't take it

[Pre-Chorus]
Leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
She's broken but she's fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar while she's getting blazed

[Chorus]
"Don't you need me
Oh baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise"

[Verse 2]
Lazy, and lying on your belly
With a Super Porp cola
Looking at your phone in clothes
You've worn for three days over
With a cookie as a coaster
Maybe, I wish I could remould you
To vertical and golden
But you turned to Styrofoam
And so it hurts to say it's hopeless
And we ain't gonna make it

[Pre-Chorus]
Leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
She's broken but she's fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar while she's getting blazed

[Verse 3]
She's drunk on old cartoons
Liquid TV afternoons
Sometimes it makes me laugh
Sometimes it makes me sad

[Chorus]
"Don't you need me
Oh baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise"
"Don't you need me
You baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise"

[Outro]
Oh, baby, now my head is on backwards
Mmm, baby, now my head is on backwards
Oh, baby, now my head is on backwards
Mmm, baby, now my head is on backwards
"Don't you need me
You baby boy?
'Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise"
(Troubadour, troubadour, troubadour)

The troubadour, the troubadour
Sings from his heart, the song that's the hit of the show
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar
Alone in the bright spotlight's glow

The song was for someone he loves so true
Who loved him and left him for someone new

The troubadour, the troubadour
Smiles as he sings, but his heart is breaking in two

(Troubadour, troubadour, troubadour, troubadour)

They begged for more, the troubadour
Sings once again, the song that's the hit of the show
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar
Alone in the bright spotlight's glow

There is a hush in the darkened hall
A few hearts are heavy and teardrops fall
But in the crowd one head is bowed for the troubadour
And oh her heart aches most of all
Troubadour, troubadour
Her heart aches most of all

(Troubadour)
Past Virginia down from Maine
It's a rolling wild terrain
Three thousand miles of shore
Just like three thousand years before

Then the hills begin to rise
Like they almost touch the skies
From the flat black delta land
To the singing Kansas sand

Down from the desert heat I see
Keeping it ours forever free
From sea to shining sea

God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good
With brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
I’ve always been the other guy. Grass, always greener on the other side, besides girls tell lies to their boyfriends and wives tell lies to their husbands. They never ask why. Don’t give a fuck about the opinion of a side nigga. Don’t waste time on sophisticated lies. For What!? They never cry, when I fuck another bitch. They never lie, when they suck another dick. I’m just a side nigga, no feelings, creeping in. No bitching in my ear when they bleeding
Her man on the phone crying from home, I’m just hard dick that she gets on the weekend, when their beefing. We never fuss their always beefing. If we creeping, we freaking. While we fucking, listen to the Weeknd, do drugs. Good girls, love thugs. Hit clubs out of town because her man just a local nigga, Lame Nigga.  I move around. Never met him but sounds like he’s a clown
Lately we’ve been fucking a lot more frequent. She mentioned yesterday through text work is causing stress. I guess that’s why we’re having sex on a Tuesday, I need to wipe down, my dining room table after 3 shots of Johnnie Walker Black Label

LIFE AS A SIDE NIGGA, I’M TO YOUNG FOR REAL LOVE
LIFE AS A SIDE NIGGA, I GUESS ONE DAY I’LL FALL IN LOVE, BUT NOT TODAY
LIFE AS A SIDE…

Her best friend just broke up with her boyfriend. She caught him cheating. Now she’s grieving. Feeling stupid, breathing hard, they want a threesome. They call it freedom. I never judge 'em. We do it often. Bursting in 'em. Leave it in gang. All she really wants is loyalty, to spend time, and good dick. We take pics
I’m the man  on Instagram. I take her shopping, not because I’m tricking, but because I’m better than that lame nigga. I’m not going to front, I caught feelings, and it’s appealing to have the appearance of a girlfriend without the title or the obligation of a boyfriend. I’m getting free pussy that brings more pussy. Can you dig it? I can dig it

LIFE AS A SIDE NIGGA, I’M TO YOUNG FOR REAL LOVE
LIFE AS A SIDE NIGGA, I GUESS ONE DAY I’LL FALL IN LOVE, BUT NOT TODAY
LIFE AS A SIDE…

Lately, her sex game been crazy, feeling hazy from the weed smoke. Still choke when she deep throat. I leave it in every time, and then one day she tells me one day that she’s pregnant with my baby. I can’t believe that she’s having my baby. She looks at me, looking mad; laughed, said I’m killing this baby. I knew what it was and I didn’t love her but, the bitch just killed my baby and I can’t forgive her. Now I’m scorned. I don’t hate women, I still love them but I can trust them, so for now on I’ going to fuck, and say fuck him

This girl was Pilipino just imagine what our baby would have looked like.  I could have had a Filipino baby mother. Life az a side nigga. Damn! Life az a side nigga
You get mad at me and go hang out with that skinny bitch, her boyfriend, and his homeboy, I'm putting a bullet in all yaw

You always gotta take it there
You always gotta take it there. You need to stop drinking

Look babe, you don't buy these bottles

Omni!. Either you leave the streets alone or I'm leaving you alone

My girlfriend bugging. Fuck that bitch. I’m hood-rich. Why she tripping, I'm hood rich? She always bitching. Never listens when pimping talking. Now I’m walking to the car, stumping. Chip on my shoulder. She stressed me out. I leave the house. I don’t play nice. No therapist. When I’m pissed the therapy is shopping. I’m a moody nigga. Sales girls check out my physique (I’m a sexy nigga). No cards. I pay cash, they check out my receipt. She make me mad so I cheat. Don’t believe in karma. I remember what Common-sense said. Young girls with week minds but that their butts strong. It make my dick hard. I write rap songs. Smoke bongs. No job. I ‘m a member of the lonnnng dick club. Nice to meet you. I might eat you. I might treat you to a pill or 2

A shorty, what time you get off? You ain't gotta catch the bus. Come fuck with us

Bobbie kitty, what that pussy like? Play nice and I might just smack your ass. Roll this grass. Take a drag with me. Shake your ass. (You going to eat this pussy, or what?) Girl, I might just eat your ass. I’m bad boy because I’m mad. I like new cochie, but when I’m done, I miss bae. I should stay the night. I got a point to prove and can’t lose. Bae hit my phone. Quick, Come home. I need you. (Come home quick! I need you! Come home quick! I need you!)
Quick bird bath, now I'm driving down the highway 3am on Monday. Chest-necked. Check the record. Best drunk driver in my city. Doing a buck-5o easy. Still not swerving. Just passed the po-po so, slow down. Too late now. They on the kid. Can I live? Drunk driving, plus I’m black while driving

They coming. They coming for the kid. Got two kilos and some bread and the cops just pulled up. What the fuck!? They wanna take my bread, and hit me in my head, wit, some years that I ain’t trying to do. They wanna tell me, sit your ass down in a whole in the ground. I need to know I can count on you

They coming. They coming for the kid. Got two kilos and some bread and the cops just pulled up. What the fuck!?

Why you pull me over pig? Is this your car? Yeah it’s my car. Is it registered to you? Yeah it’s registered to me. Give me your license and registration I ain’t giving you shit. Now, why did you pull me over? Because you got a warrant for child support from 2014. Get the fuck out of here. And you’re license is suspended. I don’t need a fucking license. Get the fuck out the car you fucking deadbeat

Luckily I know 4 women that work down the bookings. 3 of them good looking. Shout out to the C.O’s that fuck with a nigga. Shout out to the C.O.’s that a fuck a nigga
Welcome to the future, the wonderful future. Kids don’t talk to strangers. Strangers be careful, the kids a shoot ya. It’s simple. Written on the walls of temples it told the future. It talked about creatures, with human features. Human artificial. I got no issue with scriptures. Your interpretation though, it’s bullshit. Your religion, garbage. You talking nonsense. Hit it or miss, you need people with pistols @ your residence. Can’t trust the government underlings. (The truth is evident.) Rumblings in my stomach make me realize President whoever, can’t do shit for me! I’m a highly melaninated and intoxicated, and opinionated. You can’t do shit with me. My mixtape is the best thing since fried chicken. I put a panic pack inside my piece pipe and smoke it. Grow magic mushrooms inside horse shit. Fuck the government! Fuck the police! Fuck that bitch, that burned me when I fucked her. When I see her I’m a smack her

This is the future, It’s not what they promised. It’s what THEY wrote about. Welcome to the future. The wonderful future. I’d like to introduce you to the future. My present

They talk about the coming time. Well, the time is come and in the meantime, the dreamtime, was fun. Grab your guns. Feel your lungs, with weed smoke. Don’t choke. Yeah I know. It’s hard to do that. I grab a hood rat and ghetto gag her. Why? It’s fun to do that. They recognize my face but not my name. Change the game, maybe my ambition is getting paid and getting laid in the shade in sunshine in the summertime in the winter time. So I grind out and Stack my cash. Until I find out, what to do with it. It’s a code to the streets. They ruthless in the boardroom. Don’t trust ‘em, like hoes in a bedroom. I don’t love ‘em. Protect yourself. I’m going to use this big dick like a big stick and paint the whole world black and brown again. I’m fucking everything!

This is the future, It’s not what they promised. It’s what THEY wrote about. Welcome to the future. The wonderful future. I’d like to introduce you to the future. It’s my present

If a hen went inside the oven and had some babies would you call them biscuits or chickens? Are we niggas or Africans? The foundation starts before the basement. That’s one to play with. You think cash is king? Guess what? They taking shit for free, nigga. (I want you to come for me) You chose religion I chose to be God. It’s Hard. I know nigga. It’s easy to sheep. It’s hard to be free. Pussy talking to me, said “Come inside me.” Vesica piscis. I might just do that. It’s fun to that. Condoms are evil, don’t let the media deceive you people. I wonder how Zumbi, would feel if he could see me now. Rappers want to be crowned King, sound like clowns to me. We have all the freedom in the world. All the pretty girls of the world wanna be my lady, have babies. I could fuck this world BLACK & BROWN. They fear the future. Their future now

This is the future, It’s not what they promised. It’s what THEY wrote about. Welcome to the future. The wonderful future. I’d like to introduce you to the future. It’s my present

Now I told you one and I told you twice
This is my motherfucking life
Sly, working at the DMV
Bitch who are you? TMZ?
I can’t breathe with you on my neck
Better get a hold or the team on deck
Call me, complaining, draining a nigga
With this raining, for the maintain
I left out the back door
And met lil’ mama on the down low
And I slid to the restroom
And found out you was next door
Cheating in the next room
Who am I to play?’
And what am I to say?
Fading away like a DJ
Really don’t give a fuck bout what she say

[Hook]
It’s not a secret (it’s not a secret)
It’s just not none of your business (not none of your business, bitch)
Not much difference (not much difference)

Round and round we go
Where we’ll stop, nobody knows

Guess she tried to play me
I ain’t crazy
Look here baby
Hoes don’t phase me

She looking on my Instagram trying to get some info
Started off a cool bitch, now the bitch is a nympho
Crazy friends go coo-coo for the Cocoa Puffs
Smoking on that kush, she got fucked up
Hitting my followers, stalking on my females
Crazy bitch be lying all about our details
Fake pics that ain’t you, damn she worsen
Tryna fuck again but bitch I ain’t nervous
What’s mine is mine, find out you want
The conversation, kick bitch, you just word
You ain’t learned your lesson
Second guessing your homie

Come show me just what you can do

So come with me tonight boo

[Chorus]

Sexuality

[Outro]
Wanna see you baby (sexuality)
I want your sexuality
I want your sexuality
I want your sexuality

[Verse 1]
I exist as an explorer
Inspired from the winds enchanted, organic intent which caresses the aura of life and its winding roads
My home lies within the confines between the earth and the atmosphere’s ozone
A nomad on the roam I walk through the park
Acknowledging tree shades, light to dark, and my mark can’t be measured by miles or kilometers
My dreams I reach pinnacles of infinite heights, spiritual flights, cause’ i'm a wanderer
Possessed by an infinite journey
I go with the pace of my heart, my metronome is not in a hurry, life will surely lead you in the right direction
My soul is the compass of my intuition combined with reflections makes up my perception
I fly on the back of the sky, surfing on the thought plane
A matter inspired by my ancestors lives
So high, you don’t know where you are
I see the goose prairie with my family
Contemplating the stars on our backs
This is not about where you want to be, but where you’re at
And if you know that, and simply follow your own map?
Reality is an effect
So don’t believe everything that you hear
I ponder the thought of life in other unseen atmospheres
Anything out of the ordinary is considered weird
I try to stay clear of them Earthlings and their peers
Trying to find thoughts fountain
With a backpack and a notebook, I sit on top of the olympic mountains
Negative thoughts, I drown them ascending the trail
Winding around the curves of rock, plotting the scale of destiny’s surface
I will never fail
But my purpose is passed with worthless merchants and their distracting urges
I meditate to the medicinal music
Produced by the choir of tropical rainforest animals
Aware that I am only a student
The classroom of mother nature is the only witness
But life can leave you in an instant
And in the forest, it’s the survival of the fittest

[Verse 2]
Traveling, babbling to my self
Not knowing where I am going
I follow the river that is showing me direction
I expand over the universe and converse with heaven
Hovering over gravity’s dimension
Feeling freedom and justice
I metamorphosize
As a Native American
Hijack the Santa Maria and assassinate Columbus
Transcend my being back to present time
Sit on the porch with my parents and converse about life in the sunshine
Abort my mission for another expedition
Listening to birds cipher in tree tops as I beatbox to their wisdom
I stand on sacred ground that is engraved
For all the fallen journey men who pave the way for the present day
I stand alone with only my echo trying to act brave
Deciphering graffiti hit it by the Americans who decide the adventures in K
I puff on the peace pipe and watch the smoke sway
Aware that one day we will all pass away
But until that time
I will sit at the sea side
Unwind and continue to write rhymes
I’ll praise the most high
Without that spirit, life would have no light
The guiding force that shines bright
Giving travelers their navigational insight
With my walking stick, I spit licks
Hop over the present and watch the apocalypse erase this in the year 2006
Back to the 206
Hop on a bus to the 604
Like a show in fourth world
Having them screaming for more in the front row
Remain humble
I transport to the Grand Canyon with an eighth of 'shrooms concealed in my jansport
I report into my notebook as the remedy
Conserve my energy into painting the present
Remembering the memories
Always remain in forward motion
I hold the pen of eternity as I script to the sound of the waves formed from the ocean
Swim to the pace of the harmonic embrace
Tectonic plates shifting a subsonic rate in the Earth’s outer face
Changes like the seasons
I converse with Orca whales about existence and the reason why we fight our own kind when we all are breathing
A traveler who is with the everlasting journey and I’m leaving

[Verse 1]
If you were standing on a corner with no money in your pants
And life fell apart, I'd hold out on my hand to you
The best and the worse things in life come free
But you can think of me as your best guarantee
It's true, I'm here for you
And if you just breathed your last breath
I'd give you my air 'til I had nothing left
I'd never let you go
If you were on the edge of a bridge
I'd push you to live
I'm your parachute, don't you ever forget
And if you get the chance to return the gift

[Chorus]
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

[Verse 2]
Like a child underneath the light, afraid of monsters in the night
I'll hold you 'til the dawn, 'til they're gone, no fight for you
I'd fight for you
When you're drowing in your tears and no one answers your prays
I'll be the boat to keep you afloat, my dear
And if you get the chance to return the gift

[Chorus]
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

[Bridge]
When you're alone in the darkest nights, I'm there for you
When you feel like you're about to cry, I'm there for you
I know you got so much strength inside
If I ask you would you save me tonight?

[Chorus]
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

[Verse 1]
I've never asked to define our time
It's understood
So crystal clear
When your eyes lock mine
We so connect
But we're almost scared of it
So no strings attached
Is where it's at..
For the moment

[Chorus]
So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night (woah oh oh)
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I play cool
Like i've met a hundred yous
And for tonight
You're just right
To be the one I use
But you break me down
I forget the games I play
Oh you wrap me up
In your arms and I just.. melt away

[Chorus]
So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night (Whoa, oh oh)
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night

[Bridge]
Oh if I could freeze this moment
In my heart shaped locket
Wear you around my neck
So you won't be forgotten
I would, I would
Oh if I could tell you everything
I feel for you baby
Spill my heart out on the floor
And have it be reciprocated
I would, you know I would

[Chorus]
So just relax
Baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night (woah oh oh)
Undo my dress, let down my hair
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Oh baby relax
Oh baby lay back
And let's just
Spend the night, spend the night
Undo my dress, let down my hair (Oh if I could freeze this moment in my heart shaped locket
And let's just wear you around my neck so you won't be forgotten
Spend the night, spend the night. I would, I would)
Woah oh oh

[Verse 1]
As time passes, I feel so low
Searchin' for pieces, covering up the hole
I'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul
I'll throw all of my cares away for you
I'll be there to wait for you
Maybe you weren't the one for me
But deep down I wanted you to be
I'll still see you in my dreams
All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you

[Chorus]
So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me

[Verse 2]
Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh

[Chorus]
Coasting, roller-coasting
In my emotions, oh
I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
I noticed you weren't the one for me

[Outro]
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
Weren't the one for me
You weren't the one
You weren't the one for me
So don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me

[Intro]
Dark mascara dripping down my face
Only fools could ever feel this way
Send my message into outer space
Wonder if it's gonna float your way

[Verse 1]
I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear out my mind
But it's difficult, so difficult

[Pre-Chorus]
Houston, I know there's a problem here
Must be a hole in the atmosphere
Baby, I wanna be closer to love

[Chorus]
Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon

[Verse 2]
Last night I was in your arms so strong (It felt so good)
One small step and, baby, you were gone
Now there's meaning in the saddest songs (I just wanna cry)
All I do is cry and sing along (And cry, and cry...)

[Pre-Chorus]
Drinking alone in my party dress
Would you come back if I looked my best?
Put on a smile and I say to myself (I said it again)

[Chorus]
Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon
Moon
Moon

[Bridge]
I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear up my mind
But it's difficult (why is it so difficult?), so difficult
Château Marouatte
Il m'amène au lieu du chevalier cet hivers
Cinq, quatre, trois, deux, un

[Chorus]
Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon
Moon
Moon

[Intro]
Yeah, we're going to Brit's Valentine's party next weekend

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again

[Verse 1]
I have been known to mess around in the past
This time, I promise I'm real
But I look out my eyes and see some pretty faces
And I'm not sure what to feel

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You got this cute little face and a cute little accent
Want to put you in my pocket, cause you're such an attraction
Lost inside a toy store, and I'm getting distracted
So please help me out, don't think I'm being dramatic
I can see this handsome teddy that I'd knock over there
With the big brown eyes and the curly hair
I want to go and check him out, but I know it's not fair
I need to get out of the room, need to clear my head, oh!

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again

[Verse 2]
Now, please don't think that I am having second thoughts
You know that we are meant to be
But when I look around and see these other faces
It's so appealing to me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause I remember last year, sitting there on the sofa
Got my heart broken when I moved a little closer
And a year later, yeah, we're still together
Cause I patched up the scratches and my heart got better
Now I'm looking around and I feel a bit strange
I can hear these other teddies always calling my name
They say they'd buy me lots of presents and they'd push all my buttons
But I can't tell them all this trouble's gonna burst my bubble, uh-oh!

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again

[Bridge]
I wish I could be like a Barbie doll
She's got one man meant for her
She doesn't have to choose, she's not gonna lose
Ken's the only one for her
I wish I could be like a Barbie doll
She's got one man meant for her
She doesn't have to choose, she's not gonna lose
Ken's the only one for her

[Breakdown: (Bridge + Chorus)]
I wish I could be like a Barbie doll
She's got one man meant for her
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again)
She doesn't have to choose, she's not gonna lose
Ken's the only one for her
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again)
I wish I could be like a Barbie doll
She's got one man meant for her
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again)
She doesn't have to choose, she's not gonna lose
Ken's the only one for her
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again)

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm falling in love again

[Intro]
Just luv me (Just luv me)
Just luv me

[Verse 1]
I'm not gonna ask for a sip when I'm thirsty
And you don't have to hold my hand when I'm hurting
Won't make you sober me up when I'm turning
And you don't gotta say it, I know that I'm worthy

[Pre-Chorus]
You could ask me for a sorry
And a calm before the storm
Ask for pieces of my body
Until all of it was yours

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me, just luv me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just luv me, just luv me
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me, just luv me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just luv me, just luv me, just luv me

[Verse 2]
If you think that I'm saying it because I'm high maintenance
Like I'm trying to mask every problem that I'm facing
Well you're wrong cause I don't need nobody when I'm breaking
All I need is your luv and a little bit of patience

[Pre-Chorus]
You could ask me for a sorry
And a calm before the storm
Ask for pieces of my body
Until all of it was yours

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me, just luv me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just luv me, just luv me
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me, just luv me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just luv me, just luv me, just luv me
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me

[Bridge]
Oh no, I won't, I promise, I promise
Oh no, I won't ask you for nothing
Oh no, I won't, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me, just luv me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just luv me, just luv me
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me, just luv me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just luv me, just luv me, just luv me

[Outro]
Oh no, I won't, I promise, I promise
Oh no, I won't ask you for nothing
Oh no, I won't, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me (Just luv me)

[Verse 1]
I think I see confetti from this potion
Pillow fights and feathers, overdosin'
Smells like a cologne and candy lotion
Like a slumber party
Sheets all on the floor just like an ocean
Building up your fortress like a mountain
Neighbors say we're causing a commotion
Like a slumber party

[Pre-Chorus]
No one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonigh-igh-ight
Oh baby, no one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause we got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party
Like a slumber party
Like a slumber party

[Verse 2]
Let's fill up this clawfoot bath with bubbles
Loving me so hard it's causing trouble
If there's seven minutes in heaven make it double, triple
Like a slumber party

[Pre-Chorus]
No one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonigh-igh-ight
Oh baby, no one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause we got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party
We got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
(Crazy, go) Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party
(I go fucking crazy)
Like a slumber party
A slumber party, yeah

[Interlude]
Like a slumber party
No one but, no one but you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight
Like a slumber party

[Chorus]
We got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos (our own videos)
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party
We got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go fuckin' crazy, go
(Go crazy, yeah) Go crazy, go
Like a slumber party (a slumber party)
Like a slumber party (I go crazy for you)
Like a slumber party

Say you feel alone, that your day was the baddest
Tellin' me you can’t sleep because of your mattress
Do you wanna come over? (Yeah)

Let me rub your back, you can set limitations
Honey, if you want, you can get out frustrations
Do you wanna come over? (Just let me know)
Do you wanna come over? (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause nobody should be alone if they don't have to be
Nobody should be alone if they don't have to be
Nobody should be alone if they don’t have to be
Should be alone if they don't have to be

Or we could be good and do next to nothin’
Do you wanna come over? (Yeah)
Do you wanna come over? (Yeah, let me know)
'Cause all I want is what you want
And all you want is me
Yeah, all you want is what I want
And all I want is you (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause nobody should be alone if they don’t have to be
Nobody should be alone if they don't have to be
Nobody should be alone if they don’t have to be
Should be alone if they don't have to be

Come over? Uh huh
Do you want to come over? (Uh-huh)
Come over? (Uh-huh)
Do you wanna come over?

[Verse 1]
You evoke the feeling
This feeling I've been dreaming of
I'm ready to reveal it
Let inhibitions come undone

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes or no, but no maybes
Not gonna beg, so don't make me
Yes or no, but no maybes

[Chorus]
Here's my invitation, baby
Hope it sets us free
To know each other better
Put your love all over me
Here's my invitation, baby
Come feel my energy
Give emotions to each other
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over

[Verse 2]
I know it might seem crazy
But I'ma put you in this blindfold
I just need you to trust me
Oh, that you see more with your eyes closed

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes or no, but no maybes
Not gonna beg, so don't make me
Yes or no, but no maybes

[Chorus]
Here's my invitation, baby
Hope it sets us free

Put your love all over me
Here's my invitation, baby
Come feel my energy
Give emotions to each other

Feeling something, kinda thinking out loud
Feeling something, kinda thinking right now, right now
But we could be right, right now, right now

[Chorus]
Here's my invitation, baby
Hope it sets us free
To know each other better
Put your love all over me
Here's my invitation, baby
Come feel my energy

All my life they told me bout a creature so hypnotic
But I guess I never thought it was true (Yeah)
And now that I've seen you I've turned into a believer
Baby, so much for what I thought I'd do (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Since I tasted you I got a craving
Shaking in the heat of the night
Oh yeah, baby, you've got me misbehaving
And I don't even know what is right

[Chorus]
It's just so hard to forget ya
It's just so hard to forget ya
It's just so hard to forget ya
It's just so hard to forget ya
It's just so hard to forget ya

There's just something about ya
Something about ya

We're stuck here forever
Something about ya, 'bout ya
Something about ya
It's hard to forget ya
We're stuck here forever
Something about ya

[Verse 2]
Eyes locked on your body, sexy features, so iconic
And I just can't keep my fingers away (no)
Your love got me faded, keep it going, let's get wasted
Baby, so much for my poker face (oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Since I tasted you I got a craving
Shaking in the heat of the night
Oh yeah, baby you got me misbehaving

It's just so hard to forget ya

[Bridge]
Ah, there's something 'bout you
There's something 'bout you
(When I think about it)
Nobody can do it as good
(When I think about it)
I keep running right back to you
(When I think about it)
A lifetime just won't be enough
I need more, more, more
It's hard to forget ya

[Chorus]
Something about ya
It's hard to forget ya
We're stuck here forever
Something about ya, 'bout ya
Something about ya
It's hard to forget ya

I got what you want, I got what you need
Bringing out the fire inside of me
I got what you want, I got what you need
Bringing out the diva that lives in me
I got what you want, I got what you need (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got what you want, I got what you need (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
One time just ain't enough, won't let this fade
I got that good, good stuff you can't erase

[Pre-Chorus]
Give you what you want, I'm a certified special
Run up in your home, lay your bed with petals
Nothing here to hide, want you 24/7
Keep you satisfied, be your new obsession

[Chorus]
I got what you want, I got what you need
Bringing out the fire inside of me
I got what you want, I got what you need
Bringing out the diva that lives in me
I got what you want, I got what you need (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got what you want, I got what you need (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
My love don’t 9 to 5, to satisfy
Guns off to the finish line, it's winner's time

[Pre-Chorus]
Give you what you want, I'm a certified service
Run up in your home, lay your bed with petals
Nothing here to hide, want you 24/7
Keep you satisfied with your new obsession

[Chorus]
I got what you want, I got what you need
Bringing out the fire inside of me
I got what you want, I got what you need
Bringing out the diva that lives in me
I got what you want, I got what you need (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got what you want, I got what you need (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Don't know just what you started
Take a chance, let me roll the dice
No risk cause you know I got it
Slight of hand, let me blow your mind

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo

I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you

Baby, I got what you, baby, I got what you want
Baby, I got what you, baby, I got what you want
Baby, I got what you, baby, I got what you want
Baby, I got what you, baby, I got what you

That was fun

[Verse 1]
You say we don't talk anymore but
I'm thinking we talk too much
Whenever we speak we fight so
Come talk to me with your touch
You're playing with fire, and you like it
A little bit dangerous

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Round and 'round we go ‘til we fall like dominoes
I know

[Chorus]
My baby gon' love me down
Gon' love me down, gon' love me down, yeah

We're better just skin to skin
I'm treating you real, real nice now
We'll finish and start again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Round and 'round we go 'til we fall like dominoes
'Til we can't see straight no more
I know, I know (I know, baby)

[Chorus]
My baby gon' love me down
Gon' love me down, gon' love me down, yeah

[Verse 1]
See I be gettin' to it, gettin' to it
Come to these broads I be stickin' movin'
Don't ever talk it, if I didn't do it
I'm ridin' round, bumpin' on some new shit
Looking for a bad broad to cruise with
Come and kick it with a winner
No, we never losin'
I'm a call some of my dawgs, call them girls you cool with
I ain't nothing like them niggas cause they all illusion
I'mma roll some of this weed put my car in motion
Now we roller coastin'
Tell me I'm the one you need
Well, that ain't hard to believe
Hit this chronic then we leave
By now you probably wonderin what tricks I got up my sleeve
Cause tell me how you want it tho
And I'll slow down the speed
I open up the roof and drop the top you feel the breeze
Yeah I'm young and successful
But I made it out the streets
I'm throwin all my funds
And make it back in a week
You need to roll with me
You the baddest, to say the least

[Hook]
Shorty, whats good?
If you down, we can ride out to the hood
I'm tryna meet her, when you meet me like I should
We got you on, so you meet us   understood, it's understood
It's all good! I'm tryna leave with the baddest one in there
Top down riding round through the city blowin loud while we screamin
I'm tryna leave with the baddest one in there
Top down riding round through the city blowin loud

[Verse 2]
Major player, major paper
You with a money maker

Take you out get you flyer than a pilot, babe
I ain't running game no this ain't the same
I'm tryn put you in position to do bigger thangs
Everything in your name
Let your homegirls hate
Niggas try, but they ain't gettin in a way
I've been workin all day, now I'm dressed, tryn make a play
Wonderin if she leave here or she gon' stay
I'ma let you push the whip, to the crib, while I twist
Say you stoned so Im gon' take this one to the face
Niggas tryn win the race, I'm just tryn get you laced
Take her right up to my place
Bring the bottles by the case
Roll the chronic, have a taste
I ain't got no time to waste

[Hook 2]
Shorty, whats good?
If you down, we can ride out to the hood
I'm tryna meet her, when you meet me like I should
We got you on, so you meet us   understood, it's understood
It's all good! I'm tryna leave with the baddest one in there
Top down riding round through the city blowin loud while we screamin
I'm tryna leave with the baddest one in there
Top down riding round through the city blowin loud

[Verse 1]
Ah ah, a-a-a-a-ah
A-a-a-a-a-ah, ahh
Trying to think of a way to get started (hehe)
Stutter my flow, train of thought just departed
Taste of Mezcal on my breath
Let me get this off your chest
Open my mouth, all the gems falling out
Make you lose control

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, I've got that silver tongue
Got, got that silver (ah)
Silver tongue (hey)
Drives you into delirium
Got, got that silver (uh)
Got that silver tongue like (o-o-oh)
I'm addicted to madness, but what can I say? (sa-a-ay)
I'm addicted to badness, but what can I do?
I got my silver tongue (hey)

[Verse 2]
Ah ah, a-a-a-a-ah
A-a-a-a-a-ah, ahh
Clothes on the floor, but the bed's on the ceiling
Slurring my lines, but I'm nailing the meaning (uh)
I'll say what you want me to say
But talk only gets in the way
Rolling our eyes, no more words to describe how we
Lose control

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, I've got that silver tongue
Got, got that silver (ah)
Silver tongue (hey)
Drives you into delirium
Got, got that silver (uh)
Got that silver tongue like (o-o-h)
I'm addicted to madness, but what can I say? (sa-a-ay)
I'm addicted to badness, but what can I do?
I got my silver tongue (hey)

[Bridge]
(Na na na)
I've got nothing on you
And all the things you do (oh)
(Na na na)
Yeah, I've got nothing on you (ah)

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, I've got that silver tongue
Got, got that silver (ah)
Silver tongue (hey)
Drives you into delirium
Got, got that silver (uh)
Got that silver tongue like (o-o-oh)
I'm addicted to madness, but what can I say? (sa-a-ay)
I'm addicted to badness, but what can I do?
I got my silver tongue (hey)
Ah ah, a-a-a-a-ah
A-a-a-a-a-ah, ahh

[Verse 1]
I'm a lazy lover
Undercover
Wasting time
Then one day this summer
I changed my number
To cut my line

[Chorus 1]
Good love is on the way
I been lonely but I know, I'll be OK
Good love is on the way

[Verse 2]
3 years broken-hearted
But now her ghost is finally gone
I'm done with broken people
This is me
I'm working on (because I know)

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[x2]
Good to go for wherever I'm needed
Bags are packed and I'm
Down by the door
You can take all the tricks up my sleeve
I don't need them anymore

[Chorus 1]

[x2]

[Instrumental Break]
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
I'm not up to something funny
I just want to know you girl is all
You've got to know baby
Everybody's free sometime
You've got to know baby
Everybody's free sometime
Could you get to spare a moment?
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Friday night you're busy; something else to do
Saturday you're sleepin'
You've got work on Sunday too
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
I'm not up to something funny
I just want to know you girl is all

[Instrumental Break]
Keep the motor runnin'
Leave you're jacket on
If I had my way you would be drivin' home at dawn
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
I'm not up to something funny
I just, I just want to know you girl is all
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
Why won't you come baby?
Why won't you come when I call?
I'm not up to something funny
I just, just want to know you girl is all

[Instrumental Break]
They tellin' lies on Hot 97, that's how it goes
I told 'em fire Funk Flex, then I'll come and do your show
Plus me and Kanye, we just left out of the studio
My first night in the Garden, I'm feelin' like D. Rose

[Verse 1]
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi roads
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

[Verse 2]
Yeah it's, "Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now"
Fightin' words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi roads
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

[Bridge]
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know

[Chorus]
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi roads
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
The way I talk

[Intro]
Ugh
No we will not
Ugh, no

[Verse]
No we will not stand here in silence
While they take the lives of our brothers and sisters and partnas
We will not turn a blind eye to the murder with no repercussions
Oh no, we will not
We will not live on our knees, we will die on our feet
This ain't no lie that I speak
All you youngin's out here in the streets only wanna shoot people who look like you
You can stay home, you too weak
Oh no, we will not go and repeat the mistakes of the past
Ignorin' the snakes in the grass, payin' you cash
Still we pray and we fast 'til one day that's your ass
We will not ask for no war
No-no-no-no-no-no, but we will be prepared for one
Hopin' not with a gun
With the unity, using the same shit you did to destroy me
We sick of the garbage you kickin' and teachin'
And lynchin' us, lockin' us up for no reason
And killin' us, no consequences, convictions, you serious?
Lyin' about what you show in the media
Assassinate all the leaders who leadin' us
Leave us with ones who misleadin' us
Then go and reward all the ones who mistreat us
And leave us in projects and give us these poisonous products
On top of narcotics to push to our sisters and brothers
Like them ain't our sisters and brothers
No we will not be run amuck, led astray
Or bamboozled, the buck'll be stoppin' today
See what happen when athletes'll no longer play for you
Tell them accountants to pray for you
On respect or just respect what that paper'll do
Look up, it too late for you, droppin' you off
Turnin' them profits to loss when we won't go shop in the mall
United we all, stuck in this bullshit together
Showin' these folk we just won't take whatever
Or else they just roll up and shoot up whatever
Just like they've been doin' forever
The niggas swear they hard be huffin' and puffin'
But ain't gon' do nothin', the enemy try 'em
They wait behind enemy lines
Why you tryna be so friendly now? Handle your business now
And we won't fear nothin' but judgement from God
Standin' there lookin' at me sayin' you ain't do nothin'
I bless you when you ain't invested in nothin'
Just kept up the cycle of death and destruction
Ignornin' your neighbor won't help him but helpin' yourself
Just like the devil himself, hmm
Promote all that fornication
All that baby makin', ain't no baby raisin' for a generation
Now they trapped in systems cause incarceration
Was inevitable due to education
Substandard institution never cared
J's drop, buyin' every pair
Crack rock, crip, blood, all the 80
GDP and whatever else separate us
Hip-hop, king you finally made it, your time to take it
Pass Martin Luther, all that money and you still blew it
Didn't save and you feel stupid, ITunes came and they bootleggin'
What you get for bein' hard headed? God damn nigga
Might as well gon' and go to hell nigga
Cause I tried as hard as I can nigga
I know you only a man but God damn nigga

[Outro: Malcolm X]
They don't scare negros today with no badge, or no white skin, or no white sheet, or no white anything else. They police the same way, they put their club upside your head and then turn around and accuse you of attacking them. Every case of police brutality against a negro follows the same pattern --- they attack you, bust you all upside your mouth and then take you to court and charge you with assault. What kind of democracy is that?

[Intro: (Shabba Ranks sample)]
What a dilemma!
It's a Shabba ting!
(Trailer load, trailer load, trailer load, trailer load, trailer load (2x))
Yard and foreign kick up!
Bruk whine!
Sing!

[Verse 1:]
Bring up the menu, tell me if you love the features
From the haircut straight down to the sneakers
Turn up the swagger just like the speakers
Whether ragga ragga or neaters the creatures
Well if you like stars, me bring you the sequels
Or even TBS for real funny comedians
Parental discretion is strongly advised
But your past 18, so its not illegal
Me really waan you come rewind pon me gyal
No true me say gyal, you a wife material
Dem a say
How da youth ya sound familiar?
A di same youth weh sing fi di cheerleaders

Hear boom riddim, hear boom riddim
Booyaka! Booyaka!

Ting-a-ling-a-ling
Dancehall a swing
Dj ears cock up when him hear boom riddim
Hear boom riddim, hear boom riddim
Booyaka! Booyaka!
Boom boom riddim
Booyaka! Booyaka! Boo-Boo-Booyaka!

[Verse 2:]
Pull up at di gate inna di double seater
Everything fresh, you nuh see no repeaters
Capture her eyes like Jeepers Creepers
Say she glad seh she find me, finders keepers
She tell me she rate me, as di real dad
So she waan follow me just like procedures
Me full a action like Steven Siegel
She request a cup a tea, because she feel bad
Me ba-ba-ba beat it like a steel band
She want me fi stay from dusk until dawn
Me call her baby, she call me King Kong
Stay tuned for the next program

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Dem say, "Killa, weh you name?, weh you come from?"
I know Miami it no sound like no England
But it nuh matter cause a me make di hit song
Di kids dem, a sing along like a Chipmunk
Some say hip, some say hop, some say urban pop has arrived
Some say O.M.I
OMI!
Haha
And if you fall from the stage
It's no disgrace
If you survive than so can I
Haha, Yeah

[Repeat Hook]

[Repeat Verse 1]

[Repeat Hook]

[Outro:]
Trailer load, trailer load, trailer load, trailer load, trailer load (6x)

[Verse 1]
Got a call from my friend
She saw my picture again
In a magazine
We laughed out loud
'Cause she said, "Remember when this was all a silly dream?"
Now I wake up every day
In a different city
A smile on my face
Somebody pinch me
She said "All the world's a stage"
But girl you know
Those cameras and lights
Won't ever change me

[Chorus]
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

[Verse 2]
It's amazin' to hear people singin' along
Hear the radio playin' my song
I still get butterflies
Still get nervous inside
In the spotlight

[Pre Chorus]
Now every now and then
On a Friday night, cruisin' down to the dive bar
We waste the night away
Spend saturday sleepin' in late
Yeah, those were the good days

[Chorus]
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door

[Pre-Chorus]
And even when I'm miles away
I'll always have the roots from where I came
'Cause when it all fades away
My home will still be the same
Ooh

[Chorus]
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I...

[Verse 1]
For my theme song (black)
My leather black jeans on (black)
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on (black)
Enter the kingdom (black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in (black)
Came to see him and his black kin (black)
My homie was number one draft pick
They still burned his jersey in Akron
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Saying he overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

[Chorus]
Four in the morning, and I’m zoning
Think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
Baby we livin' in the moment
Baby we livin' in the moment
Baby we livin' in the moment

[Refrain]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go down
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control now
And nowhere to go now
But there's no way to slow down
Runnin' outta time
Just close your eyes and enjoy the crash

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 2]
Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Mess up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' it
Them niggas ain't doin' it
What do you say to a masked man
This Inglorious Bastard that’s rapping
We might have to burn this whole shit down
Like the theater that Hitler was trapped in

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
300 girls, and we know it
300 girls, and I'm zonin'
Baby, we livin' in the moment
Baby, we livin' in the moment
Baby, we know it, keep it goin'
Keep it goin', keep it goin'

[Refrain]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go down
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go now
And there's no way to slow down
Runnin' outta time - movin' fast
Just close your eyes and enjoy the crash

[Verse: Toro y Moi]
I think I've gone and lost my mind
Thinking way too much
Even when there's time
Welcoming confusion
When the wheels touch down
Pass on public transit
Cause there's too much sound

I overuse my jet-lag lie
Feeling so accused
Wasting most of the night
Eyes are crashing like a wave
Feet are heavy now
I am a walking cliché
I think I'll stay inside
Think I'll stay inside

[Outro: Toro y Moi]
I say bye
And goodnight

[Verse]
Put her on a plane, fly her out to spain
Berry, girl you my main she with me when I hit stains
Together we make it rain
In the winter we hop on a jet get MIA
And in my A where we stay
In our palace where she'll lay
And I work hard and then we play
Make soo much money we'll be straight for days
Straight for days
I'm her baller, she's my model
We be together forever till we both turn fossil
She's my dream girl, she's my dream girl
She's my dream girl
Where are you now and where to be found
I heard you got a man, but that nigga a clown
He not fly, can't show you 'round
Take you to the town
He can't make you happy
Maybe it's me, hell nah it ain't me
I'm too fleek, not tryna sound cocky
But baby come be with me
You're my goddess in all my dreams
So when I go to sleep I don't wanna wake up
That's why I pour soo much purple in my cup
Your my baby and I need your love

[Hook]
You're my dream girl, you're my dream girl
You're my dream girl, you're my dream girl
Together till-
You're my dream girl, you're my dream
You're my dream, you're my dream girl
You're my dream girl

[Bridge]
Put her on a plane, fly her out to spain
Berry, girl you my main she with me when I hit stains
Together we make it rain
In the winter we hop on a jet get MIA
And in my A, and in my A
And in my A
Baby girl you're my dream girl
And in my A
But, you're my dream girl
You're my dream girl
And in my A
Put her on a play, fly her out to spain
You're my dream girl
I'm her baller, she's my model
You're my dream girl and in my A
Where are you now?

[Verse]
Put her on a plane, fly her out to spain
Berry, girl you my main she with me when I hit stains
Together we make it rain
In the winter we hop on a jet to get MIA
And in my A where we stay
In our palace where she'll lay
And I work hard and then we play
Make soo much money we'll be straight for days
Straight for days
I'm her baller, she's my model
We be together forever till we both turn fossil
She's my dream girl, she's my dream girl
She's my dream girl

[Verse 1]
I don’t need a lot
But there's one thing
Love has taught me
It’s to never expect too much
Don’t need a believable touch
I just need you
I just need you
And I might, I found life
Why should we be wasting time?

[Chorus]
You don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view

[Verse 2]
Think of a quiet beach
Think of how the waves crash down
Think about a summer’s eve
No offense to them but they ain't got nothing on you
Walking with you
In the light or in the dark
Well nothing shadows who you are

[Chorus]
And you don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view

[Bridge]
I look outside the window
Everyday see something new
But all I ever wanted was a
Window looking at you, at you

[Chorus]
And you don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
You don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view

[Verse 1]
Aye, yeah, aye, whoa

Aye, hold on, aye, yeah

Pull up in a cannon you can check my gangsta grill

Pop it at your noggin if your pussy ass squeal
Hold on, bitch I do this shit for real
Boat from the six or, I ball like a sixer

Hold on, no face, no case
Yeah aye whoa damn hold on

[Interlude]
Yeah, I'm fuckin' with this shit

You feel me?
Just like that

[Verse 2]
I might drop fifty thousand on a necklace
I don't give a muthafuck cause I'm reckless
Middle fingers to a cop I could give a damn
Young nigga, I might pull up in that goddamn
What the fuck
10 bands spent on a hummer truck
Told that bitch to back it up
Yeah whoa goddamn
Check a nigga wrist, nigga keep lucky charms

Pimp-pimp hooray

Classic Timeless rules forever

[Talking]
By the time I start writing when I was thirteen I knew from the jump I wanted something that was original that was classic

[Freestyling]
I freestyle over anything give me a instrumental
I bet I make bells ring
I bet I make birds sing
It sounds that good
I'm so street and I'm so hood
And I'm intelligent and I'm special and I'm heaven sent
Haha
When you think about rhymes and style you always want a classic feel so my first introduction to a classic shoe was the moment I stepped in school and said, I want to put something down on paper. I started writing. Everyone in the classroom was wearing Reebok classics

Hip-hop was more than just the music. It was part of culture. It was part of havin' style it was part of a whole graffiti and arts

Hot off the press
Hot off success
Look how I dress free, me
Reebok complete

[Verse 1: Shake070]
Don't play wit me, long as I'm honest
Don't get too close, baby I'm toxic
Need to get the racks and the bread up
Living like a slave and I'm fed up
If my niggas ever low, tell 'em get up
Me and my crew
Know a couple things we could do
You, never satisfied with the truth
You, everything you do is for you
Only really care for a few
Oou, Follow you to the bathroom
No, Quick climb inside the bathroom
Don't worry, I'm right behind you
Don't got no time for distractions
Don't got no time for no acting
You say you working, you lacking
Action action, baby I need action
You're fine with relaxing
Baby, find a passion
Then you'll understand me, oh

[Hook: Shake070]
Uptown got a nigga so throwed
I'll be back soon girl before you even know
We gon' make it but we gotta lay low
Spit fire wit my heart so cold

[Verse 2: Shake070]
I'm just trynna get it wit my real ones
Sip a lil', puff a lil', baby feel some
We don't really give a care if you feel us
This is war baby, only for the killas
Business, baby only for the dealers
So blueprint, if you trynna build us
Lemme see your armor girl, if you trynna shield us, baby
And you don't see the vision
And you don't ever listen
So, I'm gon' make you mess up, ooh

[Hook x2]
Uptown got a nigga so throwed
I'll be back soon girl before you even know
We gon' make it but we gotta lay low
Spit fire but my heart so cold

[Verse 3: Shake070]
You don't really understand, hit the door
Heater crib, but my niggas on the floor
Feel a lil' cool, pop one, took four
Shorty came through, I think I need a lil' more
Act like I don't know
What you did before
When I said just go
You said that for sure
Did your thing but said you weren't ready though
Did me wrong, expecting me to let it go
I said I couldn't make it
And you just get upset
And my niggas they just get it
Drives you crazy cause you let it
And I never get the credit
I already fucking said it
Hurtful words and I regret it
You just tripping cause I meant it
And I don't got the time for this
I'm working on myself and shit
I don't got the energy
Girl I need a line for this
Everything so tight
I don't got time for you to try to fit
Take this and just try a bit
Let it drip, sink it in, get a grip, get it baby, keep on dancing
Bring it low and take it far
Love it baby, find a passion, take it in and love it up
Truth be told, I lied to you
Wrong for me to ignite the blues
We'll take control and light a few
We cannot make it righter, no
Same old thing, with the same old words
Let it out bang, bang
Let it hit, then I skid
Got you rocking with the beat
Can you love me for me
Can you let this be us
Cause my dreams are a must
Just, me and my, me and my

[Hook: Shake070]
Uptown got a nigga so throwed
I'll be back soon girl before you even know
We gon' make it but we gotta lay low
Spit fire and my heart so cold

Uptown got a nigga so low
Uptown

[Outro: Shake070]
There's beauty in the chatter
So baby you whatever
Not really trynna settle
This love thing is a setup
UPTOWN

[ Verse 1 : Lil' Fame ]
Why y'all niggas is sis' to fuck with Lil' Fame
I analyze the streets, spit real game
I'll blast on you as you pass on through
Catch you right where you stand put your ass on you
I remind niggas with that blue steel that you rip
And the rush that you felt from the nigga that you hit, now
How many niggas wanna ride with me, collide with me
Be accessories to homicide with me 

[ First Family! ]
Who I hang with, bang with, spit flames with
The hand full of niggas that I came with
I ain't tripping, I know you got a hell of a plan
For the man if you ever caught me slipping
You will stop me, won't you, pop me, won't you
But you know I'll whoop ya motherfucking ass bitch, don't you
My family strong, your moms don't need so stop breathing'
Before you cats and you ass get deleted

[ Chorus 2x]
Look, ain't nobody stoppin' this here
You'll see it, it's on and poppin' this year
Mound up (Mound up!) Pounds up! (Pounds up!)
We build this foundation, from the ground up nigga

[Verse 2 : Billy Danze ]
Stand up faggot, I'll let you have it where you post at
(William Berckowicz!) Back with my golden fiend and Womack
(BLAOW!) Nigga hold that, Juliani can't control that
(We buss outta clutches on Magnum triggers) He know that
With the same cats that blaze DAT's on the boulevard
We remain strapped, then came back, doin' it hard
So send your soldiers cobra and I will send everyone of 'em back
With holes under they' hat, falls of through they' back
Damn with it motherfucker (BK!) All day real with it motherfucker
I'm not your average, I'm from a block where they trap cops
And made 'em holler ten-thirteen
It's the commander, Danze, hands, down
You need to know who you fucking with now
Now kill-a-kill again, with an unusual will to win
An unusual will to sin, stop fucking with me

[ Chorus 2x]
Look, ain't nobody stoppin' this here
You'll see it, it's on and poppin' this year
Mound up (Mound up!) Pounds up! (Pounds up!)
We build this foundation, from the ground up nigga

[ Verse 3 : Lil' Fame ]
It's an every day thing in a every day game
More day every day, motherfucker bang (BANG!)
It's the streets in me, and me, I'm staying tuned to this shit
It's music to my ears, I'm immune to this shit
I'm suffering, from a disease called 'Leave me the fuck alone'
In this full blown (blown), bitch
M.O.P., prepare for the ruckus
And we murder-murder-ma-murder-murder you motherfuckers

[ Verse 4 : Billy Danze ]
Allow me the way out, down out, pull my gun out
Run out in the middle of a street light (Bum, bum bum)
Ah, there you go, bastard, murder international, custom main caskets
Now could any of you cocksuckers turn to me
The way this streetgame is going is concerning me
Whatever happened to the old days
We all blaze, we all study criminal ways

[ Chorus 2x]
Look, ain't nobody stoppin' this here
You'll see it, it's on and poppin' this year
Mound up (Mound up!) Pounds up! (Pounds up!)
We build this foundation, from the ground up nigga

[Verse 1 : Big Punisher]
Hey yo it's all love, but love's got a thin line
And Pun's got a big nine, respect crime but not when it reflect mine
The shit I'm on is wrong but it lasts long
Pull a fast one, then Pun'll wake up, with the stash gone
I'm mad strong, and my cream is fast
Smoke the greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass
And a taste legit, I don't have to waste a whole case of Crist'
All it takes is my pretty face and my gangsta wit
Lace the click, cause we all share
It's all fair like love and war, thug galore with the long hair
Big Pun, Pun the name that makes the kids run
Like spelling murder reverse it deliver redrum
Come one, come all, if you wanna brawl
I'm the mighty Thor clotheslining motherfuckers like Steven Segall
Cause all you gonna get, is your ass kicked or up in a casket
That's it (that's it?) That's it

[Verse 2 : Cuban Link]
Punisher bash it, at last it's, rappers that really blast shit
Cats getting Big Willie niggas like Billy Bathgate
Up in Jimmy's Cafe, havin caviar
Crackin Cristal at the bar, smokin cigars, livin large
We rob and steal, run with the mob, doin jobs for bills
I'm hard to kill for real nigga guard your grill
I like to chill, spark an L and get high
I'm one hell of a guy, fly pelican fly

[Verse 3 : JuJu]
Whattup Duke-o, you know, politickin papi chuco
I'm out here, watching for Jake, getting this loot though
Shoot bro, I got a waterproof suit yo
Swervin like a A.K.A. in Beirut yo
Squeezin, out of automatic M3's and
Please, you ain't seen no thugs like these
I can tell you lots of things that'll make you believe
In Corona yo it's better to take than to receive

[Verse 4 : Psycho Les]
Your career's on life support, and I'mma pull the plug
And have every thug shootin that Beatnut drug
In they blood, no escapin this
Niggas is goin over their favorite shit (for what?) to be tapin this
World premier, loud and clear
La and beer, get the dough, blow up the show
Disappear, jump in the Cavalier
Feelin marvelous, street pharmacist, twist arboles
For pleasure, bring your territory terror
Keep my workers under pressure got em sayin "FUCK LESTER"
But that's aight Duke-o, my heart nowadays too cold
Don't give a fuck where you been what you done
Where you go, you know, peep this statement
In black shades like a secret, agent
We're night thieves, roll up on you like sleeves
We light trees, bust these and stack cheese

[Chorus 2x]
It's off the hook this year
Makin mad money off the books this year, ain't nothin
But crooks in here
Gettin mad money off the books this year

[Verse 5 : Guru]
Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
Cause in the night you'll feel fright
And at the sight of a four-fifth, I guess you just might
Wanna do a dance or two
Cause they could maybe bust you for self or with a crew
No matter if you or your brother's a star
He could pop you and jet without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But he's sticking you and taking all of your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame from the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain that the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way he'll have the chain on his neck
Claiming respect, just to get a rep

[Produced by MF DOOM]

[Verse 1 : Ghostface Killah]
Both hands clusty, chilling with my man Rusty
Low down, blew off the burner kinda dusty
The world can't touch Ghost, purple tape, Rae co-host
Monty Hall expo, intellect, you read pro
Son trifling fuck, wildflower on the cycle and
Picked up the broom thought I was Michael-in'
West Brighton Pool, now I'm into Iron Duels
Turn Nuns to Earths Whoopi, she at Allah school
Inhale break beats of hell A-Alikes propel parallel
Duracell knot, you flash a burnt cell
Snap out of CandyLand kids, the old rumor is
Blacks become immune and shit, we never did
Like eating dead birds, trust the pharmacy over herbs
Men marrying men, ill they got the urge, pulsar
Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter, living off land
You god damn right I fuck fans, king me
Check checkmate props like the micro chip founder
Neck to neck stock with Bill Gates now

[Bridge]
When we hug these mics we get busy
Come and have a good time with G-O-D
Make you snap your fingers or wiggle
Scream, shout, laugh or just giggle
Shake that body, party that body
Don't fuck with Ghost you'll feel sorry
That's word, I'm not the herb
Understand what I'm saying, saying, saying

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Hit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert
Let off the Eiffel, burn a flag in your grass, spiteful
Ringleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter
Culprit, prince of the game wish you could see us
We lay low glitter wax full bangles
Priceless ropes, lay around the God get tangled
Woolly hair, eyes fiery red, feet made of brass
Twelve men following me, it be the God staff
Move, every script's like Miramax
Smash the big boy, totalled it, Wilshire and Fairfax
Son beaming wifey on the beach, sipping Zima
Wu 'binos, to latinos, we love Selena
Overnight, God schedules, Fed-Ex
Pretty soloette velvet nice DNA scroll genetics
Too hot, to handle one thought from scrambling the mandolin
Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack 'em, say when
He rolling up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts
Yo kid stop fronting on the ground 'fore you get touched
It's Canada Dry sess with Allah, son
We want rye, we want it so bad we might cry

[Verse 3 : Cam'ron ]
Yo, I don't understand how these cats sip daiquiris
Like it's all good down at the hit factory
Be on 54th, whole clique backing me
All that click clackery takes your wrist wrappery
I ain't no rapper, b, I skeet Uzis
And I can't act, turned down 3 movies
So gimme your chain, your jewels and your cash
And your fast food, I'll eat your food fast
My rude ass, carries 3 weapons
And I'll give your face a c-section and keep stepping
Who else in a hurry to mirk
We kill girls, rape em', bury their skirts
Imagine me wake up 7:30 for work (what?!)
I'd rather run the streets 730 with work
But met this knucklehead, thought he want a order
Came and asked me stop pitching to his daughter
Y'Serious? This man can't be
Be glad I'm not in her damn panties
Got a damn handy
How you going to ever ask stop carrying candy
I'm going to sell to anybody in your damn family
Your Uncle Tom, your Aunt Tammy, your Grandmammy
Your right hand man Randy, understand me
In Atlanta I got an outlandish land piece and a matching land
Desert-colored: Sandy

[Hook]
You know the one with the whips, THATS ME
The one with the chips and the chips, THATS ME
The one with the toast, pants saggy, yelling out get at me
Get at me, nigga, THATS ME
The one that be running and dodging, YOU
The one that be sucking mad dick, YOU
The one that's scared of some yay yo
Always wanna lay low, cause your girl say so, YOU, biatch

[Verse 4 : Cam'ron ]
I could show you some ice
Throw you advice
You not that good dog, who told you you're nice
Ay, yo your crew, switch siders
When I come through, hey Cam
Dick riders
But I only mess with Navigators 528
6 drivers, big buyers, where you live we live liver
Come through, stick your suppliers
Mack so many hoes, dick in saliva
Gash her up, ma, put it on you mouth
Then I grab her neck and try to take her tonsils out
And I don't got beef, I don't play those games
If I did though believe me I would say y'all names
Go to your house, red dot scope your crib
Smack your earth, snatch your seeds, choke your wiz
My crew split it was my mistake
But to my nigga Duke we all make mistakes
I'm going to get shit right if I spend my cake
Jimmy, I'm a get you up out of 5h
This is for my niggas that load the pipe
Saying I'm the best just not promoted right
You know my life
Drink, smoke, roll some dice
Control the hiest
Know I'm a patrol your schiest
We all get schiest

[Produced by MF DOOM]

[Verse 1 : Jeru The Damaja]
Now, I don't push a Lex
Others had their turn to flex, Jeru is up next
All these so called players up in the rap game
Got brothers on the corner selling cooked cocaine
It used to be LaToya and jim hats
But now it's Uzis, Macs and G-packs of cracks
Everybody's psycho or some type of good fellow
But me I keep it real that's all swine like jello
Don't drink Cristal, and I can't stand Mo
Never received currency for moving a kilo
Or an ounce, make em bounce to this fake-pimp-free flow
I never knew hustlers confessed in stereo
Or on video get caught you'll know who turned state's
Evidence, murder weapon, confession and fingerprints
Mama always said watch what comes out your mouth
Tight case for the DA from here to down South
Knowledge wisdom understanding like King Solomon's wealth
You're a player but only because you be playing yourself

[Hook 1]
With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself
With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

[Verse 2 : Jeru the Damaja]
Now these ladies is looking pretty from city to city
I refined a few I met, around the country
The nitty gritty, it's all reality, no question
Actual fact like tight jeans cause yeast infections
And sisters with good minds, get no respect when
Their ass is all hanging out, playing the bar section
Of the club shake what your mama gave ya, back to the lab
I drop the truth, cause rhyming is more than just my craft
Or a way to get ass, or fast cash, or blasted
Black women, make sure you're respected
When niggas is kicking that old off the wall shit, let em know
From jump: "Dead it", you're not ignorant
Knowledge wisdom understanding is the key to wealth
Put some clothes on that ass if you respect yourself

[Hook 2]
With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself
Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

[Verse 3 : Jeru the Damaja]
Now, I don't bust a Tec, bubble drugs
In the projects, or use mics to sell sex
Niggas, nowadays is all about this
So much ying yang, it's ridiculous
If you got so much cheese where are the black distributors
And these record companies shake em down like mobsters
But impostors, like commercial locks are not rastas
Always faking moves, never, making moves
Asses shake, bottles pop, the government is breaking down you fools
You work all week and give the devil back his loot for jewels
And the steak on your plate is filled with chemicals
Still, brothers leave brothers all battered and bruised
On the streets, won't see snakes on my feet
The race is on, but I won't compete

[Hook 1]
I want you to know, yeah I want you to know
I'll fuck a nigga bitch, I'll fuck his hoe
Pull up on forgs, swearin' 'round corners
I want you to know
I'll fuck a nigga bitch hoe
Pull up to the club on forgs, yeah you already know

[Verse 1]
I do this for my brothers
Fuck a bitch with the rubber
Fuck her then I live in the covers
Fuck her then best believe I duck her
Shout out to my squad
Brothers on the vard goin' hard
Stomp a nigga out on the yard
Do that shit just cause I can
Ball like point gaurd
Bitch nigga get out my way
Cause I'm goin' far
I'll let a nigga know quicky
Nigga shit, nigga shit
My brother stay smokin' that sticky
Aye yeah aye aye
Never let a bitch give me a hickey
Used to fuck a bitch named Vicky whoa

[Interlude]
Yeah namsayin'? you wanna say somethin' to the folks namsayin? that's soo beautiful, that's soo soo beautiful
You got somethin' for 'em? aw man. yeah we just having fun tonight

[Hook 2]
So I want you to know
I'll fuck any nigga hoe
Aye walk in best believe lil boat steal the show
I want you to know
I'll fuck any nigga hoe
I ain't goin'  nowhere unless I'm with my bros
All these pussy niggas joe blow

[Verse 2]
I used to have the afro
Now my braids hang to the floor
Money stacked up to the wall
All these bitch tryna get in a niggas drawers
That's how it go
When a nigga on then he havin'
Bitches they just get real friendly
Fuck a bitch I don't really need her
Shout out (?)
Best believe lil mama a keeper
She treat me real nice
So I give whatever shawty want aye
So I give whatever shawty want aye aye
I am living, I’m getting older
You are leaving, and I’m lonelier

You are living, you’re getting older
Soon, you’re leaving, and I’m lonelier

God, I’ll miss ya
God, I’ll need ya
Can you be there for me?
God, I’ll need ya
God, I’ll miss ya
Will you be there for me?

I am living, I’m getting older
Soon, you’re leaving, and I’m lonelier

You are living, you’re getting older
Soon, you’re leaving, and I’m lonelier

God, I’ll miss ya
God, I’ll need ya
Can you be there for me?
God, I’ll miss ya
God, I’ll need ya
Can you be there for me?
I will miss, I will miss ya, I will miss ya
I will miss, I will miss ya, I will miss ya
I will miss, I will miss ya, I will miss ya
I will miss, I will miss ya, I will miss ya
I will miss, I will miss ya, I will miss ya
I will miss, I will miss ya, I will miss ya
I will miss, I will miss ya, I will miss ya
I will miss ya
I will miss, I will miss ya, I will miss ya
I will miss, I will miss ya, I will miss ya
I will miss, I will miss ya, I will miss ya

[Verse 1]
Got those heels on that you love
The ones that drive you crazy
Exactly what you're dreaming of
I'll give it to you, baby
150 miles away
Singing out my lungs
Driving fast all through L.A
Warming up my tongue

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Heart's beating fast
When I'm turning the key
I see you on your back
And I just can't believe

[Chorus]
She looks just like me, just like me
No, I just can't believe
She looks just like me, just like me
Just like me, ooh

[Verse 2]
Before I think, I start to run
But you can't even face me
Know exactly what you've done
Know exactly, baby

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Pictures, they flash
And I can't even sleep
I see you on your back
And I just can't believe

[Chorus]
She looks just like me, just like me
No, I just can't believe
She looks just like me, just like me
Just like me, ooh

[Bridge]
She can, she can, she can have you
She can, she can, she can have you
She can, she can, she can have you
She can, she can, she can

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pictures, they flash
And I can't even sleep
I see you on your back
And I just can't believe

[Chorus]
She looks just like me, just like me
No, I just can't believe
She looks just like me, just like me
Just like me, just like me
I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images and when
We kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God himself did make
Us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

And true, it may seem like a stretch
But its thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home

They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now," they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
"Come down now," but we'll stay...
I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat it sounded thin
Upon listening

And that frankly will not fly
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home

They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now," they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
"Come down now," but we'll stay...

They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now," they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
"Come down now," but we'll stay...

They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now."
They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now."

[Verse 1]
Love is not a toy
Fragile girls and boys
Gather beating hearts
Shattered work of art

[Pre-Chorus]
I was afraid of the love that you asked for
You asked for
You were the light in my eyes; you're the answer
The answer

[Chorus]
The fire in you is long gone
It burned too bright, like the red sun
The child in me
Is elsewhere (Elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere)

On the dance floor, oh, oh, oh...

[Verse 2]
Love is not a choice
(All of the kids on the dance floor)
Wasted girls and boys
(Let us be free on the dance floor)

[Pre-Chorus]
I was afraid of the love that you asked for
You asked for
You were the light in my eyes; you're the answer
The answer

[Chorus]
The fire in you is long gone
It burned too bright, like the red sun
The child in me
Is elsewhere (Elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere)

On the dance floor, oh, oh, oh...

[Bridge]
(Elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere)
On the dance floor, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah!
(Elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere)
On the dance floor, oh, oh, oh, oh, mm...

[Pre-Chorus]
I was afraid of the love that you asked for
You asked for
You were the light in my eyes; you're the answer
The answer

[Chorus]
The fire in you is long gone
It burned too bright, like the red sun
The child in me
Is elsewhere (Elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere)

On the dance floor, oh, oh, oh...

[Outro]
The child in me is elsewhere
On the dance floor
The child in me is elsewhere
On the dance floor..

[Verse 1]
Jack from school
He listened to Bowie, people thought he was cool
He used to live for the thrill
Skiing around up in the Hollywood Hills

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But no one knows
He's talking it up
That it's all for show:
He's boring as fuck

[Chorus]
You're Mr. Know-It-All
She's staring at her phone
And even though you sit together
You feel so alone

It's such a tragedy
When people hardly speak
Try to live up to the person
You pretend to be
You're Mr. Know-It-All...
You're Mr. Know-It...

[Verse 2]
Jill liked art
She listened to Mozart, people thought she was smart
She used to quote Hemingway
Trippin' on acid in the Palisades

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But no one knows
That it's all for show

[Chorus]
You're Mrs. Know-It-All
He's staring at his phone
And even though you sit together
You feel so alone

It's such a tragedy
When people hardly speak
Try to live up to the person
You pretend to be

[Bridge]
You must've known I tried to change
Would love to say
Hello, hello, hello (Hello?)
Please, don't hang up
Afraid
Of what I'd say
Hello, hello, hello?
I'm Mr. Know-It-All

[Chorus 2]
I'm Mr. Know-It-All
Staring at my phone
And even though we sit together
I feel so alone

It's such a tragedy
We always used to speak
Try to live up to the person
I pretend to be

I'm Mr. Know-It...

[Verse 1]
Somewhere in the forest
Where the waters meet
Lie the days before us
Spinning on repeat
There's darkness through the doorways
Silence in the streets
There's something in the stillness
A distant memory

[Chorus]
Show me love, fill my cup
The world's not empty
It's how you want it to be
Push and pull, the glass is full
Float on an ocean
We're caught up in the motion
So we move
(We just move, we're just moving)
(We just move, we're just moving)

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in the mountains
And buried in the snow
Life grows underneath us
A thousand leagues below
Sunlight through the window
Spilling on the streets
No stillness in our orbit
We keep spinning
We keep spinning on repeat

[Chorus]
Show me love, fill my cup
The world's not empty
It's how you want it to be
Push and pull, the glass is full
Float on an ocean
We're caught up in the motion
So we move
(We just move, we're just moving)
(We just move, we're just moving)
(We just move, we're just moving)

[Outro]
We're caught up in the motion
So we move
(We just move, we're just moving)
Push and pull
(We just move, we're just moving)
The glass is full
Float on an ocean
We're caught up in the motion
So we move
Spinning on repeat

[Verse 1]
I, I saw a picture of you today
At an art exhibit
On memory lane
You wore those pearls we found on Champs-Elysees
Framed like the golden masters
Forgotten all these years
Pouring like rain
A true thought appears
Oh, the genius of pain
Without a name
Pouring like rain

[Chorus]
Cause I'm on my back, on my back again
Words we had to describe the same feeling
Now without a meaning
Cause I'm on my back, on my back again
Looking at a hole in the ceiling

[Verse 2]
I, I watched the movie of you today
Silver screen adapted from my thoughts on Broadway
You saved the world; we lived in such harmony
Blockbuster sales in twelve countries
Remembered all these years
Falling like rain
A truth that appears
Oh, the genius of pain, oh

[Chorus]
Cause I'm on my back, on my back again
Words we had to describe the same feeling
Now without a meaning
Cause I'm on my back, on my back again
Looking at a hole in the ceiling
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Dear Saturday Club
Happy birthday to you
Oh yeah!

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Dear Saturday Club
Happy birthday to you

Niggas hating on the kid, better stop that
(Said you got a long way to go)
If you niggas wanna tame the foe
I'ma stay gettin money with a gang of hoes
Going hard on a job so my change'd grow
In the lab with a pad and some haze to blow
Or on the road, in the zone, getting cake for shows
Woah
I'm the Prince, most you cats' peons
Play a role on track, actors like Leon
I'm steering the game, you get your backseat on
Won't even use your mixtapes to roll weed on
(Fuck outta here)
Fresh trees on
And my cheese on
Need a 16? That be about a G a song
That's only cause I'm a new face
Go head, name your favorite rapper -
I'm taking dude's place
I'm into new things
My shit Artful Dodger
Ain't nothing you've seen
Straight out the boutique
The bitches choose me
Ain't worried bout another nigga, I do me
Yeah, I do me
(Said you got a long way to go)

[Verse 1]
It's all in frame
Familiar faces on my wall
This town is strange
Seasons never change
Time is up
The world doesn't stop for anyone
Until the sun dissolves

[Pre-Chorus]
We all disappear
There's nothing to fear now, my love
How does it feel?

[Chorus]
It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do to you
It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do to you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do to you
It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do to you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do to you
It's over, nothing's over
I'll grow up when I'm older
God only knows what I would do to you

[Intro]
Land of the free, home of the strange
From shining sea to mountains grey

[Verse 1]
Didn't get your number
Couldn't catch your name
But you got me under
Girl, you've got me tamed

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do what you want to
Do what you please
You are the Queen of the ocean
Her majesty

[Chorus]
Land of the free, home of the strange
From shining sea to mountains grey
From amber waves of fame, I will not change
Can't put me in my grave, in my grave

[Verse 2]
I crave your wonder
I shout your name
Feel the fist of thunder
Electric rage

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do what you want to
Take what you need
Let me live in the moment
Let freedom be

[Chorus]
Land of the free, home of the strange
From shining sea to mountains grey, hey hey
From amber waves of fame, I will not change
Can't put me in my grave, in my grave

[Outro]
In my grave
Can't put me in my grave, in my grave
You can't put me in my grave, in my grave
Can't put me in my grave, in my grave

[Verse 1]
I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo in so much space
And when you're out there, without a care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

[Chorus]
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Probably

[Verse 2]
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
Oh, you think you're in control?

[Chorus]
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

[Verse 3]
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, yeah, it looked like fun
So it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

[Chorus]
Well, maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

[Verse 1 : Erykah Badu]
Oh my my my I'm feeling high
My moneys gone, I'm all alone
The world keeps turning
Oh what a day, what a day, what a day
Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learned
If your knowledge were your wealth then it would be well earned
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same

[Hook]
Oh on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
On and on and on and on
All night till the break of dawn
I go on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Oh on and on and on and on
Goddammit I'mma sing my song

[Verse 2 : Erykah Badu]
I was born under water
With three dollars and six dimes
Yeah you might laugh cause you did not do your math
Like one, two, three
Damn, yall feel that
Like one, two, three
The world keeps turning
Oh what a day, what a day, what a day
The man that knows something knows that he knows nothing at all
Does it seem colder in your summertime and hotter in your fall
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same

[Hook]
Oh on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
On and on and on and on
All night till the break of dawn
I go on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
Oh on and on and on and on
Goddammit I'mma sing my song

[Verse 3 : Erykah Badu]
I am feeling kinda hungry cause my high is coming down
Don't feed me yours cause your food does not endure
I think I need a cup of tea, the world keeps burning
Oh what a day, what a day what a day
You rush into destruction cause you don't have nothing left
The mothership can't save you so your ass is gon get left
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same

[Chorus]
Oh on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
On and on and on and on
All night till the break of dawn
I go on and on and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
On and on and on and on
Mad props to the God JaBorn

[Part I: OLA]

[Verse 1]
They call me a ruler, trend setter, making life feel better
Breaking order like a leader now follow
Popping a collar, yea hustle a dollar
You can't touch us like MC Hammer
Eat my mum's string hoppers, jump in the chopper
Yea, chop up a mango with salt and pepper
Holla, holla, holla, true scholar with the nona
And I'm here to shine the light on the matter

[Hook]
At the border I see the patroller, cruising past in their car
Creeping in my socks and slipper, Mexicans say "hola!"
At the border I see the patroller, cruising past in their car
Hiding in my Toyota Corolla, everybody say "Y.A.L.A.!"

[Post-Hook]

When I drive in I'm a winner
Whatever I'mma rap got fuel in the burner
Off the grid, staying off the radar

[Hook]
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Creeping in my socks and slipper, Mexicans say "hola!"
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car

[Hook]
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car

[Intro: Sample]
(Foreign singing)

[Verse]
Get a house pay rent, your help is God-sent
Better tell somebody, women and men

Better tell somebody I'm a immigrant
When I jumped out fence, I go and get offense
Then I leave my tent and I go'n be your foreign friend

[Bridge]
And I go'n, and I go'n, and I-and I go'n-go
And I go'n, and I go'n-go, and I go'n

And I go'n be your foreign friend
And I go'n, and I go'n, and I-and I go'n-go
And I go'n, and I go'n-go, and I go'n
Then I leave my tent and I go'n be your foreign friend

[Interlude]
I'd much rather stay in a hot country
We come to cold countries 'cause we have to
But I like it hot

When I jumped out fence, I go and get offense
Then I leave my tent and I go'n be your foreign friend

[Verse 1]
You make me feel like I could sparkle through the night
You are beautiful like lightning
When you kiss me I'm electrified
You are like magic
You're my angel in the sky
You're my baby, never leave me
Catching all the tears I cry, oh
You're the glow in my heartbeat
You're the spark in the empty room
You're the song on the repeat
You're the star and you're in full bloom
And I hope that you know, I'ma always be right by your side
Crystals just don't satisfy

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, did you know that I'll always be in love with you?
I can't fake it, my heart's taken

[Chorus]
Our love cuts like diamonds
Your love alone, worth finding
Give me your heart, give me what you're hiding
Our love cuts like diamonds
Our love will burn down cities
Your love, the fire within me
Give me your hand, we are shining
Our love cuts like diamonds

[Verse 2]
I feel your power
We could take over the world
You're the apple of my eye
I know that I'm your only supergirl
Don't need no rubies, don't need emeralds or pearls
We are perfect just the way we are

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, did you know that I'll always be in love with you?
I can't fake it, my heart's taken

[Chorus]
Our love cuts like diamonds
Your love alone, worth finding
Give me your heart, give me what you're hiding
Our love cuts like diamonds
Our love will burn down cities
Your love, the fire within me
Give me your hand, we are shining
Our love cuts like diamonds

[Bridge]
Da-da-da-da-da-da

Our love cuts like diamonds
Your love alone, worth finding
Give me your heart, give me what you're hiding
Our love cuts like diamonds
Our love will burn down cities
Your love, the fire within me
Give me your hand, we are shining
Our love cuts like diamonds
Our love cuts like diamonds
Your love alone, worth finding
Give me your heart, give me what you're hiding
Our love cuts like diamonds
Our love will burn down cities
Your love, the fire within me
Give me your hand, we are shining
Our love cuts like diamonds

[Verse 1]
Why can't you just let me sleep?
I don't know, I don't know
Locked inside this broken dream
I can't go, I can't go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Body turns into paper
Ink stains on my hand
Writing turns to bruises
I can't stand

[Chorus 1]
Living in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
We're dying in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high

[Verse 2]
Ice blue lips upon my skin
So cold, so cold

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Nothing with each other
Our lights begin to flame
Sick down to my stomach
We can't change

[Chorus 2]
We're living in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
Dying in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high

[Bridge]
Ooh, never gonna take me there
Ooh, never gonna make it there

[Chorus 2]
We're living in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
Dying in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
We're living in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
Dying in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high

[Outro]
Living in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
(Ooh, never gonna take me there)
Dying in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
(Ooh, never gonna make it there)
Living in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
(Ooh, never gonna take me there)
Dying in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
(Ooh, never gonna make it there)

[Verse 1]
You got a blue heart
You got magic hands
You blow me candy kisses
We've got secret plans
I'm in a black box
But I can see the light
I'm on the other side of this paradise

[Chorus]
We could run away
We could run away
Take me out this place
We could break the chains
We could run away
We could run away
Help me, please escape
We could break the chains

[Verse 2]
I got a lot of love, but I'm scared it's gonna go to waste
Locked inside an empty room
How can I get through to you?
Lying on the floor I'm just a body in an open grave
I just wanna scream your name
I am gonna rise again

[Chorus]
We could run away
We could run away
Take me out this place
We could break the chains
We could run away
We could run away
Help me, please escape
We could break the chains

[Refrain]
I just wanna kiss your face
I just wanna have a taste
I am gonna break the chains, chains, oh, oh, oh-oh
I just wanna kiss your face
I just wanna have a taste
I am gonna break the chains, chains, oh, oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
We could run away
We could run away
Take me out this place
We could break the chains
We could run away
We could run away
Help me, please escape
We could break the chains

[Refrain]
I just wanna kiss your face
I just wanna have a taste
I am gonna break the chains, chains, oh, oh, oh-oh
I just wanna kiss your face
I just wanna have a taste
I am gonna break the chains, chains, oh, oh, oh-oh

[Hook 1]
It's time I settle the score!
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Playing Mr. Big, I'm gonna get you sucka
Hahahaha, you shouldn't diss refugees...
Soldiers, left and right, left and right, left and right, left and right, left and right, left and right, left left left left

[Verse 1: Wyclef]
Look into the rhyme
Rum to the ripple
Single
But at times I come in triple
Blaow, blaow put the heater to your head
Now your dead
Wyclef don't give a *beep* if you're dead
Raaaaah, raaaah
Let me attack just like the black cat
You in the wrong neighborhood, check the map
Hooo, you've got to go for backup
To do what you gotta do
So you'll be back with France CU
Traitor in your crew is mafo heat
Put the poison in your tea
And kill the toad, But I'll be back with the centipede
I'm on some new technique, drunken bamboo
Awoo hoo a hoo, I'm taking all crews what
Competition, stimulation for the rap man
Losers check your tooters
While I'm suckin' on your girls hooters
Don't play macho, while you got the gun
Cause if you got to reload

[Hook 2]
Its time to settle the score!
"Too many MCs, not enough mics"
"Ready or Not, here I come"
"Hahahaha you shouldn’t diss Refugees and…”
Soldiers, Left and right, left and right, left and right, left and right, left and right, left and right, left, left, left, left

[Verse 2: Wyclef]
Yo, Wyclef the multi-talented
Average heads can't handle it
I'll bring it to you live
Only if you want it
Me and my guitar go back like the days of the R MC's
(C'mon check out my melody)
The W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef
Through any contest
I'm victorious
Still keep it real, if you will and manifest
Through your skills, not by how many shells you peel

[Verse 2: Praz]
I'm a bring down the ruckus
Play the nutcracker
Rough-neck rednecks make me no bother
Time after time, ask Cyndi Lauper
Boss, you don't want to fuckk with my partners
Motion, commotion, what's your proposal
Uphold two-fold, the crew is disposal
Like utensil, false idental
I autograph my lyrics with a number 2 pencil

[Hook 3]
Its time to settle the score!
Incomprehensible
“Oba-observing
The hypocrites”
“They smile at my face, then they talk behind my back”
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left

[Verse 3: Lauryn]
I'm the L, Won't you pull it
Straight to the head
With the speed of a bullet
Cuttin' jokers off at the meeky-freeky gullet
Lyrical sedative, keep niggas medative
Head rushers I give to creative kids and fiends
Dreams of euphoria
Aurora
To another galaxy
Phallic-sy
Be this microphone, but get lifted
Lyrically I'm gifted
Burn on in without the roach clip it
Henders, mind-bender
Pleasure sender
So frequently your nerve endings belong to me
Wrongfully you put me down not receiving the full capacity of my smoke
Wack niggas choke
From the fumes that I emote
Or emit shit
See even I feel the mahogany L
Natural hallucinogen
Turning boys to men again
With estrogen dreams
Release blues, yellows and greens
From Brownsville to Queens

[Hook 4]
Its time to settle the score!
“Ready or not, Refugees taking over”
“‘Cause we soft spoken, doesn’t mean that we forgotten”
“Now we, permanently one”
“And one day you will be gotten”
Soldiers, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left

[Verse 4: Diamond-D]
I creep like a theif, no doubt the man's swift
I'm more magnificent than Lee Van Cleef
You stand stiff and got the nerve to let your man riff
(We know where to run)
And start flakin' like dandruff
C'mon son my steelo's tight
Cause by far I'm the best producer on the mic
Born to write, analytical conceptions
With precision and leave lyrical incisions

[Outro]
BING!
Hahahaha... (echoes and fades)

And I've been, runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
I've been runnin' 'round revolvin' doors
And she's so stunnin', stunnin', stunnin', stunnin'
I can see it comin' out her pores
And it's nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
To somebody like me
Somebody like me

[Pre-Chorus: 070 Shake]
But do you still think I'm funny, funny, funny?
(You know you love me, baby, come on, come on)
Tell me, baby do you love me, love me, love me?
I'm Butterflies
I know you feel it in your tummy, tummy, tummy

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
And you sting like a bee
Like a bee
But you're still my honey, honey, honey
And you sting like a bee
Like a bee
But you're still my honey, honey, honey
Hey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey
But you're still my honey, honey, honey
But you sting like a bee, sting like a bee
Sting like a bee, sting like a bee

[Verse 3: 070 Hack]
One more time, tell me one more lie, girl
One more chance or I'll give you to the world
Tell me what you really wanna do
Girl I gots to
Girl I gots to

I don't wanna hold you back no more, no
With this love, with this love, with this love, oh
And do you still think you're funny, funny, funny?
Funny, funny, funny

[Pre-Chorus: 070 Shake]
And do you still think I'm funny, funny, funny?
Tell me, baby do you love me, love me, love me?

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
And you sting like a bee, sting like a bee
But you sting like a bee, sting like a bee
But you're still my honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey
Oh, but you sting like a bee, but you sting like a bee
But you sting like a bee

[Verse 4: 070 Shake]
You know I really hate it when you turn around
You know I really hate it when they talk you down
It don't gotta be what it has to be
Turn around and just dance with me
Now's when you're lookin' like I take control
Faster I go, the more you moan
Stop it now
You know I really hate it when you turn around
You know I really hate it when they talk you down
It don't gotta be what it has to be
So baby turn around and just dance with me
Turn around and just dance with me
Hey, dance with me
Oh, dance with me, yeah
Oh, dance with me
Dance, dance, dance, dance
To the left
Dance, dance, dance, dance

(What you say, Tree?)

[Bridge: Treee Safari]
Save me the last dance, dance, dance, dance
Save me the last dance, dance, dance, dance
I blew my last chance, chance, chance, chance
I blew my last chance, chance, chance, chance
Save me the last dance, dance, dance, dance
I blew my last chance, chance, chance, chance
Save me the last dance, dance, dance, dance

(I abducted you)

[Outro: 070 Shake]
But do you still think I'm funny, funny, funny?
Tell me, baby do you love me, love me, love me?
Butterflies
I know you feel it in your tummy, tummy, tummy
But you sting like a bee

[Verse 1]
Carry me off the stage
I can't do this anymore
Been gone for 3 years
Is that enough for you boy?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Carry me to my bed, paint my toe nails blue
Tell me all about the things that you and I will never do

[Chorus]
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

[Verse 2]
Carry me off the stage
Had too much to drink
Been on tour too long
And I've had too much time to think

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Carry me to my bed
Lay me in a pillow town
Kiss me on my head
And remind me of the way we will not know

[Chorus]
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

[Bridge]
Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, laying in Versailles
You and I get to know one another

Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, baby you and I
Can get to know one another

[Bridge: Unleaked Version]
Cause late at night, we have one life to kill
Oh You and I
Can get to know the thrill
Cause baby you're my sign
And I wanna get to know ya

[Chorus]
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

[Outro]
(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)

[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, when you call me, I come to
From dreams I'll wake, and I'm waiting for you
Oh, baby, when you call me, I come to
I jump through hula hoops of fire just to get to you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're making me crazy, oh, little baby
Shut your complaining, aye-aye-aye-aye
You make me so angry, someone should pay me
Why don't you get the sty-y-y-yle?
Make me smile

[Chorus 1]
Life's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance

[Verse 2]
Oh, honey, when you call me, I want to
Stay on the telephone for hours just to get you home
Oh, sugar, when you call me after school
I see your smile and I could run a methampheta-mile

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'll never forget it, oh, you'll regret it
Nowhere to kiss it, aye-aye-aye-aye
Take it or leave it, better believe it
You'll never see why-y-y-y
Say goodbye

[Chorus 1]
Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance

[Bridge]
New kind of porno
One that has yet been born, oh
Loving you's like loving a hurricane, I'm tired of
All the mess you make, all the hearts you break
Loving you's like loving a dirty bomb, you're blowing up
All the cash I'm paid, all the love we made

[Breakdown]
Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul

[Chorus 2]
Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance
Your problem with commitment is
The bane of my existence

[Outro]
True love, it comes once
You messed it up, you stupid...

[Verse 1]
I wore diamonds for the birth of your baby
For the birth of your son
On the same day, my husband-to-be
Packed his things to run
Was bittersweet to say the least
One life begins, one comes undone
I've always been a strong woman of faith
Strong like a tree, but the unlucky one

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going down now
With all of my

[Chorus]
Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

[Verse 2]
I wore diamonds for the day of our wedding
For our day in the sun
On the same day, my mother-to-be said she wouldn't come
It's always been that way with me
No time for change, no time for fun
It's always been that way, it seems
One love begins, one comes undone

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going down now
With all of my

[Chorus]
Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

[Bridge]
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
Blue, ah, blue
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
Blue, ah

[Chorus]
Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

[Outro]
Fine china, fine china, fine china
Fresh linen, fresh linen, fresh linen
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
I'm the other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman

[Verse 1]
You, you, la-la-lie
You, you, la-la-lie
Who else knows you're not a stand up guy?
Trouble in paradise, they can see it in your eyes
Living double lives, that you're living double lives

[Pre-Chorus]
He says he loves me, I don't believe him
If I'm so angry, why don't I leave him?
But he knows that I, I really need him
I'm tired of being, tired of being

[Chorus]
The other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman

[Verse 2]
Taste that high, chase that high
Is there nothing that will satisfy?
There's trouble inside your mind, and you're desperate for the fire
Addicted to surprise, addicted to the lies

[Pre-Chorus]
He says he wants me, why can't I see him?
Only at late nights, not on the weekend
I know his tough life, I know his girlfriend
I'm tired of hearing, hearing he's leaving

[Chorus]
That other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman

[Verse 3]
At the supermarket, waiting in line
Hair done, nails on, gold design
She walks up and whispered from behind
"Everyone knows your little secret"

[Bridge]
I'm the other woman, oh
Everyone's bridesmaid, nobody's bride
Everyone's mistress, nobody's wife
But we knew when you moved that you were the troubled type
You the kinda girl who, you the kinda girls

[Chorus]
That other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman

[Intro]
Motel six, sloe gin fizz
Swinging in the lobby, do the sunset twist
I can do it, you can do it, move them hips
C'mon everybody, get dangerous!

[Verse 1]
Fellars, if you wanna get that invite quicker
Pack up the pick-up, pick up the liquor
Go on use your charm, so come on, go on get her
It's about time!

[Verse 2]
Ladies if you really wanna reign them suckers
Line up your lips, plump up your pluckers
It's about the only way to get them motherfuckers
To do what you want to!

[Chorus]
It's a party, it's a party, we're so naughty
C'mon Johnny, do it, do it, do it, c'mon!
It's a party, it's a party, that we started
C'mon Johnny, maybe this is where we belong!

[Verse 3]
Motel six, you're so sick
Swinging from the ceiling like a front man Rick
Show a little skin for my polaroid pic
Promise I won't show your little girlfriend this!

[Verse 4]
Ladies, if you really wanna know my secret
Come a little closer, kitty, promise you'll keep it
Come a little nearer, dear, you're gonna need it
Gonna tell you

[Chorus]
It's a party, it's a party, we're so naughty
C'mon Johnny, do it, do it, do it, c'mon!
It's a party, it's a party, that we started
C'mon Johnny, maybe this is where we belong!

[Bridge]
Maybe we can go to the 7-Eleven
Drive down the main drag in your pontiac heaven
You can drink and drive, whatever you want to
And we'll get right down to it, me and you boo

We're layin' on the hood like it's a flatbed truck
In the spotlight we see Jim and Chuck
Saw that car from a mile away and it's slowin'
"They say that there's a motel dance, let's get going."

[Chorus]
It's a party, it's a party, we're so naughty
C'mon Johnny, do it, do it, do it, c'mon!
It's a party, it's a party, that we started
C'mon Johnny, maybe this is where we belong!

It's a party, it's a party, we're so naughty
C'mon Johnny, do it, do it, do it, c'mon!
It's a party, it's a party, that we started
C'mon Johnny, maybe this is where we belong!

[Verse 5]
Motel 6, drive-in flix
Ladies in their black cars, bras, and kicks
Babies at the sitters and we're getting our fix
Keepin' it, keepin' it, glamorous

[oUTRO]
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, c-c-c'mon

Jeffery, be easy
After sex she gon' wanna get married
Seen many men on Maury
Claimin' "the kid ain't my baby"
But taste the cake, I gotta have her
Shower to the big red sofa chair
Play truth or dare
Jumpin' in the pool with no swimwear gear
You keep me 'ware lookin' like a peacock
Everytime we press she be rooster
Feelin' like the big block time shift
Number one Haitian, she in love with the voodoo sex
Flippin' on the mat yo
Like olympians in Rio, oh
Blast off like the rocket man, piano
Scream so loud, dolphins hear the signal

[Verse 1]
Tryin' to get control
Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion

[Verse 2]
I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)

[Bridge]
Where are you?
'Cause I can't see you
It was a perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy
Where are you?
'Cause I can't see you
It was a perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
But I feel you watchin' me
Illusion
But I feel you watchin' me
Mistaken for love
Where were you
'Cause I can't see
But I feel you watchin' me
Mistaken for love
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy
Mistaken for love
In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy
I'm over the show
Yeah, at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Oh-oh-oh, you were a perfect illusion
Oh-oh-oh, it was a perfect illusion
It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
It was a perfect illusion, illusion, illusion

[Outro]
Where were you 'cause I can't see it
It was perfect illusion
But I feel you watchin' me, baby
Somewhere in all the confusion
Dilated, fallin' free
You were so perfect
In a modern ecstasy
You were a, you were a perfect illusion

[Chorus]
I've been tryna tell a different story
Find balance and I'm tippin' off
And tell grandma I be with her shortly
I won't panic when they send her for me
Cause I ain't got time for feelin' sorry
I gotta be on point when duty call
And I'm prolly the worst nigga to get involved with
These shoulders is not for you to sniffle on

[Verse]
Watch the wall collide with my fist
Mostly over problems that I know I should fix
Focused so I know my skin tone is a cliff
We on the edge and they hopin' we slip
I had to ask moms what I owed to this shit, she said "Nothin'"
She asked me 'bout them old times both of us miss, I said nothin'
She asked me if I'm smokin' again
I told her that I prolly gotta go in a bit

[Chorus]
I've been tryna tell a different story
Find balance and I'm tippin' off
And tell grandma I be with her shortly
I won't panic when they send her for me
Cause I ain't got time for feelin' sorry
I gotta be on point when duty call
And I'm prolly the worst nigga to get involved with
These shoulders is not for you to sniffle on
The best things in life are free
But you can keep them for the birds and bees
Now give me money
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)

Now give me money
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)

Money don't get everything, it's true
What it don't get, I can't use
Now give me money

[Verse 1]
Survivor
It starts when you’re ready
It starts when I’m heading over
Getting blessings in the shower
Looking in the mirror, mood emoji fire
Trying not to remember
My time in the fire
Cause ain't gonna tell ya
This war is never over
I ride through the sea like a pirate
Just to flow with the water
Can't carry feelings
Like basket can't carry water
Ain't gonna tell ya
That I live strictly for the paper
Men are good, men are bad
And the war is never over

[Hook]
Survivor, survivor
Who said it was easy?
Survivor, survivor

Now power up your lighter
For you know you are a survivor

[Hook]
Survivor, survivor
Who said it was easy?
They can never stop we
Survivor, survivor
Who said it was easy?

Nothing changed since you been top ten
All in the streets are hungry men
If you don’t give us what we need then
We gonna go off and hit the bend

Click again
Kick me down and I’m back again
Gonna fight pen
With my pen
I fire that round till they stop the trend

[Hook]
I talk and talk until I piss em off
I talk talk talk talk

[Verse 2]
This system has to come
With way better shit

Hatism or
Hate Islam
Better check up on the baptism

If you do give a shit thats wac to some
If you got a brain lets practice em

Getting back at em
Here we come here we come
Dance on the street like I hit a drum
Here we come here we come
Dance on the street like I hit a drum

[Hook]

[Hook]
I talk and talk until I piss em off
I talk talk talk talk

[Verse 1]
I'm a parrot
I'm robin this joint
Not a lyre bird
Sure ain't a vulture
Don't swallow that cause I make the culture
I'm not a lyre bird, I'm not a lyre bird
Staying, staying rich like an ostrich
Love ain't a albatross hanging 'round ya neck
Drink a sparrow, love is food, take a peck
Let's go to Turkey, swift like a rail
Can't pigeon hole, I'm epic like a Zeus tail

[Hook]
Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love

[Verse 2]
Doves cry
Are you going home alone?
Squad flock
Migrate for the summer
Duck out for, for some hot weather
Birds of prey and I'm shaking off my feather
See the water foul, swing on a creeper
Like starlin dictating love on my speaker
Hot flamingo, go bird emoji yo
Monogamous like a swan going with the flow

[Hook]
Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love

[Bridge]
Watch the sky, watch the sky
Watching, watching the sky
Watch the sky, watch
Watch the sky
Watch the sky
Watching, watching the sky
Watch the sky, watch, watch

[Verse 3]
Is that a crow on a crain?
Is that you or a plane?
Where's your chicken at?
I'm watching like a hawk
Aye, I need more birds!
Gully like a seagull
Gully like a, gully like a seagull
Gully like a seagull
I'm cuckoo for you, let's talk!

[Hook]
Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Free up my love
Staying, staying rich like ostrich

[Outro]
Drop down get your eagle on
Drop down, drop down like a falcon
Drop down get your eagle on
Drop down, drop down get your eagle on
Drop down get your eagle on
Drop down, drop down like a falcon
Drop down, fly phenomenon
Humming higher than a drone
Free up my love

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, well, you could be my...

Yeah, you could be my...
Yeah, okay, well, you could be my...
Baby, you could be my...
Said, baby, you could be my...
Yeah, uh, well, okay, it's alright, it's okay

[Chorus: Mac Miller]

Said you could be my... (Boo)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Well, you ain't in the mood to argue
Baby, don't you worry, this some shit to get along to
Some shit I right my wrongs to
Well, I've tried to call you, have us a discussion
We never talk, we always way too busy fuckin'
I'll think of somethin' to say, I always do
I'm in love with the way that you say my name
Every time it sound brand new

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Baby, you could be my... (Boo)
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay

Only if you be my... (Boo)
It's alright, it's okay

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay
And time will tell if I'm alive and well, 'cause when I'm by myself
I find that I keep flyin' high, sometimes I must remind myself
That change is more than pennies layin' on the floor inside the well
You cross my mind, do not apologize for bein' fine as hell
I'm spinnin' here inside your spell
My mind, it start to wander
Miss a day, I stay up late admirin' your posture

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Baby, you could be my... (Boo)
Yeah, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And, baby, you could be my... (Boo)
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your... (Boo)
Okay, it's alright, it's okay
Yeah, only if you be my... (Boo)

[Bridge: Cee-Lo Green]
There's no more you or me, we are we, yes we are
(Yes we are, sweet baby)
And I can see, I can see, so much better (I can see)
And carefully, precious things fall apart
Just let them be, let it be, forever, oh
Lovin' me, in spite of me, bless your heart (Bless your heart)
I can breathe, I can breathe, so much better (Yeah)
I won't let anything tear us apart, no, no, no
We are we, we are we, forever

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
You could be my... (Boo)
Okay, it's alright, it's okay
I feel like you could be my... (Boo)
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your... (Boo)
Well, okay, it's alright, it's okay
Only if you be my... (Boo)
It's alright, it's okay

[Outro: Cee-Lo Green]
You gotta deal with Mac Miller, bitch
Hehehehahah
You say that you love me
But you still out in these streets
All that hustling, hustling, hustling
Leads to nothing, nothing, nothing
It’s time for you to leave
Cause you're still out in these streets
All that hustling, hustling, hustling
Leads to nothing, nothing, nothing
(hustling, hustling, hustling)

Tory’s Girlfriend: Hey Tory, its me. I just wanna let you know that I’m walking away from the situation. I just feel like I have tried and I tried, its just... I can’t get through to you and ... I feel like you love this lifestyle more than you love me. Just pray that you take care of yourself and be safe out there. I love you

Tory: At this point, I ain’t know what to do, couldn’t go back to my girl’s house and I for damn sure wasn’t going back to the hood. I had less than a dollar and a dream and I was flooding down Loners Blvd

[Verse 1]
As the rain drops down in this cotton town
We eat candyfloss by the sea
And the more it pours, the more I'm yours
Oh, please, steal the way with me
But there's another girl and she turns your world
You joke she's not a patch on me
And when I watch your eyes, I'm catchin' butterflies
Oh, I wish that you could see me

[Chorus 1]
Wooh, you were the one I have been lookin' for
Wooh, you were the one I never found before

[Verse 2]
Playin' in the dirt
In your favorite shirt
You plant a kiss upon my lips
And I just stopped and stared
You run your hands through my hair
Electric currents to my fingertips

[Chorus 1]
Wooh, you were the one I have been lookin' for
Wooh, you were the one I never found before

[Bridge]
But when Sully Tane heard about my name
She came around and knocked upon my door
When she came around, she stepped my flowers down
Don't want me hanging 'round with you no more
So I moved away to another place
No more candy by the sea

[Chorus 2]
Wooh, you were the one I have been searchin' for
Wooh, you were the one I never found before

[Verse 1]
If you dance, I'll dance
And if you don't, I'll dance anyway
Give peace a chance
Let the fear you have fall away

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you

[Chorus]
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

[Verse 2]
If you go, I'll stay
You come back, I'll be right here
Like a barge at sea
In the storm, I stay clear

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you

[Chorus]
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

[Verse 3]
If you dance, I'll dance
I'll put my red dress on again
And if you fight, I'll fight
It doesn't matter, now it's all gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you

[Chorus]
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

[Outro]
I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you
I've got my mind on you

[Verse 1]
Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self contained and aware
Of each other's forms
Still and in full strides just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers

[Refrain]
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around the Higgs

[Verse 2]
What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after genius ends
I watch video; only difference is, it's flattened and remiss
Sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone

[Bridge]
I'll be back before
The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no, not at all
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you've showed
What you give, my words can’t hold
And if acts of God breaks us apart
Least we did ours

[Outro]
Turn back, turn back
Turn back, turn
Back, turn back, turn
If you've never been in love

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
Yup, duplex in New Orleans east
I was writin' down everything
Things I would tell nobody
Some things I didn't even tell me
Sleepin' on my back, my body would wake up after me
My barber fresh out the penitentiary
That alcohol was stingin' me
My four cousins stayed with me, stayed with us
One was in the shower
My aunt in law come over to fuss and fight
So she get out in cutoffs and a wifebeater
Barefeet and bra-less, titties swingin'
She was seventeen then
Vaseline and Reebok classics
Weaves and baskets
Take the bully on the greenest grasses
His name was Renny, we was cool after
Matthew had some pairs of Air Maxes
Clarky had them road rashes
Lost your virgin on a air mattress
Texturizer, feelin' unnatural
This what I would do just to show you
That it's special now

[Outro: Frank Ocean, Sampha & Jazmine Sullivan]
What could I do to know you better than I do now?
What can I do to love you more than I do now?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do to show my love?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do? What can I do?

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Over where the trees burn down
The place where the fields went down in flames
We could put a hole in the ground
Throw seeds and dance for rain
It takes a mind to worry
A conscience to feel ashamed
But there’s no place to hide out here
These skies are filled with planes

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
And both our hands are filthy
Pointing up at the moon
All tonight, I’ll hold you close, close enough to bruise
Hope a garden grows where we dance this afternoon
Hope our children walk by spring, when flowers bloom
Hope they’ll get to see my color
Know that I’ve enjoyed sunshine
Pray they’ll get to see me, me wither (When I was young)
See me wither (When I was young)

[Outro: Frank Ocean & Jazmine Sullivan]
Know that— (Me)
Enjoyed sunshine (When I was young)
Know it happens all— (Me)
Know that I’ve enjoyed sunshine— (Me)
Know it happens all (Me) —all the time (Me)
Know it happens all (Me) —all the time (Me)
When I was young (Me, me)

[Intro]
Gotta rinse off here
I can't see your diamonds
I need a week paradise
I went god mode all year
I can't see so cloudy
Paradiso laundries
I keep the cheats on all year
Sometime in Heaven
You still behind like ancestor
All on your mood board all year
I went god mode about it
You ain't got no muscles, lil' nigga
I ain't in the mood for it all year
I keep the cheats on always
Wrong side of average

[Chorus]
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide off or peace out, yeah, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
For your mentality
You play ball, you run five-on-five least three times a week
Glen Park down the street
Waitin' on you to tire, retire with victory
Play so savagely
Always fighting with them you grew up with
When you lose, you don't cry, but you low-key sad to see
If we cut like some champions, you'll redeem yourself
You'll sleep happily, uh-haha, smiling
I'm still working while you dream pop
I could never let a scene stop smilin' on me
I don't think they get the point, pop
They forgettin' that it's me, akh
Akhi, tell 'em I ain't gone, wallahi
I'm just all day running numbers
How the fuck you think I live?
Too many heads waitin' for my downfall
They're like, "Something's gotta give"
Boys in the building give me updates like they know the weather
If you ain't in the streets, you can't see the sky, I'm out here
I could see the sky and it's paradise
On the regular

[Chorus]
And when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on, oh, slide, yeah, yeah
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
First time on me, oh, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
This is for when you change your mind and slide back this way
This is for that night when setbacks won't let that much fade
Guess you can't blame the ones you choose

[Interlude: Crystal LaBeija]
("Feel a certain way—")
"‘Cause you are beautiful and you are young
You deserve to have the best in life"
("Feel a certain way—")

[Intro]
Woo! (Woo, woo)
Woo!

[Verse]
I was in all them hours in it
10K, tokin' mid strokes
Prime prime time of my life witcha
Puttin' prime numbers up though
On them 777 flights witcha
Take a shower with it, gotta cleanse it
Keep the safety off innit
Now we finna have a minute
Outta wedlock, God forgive it
Then forget it
'Cause only God can forget it
All this hotel living
Might as well pay the mortgage what I'm spending
Said the dick long as a swan neck
Put some real swans in the pond then
Fell asleep in the foreign
After the free show at the Garden
Let the LED roll, deer hunter
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience
Bet we sell the biggest out next week
On me on, my partners

[Outro]
When I'm up they gon' hate
When I'm sideways, yeah, I set me straight
When I'm up they gon' hate
When I'm down they gon' celebrate
Sittin' sideways, too sideways
Nah, it's not too late

[Verse]
City view turned to the mountain view
Find a place for a quiet one
Suburbia got a yard
All this estate for my mind to run
(Run, run, run)

[Verse: Frank Ocean and Jazmine Sullivan]
Gonna be somebody, oh I follow
Oh and it's so cloudy
Running showers and the mist so fly
Enough time to know, know nothing at all
Oh I see the lines, there's two lines (walls)
You'll live a life anew
Tell me what you need from me? Gas money?
And I did what I needed to, to be kind
Cut your teeth on sheets in Paris
Hope the water's deep enough
It's a rush to the head
We've been here before (It's just like the water)
The first time is not the past time
I ain't felt this way in years
First, I was rushing for a wait
This time I'm waiting for a rush
(Oh, help me up off my feet)
Infatuation's your rush
(Help me, help me, help me off my feet, yeah
Do you wish you were me?)
Keep pushing on ‘em, never let ‘em stop (Do you wish you were me?)
All what happens to be, now it happens to me, upon his feet
Twin peaking, highs and lows, we shaded off and on
Bygones but we're still here, ride around in my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel
(What happens to me)
Bet you wish you was me
(You, just you and me)
(I need some help on my feet)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I be up to my feet
I wake up feeling weak
Wake me up in a week
(It’s like drivin’ round) (Stroke me, suck me, pipe me down)
(Two is a crowd, quieting down)
(Bite me down, pad me down, do whatever to fly me down)
It don't matter, pipe it down
Two is a crowd, quieting down

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
What stays and what- what's gone and what's here still
And what's here still
Riding my two wheels
They're gone and you're still here, rid-
They're gone and you're still here, riding my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel

[Verse: Frank Ocean & Jazmine Sullivan]
I know you're in here somewhere
You came with someone
There's something you need someone out there
But try to love the one you're with tonight
Try to love the one you're with
Tonight late at night sometimes it helps
If you don't have to be all by yourself
In a moment life could end
And this could all be over with
I know you're in here somewhere
You came out alone
Something you need
It's been so long
Gotta find the one
Who'll hold you tight

[Outro: Lil Flip]
Feel what I'm sayin'? (Yeah)
Like 10, 10, 12, 11, 10, 6, aight?
Platinum

[Part I: Impietas]

[Intro]
Are you against me or are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?

[Part II: Deathwish]

[Verse]
Is it a deathwish to doze off helpless?

How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
Chemically, I don’t have no more new places to go

Chemically, I don’t have no more new places to go

Chemically, I don’t have no more new places to go

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Delusional Thomas]
Hearts on my timeline
Bullet to your rose, then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty
Have no guideline
One day, four times
You don't mind that
I don't care (Pleasure)
Your divinity has turned me into a sinner
God is fair (Pleasure)
And your beauty can even make hell have a winter

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah
And a freak mind is divine, so we fuck from behind
On these sides, between thighs I eat up
Why do I do anything but trust myself?
Tried to give her up but she fuck so well
Man, that bitch so cold, man, that bitch so cold
I'ma take my time, I'ma hit that slow
'Cause I ain't in a rush young girl
You the only thing for me in this fucked up world
And do you believe in love?
Hold on tight when demons come
It'll be alright, no need to run
Stay with me tonight, we'll see the sun
And when we wake up early we'll still be young
Never felt this free before, I need you more
Than keys need doors, I need you sleepin' next to me
The blanket sheets, I'll take them all and keep you warm (Yeah)
And I teach her that we were the creatures of love
You be the leader, I could be Julius Caesar
When I'm pullin' up in the Bimmer
The beats in the trunk, all the freaks wanna fuck

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Hearts on my timeline
Bullet to your rose, then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty (Sexy, nasty)
Have no guideline (Have no guideline)
One day, four times
You don't mind that
I don't care (Pleasure)
God is fair (Pleasure)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I need to feel your touch
You shy, you don't reveal too much
No lies, don't hide yourself at all
With you, I just can't help but fall
It's true, and I'll try everything
Girl you my sexy nasty, thing
She been getting faded all the time, flap your wings
I been getting stoned all week
It make me go too deep
Girl, you so lonely
Will you come home with me?
Just take your clothes off, babe
Know that we been talkin' on the phone all day
I love it when you tell me that you don't behave
Tell me when and where, I bet I won't be late
All I really wanna do is procreate
I'm a Superman, you'll be my Lois Lane
Know you late for work, you stayin' home today
We gon' keep on goin' 'til our bones both break
It's the grown folk way, yeah

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Hearts on my timeline
Bullet to your rose, then I watch your petal fold
Don't you know your body been mine?
I know you know I know
Sexy, nasty (Sexy, nasty)
Have no guideline (Have no guideline)
One day, four times
You don't mind that
I don't care
God is fair

[Piano Interlude: Robert Glasper]

[Outro]
Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other, and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little, living very close in the same building, and he would help me with things, and I would see him and think "what a cute guy," and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little, we got to know just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being... finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...

So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.

With this Apple appliance, you can capture live videos
Still motion pictures shot at high frequency
Blurring, blurring the line

Starts again at 38:48 and ends at 48:50:

[Chorus]
With this Apple appliance, you can capture live videos
Still motion pictures shot at high frequency
Blurring, blurring the line between still and motion
With this Apple device
You can blur the border between still and motion pictures
You can blur the border between still and motion pictures

With this Sony Telephone 4K video is in your palm
It is in your palm, in your palm
In your hand, in your hand
With your eyes, with your eyes
You can capture real 4K
With this Samsung telephone, we don't call it telephone
I think I saw billboards describing life interactivity
Life sharing, live posting, streaming off your videos
The new Samsung Galaxy allows you to livestream your life
Livestream your life, livestream your life
You can blur the border between still and motion pictures
You can still stream you life
Your life can be streamed
In endless communication
We all show interest in everybody's life
Your life can be streamed
Life, your life can be streamed
Life, life

[Chorus]
You can blur the border between still and motion pictures
You can blur the border between still and motion pictures
You can blur the border between still and motion pictures

Think of the possibilities, think of the possibilities
Think of the possibilities....with this...

With this device, stream your life, it's possible
Streaming life in this device is possible
Streaming life in this device is possible
Streaming life in this device is possible
Streaming life in this device is possible
Streaming life in this device is possible
It's in your palm, dreams of pleasure in your hand
This device in your hand, streaming life in streams of pleasure
Blurred, still and motion, audio
Your life is an active stream of life
This stream of life, on this device
Is causing an interactive stream of life
This stream of life, on this device
Is causing a streamed life
A live stream of my life
Is caused by this device
By this device
An internet Scheiß
Ja, so ein großes device
Das schafft einen stream of life

[Intro]
That ain't really loud
Couldn't raise his voice 'cause his wind gone
Niggas sound like Reggie
(Already, ran through already
Nigga goin' in, fuck it)

[Verse]
Pray to the pipe, (fuck it) I slide deep inside
Not too deep, not too shallow, I'm mindful of size
She chock full of my swipe, like a capsule sealed tight
With that substance you need, start a family tonight
Big body Merc, LED lights and it's all overprice
The dollar been cheap than a bitch
Tuberose and tulips
On the boxes you're in, from the holes in your skin
Hit the road and get rich or stay home and get broke
It's your choice in the end
Yeah they watching my fence, like they next to my kin
Like they paid by the pope, got some priests by the door
Frisk the demons before they step into my glow
Oh my my
Get it, get it

[Intro: Ariana Grande]
I don't know why, but I think that he makes me smile

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Said, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie
Said, the universe couldn't keep us apart
Why would it even try?
Yeah, said, don't let them hurt you ever
I know you far too smart
Before things come together, they have to fall apart
It's been a while since I've been sober
This life can be so hard, I'd rather talk about you

[Chorus: Mac Miller, Ariana Grande & Both]
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part (Oh)
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
If you wanna stay, we're taking it slow, baby
'Cause you want me, and I got enough on my mind
But I can make some time for something so divine, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Ariana Grande]
Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe, see, me, I got you covered
I'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry
We ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love

[Intro: Tom Misch]
You said I was different
Right from the start
You gave me your trust and gave me your heart
With you I would fly in a special place
Cruising the sky and outer space
And then karma police shot me down
Stealing you, without making a sound
I think of us, even today
But losing you was the price I had to pay

[Bridge: Loyle Carner]
I've tightened up
Need to get my mind loose
Have a little dip
Slip into the right mood
The night's new
Rhymes still the type to
Stride 'til it's gettin' light
Smile and surprise you
I might do, I might do
Looking for trouble
I might find you
I might do
Maybe I like you
Uh, maybe I might do

[Verse 1: Tom Misch]
And my head starts to spin
As I see you with him
Do you see me standing here
An empty soul with no idea
Cause I still feel your head
On my shoulder
On my shoulder
On my shoulder

[Bridge: Loyle Carner]
I've tightened up
Need to get my mind loose
Have a little dip
Slip into the right mood
The night's new
Rhymes still the type to
Stride 'til it's gettin' light
Smile and surprise you
I might do, I might do
Looking for trouble
I might find you
I might do
Maybe I like you
Uh, maybe I might do

[Verse 2: Loyle Carner]
Her voice flicking through the mist
In the moonlight
Maroon eyes
Shimmers 'til I soon rise
To move wise
Bruised and cocooned
Quite right
Out of sight
Like the night
That confused mind
Removed mine
Blue 'til the two twine
Mood too true
To conclude where the truth lies
Saying you might move
Tell me you might do suttin'
You couldn't choose
But the dude's like
You, so I be seeing nothin' but no
Coughing my soul
In the puff of her smoke
Broke, bluffing a joke
As I nuzzle her nose
Ruffle her toes
Ain't suttin' supposed
As love grows

[Hook]

Color-coordinated Bentleys
Watches, car, the agent sent me
A sixty inch in every room
But all I wanna see is you
Got the cash to take vacations
To a beach in every nation
I don't wanna be a Scrooge
But I'm not going without you!

[Bridge]
Santa don't know what to get me
I just wanna see my baby!

And take me where I'll find my baby?

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse 3: Pepe the King Prawn]
Come on Mr. Santa, if you could
Steamed, baked, or or fried, I'm always good!
I only stole one little heart this year
But it was from a shrimp, who really cares?
It's time to make his list and check it twice
So I hope he likes his seafood naughty and spiced
You got something bad to say about this crustacean?
You'd better clam up 'til after Christmas vacation!

[Bridge: Cee-Lo Green (Miss Piggy)]
Santa, won't you come and get me
(I'm ready for my presents!)
And take me where I'll find my baby?

[Verse 1]
Cinematic, take it right back
With a bottle of perfume lotion
Where'd you come from talking like that?
Butterfly from the bottom of the ocean
I can't stop this slow motion trip...
Run away with me, no politics
Such a perfect notion
Your gravity has got me
Bowing in devotion
You and me fit a magic trick...

[Chorus]
If I'm dancing, if I'm dancing, if I'm dancing
I know the music's good
If we're dancing, if we're dancing, if we're dancing
I know that we'll be good

One look at him and I see
Candy-coated heart shapes
The jewels and furniture can go
But baby, he stays
He plays sitar, three notes so far

[Chorus]
If I'm dancing, if I'm dancing, if I'm dancing
I know the music's good (wait, did you get that?)
If we're dancing, if we're dancing, if we're dancing
I know that we'll be good

My chakra's all been green and red
But he wants blue and green instead... (let's just do it over)
My chakra's all been green and red
But he wants blue and green instead...

If we're dancing, if we're dancing, if we're dancing
I know that we'll be good

These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely

You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes, but the real ones
Just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick, I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
R.I.P. Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papá
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' 'bout somethin'
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body-jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came witcha
But he ain't witcha
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin' pheromones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
I may be younger, but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here, I'll save some for you
I'm not him, but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

[Verse 3: KOHH]

[Intro]
She got someone that she sees late night, I know this
I'm just tryin' take that position from em'
We been talking on the low, I know one day you'll notice

[Verse 1]
I think I found her, she's so astoundin'
Everywhere she go, that music play, she looks so soundish
Niggas crowd around her, but that's ain't what she round for
Search around the world and I can't find what she surrounds me with
I know that she was made for me
I know that heaven must've saved you just for me
The way that I feel right now can't be coincidence
The way that you feel right now can't mean you're innocent

[Pre-Chorus]
To all of the ones that have been in love with you
This is a fuck you to all you niggas
We had some good times, I've been in love with you
All of them good times, I wish them good times

[Chorus]
Can come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me

[Verse 2]
Smoking loud and on patron, I'm in my zone, I'm in it
Ain't no one can stop this feeling that we got, no oh
You make it feel the way you used to feel back when we did it
Oh listen baby, top down in the winter your city baby, hey
How many shots does it take just to get you all on it?
Girl, how many moves I gotta make? I start to talk all honest
Girl I want you, can't help it if you need me, don't leave me
I'd be fucked up, I'm waiting
I say

[Pre-Chorus]
To all of the ones that have been in love with you
This is a fuck you to all you niggas
We had some good times, I've been in love with you
All of them good times, I wish them good times

[Chorus]
Can come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me

[Spoken Intro]
Many of our world's problems today
Are a result of the fact that children have had their childhood stolen from them
The magic, the wonder, the mystery, and the innocence of a child's heart
Are the seeds of creativity that will heal the world
I really believe that

[Verse 1]
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

[Chorus]
People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood I've never known
Have you seen my Childhood?

[Spoken Interlude]
When I create my music, I feel like an instrument of nature
I wonder what delight nature must feel when we open our hearts and express our God-given talents
What we need to learn from children isn't childish
They know the way to summon things that lie waiting to be recognized within our own hearts

[Chorus]
People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood (Childhood) I've never known

[Verse 2]
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

[Outro]
Have you seen my Childhood?
We can start now, you ready? Yeah we can start now, yeah we can start now, we can start now, yeah.  You have to let him start...

[Verse 1]
This is why events unnerve me
They find it all, a different story
Notice whom wheels are turning
Turn again and turn towards this time
All she ask's the strength to hold me
Then again the same old story
World will travel, oh so quickly
Travel first and lean towards this time

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time

[Chorus 2]
Watching her, these things she said
The times she cried
Too frail to wake this time

[Chorus]
I'll break them down, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time

[Outro]
Avenues all lined with trees
Picture me and then you start watching
Watching forever, forever
Forever, forever
Watching love grow, forever
Watching love grow, forever
Watching love grow, forever
Letting me know, forever

...Thank you very much.  Now what?

[Verse 1]
What would you do?
What would you do if I handed you a drug that'd teach you something new?
What would you feel?
What would you feel if I took over the fake and made them all real?
What would you say?
What would you say if I told you it's actually gon' be a good day?

[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

[Verse 2]
What do you need?
What do you need to show you there's better things to life than good weed?
What do you hear?
What do you hear?
What do you hear when I tell you I'm always near?
I made it pretty clear
What do you see?
What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free?
You got a friend in me

[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

[Bridge]
And I'm still here
And I'm holding hard onto your hand
But it still feels
Like you're never gonna understand
One can drown alone, but we can swim together

[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
And let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Is it because you're running low on gear?
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
Still, I'll always be there for you
How I do
I let go of my claim on you
It's a free world
You'll look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home always

[Bridge: Frank Ocean & Kim Burrell]
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (Until it's time)
This love will keep through blinding of the eyes (Oh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (Oh)
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (Oh, it's 'til it's time we die)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind

[Outro: Kim Burrell]
Oh, oh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see your face is
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Verse 2]
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

[Bridge]
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
Had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

[Outro]
All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say, did you mean to? Mean to?
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin', dreamin'

[Verse 1]
Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
(Sweet sixteen, how was I supposed to know anything?)
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times

[Verse 2]
Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ahh, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes

[Verse 3]
I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
In this life (Life), in this life (Life)
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
(Thought you might want to know now)
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life
(Love)

[Verse 4]
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You’re tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly, this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given (No way)
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam

[Verse 1]
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing
By myself, gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you
Gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now, I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through, but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo (Solo), solo (Solo)
S-solo (Solo), s-solo (Solo)

[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell, there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell, there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo
Solo
Solo
Solo

[Verse 2]
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw, though
Now your baby mama ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo, yeah
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died
Smoking big, rolling solo

[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell, there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell, there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo
Solo
Solo (By myself)
Solo
Solo
Solo
Solo
Solo

[Part I]

[Verse 1]
Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (Bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Ooh, nani nani
This feel like a Quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnings, ahh
New beginnings, wake up, akh
The sun's goin' down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
Every night shit, every day shit

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, every day shit
(Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)

[Bridge]
All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you're outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right

[Part II]

[Verse 2]
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions
All the reverends
Preachin' self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'Trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night

[Chorus]
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
That's just every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
Every day shit, every day shit
Every night shit, every day shit
Every day shit, every day shit
Every day shit, every night shit

[Verse 1]
This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive, stay alive
Got your metal on (Ooh), we're alone
Making sweet love, takin' time
'Til God strikes us
That's a pretty fuckin' fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the 5
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fuckin', underneath moonlight now
Pretty fuckin', sunrise in sight
In comes the morning, haunting us with the beams
Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur, hey)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, haze, wait)
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on a speed boat?
We smell of Californication (Strike a pose)
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows (Ooh)
Can you come when I call again?

[Verse 2]
On comes the evening, gold seeking ends
Piece in my hand worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carried away
Because I'm stronger and the Congo is dim (Smoke)
In comes the morning, ah (Smoke)
In comes the morning, ah (Haze)

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Poolside convo about your summer last night, ooh yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mmm
Could I make you shive last night?
Could I make you shy on the last night, last night?
Could we make it in? Do we have time?

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

[Chorus: Austin Feinstein]
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Now and then, you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights, you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control

[Chorus: Austin Feinstein & Yung Lean]
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Sometimes you'll miss it
And the sound will make you cry
And some nights, you're dancing
With tears in your eyes

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it (Yeah)
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, um (Woo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still, I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

[Chorus]
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Verse 2]
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the rooves
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

[Chorus]
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Outro: Frank Ocean & Beyoncé]
Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out of melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality

[Intro]
Now, to the edge, I'll race
To the end, I'll make it
All the risk, I'll take it
Head bang with my faux friends
We pour a taste out for the dead
This is the blood, the body, the life right now
The height right now
Might be what I need
Might be what I need
Said you wanna hurt me now
You can't hurt me now
That might be what you need

[Verse]
What it means to be alive on this side
(Said you wanna kill me now)
On this side
(Don't let me down)
On this side
(Down, down)
Fuck the other side
I'm on this side
I'm on this side
I'm on this side
How it feels to have arrived
I'm inside
I'm inside
Those are my niggas for life
Mothers of us, be kind
To the fathers on whom we rely
Fathers of us, be kind
To the mothers on whom we rely
Ah-hah, ah-hah
Ah-hah, ah-hah
Ah-hah, ah-hah
Ah-hah, ah-hah
Ah-hah

[Outro]
We know you're sugar
We know you're sweet like a sucker
Pretty sweet
Pretty sweet

[Skit: SebastiAn]
No, I was just telling that I, I got this, this girl before
And I was together since three years
And uh, I was not even cheating her or what
And Facebook arrived and, uh
She wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it, because I was, like, in front of her
In front of her, and she told me, like, "Accept me on Facebook"
It was virtual, means no sense
So I say, "I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook"
She starting to be crazy
She thought that because I didn't accept her, she thought I was cheating
She told me like, uh, "It's, it's over, I can't believe you"
I said, "Come on, you're crazy, because like, yeah
I'm in front of you, I'm every day, here in your house"
That's, it means, like, it's jealousy, pure jealousy
For nothing, you know?
Virtual thing

[Verse 1]
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move and settle
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
(Brave)
I'm not brave

[Verse 2]
I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes, I've
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views (Nice views)
Maybe I should move, settle down
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell
(It's a loop) What would you recommend I do?
(The other side of the loop is a loop)
This, this fe—, this feel, this feel, this feels
This feels how molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel

[Bridge]
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell
(Brave)

[Verse 3]
Speaking of nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot, where I cannot

[Verse 4]
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
One solar flare, we're consumed
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon

[Outro]
(In the dark)
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for

[Skit: Rosie Watson]
Many college students have gone to college and gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else, don't try to act like someone else
Be yourself, be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana, because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's, um, control
Then it's regulated
Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, bye

[Verse]
Here's to a good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY, I should look you up
I, first time I'd ever saw you
And you text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
Here's when I realized you talk so much more than I do
I, here's to the highlights when I was convinced
That this was much more to you than some some night shit
I know you don't need me right now
And to you, it's just a late night out

[Outro]
Bitches, nigga, all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you, nigga
They told me
I used to fuck with all of 'em
Yeah, I ain't got bitches no more
But now I don't care about bitches like that, my nigga, that shit—
Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart, I don't even know how to feel about bi—

[Intro]
Alright, hold on

[Verse 1]
If I was being honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day and not skip a meal, I'm good
I used to work on my feet for seven dollars a hour
Call my mama like, "Mama
I ain't making minimum wage, mama
I'm on, mama, I'm on
Now  I'm making 400, 600, 800K, mama
To stand on my feet, mama
Play these songs, it's therapy, mama
They paying me, mama
I should be paying them"
I should be paying y'all, honest to God
I'm just a guy, I'm not a god
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god, but I'm not a god
If I was, I don't know which heaven would have me, mama
Let me run this bitch, I'ma run it into the ground, mama, the whole galaxy
Goddamn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck these niggas, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck you niggas and
Fuck me if I hated on you

[Verse 2]
I'ma stick around
I'm gon' let my nuts hang
Nigga, you got some just like me, don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese, roots run deep
Family tree throw a big shadow (Jamming to the rhythm)
Tech company, please give me immortality (It's a face to face)
I'm going rapidly, fading drastically (Keep me high, Castrati)
Damn (Punani fade the stress)
Or pull the zip down
Wet your lips first, lick the tip now (Bugatti left some stretch marks on that freeway)
Smoke somethin'
(Marks on that freeway)
They tryna find 2Pac
Don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press
He escape the stress
La, la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-la
La-la-la

[Verse 3]
I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changing on you
I feel like Selena
They wanna murder a nigga, murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cuff bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my photo
I only got one four-door
Remember when I had that Lexus, no
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa, yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song, so I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Ménage on my birthday, tap out on the first stroke
'Cause this ain't no work day, she don't give head anyway
'Cause what niggas say, that's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas wan' fight in the streets
Now shit startin' to make my hands hurt
Jay hit me on the email, said I oughta act my net worth
Dog, this is chess now, not fetch, I ain't runnin' for a nigga
Ain't ran since track meets, that's the only time I ran from a nigga
You can change this track now, could've changed this bitch a long time ago
—know and —know, —know and —know
Shout out to Hollygrove, I'm from that 7th, though
Twins know and Lance know, Clark know and Matt know
Shit went one-eighty on me, please run that back, though

[Skit]
You say some shit about me? Tuck a real sport, my nigga
That shit happened the second time? 'Cause Mark saw both times, nigga, I only saw the first time
That second time, Jerron was there, nigga
On God, he grabbed me in circles, nigga
And the, and the other nigga tried to pull me
Oh yeah, Jerron told me you that your ass especially told him
Yeah, 'cause the nigga tried to boom me in my face
I had AD in a headlock, nigga (The first time I saw?), I had this nigga like—

But forever at the same time

[Mikey]
Yo, what, what's, what's the year 3000 going to look like? (Dog, stop, stop, what you mean, bro? Stop, stop)

Probably spend a lot of time with my family

Spend a couple hours with my family and I would go out and do like everything that I ever thought about trying

I don't know, there's a lot of things that you could do
That's it

[Mikey]
How far is a light-year? How far is a light-year?
(I'd say like a thousand years?)

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
I'll be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hand through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
After a while, they're keeping me close to you

[Outro: Stevie Wonder]
Just like me, they long to be close to you

[Intro: André 3000]
Ayy
Ayy, so now I'm

[Verse: André 3000]
So low that I can see under the skirt of an ant
So low that I don't get high no more
When I Geronimo, I just go, "Heh"
Solo, my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
So low that I can admit
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
It ain't an event no more
So low that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
When I do, I cut the pony off
Now there's a hole where there once was a logo, how fitting
So low that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards
Over half of these hoes had work done
Sayin' they want something real from a man
Just saying it, we being real persons
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you, ant
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
So pardon me if I am being insensitive
But darling, this only worsens
So low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent
So low that when they throw pussy or pesos
Don't pay no attention to it
So low that I am no rookie, but feel like a kid
Lookin' at the other kids
With astonishment while I'm on punishment
Watchin' the summer come close to an end
After twenty years in, I'm so naive I was under the im—
'Pression that everyone wrote they own verses
It's comin' back different and, yeah, that shit hurts me
I'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving
I've stumbled and lived every word, was I working just way too hard?
Frank: Aite so, Imma have my Red Bull. This ain't really relaxing, but okay. So, umm first of all, thank you for your time, BasedGod.

BasedGod: Mr. Ocean, yes sir, thank you.

Frank: You never know what someone's going through they say. What would you say the average commenter looks like on the internet? Let's say you put out a song in like two hours and you go on a blog and there's a hundred comments already... I'm tryna understand what that person is, who is it? Is it everyone around me secretly? I don't know that I know any of them. (Laughter)

BasedGod: When it comes down, it's like, who?? And I wonder that too. I can speak from personal experience, one of my people that I know, he had a video on Worldstar and I wrote some comments and I hated!

Frank: So it was you?! (Laughter) Alrite fsho.

BasedGod: So if you have some comments and they might be a lil personal, it might be your friend.

Frank: So these people are playing, it's just something to do. Not serious.

BasedGod: The scary thing is that some of these people are serious. (Laughter) that's what's scary. The comments give people the chance to say something anonymously, to put whatever they want, frustrations, anything. They could've come back from a long day and just wanna let loose on somebody. This is a real experiment, and it shows you how people are. I know you've heard about the experiment where they test people to see if they would beat up someone who's in jail, and they see if the people would shock someone else if they had the chance and the other person wouldn't know. People were actually shocking other people if they did something wrong, because you didn't see them. They would shock them, but if you could see them, then they weren't doing that. It's a scary thing when you feel like you don't have to see anybody or you have these layers of protection.

Mikey: It's a scary thing.

Frank: That's the real them. That's the real person. At the same time though, people are complicated to the point that nobody is any one thing. Given the opportunity you could be five different Brandons and I could be five different versions of myself—or more. Five is an arbitrary number. The internet is just another experiment showing us more sides of us.

BasedGod: You'll see some girl in the street who's really nice but on the internet is hating. (Laughter)
Frank: Okay, so we were talking about putting out music and I was saying your approach to it is modern. You aren't pinned down by the house rules or...

BasedGod: The norm.

Frank: That corporate America music shit, you know? I feel like the 'Based Way' is a lot healthier, because it's in a flow, unencumbered. To be able to take time and prepare a body of work is great, but overall being free-form with our output is better in the long run, I think. I'd like to be like that.

BasedGod: Congratulations.

Frank: Huh? (Laughter) Thank you.

BasedGod: I come from the traditional sense of music and I did that and I do that, that's what I love doing. I love that. Getting in the studio like where we at right now and doing what we doing, this is what I love. This is legendary. Also I come from making music however it comes because you know it's motherfuckers that need the music because that's all they got and that's what they got. You know we not worried about if it's for club quality. We gon play that full blast in our car or full blast at the house, and shit the club gon play it too, eventually, you know what I'm saying? The hood parties you know, or the local, the local parties or the people gon fuck with you. You know the people gon make that. (Runner brings in a bottle of Johnnie Walker)

Frank: Aye! Thank you.

BasedGod: Shall I open this for you, sir?

Frank: There you go, corporate backing.

BasedGod: You know what I'm saying?! That's what that corporate backing will do forreal!

Frank: You know they'll have that ass on the Johnnie Walker advert.

BasedGod: You gotta put that away, look, if you got some stock in it I'm fuckn w you.

Frank: I don't even know if they did the IPO like that. Nah they over there in Scotland. They got the address on the box right here. We should go see em.
BasedGod: So, look you gotta tell me, cus you be saying words I don't even know. IPO, what does that mean?

Frank: IPO stands for Initial Public Offering, it's when a company makes their product available for trade on the stock market. When they 'go public' so to speak. This comes with letting people know your business, like you gotta tell your shareholders how you did that quarter of that year, you know? You've got people to answer to.

BasedGod: Like why that drop?! Your investment niggas might fake on you. OG like 'Oh, you dropped five percent... I'm leaving,' and you like 'I thought you fucked with me, I thoughtu was my patna?' he like, 'Hmm...'

Frank: It's true though, fiscal responsibility. You've got a board. You could get kicked off the board even if you started it!

BasedGod: That shit's crazy, bruh.

Mikey: They tried to get Bill Gates in trouble, because when he took Microsoft public he bought 35 percent of the shares. He wasn't supposed to do that. I think you're only supposed to be able to get a quarter.

Frank: He needed that.

BasedGod: That's bossed up. So what would be the motivation of making your stock public and then buying 35 percent of it, if you already own it?

Frank: I don't know. More money equals more control I guess.

BasedGod: I'm 'bout to force myself to start loving money.

Frank: I had a conversation recently and the question came up, is money sexy?

BasedGod: You a real one for that bruh, I never.

Frank: My first thing was, 'Yes, money's sexy as fuck.' and my friend's saying, 'Nah, money is gross, it changes hands, it's filthy. People wear it wrong etc.' And I was thinking, 'Sure.' but no, I don't agree with that.
Mikey: I don't either, money is the fuel for options.

BasedGod: I was waiting for that and we can't forget that my brother, we cannot forget. Me, my problem sometimes, you know we all artists in here, and sometimes I'll just be so into my art and just my brand and shit, so fulfilled off getting the art and doing what I do that you forget that you're running a business also. You've got operations and things to keep this business going and to do that you gotta have money, you gotta be making money. You know it costs money to be in this studio. And I'm not the guy that's always putting it on my fans like, 'Hey fuck with me on my Paypal.' putting it on twitter, you know, 'Help the boy!' But it's a blessing too, because when you believe in your brand and you stay solid through the hard days and the times where you might be like, 'I don't know what's goin on dude,' or 'I don't know what's gonna happen,' and people might be saying 'Aww, you fell off.' and shit like that, and you keep going, and you know, then that big paycheck comes out, and you be like, 'Damn!' or, you know, these companies or individuals might come support you. I've been blessed with that. With hard work and stuff, if you really care about what you're doing, people will pay for that and they gon pay that price. And the show money has been going up for me. It's hard because you don't wanna get complacent. You know, 50 grand shows 15,000 something like that, and you unsigned. And you know you gotta split some money up, get your team and business costs to make the show happen. And I'm paying taxes than a motherfucker.

Frank: We all paying em. Trust. (Laughter)

BasedGod: Yea we all are. You just don't wanna be complacent because at first I was just worrying about paying bills. And now bills are paid and motherfuckers is owning things and now it's the next level of career and worldwide.

Frank: Worldwide. Yes.

BasedGod: Yes sir. Pop. You know I feel like i'm embedded in pop culture right now on this level, and that's a blessing where and how far we've come from. A lot of the beautiful people holding me down too. And especially people like ya'll that's just taking ya'll position and not afraid to show love and when ya'll are like on top still show love to people. Because everybody won't do that. Everybody won't be like, 'We still fuck wit B'. I'm like that though, always, anybody that inspires me... I mean you see I followed a million something people by my hand. You know what I'm saying? So it's like niggas can reach me. I made sure. I followed a million (knocks on the table) this hand bruh, I gotta gold-plate it! This is a hand that's followed a million niggas and then wrote a lot. A motherfucker can come talk to me, and I made that so. Cus I'm paying homage too, so I put that out there—anybody can come talk. If you gotta problem or nigga it's real, come talk to me. That's how I feel sir.

Mikey: Influence, also a big marker of success. When you wear something and then hella people wear it you're successful.

BasedGod: Yes, sir. Bless you my love. And thank you. And that's what I've been too. I've been having to deal with that like it's crazy, because I've been so under a microscope it's like... like me, creating a lot of these ideas. And it hurts me as an individual artist, because you'll see people—and I understand this is life though too you know—but you'll see people like an idea that you might've been thinking years on with the music or a brand that you've worked on extremely hard like with the 'Thank you BasedGod' or something like that and then you see motherfuckers stealing shirts and using the brand and not licensing it and not coming to me directly and doing this, and you know, just messing up the brand... I've got trademarks and shit too, so I'm not just out, but I haven't put lawyers on niggas because I'm just seeing how people doing me. And you seeing how people doing me. And that's not right. For me, I don't remember listening to Lil Wayne and being like, 'Alrite imma make a fucking Wayne t-shirt then sell it.' I never been like that. Wayne can do that, I can't and then people got the nerve too. (Laughter)

Frank: They do, they've got the nerve. That's what Mikey's talking about, that's success. Even that, even in that negative, that's a positive. People bootlegging because it means something, it's valuable, on whichever level.

BasedGod: And if you ain't givin' it to em!

Frank: My last record, I didn't make a vinyl. But somebody did and sold a whole lot of vinyl. They had mp3s on it, not properly done at all. Still they'll win because there's a demand for it. That goes back to the business talk we were having about covering your ass. Make sure you can profit from it not just for the sake of profit, but so you can convert that energy to build up your next ideas.

BasedGod: That's truth, bruh.

Frank: Random, but sometimes I prefer my childhood over all this serious adulthood shit.

BasedGod: Hell yeah

Frank: Not saying I wish I was a kid again but...

BasedGod: Well, you know what's crazy? I wouldn't be mad to look like a kid and have the adult mind. You know what I'm sayin? Keep the youthful skin. But you know I love it. I love it. I've finally accepted becoming an adult and really feeling what it means to have knowledge from experience. And for a long time I was really being hard on me. 25 used to always be old to me.  I used to say 'When I'm 25...' and things like that. You know it finally got there, and I'm getting a little further away from the high school. I've been out of high school (counts) I gotta count on my hands!

Frank: Yea man, believe it.

Frank: What year did you write your first book?

BasedGod: I was 19 so that was—uh...

Mikey: 2009.

BasedGod: Yes sir. Good math. He getting that money. Niggas know, I need my assistant nigga. Nigga gotta count for me (Laughter)

Frank: You're an author though. Are you gonna write another one?

BasedGod: Yea, yes I am. I'm definitely—I already got the title.

Frank: You don't gotta give that up right now.

BasedGod: The next interview, when it's closer.

BasedGod: It's gonna be powerful, so I really wanna get back to writing that. Like I just been so excited about making music bruh and like all the shit that I got planned.

Frank: Yea. Are you doing any more lectures anytime soon?

BasedGod: Man, thank you. Well um...

Frank: That's very ahead by the way.

BasedGod: Thank you, I love you for that, thank you. It's the caliber of people that like Lil B, so it's dope people—people in the school system that are smart and that understand the art aspect of it like you said. The modern way I'm distributing art, that was a beautiful way that you worded that... and these people they're getting it, the future. It started at NYU, I got my email out online and the people hit me up and they inquired and every lecture situation was inquired. Like I said, I don't gotta booking agent or manager and stuff like that so I don't have people actively trying to book like, 'Hey, can we book Lil B.' So anybody that wants to book a show from me, they're contacting me personally by email. It started at NYU and that was a huge stepping stone and deep down inside I really felt really good.

Frank: Yea, it was awesome.

BasedGod: Thank you bruh. I'm sounding modest and cool right now, but deep down inside, yea like, especially the MIT one I was really happy, because for me coming up, dude and this is a real emotional thing too. It used to hurt my feelings when people called me stupid back then because I wasn't in school all the time. I was doing what I wanted to do. But I loved science, I loved history and I loved teachers. I can't say I loved all history, but I loved science, off top science, I loved that no matter what. But I also loved teachers that really loved to teach me. And I had a lot of problems early on because I wanted to be a star in the classroom. That's why it makes sense that I'm a rapper because I was always looking for attention. When I raised my hand I knew it was my time in class, you know what I'm saying? I was like, 'Ooh, I can make a joke right now, aww the whole class is looking. I can say something in front of the teacher.' So I was always that guy pulling the school bells and little things like that, getting my respect and freeing the kids. I was freeing all of us. Because I wasn't understanding the magnitude... and the beautiful magnitude, of education. But I did. But it was like when you're a kid, dude... nigga, they got you in there for hours and shit.

Frank: The whole fuckin day man. Missing the sunlight and everything in there (Laughter)

BasedGod: We was blessed cus we had the off campus lunch, so nigga I was gone. We had a chance to go and eat and leave school for lunch, bruh. And that was a blessing and it's a beautiful thing, because you always got to—it's all about the unconscious—unconsciously I always been doing this, however, whatever... it was always music near me. And it stayed to this day. My grades and shit wasn't reflecting how I felt inside, you know my grades if I would've went by grades, you know I... you know, right know I.... I knew. You know what I'm saying? And that's why I cry, you know? Like when I'm listening to my music or I cry for how where I'm at today. Because it's like by the standards I shouldn't be, by the standards... I should be working or something.

Mikey: That's beautiful.

BasedGod: God bless you man.

Mikey: That's like believing in yourself.

BasedGod: Yes sir and thank you. Yea, but back to the root, what was the root kinda. The root?

Frank: Nigga I forgot.

BasedGod: Yea I forgot too.

Frank: I don't know where I was reading it at, but the chain of command in your brain and how it's evolutionary... in the sense of you having a part of your brain that in the progress of human evolution was the first thing to be developed, the brain stem which is said to control involuntary function. Then you have the next level up, which is emotional and survival based, and then above that you have rationale, mathematics and creative writing—all the things we do for a living. That state of the art brain stuff. It was also talking about how it, let's say we were nomads again and we were out here hunting for a living and we were confronted in the woods by a predator, you'll be literally cut off from access to the higher levels. Your brain is designed to cut off reasoning and to go straight to the mode of survival so you don't waste precious time tryna delineate, you just go straight into survival—the real fucked-up part about it is rarely, if ever are we now encountering a bear, but you might encounter a scenario that's actually not life-threatening but that scares you enough to initiate that sort of response and go straight to this lesser developed part of the brain.

BasedGod: Nah, that's the truth. Quote unquote a man and being quote unquote a man and what that means in society and that's what's hard for us. I really wanna protect the women and protect the kids, make sure that ladies know that you can wear gym shorts and not or don't have to feel like you're forced to, because sometimes I wonder if these fashions, these styles that we think are normal are normal... we should be able to see people anyway they wanna be seen and not fantasize about them or fetishize how they look. So it's like, a girl, she might be hot and she has a bunch of hot pictures on Instagram, and I look and be like, 'Oh, she's hot.' and she might put a funny face picture up and I'm like, 'Ew,' like some weird, you know. Just being herself, you know how the girls be doing that just to do some shit and uhh, I had to look at myself and ask, 'What the hell is my problem?' she's human, we're human. Like, because I do the shit too. I put pictures up—and especially now—I'm more comfortable with myself than ever so. You'll put some shit up and it might be an angle or something you not gon try, you not gon take 15 pics. You gon take that one and just put that motherfucker up and let the world see you. We just gotta keep protecting the young me, the young women and also the older people. You can't forget about the older people too. And try to let them know. Just keep on moving these walls and barriers of what it means to be a man or a woman because that shit'll kill you too. If you really try to live by that, you know, being a masculine man like, 'Oh, I gotta protect my wife,' like 'I gotta go hunt for some food.' Why can't she hunt? Or not, and I'm not saying that and imma tell ya'll like this. I been punched by a girl. Girls done punched me. I'll never hit em and that's what's funny to me because you see I'm not the biggest guy and shit—that shit hurt. When the females hit me, that shit hurt. I never hit them back but all this law bullshit they talking about 'A girls. Don't hit girls and shit'... Well, you know what? I never hit a girl before, and they almost knock my ass out and I might have to hit em and sleep they ass because she almost knocked my ass out, so it's like, you know. And trust me I never hit a girl first, ever, ever, never. It was always a girl slapped me because we might be making fun of each other or something—my play sister she slapped the shit outta my ass for making fun of her. And another girl when I was at the club she slapped the shit outta my ass. I didn't know how the club rules worked (Laughter). I was at a strip club or whatever, and I was at the front part and she was dancing, and I wasn't paying I was just looking and I was with my friend, and I think it was my friend's birthday, I took him out on his birthday. This when I was younger I felt I was doing it big, rented the limo and everything, took him out, and man, she smack!

Frank: For not paying?

BasedGod: Yea, lip was bleeding and shit like that. And you know I acted like I was gonna do something, you know what I'm saying? Like I got up and 'Oh okay', and I picked up the chair, looking cool. Picked up the chair like I was gonna do something. And you know, deep down inside I didn't wanna do nothing. You know I wasn't gonna beat her up. But I still did something, I was like 'What?'. Security got my ass out fast than anything, so I really couldn't do nothing anyway.

Frank: I never heard of that. Yea, she was wildin. That's why you came out w the 'Stealing from Strippers' song? (Laughter)

BasedGod: Wildin, that was early. That's why people's wondering why I come out with the song. I got some shit that's gon come out sooner, and it's gonna be like, motherfuckers like, people are gonna be like 'Wow', you know, this 'Thugged Out, Pissed Off' gonna be talking about that, you know beating up bitches and things of that nature, because now to the outside people they might be like, 'Oh, this is horrible.' or misogynistic or whatever it is, but then once you talk to me... this guy never hit a woman but he's been attacked and what he's been through, and then you gotta be like, hmmm well, you know what? I'll speak on shit and then motherfuckers will hit me like, 'Well, you can't speak on shit because you've never been through it.' But you don't know, motherfuckers don't know. Niggas don't know what a motherfucker survived through.

Frank: Yea, true. You know, I've been thinking about something. I've been talking about moving to London since 2012. The only reason I bring that up is because I was always thinking man—this example is stupid, but today I was leaving the hotel, and I was at the elevator and something told me to go back to my room and get some Kleenex because I'm a lil sick and I'll be in the car sneezing and get snot all on my fuckin sleeves and be upset. (Laughter) It's a very simple thing to just go back to the room and get the Kleenex. Yes, I know, I'm already at the elevator, but it's a very simple thing to just turn around and go back to the hotel room get some Kleenex and head back down to the car. A lot of the times though, I'd say, 'Well, self, I'm already over here at this elevator, so im not finna do that.' Then the next thing I know, I'm in the car sneezing and I got snot all on my sleeves. I feel like we know what we're supposed to do, we've got the supreme wisdom. With the whole relocation to London thing, my mind was playing tricks on me. I started to think if I had moved when my intuition first told me to move... then certain shit wouldn't have happened. So now, I always go back to the hotel room. 

BasedGod: Okay, peep this: I was at Starbucks I was getting over this cold naturally I was drinking chamomile tea every day. I don't know what made me buy chamomile tea every day idk. I was like imma buy this everyday just getting over this cold. I was going through the drive thru every day and it was normal for me it became the normal thing so something told me to go inside Starbucks and something made me walk inside and I tried something new, I went and I said lemme try peppermint tea, which changed my life. Healed my cold asap. And I'm like why the fuck I was so stuck on drive thru chamomile tea, and something told me to try something new, and I did it and it felt amazing, and that was my new breakthrough, and when I did it a thought came to my head, and it was about manhood and lifehood and seeing how it's not easy for anybody, like our parents, because they were all our age and they all were just acquiring habits of living, and I was just trying to live when I was buying this chamomile tea every day, I'm like I'm livin, just surviving the day, we're not perfect. You know what I'm saying? So you know you'll give that game to your kids too, you might be drinking chamomile tea every day and if it works for you, you gon tell your son, 'Hey drink this every day. You can drink the chamomile too.' but it showed me when I took the other choice, make sure that you see other options and don't stay just on that one, you know what I'm saying? And don't stay so strict on that one.

Frank: That reminds me, there's an engineer named Jason I worked with on this album. He'll be eating barley you know, raw barley and he'll have the drops on hand to put in the water to make the ph balance and the minerals or whatever, and it occurred to me... see I have friends who are really curious and so whenever they're around new people they tend to ask a lot of questions and like really try and get to know people. As for me, I can be aloof. Not in any cold way I hope, let's say I'm big on giving people their space and not getting all in people's mix, and it just occurred to me recently that I should ask people more questions (Laughter) like 'Jason, when you're not at work what's your breakfast lunch and dinner game plan?' And then he'll say some shit that I didn't know, something I might wanna use for my daily lifestyle. Or what someone is reading, he reads a lot of artist biographies and I'd never asked him, 'Which autobiographies have you read?' like why have I never asked him that, I'm always reading and tryna learn from people who aren't right next to me. Discrimination based off proximity. (Laughter)

Mikey: You know it's a crazy wives' tale about how you wanna start moving on in your career and stuff, doing more and have some more sponsors and people were saying how it's hella easy, like usually you could ask me and you don't even know it. So there's an old wives' tale about diamond mining and this dude found this big old diamond and everybody gathers around him, and are like, 'What the hell? Where'd you find that?' 'It's a big nice diamond. I'm not telling you where I found this,' so everyone starts going to mountains, trees and they start doing crazy stuff, killing animals, opening their stomachs, when really diamonds are right here in the ground. It's crazy that thought sometimes that makes it go crazy.

BasedGod: Just those situations, you know, fuckin w anybody... not being scared to talk to people and ask, you know what I'm saying? Cus when I was overseas and in these other places you know Harlem—Harlem Netherlands or something like that—I was just walking in the shit because I'm foreign, and I didn't care, and it's cool, like a nigga would walk and out here and I have to remember that. Because I feel like there's so many barriers. Niggas was asking me to pull my pants up for so long so I always had these barriers. And I finally had to break the shit down, I'm not different. We're not different. No matter how motherfuckers might try to make you feel. You a legend bruh. You gotta realize I just got comfortable walking in random places, cus like I got money I could do what I want. Like in a way, to an extent, but like for the Base level, you know like niggas could go in anywhere and we could do, even to eat, just say, to eat. So my thing was I was so wrapped up in how I look or how I thought I looked but, nigga like, we should be able to go in any restaurant any place. I used to think and be so into my head and worry about what people thought about me and that used to hinder me. I used to not do as much as I could. Like my nigga why am I still eating fast food? I'm eating fruit all time now, you know it's beautiful, we got the fruit downstairs.

Frank: Yea you told me you went to Whole Foods before you came here. Said you were a lil late because you had to stop at the market and get those fruits and vegetables. (Laughter)

BasedGod: I got another one, here it goes, I ordered a sandwich. I was a little hungry and I automatically flipped on dude like before I even opened it. Like 'Why the fuck is this sandwich not cut?' I opened it a lil bit and it was cut. You just gotta wait sometimes. I tripped like, 'What the fuck. Niggas can't get shit right. This dude.' I just opened it a little bit just waited, wait. Not expecting the worse. And I'm just like 'Boom!'... I'm just a fucking ass

Frank: Dog, what? (Laughter)

Frank: I think we got it man. (Laughter)

BasedGod: This is so great. I'm so glad you made this happen bro.

BasedGod:This was a good one my brother.

Frank: Peace to the God. Thanks a lot. It was great to see you in the flesh.

BasedGod: You think I could take a picture of you bruh on the professional camera?

BasedGod: I'm on my Terry Richardson.
My boyfriend drives a lil bucket
When it rain it fills up with rain
My boyfriend he gon pick me up
Don't distract him at the wheel
In his lane
He's the only one

My boyfriend he misses me when I'm gone
So he don't forget me
There's a song he sings
Calms his nerve, endings
My boyfriend is friendly
And we don't want no problems

I could say that I'm happy
They let me and my boyfriend become married
I could say that I'm happy
But cross my heart I didn't notice
Hope to die no never, we voted
Me and my boyfriend cast our ballot
Every kiss reads like a poem
Making wrongs right like a poem
I couldn't say I dream of you
Because my dreams are filled with no one
And all is lost
Me and my boyfriend we found
We don't hope for beyonds at all
Me and my boyfriend spend time
And that's all I'm holding on
This time

We got permission
Nothing's above condition
But this ain't a thang
It's a mission

Can't join the band so sing along
Me and my boyfriend got it going on
Sleep with fans and t shirts on
Asleep in vans your legs all strewn
Across my lap
Tan lines where your watch was strapped
You took off to make time

Cut your hair
You left it so long
I love to stare
There's nothing wrong
And if I die while I'm asleep
I pray to God my boyfriend
Keeps my secret
Peace

[Intro]
When the wind blows
That ain't really loud
Couldn't raise his voice cause his wind gone
Nigga sound like Reggie
If life is a woman them walls gone
They ran through her already

[Verse]
I'm thinking
My life is a virgin like wife in all white and
Tonight I'm determined
To give her insight, eat her right till she creams
'Till she writhes with delight
Ándale ándale, make her pray to the pipe
Make her worship that false phallic idle
I slide deep inside
Not too deep, not too shallow
I'm mindful of size
She's chockful of my swipe like a capsule
Sealed tight with that substance you need
Start a family tonight
In this Camry we might
Mean this big body Merc with the leather
Oak and the LED lights
That I don't even drive
I'm in London tonight
And it's all overpriced
The dollar been cheap than a bitch
Tuberose and tulips
On the boxes you're in
From the holes in your skin
Hit the road and get rich
Or stay home and get broke
It's your choice in the end
Yeah they watchin' my fence
Like they next to my kin
Like they paid by the pope
Got some priests by the door
Frisk the demons before they step into my glow
Oh my my
Get it, get it
I saw you, Chinese birthday
With a strawberry icee
Channeling Morrissey
Were we at the rave, dancing horribly
Pulse went through my face and my clear backpack
Sonic sound you made me
I know you're in here somewhere
You came with someone
There's something you need
Hope you don't think I'm easy
What starts inside these hallways
Always comes and goes
I come from nothing
Like you come from nothing
Light like a laser cut from the navel
Til it's dark as a plum
Back where we're from
Don't take life so serious
If you find another
He could sleep right here
Between the two of us
I'll move over some
I hope he doesn't think I'm easy
Between the three of us
There's no one sleeping cold
Nobody said it would be easy
With you on my mind
I'm scared to think alone
Ohh why was it never this easy
The windows raise to show us
Daylight's come again
Two years ago I found an image of a kid with her hands covering her face. A seatbelt reached across her torso, riding up her neck and a mop of blonde hair stayed swept, for the moment, behind her ears. Her eyes seemed clear and calm but not blank, the road behind her seemed the same. I put myself in her seat then I played it all out in my head. The claustrophobia hits as the seatbelt tightens, preventing me from even leaning forward in my seat. the pressing on internal organs. I lean back and forward to release it. Then backwards and forward again. There it is—I got free. How much of my life has happened inside of a car? I wonder if the odds are that I'll die in one. Knock on wood-grain. Shouldn’t speak like that. We live in cars in some cities, commuting across space either for our livelihood, or devouring fossil fuels for joy. It's close to as much time as we spend in our beds, more for some. The first time I did shrooms, my manager had to come rescue me from Caltech’s ‘Trip Day.’ As I got into her car, I swear to God the aluminum center console in her Porsche truck looked like it was breathing, like the throat of something. On the freeway, leaving Pasadena, we spoke and I looked away, outside, at the wheels and tires of cars doing that optical illusion thing they do where it looks like they’re spinning backwards, which, according to Google, happens because our brains are assuming something completely wrong and showing it to us. Staring, I was transfixed by all the indicator lights oscillating and throbbing against the wind. We drove thru downtown LA headed west, flying on the same freeways I used to run outta gas on. Welcomed in by the perennial creatures, imperial palm trees and climbing vines living their lives out just off the shoulder. The feeling familiar enhanced, on the 10. I used to ride around in my sinewy crossover SUV, smoke and listen to rough mixes of my old shit before it came out, or whatever someone wanted to play when they hooked up their iPhone to the aux cord. A few years and few daily-drivers later I'm not driving much anymore. It's been a year since I moved to London, at the time of writing this, and there's no practical reason to drive in this city. I ordered a GT3 RS and it'll keep low miles out here but I guess it's good to have in case of emergency :) Raf Simons once told me it was cliché, my whole car obsession. Maybe it links to a deep subconscious straight boy fantasy. Consciously though, I don't want straight—a little bent is good. I found it romantic, sometimes, editing this project. The whole time I felt as though I was in the presence of a $16m McLaren F1 armed with a disposable camera. My memories are in these pages, places closeby and long ass-numbing flights away. Cruising the suburbs of Tokyo in RWB Porsches. Throwing parties around England and mobbing freeways in four project M3S that I built with some friends. Going to Mississippi and playing in the mud with amphibious quads. Street-casting models at a random kung fu dojo out in Senegal. Commissioning life-size toy boxes for the fuck of it. Shooting a music video for fun with Tyrone Lebon, the genius giant. Taking a break/reconnaissance mission to Tulum, Mexico, enjoying some star visibility for a change. Recording in Tokyo, NYC, Miami, LA, London, Paris. Stopping in Berlin to witness Berghain for myself. Trading jewels and soaking in parables with the many-headed Brandon aka BasedGod in conversation. I wrote a story in the middle—It’s called “Godspeed.” It's basically a reimagined part of my boyhood. Boys do cry, but I don't think I shed a tear for a good chunk of my teenage years. It's surprisingly my favorite part of life so far. Surprising, to me, because the current phase is what I was asking the cosmos for when I was a kid. Maybe that part had its rough stretches too, but in my rearview mirror it's getting small enough to convince myself it was all good. And really though... It's still all good

Even the McRib was jealous of the fries

And he only be there some of the time
Everybody was jealous of them french fries
Except for that one special guy
That smooth apple pie

I'll wait 'till the stars and sun burn out

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Why do birds suddenly appear?
Every time that you are near to me baby?
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes
So true
And that is why

Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
There's a very strange vibration
Piercin' me right to the core
It says, "Turn around you fool
You know, you love her more and more"
Tell me why is it so
I don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, baby
I never can say goodbye
No no no, no no no, no no no

I never can say goodbye...
I had the time of my life making all of this
Thank you all
Especially those of you who never let me forget I had to finish
Which is basically everyone of y'all

[Verse 1]
Under the great lone star
Try to work out where you are
In the silence of the sea
I don't know where I've been
In the future, in the past
Going nowhere much too fast
When I go there follow me
When I go there follow me

[Chorus]
'Cause i don't know where I'm going but I wanna talk
I feel like I'm going where I've been before
And
I wanna talk

[Verse 2]
Take a picture of
Something that you're not sure of
Bring it back to show me
But I don't know what I see
In the future, find a home
Getting nowhere on your own
Got to find your missing piece

[Chorus Variation]
'Cause you don't know where you're going but you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before
And nothing's really making any sense at all
You tell any one who'll listen that you feel ignored
Lets talk
Lets talk
Do you wanna talk?

[Verse 3]
I'm looking upon the floor
I'm trying to sing a song
In a language I don't speak
I try but I can't get through
I'm trying to get to you
But you're difficult to reach

Won't you talk... to....me....

Oooo...

So you don't know where you're going but you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before

Let's talk, let's talk ...
Let's talk, let's talk ...

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes, but the real ones
Just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick, I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
R.I.P. Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papá
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' 'bout somethin'
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body-jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came witcha
But he ain't witcha
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin' pheromones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
I may be younger, but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here, I'll save some for you
I'm not him, but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

[Verse 3: KOHH]
一人の男
たくさんかわいい女の子
誰かのことを 誰も縛れはしない
他人の心
まあ、飲みたいならお酒でも飲もう（ふぉ）
彼女がいたり、彼氏がいたり
気の合っちゃう人間２人
しょうがない
男たちと 女たち
去るもの追わず
来るもの選ぶ
それだけの話
今しかない時間
大事にしな
何億万人も
いい人ならいるよ
あの子がまたモデルの子に嫉妬
でも好きなら好き
無理なら無理だし
次から次に （次に）
類が友を呼んでくれるいつも （類が友を呼ぶ）
たまには離れてみるのも必要 （必要, 必要）
自由にする まるでパリスヒルトン (パリスヒルトン)
The early chapters of my book included bus passes
Now its tire traction off like fuck crashes, ask him how?
Insurance higher than the lease bill, run flats when the feet peel
Fish tail, the boy eats meals, tummy ache from my cheap thrills
Granny hug the way the seat feel, on the left turn, leave the neck burned
From the frost bit links, size of an earth worm, wasted on last check earned
I’m, expecting this so it ain't odd, two 5’s on the paint job, lactose, wide body, fat ghost
Grannys watch over me when I act slow, rev till I plateau
Keys sorted on the hip, jeff gordon is his mind, life’s forza on the strip
Switch gears like I take breaths, wish I had 8
Left 6 got skipped, went to 7th from the 5th
More advance than your average
I like coupes, two shit
When my friends pull up, stops turn into a pageant
But until I get that enzo, its chapter uno
But I know what that bus pass turned into, its magic

[Cathy]

See, Rufus is going to have to understand that he has a wife, and she loves him
Now, I vowed on that day that we got married that I would always be there for him
Now, it's a big responsibility to be a pastor of a church, I understand
But to be a pastor, you have to practice what you preach, and be a responsible man
Now, regardless to all the mistakes we made, he's going to have to make a choice
Now, it's me or whatever the... hell he is
Or, damn it, I want a divorce

[Dr. William T. Perry]

(Talking into a phone)
....got your text message. I love you too, honey. Okay, bye

Rufus, Cathy, how you doing? Come on in, have a seat
Can I get you something to drink?

[Cathy]

No, I'd rather just get right to it

[Perry]

Alright

[Rufus]

I'll take a water, doc

[Perry]

One water coming up

Shirley, can you bring a water in?

[Shirley]

Evian or sparkling?

[Rufus]

Sparkling

[Shirley]

Sir, would you like that on ice?

[Cathy]

Please, can we get right down to it?
That would be nice

[Rufus]

No ice, please

[R. Kelly, Narrating]

Session One

[Perry]

So, you've been having problems in your relationship
I want you to take your time and just elaborate on it
Do you mind if I tape this?

[Rufus]                

[Cathy]

Yes.                        No

[Pause]

[Rufus]

I mean... I mind

[Cathy]

(Scoffs) Yeah, I know you do

[Rufus]

Well, you shouldn't want our business recorded, either!

[Cathy]

What business?!, Rufus, it seems like everybody already knows!

[Rufus]

Yeah, and just what everybody are you referring to?

[Cathy]

Oh, everybody!
Everybody...
They know about Chuck...
Me and you

[Rufus]

Yeah, well what about Sylvester, huh?
And you and him
Do they know about that, too?

[Cathy]

Yeah, I guess they do...

(To Perry)

Do you mind if I smoke?

[Perry]

Go right ahead...

Well, let's do this
Before this all gets out of hand
Just talk about your main concerns
And what bothers you about this relationship the most
Cathy, you go first
And Rufus, listen and try to understand

[Kelly, Narrating]

Cathy starts telling the doc, how, in the beginning, everything was fine
Then, outta nowhere, she starts crying and screaming, and putting everything out on the line

[Cathy]

And everything he told me
(Sobbing) I mean, everything I believed
And I just don't understand, doc, how he could want another man over me, oh!

[Perry]

How do you feel about that, Rufus?

[Pause]

Rufus?

[Rufus]

When I first met Cathy, it was just like... meeting Heaven
I had just finished school, and became a reverend
And everything I needed, she provided...

[Cathy]

What happened, Rufus?!

[Rufus]

But then I met Chuck, and somehow got misguided!

[Cathy]

Oh!

[Perry]

So you went off the road that you were meant to travel?

[Rufus]

Yes, I did!

[Cathy]

Despite the fact you knew every word in the Bible, Rufus!

[Rufus]

(To Perry) I'm sorry!

[Perry]

Don't look at me, look at Cathy!

[Rufus]

(To Cathy) I'm sorry!

[Cathy]

You really went and screwed things up, Rufus!

[Rufus]

Cathy, please! I'm sorry!

[Cathy]

So, tell me this! Do you love him?

[Rufus]

Baby, I'm sorry! Sorry!

[Cathy]

Rufus, do you love him?!

[Rufus]

Help me, Lord!

[Cathy]

Doc, I'm out of here, I've tried!
I've done all I can!

[Rufus]

YES! Yes! Yes! Yes

[Cathy]

Yes, what, Rufus?

[Rufus]

I still love that man!

[Perry]

Wait a minute, Mrs. Longs

[Cathy]

I'm gone

[Perry]

Let's work it out

[Cathy]

No

[Perry]

Rufus, Mrs. Longs!

[Cathy]

(Tearfully) Looks like Rufus already worked it out!
I'm out of here!

[Rufus]

Cathy...

[Perry]

Pastor, wait
I'll go speak to her

[Pause]

[Rufus]

(Beginning to pray) ... What have I done?

[Verse One]
I walk in the room there's a beautiful sunshine ray
Across the room
Then I hear the phone ring walk to it and I don't know what to say
Hello, good day
But what I do know, is that tonight is gonna be the night, when

[Chorus]
He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
When, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
When, I'll say, oh, I'll say I love him too
And, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade
Then he'll drive me home listenin' to the radio
And, he says he really loves me too, he'll do anything

[Verse Two]
Oh, I walk through the door there's a beautiful moonlight shine
Across the room
I crawl into bed thinkin' what I did today
With him
But what I do know, is that, I love him too
And the next time I see
Him walking down the street(down the street)
I'll think about this time, that was as beautiful as sunshine, oh

[Chorus]
He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
Yeah, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
And I'll say, I love you too, yeah, I love you
Oh, I'll say, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade
Then he'll drive me home, listenin' to the radio
Then, he says, he really loves me and he'll do anything

[Bridge]
I look in his brown eyes, and see a surprise
It's like a present that you open
Oh, and do you know, oh, do you know
What that surprise is?
It's love
And the next time I see him walking down the streets in his old white T-shirt, I'll always remember
This time, that was as beautiful as sunshine

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, sunshine, oh, oh, oh, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine, was as beautiful as sunshine

[Verse 1]
Stuck in the clouds
That's my story and I'm sticking to it
I'm high as a kite
Don’t bother me
I'm out here probably doing the most

[Verse 2]
From the minute I wake up I'm staring at the screen
Watching the world go insane
Gotta stay connected so I know what's happening
In these streets
Thank God for technology 'cause
Where would we be if we couldn't tweet our thoughts?
Won't you leave some things to mystery?
Opening your mouth removes all doubt
So be quiet
Technology is the key to it all

[Verse 3]
Where did I lose my phone at?
Doesn't really matter 'cause you're already behind the curve
It's okay to disconnect sometimes
We're out here doing the most

We don't care (hair up)
Put your hair in the air (hair up)
We don't care (hair up)

[Hook: Justin Timberlake & Ron Funches]
Hair in the air
Put your hair
Put your hair in the air
Hair in the air
Put your hair
Put your hair in the air

[R. Kelly, Narrating]

Well, if this hasn't taught you nothin' else, it's taught you that
Everybody's got a closet
And they own problems that need solvin'

Could this be another case
Of "what comes around comes back around"?
And "what goes up must come--"

Well y'all've heard the sayin'
Y'all get the point
Let me get back to the story
'Cause these next chapters of 'Trapped in the Closet' is gonna be so crazy

Sylvester and Gwen, chillin' in the bed, watchin' TV
No drama
Phone rings, he says, "Hello?"
Somebody says, "Sylvester?"
He says, "Who is this, and how did you get this number?"
Cathy and Rufus decides to do a little shopping downtown, only she can't
Her phone rings again
She says, "Rufus, it's those people again."
He says, "Hang up. Hang up."

Now everything seems to calm down between Big Man, James, and Bridget
'Till Bridget gets a call
Someone says, "We wanna talk to you,"
She says, "Who is this?"
"Mmmh hmm."
(Gasp) "Am I gonna be famous?"

Twan on the corner, in the front of the liquor store, talkin' on his cell phone, somebody calls, he switch over and says, "Speak on it!"
"Who?"
"Man, don't be fuckin' with me!"
"You shittin' me?"
"How much am I gettin' paid?"

Then Rosie and Randolph gets a call!
"Hello!"
Then, then Tina and Roxane gets a call!
"Hello!"
Then Joey!
"Yeah, hello."
Reverend Moseley!
"Hello!"
Big Man!
"Dixies."
James!
"Yeah?"
Pimp Lucius!
"He-he-h-he-he--"
And they tried and tried and tried and tried, but there was no luck
When it came to gettin' in touch
With Chuck....
Where are you, Chuck?

[Intro]
Pineapples are in my head
Got nobody 'cause I'm brain-dead
Pineapples are in my head
Got nobody 'cause I'm brain-dead

[Verse 1]
Somewhere in Southend when you were fun
You took my hand and you made me run
Up past the prison to the seafront
You climbed the cliff edge and took the plunge

[Pre-Chorus]
Why can’t we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?
Let's climb the cliff edge and jump again (Whoo!)

[Chorus]
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)

[Verse 2]
Somebody said I'm a fuckin' slum
Don’t know where I belong
Maybe you’re fucking dumb
Maybe I’m just a bum
Maybe you’re fucking scum
Don’t you go psycho chum
I want you for the world
I want you all the time (stop)

[Chorus]
Pineapples are in my head
(When you were fun)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(You made me run)
Pineapples are in my head
(To the seafront)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(She took the plunge)

[Bridge]
Five thousand footsteps in your wet dress
Back to the house with your arms round my neck
We drank pork soda with tangled legs
I won’t forget how you looked at me then
I know I'm no sweet prince of love
Those times that we got drunk
Maybe Jamaica rum
Maybe some Jonnie Dub
Maybe you still think of us
Phone buzz, and still I jump
Why don't I say it then?
I want you all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
Why can’t we laugh now like we did then?
How come I see you and ache instead?
How come you only look pleased in bed?
Let's climb the cliff edge and jump again

[Chorus]
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)

[Outro]
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)
Pineapples are in my head
(Pineapples are in my head)
Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead
(Got nobody 'cause I’m brain-dead)

[Verse 1]
In the summer, took my gun
And made him go to Neverland
He was something, my old husband
He had all you'd ever want
Did you say something? What'd you say?
Was that your voice or was that me?
Little voices buzzing poison
Backward noise from everything
Dr. Swango says I'm psycho
Says they all from Neverland
They'll never ever let me be
Was that your voice or was that me?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Dirty Dustin, said he saw him
Playing ball with Dizzy Jim
Dizzy Jim had never spoken
Whispered back, "You murdered him"
My heart strings broke and it was me
I pull, they stretch infinitely

[Chorus]
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing

[Bridge]
Play with me, my love, in the summer sun
I'll be waiting in your favourite Cheshire grin
Lay with me, my dear, in the evening clear
I'll be dreaming in my paper-pale skin

[Chorus]
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing

[Outro]
In the summer silence, in the summer silence
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing

[Verse 1]
Baby, don't go
I'll stop breathing coke
No more bloody nose
No more John Does

[Chorus]
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your—

[Verse 2]
Burn through my love
Just like your drugs
I've had quite enough
Or lack thereof

[Chorus]
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your—

[Bridge]
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong—

[Chorus]
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your
Steam rolled hair, look into the glare and pop it, brother
Slick like 007, man, you fly like Kim Jong rockets with your—

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When I was young and stupid my love
Left to be a rock and roll star
He told me: "Please, don't worry"
Wise little smile that spoke so safely
He booked a one-way ticket
Out west, that's where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches

He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewellery​
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon
He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool but
My life turns in slow motion

[Chorus]
Bye-bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost

[Verse 2]
Where I was from in NOLA, no one
Left to be a rock and roll star
He'd stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby
I miss him, don't you blame me?
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust, he's
Chasing that pappy pipe dream

[Bridge]
I know you don't but I-
I know you don't but I still try
My thunder shook him down
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone but I-
That girl is gone but I still try
I think it's over now
The bullet hit but maybe not
I feel so fucking numb
It hits my head and I feel numb
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong

[Chorus]
Bye-bye, baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost

[Outro]

[Intro]
Smells good up here. Yeah, it’s the candle, yo it’s uh… yo it’s uh… Sausage... (Laughter) Sausage candle... Most people don’t do it the way I do it, very personal... So, like, even the money: twenties, twenties, twenties... Y'know, like whatever... I just like sausage-

[Verse 1]
I don't ever wanna pick a slice
One is pretty but the other lies
Chewing on a fat smoke
No filter but you're puffing
Sucking on a slim Vogue
Dark fingernail polish

[Verse 2]
I'm the treasure, baby, I'm the prize
Cut me rails of that fresh cherry pie
Shitty old pistola
Shot a bullet through my wallet
Gonna go to Pensacola
Gonna fuck my way through college

[Chorus]
You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cause you live in my daydreams
You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cause you live in my daydreams

[Verse 3]
Sitting pretty in the prime of life
I'm so tasty and the price is right
Stewing in the black dope
I'm filthy and I love it
Studebaker all gold
Got a shotgun in my pocket

[Chorus]
You've gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
I'm gonna sleep 'cause you live in my daydreams

[Verse 1]
When I was a boy, I lived on Poplar Street
Just a little child with plasters on my knees
Watching all the world from high up in the trees
I saw Mrs Moore sleep 'round with Mr Keats

[Chorus]
I feel like a new man
Red flowers in my bed
Breathe straight through the crisp air
Dead flowers in the sand
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, and
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, yeah

[Verse 2]
Mama always called that woman prosti-tits
For wearing lower cuts than most and red lipstick
One night Mrs Moore she made her eyes at me
Pulled me through her door and stuck her teeth in deep

[Chorus]
I feel like a new man
Red flowers in my bed
Breathe straight through the crisp air
Dead flowers in the sand
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, and
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, yeah

[Bridge]
And all your days are gone, sitting on the floor
In your underwear begging me for more
And all my days are gone, sitting on the floor
In my underwear, begging you for more
'Cause

[Chorus]
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, and
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict, yeah

[Outro]
Just another boy who lived on Poplar Street
Tangled up in lust and her exotic needs
One night, Mrs Moore, she called collect to me
"I don't love you anymore," she said and ceased to be
Just another boy
Just another boy
Just another boy

[Verse 1]
Agnes, just stop and think a minute
Why don't you light that cigarette and
Calm down now, stop and breathe a second?
Go back to the very beginning
Can't you see what was different then?
You were just popping Percocet
Maybe just four a week at best
Maybe a smoke to clear the head

[Pre-Chorus]
Your head is so numb, that nervous breath you try to hide
Between the motions, that trembling tender little sigh
And so it goes, a choking rose back
To be reborn, I want to hold you like you're mine

[Verse 2]
You see the sad in everything
A genius of love and loneliness and
This time, you overdid the liquor
This time, you pulled the fucking trigger
These days, you're rolling all the time
So low, so you keep getting high
Where went that cheeky friend of mine?
Where went that billion-dollar smile?

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess life is long when soaked in sadness
On borrowed time from Mister Madness
And so it goes, a choking rose back
To be reborn, I want to hold you like you're mine

[Chorus]
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why

These bitches want Nikes (This is a setup)

[Verse 1]

RIP Pimp C (rest in peace)
RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me

That's good for us

[Verse 2]
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

[Outro]
I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

[Chorus]
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

[Verse 1]
Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you?
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek?
'Cause, baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me, sayin'

[Chorus]
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

[Verse 2]
I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget
It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet

[Chorus]
And if you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

[Verse 3]
Love was all we knew, and faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had, and for one summer, you were mine
Sayin'

[Chorus]
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least I'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved
They treat you rough out there
But we've got Alcantara everywhere
Ferrari

Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mine on the road
Your dilated eyes
Watch the clouds float
White Ferrari
Had a good time
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're so familiar
White Ferrari
Good times
I care for you still
And I will
Forever
That was my part of the deal
Honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari
Good times
(In this life)
You love me still and you will forever
You got that part of the deal
We got so familiar
Running my hands thru your hair
White Ferrari
Had a good time
(in this life)

One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids
On a facelift
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it it'll be over in no time
And that's life

I'll drop you off and in a few months
We'll talk again
When you need a break
Which part of the circle will you stand on
You keep doing the dance wrong

I'm sure we're taller in other dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of moving
Your body's aching
We should vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull
Least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam
Like a mirage
Always one step ahead
Where we belong
I've got a son somewhere
He'll be picking up where I left off
I might name that boy Ferrari
He'll meet a girl named Altashonda
He'll treat her soft like Alcantara
My brain is soft like Alcantara
My hands are rough, I'm iguana
Your hair is long, are you Nicaraguan?
I can't go soft, I'm Viagran
You want it all
You're always one step ahead
Where you belong
Steely walks up to the parking structure of the corporate campus where Garten's car is located. Florence is manning the security desk. Looks on at Steely knowingly. This is one of Florence's gigs.

     Florence: 'C'mon.'
     Florence: 'Don't get yourself into anything you can't get out of child.'
     Florence: 'Gimme.' (Pointing at the bulge in his pocket.)

Walks past security into the empty underworld of parking levels—few overnighted vehicles here and there. He goes to where he left Garten's car and gets in. He pulls out a box of smokes and reads the warning label. He smokes a cigarette and begins looking at his teeth in the mirror. Garten's keys are inside as before. He starts the car. He drives normally, calmly, making his way off the corporate campus onto the highway, and getting off at an exit leading to a neighborhood nestled by woods. There is a subdivision ahead of him comprised mostly of high-rises. There's a lake passed.
Steely is walking barefoot through a hardwood hallway into a kitchen space that is futuristic and primitive at the same time. The kitchen consists of a small pool of self-replenishing fresh water, light cleansers instead of soaps, a BBQ pit, a stone oven, cabinets that are refrigerated and store food, dishes and cutlery. The floor is perforated with vents that heat and vacuum the floor for debris. Potted plants are in the windows as well as above the pool of water. Steely takes two bowls out of a cabinet, a knife, two spoons, a jar of milk, honeycomb, and bananas off a hook. He begins to prepare one bowl of oatmeal and one bowl of cereal. He slices a banana on a wood cutting board, places the banana slices on top of both bowls, swirls some honey on the oatmeal then walks back through the hallway.

The hardwood hallway extends into a room where Shoobie is seated in front of a white desk with a translucent top that is eventually lit from beneath. She’s sketching schematics with graphite while 3-D printing small pieces of the design from the sketch paper directly. Steely places the cereal on her table and sits on a full-sized bed cornered against the far left wall. Steely eats and looks around the room. Photos and schematics are placed on the wall, bed sheets spill onto the floor and Shoobie’s wearing PE shorts, varsity hoodie, ankle socks and a messy ponytail. It’s a perfectly lived-in moment that feels right in the ways you’d hope for when two people comfortably cohabitate. Just then he noticed a message in his field of vision.

BEGIN TEXT:

     Matthew:  ‘wya? wyd?’
     Steely:  ‘I’m here man. breakfast.’
     Matthew:  ‘ole oatmeal eatin’ ass boy’
     Danny:  ‘all star suck me ups last night’
Steely: ‘who?’
     Danny:  ‘imma bring her and her friend out to the water.’
     Steely:  ‘oh, OK.’
     Mathew: ‘about to shower---’
     Steely::‘Yea, I gotta do the same rn.’

Steely puts the phone down and finishes his bowl of oatmeal. Shoobie’s cereal sits untouched where he placed it, getting soggy.

Steely returns to the kitchen, puts the bowl in a light wash rack. He pulls on a shallow drawer and grabs a refrigerated metal slate from a stack of four. The slate responds to his touch, turning transparent while a swarm of light particles activate a 3-D projection an inch off its surface, making a mold of his hand. Steely places his hand into the particle mold then gets up and walks into the bathroom down the hall, to the right, then left of two bathrooms. Steely sits on the toilet and begins to masturbate to a video now playing on the slate. The ground changes hue.

There’s a signal that class is about to begin.
     Shoobie: ‘I’m going to class.’
     Steely: ‘Should go together.’
     Shoobie: ‘Yea – what about yours?’
     Steely: ‘I wasn’t going to go in there till later.’
     Shoobie: ‘Irrational fears again?
     Steely: ‘Naw…’
     Shoobie: ‘They won’t let you come into class late…’ (Steely cuts her off)
     Steely: ‘I know.’
     Shoobie: ‘Truant.’ (Stares him down)

They kiss. Steely leans into it a bit and reaches under her skirt. Students are watching them. She punches him playfully in the chest and he backs off. Steely leaves Shoobie standing there, while he disappears down a decline, through a grove of trees.

Steely arrives at the entrance to a gated community, as behind him a bullet train hydroplanes silently along a narrow band of water. He lights a flavored cigarette, drops it on the ground by accident and picks it up, he puffs it to keep it alive as he walks towards a guard post. As he approaches, a woman in her fifties hangs her head out of the doorway of the security quarters. Her name is Florence and it’s apparent she knows Steely.

Florence works multiple locations as a security guard and as Steely has developed his hobby of breaking into cars, he’s also developed a relationship with Florence. She suspects what he does but looks the other way, treating him as a favorite aunt would. She has a soft spot for him and occasionally Steely brings her cigarettes or coffee or a flower picked up along the way.

There are two mesh steel hates. In front of the gates are a row of solid metal cylindrical posts that swivel up and down into the ground.

     Florence: ‘C’mon child.’ (Lazily)

Steely speeds up to a slight jog up to her half door/half window.

     Steely: ‘Yes, ma’am,’
     Florence: ‘Put that out.’
     Steely: ‘Yes, ma’am,’
     Florence: ‘I’m proud of you. You know that, don’t you?’
     Steely: ‘Yes, ma’am,’
     Florence: ‘Give me a square, son.’
Steely goes in his parka pocket and hands two to the woman – she puts one to her mouth and lights it.

     Florence:  ‘Mmmhmm, go head on.’ (Turns an eye without turning her head.)

The gates clear, the posts lower.

Steely walks through the gates and down many stairs. Before exiting the stair well he stops to read a series of text messages from various senders.

BEGIN TEXT:

     Mia: ‘Another thought on perfection. The only problem with her is that she is too perfect. She is bad in a way that entices, and good in a way that comforts. She is mischief but then she is the warmth of home. The dreams of the wild and dangerous but the memories of childhood and gladness. She is perfection. And when given something perfect, it is the nature of man to dedicate his mind to finding something wrong with it and then when he is able to find something wrong with it, he rejoices in his find, and sees only the flaw, becoming blind to everything else! And this is why man is never given anything that is perfect, because when given the imperfect and the ugly, man will dedicate his mind to finding what is good with the imperfect and upon finding one good thing with the extremely flawed, he will only see the one good thing, and no longer see everything else that is ugly. And so...man complains to God for having less than what he wants...but this is the only thing that man can handle. Man cannot handle what is perfect. It is the nature. It is the nature of the mortal to rejoice over the one thing that he can proudly say that he found on his own, with no help from another, whether it be a shadow in a perfect diamond, or a faint beautiful reflection in an extremely dull mirror.

     Steely: ‘Sorry, I hope you feel better.’

     Shoobie: ‘Matthew’s house? bored. misu.’

He finishes his correspondence and continues on. The stairwell opens to a strip where two wide roads sit, parallel but not separate. The left-hand road leads to a Cape Cod  style country club and what looks like a beach. Near the country club, a split in the main road leads to another wide, two-way road where the opposite directions are paved at different heights, like a shelf. There’s a black sand beach on one side and mature manicured hedges on the other; the tops of homes are visible. Steely walks down the road and as he passes a second block, the road narrows and inclines to a cavernous walkway that winds through the greater community.

A guys with a long curly afro, wearing a white hooded jacket with 3M accents, shorts, waist weights, and Nike running shoes comes out of a property. He jogs in place and does some light stretches. Steely walks up to the guy who turns out to be his friend Matthew, while casually running his fingers across the hedges. The two of them wave low and perfunctorily at each other then cross paths. Though there’s acknowledgement, it seems a bit clandestine as if they’re about to set something in motion.

Matthew jogs downhill with his arms outstretched and banks right into a still narrower canopied alley. Steely stays in place and keeps time. Matthew is now jogging perfectly center though a lane with mesh steel garage door every 50 years. He picks up the pace in his jog as you see the garage door open ten yards ahead – a white single-seater begins to speed out the garage but manages to stop right before hitting Matthew. Matthew acts startled.

     Matthew:  (Yelling at the Garten, and slamming his hands on the hood) ‘DAMN – NICE BREAKS!’

Matthew then jogs on following the car as it speeds in a straight line away from the scene till it’s no longer visible. Matthew hits a corner, makes a right and meets Steely back in front of Matthew’s house. They walk inside the yard gate through hedges and past fountains down a ramp into a cave like living space with an unobstructed view of the ocean.

They pass cleaning staff and art leaning up against the walls. Outside the window you can see where his yard slopes down to the ocean side cliff. There’s a pool with a high dive, a solarium, a lone, odd colored dog sits gazing at them as they walk through the house and towards Matthew’s bedroom. Matthew changes clothes quickly as Steely is talking to him about weed.

     Matthew:  ‘Fronto leaves?? – You act like you discovered fire.’
     Steely:  ‘You ever catch Mr. and Mrs. Hagen intimate – in their moment. I’d bet you haven’t, because they’re stuck with you. How free will they be when you’re out on your own? There’s a place for you in this world bro and I’m your friend, ok?’
     Matthew:  ‘You’re acting out now, you can stop.’
     Steely:  ‘Mrs. Hagen I’m sure is still very agile on that horse.’
     Matthew:  ‘You want some water or something?’
     Steely:  ‘Yea. Do you dance still. You used to be a good dancer. (Walks away to kitchen)
     Matthew:  ‘Pour my shake out the blender!’
     Steely:  (Calling out from kitchen) ‘Nah, you don’t have any ice!’
     Matthew:  (Calling out from bedroom) ‘Who the fuck said anything about ice?!’’
     Steely:  ‘Sorry, you know I really appreciate you buddy. I couldn’t find anything quite right for Shoobie’s birthday – everything’s so generic to her, she just scans it with her computer eyes.’

Steely walks into the bedroom again, Matthew is ready to leave. Steely hands him a shake and eats small pieces of fruit while finishing a blue can of Coke. The two of them exit Matthew’s room into an area where nothing else is in the shot apart from a right-hand drive Nissan Skyline from a hundred years ago and a small orange groove. Steely re-lights the fronto leaf blunt.

     Matthew:  ‘Put the fronto out. Drive.’

Later on the drive.

     Steely:  ‘I can’t think it’s too many notes.’
     Steely:  ‘He’s not on the 5 yet. That’s impossible.’
     Matthew:  ‘People are fucked.’
     Steely:  ‘He’s taking his time. How did he look when you ran into him?’
     Matthew:  ‘People are so fucked… Uhh, yea – he looked really happy to see me.’
     Steely:  ‘What are you talking..(cuts himself off)? Why are people fucked? That include you or nah?’
     Matthew: ‘People are just bad, like, toward other people. I should quit giving this traffic...but I can’t.’
     Steely:  ‘You gonna tell me something I don’t know?’ (Says this with the look on his face and not words.)
     Matthew:  ‘I showed you this already, but watch again.’ Handing Steely his phone to watch something.
     Matthew:  ‘When the lady gets sent to the neighbors house by her uncle to fight someone and she ends up running and getting chased, then falls down, breaks her shit and they set her on fire..’
     Steely:  ‘Yea, that hurt my feelings. She seemed to confident.’
     Steely:  ‘Did you listen to that Goye thing I told you about?’
     Matthew:  ‘Yeah. Are those lights new?’ (Looking at lights that follow the highway railing.)

Topography blurred outside the vehicle grass – suburbia and city overlapping – hyper color – non specific.

Matthew pulls into a sprawling office campus. We see a network of buildings, there are people from the company walking about engaged in conversation. One group in particular is huddled and highlighted.

     Colleague #1:  ‘Exploded?!’
     Colleague #2:  ‘Without heat?’
     Colleague #3:  ‘Yeah, or human shrapnel.’
     Colleague #2:  ‘So absent of heat, absence of residual bio and absent of our guy.’
     Colleague #1:  ‘He’s jumped on grenades before and lived.’
     Colleague #2:  ‘Chemiluminescence isn’t the mark of a grenade.’
     Colleague #3:  ‘Maybe saving the world a few times makes you eligible for dharmic ascension?’

Office campus is a ‘CAR FREE IS A CAREFREE’ zone – there is offsite parking for commuters.

Matthew’s car is stopped. They trade places at the wheel and Steely gets out. He walks towards the outskirts of the office campus. Matthew tries to pull unto the parking structure which is multi-level and underground. He begins to argue with the security person manning the entrance.

     Matthew:  ‘Why are you telling me I can’t park here?? It’s a free world.’
     Parking Security:  ‘Credentials please, sir? Sir. Sir. This is a corporate facility, credentials please.’
     Matthew:  ‘What’s the corporate ever done for me?! Huh? Since you know every God damn thing. What they done?? I should sit down right here and take a hot shit in the facilities.’

Steely walks down the ramp into the structure casually, trying not to be noticed – the distracted guard notices and chases after him shouting about credentials. Steely breaks into a sprint. Seconds later a small low flying autonomous aircraft is heard in pursuit of Steely down the structure.  Steely spot’s Garten’s car, the one that almost hit Matthew earlier, slides over the tip of it and almost falls of the edge of the parking structure which cascades into a waterfall, leading down into channels below street level.

Steely regains his balance and struggles with his car boosting key card, trying to gain access to Garten’s car. It isn’t letting him into the car and he begins to panic, but finally it clicks on – you can hear the whistle and the buzz of the security drone flying towards him. He slides down the seat so as not to be visible from the window. The drone flies to the edge of the parking structure and hovers, observing downward as the water flows. It then turns around and heads back to continue its search elsewhere. Just then Steely feels the vibration of an incoming message.

BEGIN TEXT:

     Unknown contact:  ‘Chase the rabbit three ways down, a ways to go.’
Steely:  ‘Who’s there?’
     Unknown contact:  ‘Do you have time?’

Steely’s baffled by the text but doesn’t have time to dwell on it, he starts the car and begins looking for another spot to park it, far enough from the original spot so as not to be noticed but still within the same parking structure. The perfect spot is three levels down. He carefully exits the car, makes his way into a common walkway towards a lift, gets inside though it’s crammed with people, and squeezes in amongst the plain-clothed engineers and corp. Employees all talking in code and oblivious to Steely.

Elevator doors open. Above ground it’s raining. Everyone braces for the rain as they exit. Steely puts his hood on and walks into an overpass. Billboards tower above it showing blue skies, a beach scene and a slogan that reads: “It’s June in Miami”. The rain continues pouring down, he’s still in the thick of the crowd. Steely exits down a ramp, jumps over a shallow ledge, walks under an overpass – there’s traffic speeding past him blurred – and begins to wait. Matthew pulls his car over, shining his lights on Steely. Steely gets into the car and steals the cigarette Matthew just lit from his mouth. Cars speed past going under and over intersections. A song played.

[Intro: Kilo Kish, Paige Montgomery, Ariana Grande & Chloe Clancy]
Where are you?
Oh-oh (Hehehe)
Oh
The Divine Feminine, an album by Mac Miller
Oh-oh (The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
The Divine Feminine
Ooh (Hehehe, hehe)

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
Am I supposed to? Okay... love
Love, love, love, love, love (Sex)
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love (Sex)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this all I know
I felt the highs and they feel like you
See, a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl, I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl, I'm so in love with you

[Bridge 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Baby), yeah, yeah
Um, well

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Baby, you were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college?
Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said, "All you ever think about is sex"
I'm like, "Oh well, you know me so well
And if this what make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail"
Well, I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass is what Heaven's like
And when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
It's my only chance, I better get it right

[Bridge 2: Mac Miller]
Take your time, my baby
It's all waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But it's all waitin' right here for you, for you

[Outro: Bilal]
You get closer with, run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your lovely ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world, in my world
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Steely walks down a street with the pace of someone with some place to go but who has left early enough to get there. He holds a rectangular metallic card smaller than his palms with grooves on its surface. The street is quiet, the sidewalk clean. As he walks, he occasionally slows to peer inside the windows of parked cars. The cars have a familiar look though it’s obvious their designs are several generations ahead. The elegant lines, the materials and tech apparent in the construction are the result of years of engineering advances beyond the present.

The city feels simultaneously old and new, weathered by time and progress, lending it a distinctive quality. A modern city embracing technology but somewhat overtaken by nature, still trying to find a balance. There are pick-ups and wagons amongst the luxury cars, very democratic. Steely peers into a car with a cigarette in the ashtray. Using the metallic card, he swipes it against the car’s access strip and gains entry. He steals the cig, lights it and walks a few cars down. He notices a hanging air freshener in another car and decides he likes it, breaks into that car as well taking the fragrant contraband. The stillness is mesmerizing, you can barely hear the autobahn in the distance or the steps of his companion just a few feet ahead.

Caged court centered in a park somewhat densely populated with live oak trees, their limbs perfectly frame rather than reach above the court. Clark is around 5’10” or 11”, lean but strapping and towering compared to a seemingly younger Steely who just beamed a ball at Clark and nearly landed a punch before Robb and Matthew body-blocked.  Clark would have hurt him, badly, obviously, as Steely is a few years younger and developing a physique to match his mental toughness.

     Robb: ‘Whoa whoa whoa level down…’
     Matthew: ‘Kiss and make up, friends. It’s a contact sport.’
     Steely: ‘Nah, miss me with that, he always tryna big man somebody.’
     Clark: (Checks his face for blood. Spits.) ‘Game point.’

Steely steps up to guard him, placing his hand on Clark’s side to telegraph his movements. Clark crosses him, drives and lays the ball up, winning the game.

     Clark: ‘Whoo! (RIC FLAIR voice) Did you feel that? Did you sense the sublime finesse and technique just then? You should be grateful. You should be grateful for me. Here.’
     Steely: ‘Blah, blah, blah.’ (Shrugs and mimes, picks the dead basketball up off the ground and does a tricky slam dunk with excess energy.)

The quiet of the morning scene continues, Steely and Shoobie continue walking as if in a dream. No birds, no other people, no sounds of cars. You see cars though, and you can hear a faint wind occasionally disrupt the silence as it passes between the rubber of the vehicles and the concrete. The skyline is a blended ecosystem of the natural world and school buildings. Tall structures of glass, steel, brick and mortar raised on stilts of a hard clear substance. Limbs of trees reaching out through some windows, you see entire floors made into greenhouses and pocket jungles sprawling off rooftops. They approach a park where we see a sculpture of a child hanging from the sky from a string that goes up forever, touching the surface of a never ending rippling pond below with the tip of his finger. There are no paths of stone or concrete, the grounds are riddled with ever so slight inclines and valleys. There’s a large Olympic sized pool built with Carrara marble, students ice skate it during the winter and skateboard in it in warmer months.

Shoobie walks slowly ahead of Steely, carrying a slate of metal, head held high, inhaling deeply and gratefully from a harmless, flavored steam cigarette. She squints her large eyes eyes on a toke and looks back at Steely going inside of someone else’s car.  The colors of her eyes change. She keeps walking. Steely catches up and throws his arm around Shoobie — he quickly takes his arm back to himself then grabs both her elbows and turns her toward him.

     Shoobie: (Bobbing her head to music that isn't playing, she sings) 'That's the way everyday goes, every time we've no control...'
Steely looks up at the sky. A wide, flat translucent aircraft is coasting slowly above, leaving clouds in its wake and filtering sunlight into beautiful prismatic refractions onto him.

He's looking down at Shoobie, she's wearing radiation protective gear. Her helmet is mirrored orange and red, the suit has a white body. He focuses on her and not the campus being destroyed behind her by fire.

     Steely: ‘Is death a high? I heard it’s like DMT. The guy who told me that isn’t dead. Maybe it’s worth dying. The high I mean. Worst part about it though. We won’t remember being so tight you know? Look at us!’

(Brushes imaginary locks from his face)

     Shoobie: ‘...uhh?’

Steely looks down at his feet and there’s ice on the grass though it’s summer. Steely pulls his head up to say ‘snow’ but doesn’t even make the begining sounds of the word. A single ball of alloy, white encoded with ice, spins around them like a tether ball to its pole. Shoobie still mouthing the words to a song playing in her head. ‘If you could fly then you’d feel south, up north’s gettin’ cold soon…The way it is were on land — still i’m someone to hold true’.

[Young Thug:]
No, my name is Jeffery

[Woman 2:]
Tell 'em who you are, 'tell em your name!

[Man:]
Young Thug?

[Young Thug:]
No, Jeffery

[Man:]
It says right here, "Young Thug."
Cut the crap. I'm trying to figure out how I can help you. What's best for you

[Girl:]

[Girl:]

Listen to me, Thugga, are you high?

Jeffery sparks blunt

[Duke:]
The fuck, it's Jeffery now?

[Outro snippet:]
Money longer than a NASCAR race
I told her keep going on the gas, fuck the brakes

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back
Please enjoy your party, I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to, and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be her
Not there in the kitchen with the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up 'cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh, God, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here

[Bridge]
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this?
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish
Don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin'
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' at the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

[Outro]
Hmm
Oh-oh-oh here, here
Hmm
Here, here
Are we over here?

[Hook: Ava Raiin]
Thank you for the promise of your faith
Thank you for your all your praise
Even if you promise me away
Out of your gaze escape

[Verse: Blood Orange]
To be construed, and strive for best
To be amused and laugh at the rest
One life could lead to one night alone
Your arms on your head
A nigga on your chest
Never gonna tell my brother I'm not vexed
Never gonna tell Becky it's far too complex
My heart it still beats for Alton who sleeps
Your phone it still beeps
My baby can't sleep
It's too wrong
But tell me who's wrong if I'm in the throng
I'm happy as long
As Dylan Roof gets squeezed
And Zimmerman gets beat
A day to be proud finally complete
But why's everybody always looking at me?
And why's everybody tryna bring down she
James said I had to keep on
Nina singing her song
Miles Blowing his horn
Dreaming of Farrakhan
Crying for Eric Garner
Phliando Castile, imagine losing the will
Imagine losing your love
The biggest most bitter pill
All because of a glove
Compartmentalize your bitterness as you just try to survive
And if we ain't blessed then why would they want us alive?
The diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along
To a handsome mannered baton
(Bygone, bygone)
A blind class aristocracy
Back through the op'ra glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn
(Bygone, bygone)

Columnated ruins domino!
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping?

Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn
(Bygone, bygone)
The music hall; a costly bow
The music; all is lost for now
To a muted trumpeter swan
(Bygone, bygone)
Columnated ruins domino!
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?

Dove nested towers, the hour was-
Strike the street, quicksilver moon!
Carriage across the fog-
Two-step to lamplight's cellar tune

The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne
The glass was raised, the fired rose
The fullness of the wine, the dim-last toasting

While at port, adieu or die
A choke of grief, heart-hardened I
Beyond belief a broken man too tough to cry

Surf's up, aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join the young and often spring you gave
I heard the word, wonderful thing, a children's song:

Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
A children's song
Have you listened as they played
Their song is love
And the children know the way
That's why the child is the father to the man
Child, child, child, child, child
Child, child, child, child, child
Na na na na na na na na
Child, child, child, child, child
That's why the child is the father to the man
Child, child, child, child, child
Steely's eyes are watering from the wind rushing in his face as he's smiling, then laughing, going full throttle on a speedboat with Shoobie, Matthew, Clark, Danny, Grad Girl #1, Rob, Grad Girl #2 and Grad Girl #3 in tow.

     Matthew (to Shoobie): 'So how'd you shut the power off? Generators didn't even come back.'
     Shoobie: 'No—I had a finals presentation.'
     Clark: 'Thought you handled your finals midterm'
     Shoobie: 'Extra credit.'
     Matthew: 'What are you?'

(Bonfire being set aflame on the beach)

     Robb: 'They're gonna shut that down any moment now'
     Grad Girl #1: (Eyes Robb while he takes off his clothes and puts on his wet suit.)
     Robb: 'Yea. I'm tryna get fit. So what. Swim.'

Robb pulls Junior girl #1 back into the water while the boat moves at a slower speed. Underwater shot shows Robb on a wake board being pulled by an aluminum speedboat. We see the turns and the flips and the fun.

     Matthew: 'I'm Shamu!' (Heard from underwater.)

Junior girls push Matthew and Danny. All fall in.

Sun going down—having brews—group talk.
     Robb: 'Always thought he had the better things.'
     Matthew: 'Kinda did.'
     Steely: 'Better looking staff, and the crazier grounds.'
     Grad Girl #1: 'I heard you have a woman in your shower who washes your back.'
     Steely: 'She's not a real woman.'
     Danny: (to Shoobie) 'When do you have to be over there? I heard that building is nuke-proof.'
     Shoobie: 'Yeah aren't they all now.'
     Danny: 'That's Central for you. Jesus.'
     Robb: 'You're not moving because of all this rain?' (Laughs)
     Shoobie: I've got all summer. The world's small. Day trips.'
     Steely: ‘Whole crew’s going different ways now.'
     Grad Girl #2: 'I'm taking over my parents' machine.'
     Grad Girl #3: 'You mean your parents' money.'
     Matthew: 'That's one thing that brings us all together, our parents' cash.. You too, my dear mid-caste offspring. Even you.'
     Shoobie: 'That's not what brings us together. But look, nepotism aside, I think you've done well for an underdeveloped intellect.'
     Matthew: (Grins in agreement) I would've quit this head job at first chance to climb locals and surf my life away. But the trust says I can't participate without taking my part in this ceremony.'
     Grad Girl #1: 'All I care about is world peace. All they taught me here was how to take notes.'
     Robb: 'OK, Miss Argentina.'
     Clark: 'I quite liked it here.'
     Steely: 'So that's why you didn't clear?'
     Clark: I cleeeaared.'
     Clark:Hey guys, listen. Alright, so. If I'm not fucking this person in person, but we get off to each other through the mesh all the time is it the same? Or am I trying to sell myself something? I asked em to take a job as my massage therapist to like simulate intimacy. Thought it was a long shot, but it worked out. It's been beautiful.'
     Shoobie: 'Who are we talking about?'
     Clark: 'That doesn't matter'
     Matthew: 'Is this person local?'
     Clark: 'Nah, isn't. It really doesn't matter guys.'
     Matthew: 'I think it's brilliant. Sounds perfect. Nothing left to be desired from my vantage point.'
     Danny: 'Hmm, I think it's nearly there. There's something missing that you might want—then again you might not want that at all.'
     Clark: Yea. It won't ever be like that.'
Steely drifts off imagining a frozen lake with another lake shining like stardust on its surface, the lakes reflecting a seamless white sky. White water.

Dream interrupted—RENNN RENNN RENNN!!! SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. An aluminum catamaran cuts through the water. Campus pull up on boats. Steely pours his beer out. Everyone hides their drinks. Water turns color.

     Campus Police: 'Please dock all watercraft and exit campus beach immediately.'
     Grad Girl #1: 'It's drop day! (Yelling at the police boat.)
     Campus Police: 'Please dock all watercraft and exit campus beach immediately.'

Campus Police speed away back to the shore. Students throw bottles at the police boat. Rather than head back to the shore and wait for the police, Steely pulls away in a different direction. The Police re-engage and give chase. Steely beaches the boat by sliding onto a black sand beach. All the students jump off the speedboat and run up the incline making an escape with the rest of the party.

     Steely: (Across the crowd to Shoobie) 'Meet at mine.'
Steely and Matthew split up in a corridor and go into different classrooms that are stand-alone trailers.

In one class, a smooth but occasionally glitchy 3-D projection of a teacher greets Steely. The teacher is severe in appearance and manner. Though her projection corresponds to a live human being somewhere else on the planet, she might as well be a robot or at least the ghost of a human once capable of warm emotion.

     Teacher: 'Punctuality appears to be your Achilles' heel, Mr. Grude. Alas, you've cleared H3, admirable. Quiet your ears, then solve the riddle.'

The teacher trails away.

Steely exhales loudly. Takes his bag off and hangs it on a hook. There is a digital 24-hour clock in the top left corner, it's black steel with white numbers. The walls are covered in floral wallpaper, overhead there's a clear paneled mechanical ceiling. The mahogany floors ramp up to class seating, with curves and layers dynamically represented. A wall for projection wrapped in a semi circle lies at the head of the class.

Steely breathes in deeply, dropping his shoulders. The room is so quiet. He closes his eyes. A montage flashing in his head: Shoobie's mouth, himself as a small boy calling up from a pit, fencing, climbing a fence, running. A small quiet click comes into his ears from a clock. The memory of his father first forgetting while giving a lecture at his school. The silence. The stutter. The angry burst at someone touching his arm. He remembers his father not remembering him. His mother throwing things out of focus. The canopied street. The first car he stole on a spinning platter. His father's car.

Steely is mumbling a mantra and slowly his memories whitewash away. He opens his eyes and he is seated on a chair in full lotus. He breaks position and pulls a tray out of a side compartment and now he has a surface with a bowl in its center, a few gauges and a small loupe. It's what seems to be a mini solar system that he's manipulating with the gauges.

The teacher swarms back in and places a decades-old transparency paper on a projector.

The riddle:

     Teacher: 'You poured it hot and you're stirring it up, now what's moving faster, the tea or the cup?'
     Steely: 'The tea.'
     Teacher: What's harder Mr. Grude, a liquid or a solid?'
     Steely: 'Shit'
     Teacher: 'Of course. And what does your understanding of physics inform you of as it relates to softness and hardness of matter, Mr. Grude?'
     Steely: 'That, from a sub-atomic perspective, my shit is composed of particles mostly vibrating at a higher rate than my piss.'
     Teacher: 'Thank you, Mr. Grude. Your deft articulation leaves little to the imagination.'
     Steely: 'You don't have an imagination.'
     Teacher: 'Well, congratulations Mr. Grude. It has been my pleasure watering yours.'
The teacher swarms off. A status bar appears on the projection wall as if loading something. When full, a dozen other desks appear next to Steely each with a student projection seated in them, creating trails with their movements. These projections seem almost real. Unlike the microcosm whose projections are light based, the students' apparitions are hard particle nano projections whose touch have a light weight, thus they can interact with the physical world on a low level. The teacher re-materializes.

     Teacher: 'Grad students, the last movie of your lives here. "Giant"—1956. Enjoy.'

Steely looks down at his desk. His microcosm is developing well, thriving. There are 64 life harboring planets in his system. He looks through his scope. He monitors his gauges, adjusting tension and gravity here and there.

Steely receives a tummy rub via instant messaging from Shoobie, and a pouty face. He replies with a blush face. The movie plays and a couple of the students are watching. The class is 50/50 male to female. A swirl of different races and creeds. Someone's nose starts bleeding. A Japanese student crinkles plastic in a Russian girl's ear to annoy her. Two students are reading palms. Steely extends his hand, taps a blue eyed Korean kid named Kio.

     Steely: 'Howdy'
     Kio: 'Listen. It's out of control. My parents are hiring a load of lifeguards for this weekend. Apparently someone drowned last year at the pool party I've never had. Been on my Kegel exercises since last week.

(Kio's projection spreads hair on Steely's scalp with his swarm fingers and examines it before Steely shakes him away)

     Kio: 'Your hair is so clean?'
     Steely: 'Kio—get off.' (Doesn't move. Focuses his sight through the scope down into the microcosm.)
     Kio: (Speaking out loud) 'Western hygiene has lacked as fuck—these guys look dank.'
     Blonde Girl: 'Close your mouth!'
     Kio: 'Only if you keep yours open.'
     Blonde Girl: You're small.'
     Kio: 'She didn't talk to me like this last night. I'm so confused. This sucks.'
     Blonde Girl: 'Do you know I can hear you? What was last night? I'm in Morocco.'
     Kio: 'Last night, last month—whenever this loud sex was. I forget.' (Kio turns his head and is punched in the nose by Blonde's swarm hand.)
     Blonde Girl: (Warns) 'You are a small feeling. Do not!'

The downpour outside intensifies.
     Steely: 'She didn't like that one, Kio.'
     Kio: 'Bro, whatever, she's a lunatic, and she just got herself un-invited.'
     Steely: (Laughs and shakes his head.)

Dree, the Pacific islander student, taps Steely.

     Steely: 'That's TWO cartridges.'
     Dree: (Says 'okay' without saying anything.)

It thunders soon after a grand flash of lightning. Rain comes down heavier and heavier, then a black out.

The 3-D swarms of students and teacher disappear and the room goes dark. The glow of Steely's experiment is the only light source in the room. His gaze stays stuck on the system, its glow upon his face. Just then a message notice activates.

GROUP TEXT:

     Matthew: 'Anybody seen Robb? I think we lost Robb black ass.'
     Robb: A piece of me with always be inside of you.'
     Shoobie: 'lol' (emoticon)

Steely gets up from his desk, pulls his hoody over hid head and goes to use the urinals outside in the storm.

It's pouring as he walks toward a small shallow tower of urinals—they resemble a merry-go-round. He pisses with the rain falling on him hard. No one is outside. He washes his hands on a faucet above the urinal then heads back toward his class. Sunlight cuts through the rain. He gets back to his seat, soaked, and sits down in the naturally lit room. He looks down at his bowl for a moment, lights a cigarette and stares at it for a moment. Spinning it around and staring at the ember trails. The sunlight creates streaks across the classroom through the ceiling. He pushes everything back into a single point then folds the desktop back into the compartment.

Steely's eyes well up.
Cut to Steely inside of a wide industrial lift. Steely's still inside the car, smoking another cigarette as the lift moves upward. Garten's car comes up through the floor, facing Shoobie. There's reflection on the glass behind her, faint speckles of light imply a city view in the distance. Shoobie's seated in a white swivel chair with large perforations. Wide white flooring with a desk complex. Neutral furniture. Fluorescent lights overhead in rails—glass all around. A potted plant caged with a bird. Shoobie sits there in the nude anticipating a party but covers herself once she sees the car. In disbelief she walks toward Steely but continues past him, covering her mouth as she stares at the vehicle.

Steely walks down a ramp into a living space, a bar that looks off into the distance. Outdoorsman photography and console portraits line a wall. A photo of Steely and his dad holding a catch by the sea, another of him climbing a half dome. There's a jellyfish aquarium. The seating area is an ecosystem all its own with more plants and contained living micro systems. He eats pasta and watches television. Once he finishes eating he gets up, undresses, grabs his recall device and heads to the bathroom. Steely walks into a yellow shower. A 3-D projection of a woman in blue washes his back.

Dunk. Break for the curb. Clark taps Steely on the ass, blows him a kiss. Clark shoves him. Steely stumbles and walks over to a vehicle parked on the side. Steely leans on the driver window and kisses the driver. Steely circles to the other side and sits in the passenger seat. Driver puts a dutch to Steely's mouth. Steely hits it. Steely and driver kiss blowing smoke out of their noses.

     Driver (Shoobie): 'Relaxxx...'
     Steely: (Shakes head) 'Awe man—don't do that—I don't even know how it started.' (leans in to kiss her again)
     Shoobie: 'Nope.'
     Steely: (Kisses her face still) 'What you do all day anyway? When'd you even get here?'

Shoobie ignores him, and changes a song on the playlist (she was his ride there in the first place). Steely crawls out of passenger window and talks over the car.

     Steely: 'So what's good for later? I need to shower.'

Matthew and Clark walk over to the car—Danny goes inside to shower.

     Clark: W'sup Shoobie.' (Kisses her on the cheek.)
     Clark: 'So you gon' draw my blood and I can't hit the blunt? You cold.'

Shoobie passes it to Clark.
     Steely: 'Imma be back later I left some shit in your house.'
     Matthew: 'What is it? I'll grab it for you now. You ain't comin' back. Y'all are about to get weird.'
     Steely: 'What an angel—but naw, imma come back though.'
     Matthew: 'Smiley faces...'

Wide road. Canopy of live oak trees and filtered sunlight. Low radio. Engine noise layered with shower scene. Engine noise. Love scene. Engine noise. Cut to black.

Steely is high off endorphins while his back is being rubbed by the lady in blue. He finishes his shower, heads to his bed and crash into sleep. Steely's blurry eyes open up to Shoobie lying next to him with the look of Christmas morning on her face. It's 5am-ish. The glass now gives the views pass up on the level. Shoobie has been dealing with Garten's vehicle for the last several hours.

     Shoobie: 'The majority of Garten's designs contain two access points. It's a motif of his.' 'This design in particular has nearly complete function solely from one key point. The second key point is hidden. I got its location off this thing's own thoughts. Whatever, take a seat.' (Pointing to the car)

Steely takes a seat. Black cup of coffee in his hand. Shoobie has a rainbow coil of wires running from a handheld device into a port on the headlight of Garten's car.

     Shoobie: 'Wait for it.' (As she works)

In a moment Steely's vision through the windshield glows and the city past the woods falls off into sky. His entire surroundings glow golden and white and the edges of his view fall off into endless sky. He seems to be on an island, floating high above any water. Steely jumps a bit, spills the coffee on his boxer shorts. It takes a moment for him to feel the sensation.

     Steely: 'Fuuuck....'

Steely jumps out of the car. Pulling off his burning shorts, eyes affixed to the fantastic view, which is fading back into reality all around him. His vision goes back to normal again. Shoobie smiles. Steely starts to wring out his shorts when he gets a new message notification.

END EPISODE 1

[Verse 1]
I've found
She's kept it all together, for so long
I wonder how
She kept it all together, for so long
I ask how
She kept it all together, for so long
Girl

[Verse 2]
Oh girl
Understand there's love in the air
Oh girl
Won't you understand there's light towards the end
Girl, girl
Won't you understand there's trouble reaching there
Girl

[Chorus]
The weigh me down, don't sweat it now
Don't ever feel ashamed
It's not easy love, pour it out
Don't ever feel ashamed
Girl
Let it out
Don't waste away
Don't ever feel ashamed
So easy how
We fall in love
And feel like we'll never make a change

[Bridge]
Let it out
Don't waste away
Don't ever feel ashamed
Sometimes you need a helping hand
And to make a change

[Chorus]
The weigh me down, don't sweat it now
Don't ever feel ashamed
It's not easy love, pour it out
Don't ever feel ashamed
Girl
Let it out
Don't waste away
Don't ever feel ashamed
So easy how
We fall in love
And feel like we'll never make a change

[Intro]
It's been a hot summer in the 90's and you're kids are about to be in school or already are
You're home alone and now it's time to jam
You are listening to Skrip's remix of Justin Beiber's "What Do You Mean?"

[Chorus]
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

[Verse 1]
You’re so indecisive, what I’m saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between
Oh, I really want to know…

[Chorus]
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

[Verse 2]
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Trying to compromise but I can’t win
You want to make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between
Oh, I really want to know…

[Chorus]
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
(I wanna know)
Oh, what do you mean? (Ooh)
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
(Oh baby)
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

[Outro]
Oh, oh
(This is ours baby, yeah)
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
(You're so confusing baby)
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
(Be more straight forward)
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

[Outro 2]

[Spoken Word]
People standing in line to look at pre-made sandwiches
People standing in line to get high to bad bitches
People standing in line to smoke weed that's green tea
People standing in line for two rails of OxiClean
People standing in line to nuke themselves with ketamine
It's artisan raw and gluten free
Probiotic superfood antioxidant low-MSG
Non-GMO locally sourced quinoa and chia seeds
Jojoba and baobab dog treats
Hand made with wild goji berries
Agave, acai and activated whey protein
People standing in line to buy whatever the McFuck
they might want to shove down their foodpipes tonight
New watch in black gold
New shirt that looks old
Big dick and no soul
New pants with four holes
Old phones in one drawer
Five dry pens, something from a Kinder egg
And everything you didn't know you were looking for
People complaining 'cause their Mum whines
People complaining about losing their minds
People complaining about standing in line
People standing in line and they don't even know why

[Intro]
I, mean, everybody want somebody that's got confidence
You know it's in her attitude
The way she walks, nice legs (ummm)
She's gotta be beautiful, nice thin waist (uh umm)
Fat ass (hahaha), ooh
And them soft little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips

[Break]
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
I wonder if your lips are as soft as I imagine them to be
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Huh, the crazy shit is you the only girl I love
Little lips, little lips, little lips

[Verse 1]
I reminisce of all of the things that don't exist yet
Like the breakfast on Sunday mornings after drunk sex
Or when you're out with your girls and you send me a drunk text
Saying "Baby, are you far, want you to come closer to my heart"
I miss you girl, whoever you are

[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you, already
And I just wanna kiss you, already
So come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up to the home
You don't know I miss you already
Girl I miss you, yeah

[Break]
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips (ahh, ahh)
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips (yeah, ooh ahh)
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips (umm umm, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Pillow cases covered in traces of your makeup (ahh)
And, if I ever cheat, all she gonna taste is your flavor, real shit, ooh
I dreamt about you last night, I ain't wanna wake up, ahh
Even though I can't see you so far
Looking just like the tint on my car
I miss you girl, whoever you are

[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you, already
And I just wanna kiss you, already
So come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up to the home
You don't know I miss you already, I..

[Break]
I like the way your frame is, uhh
I wonder if your sex is as good as I assume it's gon-na be, huh
The crazy shit is you already knew what it was

[Bridge]
Take this, take that girl, but don't take time
To take my heart, baby come claim mine
Won't wait forever but I'll wait for you
Don't take too long girl 'cause I'm missing you

[Chorus]
Miss you, already
And I wanna kiss you, already, hah
Come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up, come on home
Girl I miss you, already

[Verse 1]
You go where the wind blows
Destroying everyone in your path
I'm done feeding your ego
Forgetting everything that we had

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how history ends in an instant
How something so close can end up so distant

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Verse 2]
Good luck when you wake up
And realize all that you've lost
Shining lies are what you're made of
I hope it's worth the price that it cost

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how history ends in an instant
How something so close can end up so distant

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Bridge]
I let you go, so let me go
Let us go
I let you, I let you
I let you go, oh

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Outro]
Mmm, the great divide
Hey, yeah

[Verse]
The tavern where you worked
Was cold and dark as a cavern
You kept quarters in your shirt
But I never could just have them
You always made me sweep around every fly and floozie
Under booths and bums asleep
Waking up, they'd ask you, "Who's he?"
Behind a glass without a glance
"My daughter's boy," you would say
Well, I stood there in a trance
Listening to the jukebox play

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
I don't even know...

[Verse 1]
You give me all of you
I recognize my heart as black and blue
You accept all I do
But I don't know if that is wise
You offer all of you
I recognize your hand as a budding bruise
You reject solitude
But I don't know if I am worth it

[Chorus]
I don't know if I am worth it
I don't know if I am worth it
Worth it

[Verse 2]
Tepid and taciturn
Isn't enough to make you learn
You're not afraid of burns
But I don't know how to light my fire

[Chorus]
I don't know if I am worth it
I don't know if I am worth it
I don't know if I am worth it
I don't know if I am worth it

[Verse 1]
What goes underneath your armor
Underneath your clothes
Do you know?
Let's find out together
Let's find what we're looking for
We'll explore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Leave your house of mirrors, hear me out
Fear no consequence, forget your doubts

[Chorus]
I don't know where the road leads
You don't know if I'll break your heart
We don't know how the winds will blow
And we won't know
We won't go unless we start
Ooh, ooh, start

[Verse 2]
Fall into the sea of possibility
And hope
We're letting go
Float away with me
Until we can't see any coast
That we know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hold on tight until we become one
Find our island underneath the sun

[Chorus]
I don't know where the road leads
You don't know if I'll break your heart
And we don't know how the winds will blow
And we won't know
We won't go unless we start
Ooh, ooh, ooh, start, yeah

[Bridge]
Our beloved beside us
All you want to give up
Only happens if we let it live

[Chorus]
And I don't know where the road leads
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You don't know if I'll break your heart
We don't know how the winds will blow
And we won't know
We won't go unless we start
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, start, yeah

[Outro]
Oh unless we start
Ooh, oh, let's start, yeah
Unless we start

[Intro]
Mustard on that beat

[Verse 1]
Look in the mirror
Who do I see? Who do I wanna be today?
If you came for a show, which role should I take?
Fading to gray, so do we make a big mistake?
True colors'll show, baby, just put me on display

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I have no secrets
'Cause there's a version of me that I don't know how to hide
When you're making me glow with your fingers against my thighs
(Glow)

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
This mood ring, mmm

[Bridge]
I'm in the palm of your hand
My temperature is at your command
By my demand
And now I'm falling for you
I turn to golden from blue
And you do too, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
I think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah
Hey
Hey

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Better duck from the shells
Break her back just like kale, you niggas gon' tell
After 11, I jump to a teen 'cause I do not fuck with 12
I do not get it, you niggas and bitches
Leave his ass with stitches if he touch my digits
Pull up to the scene, all you hear is crickets
Buddy went ghost when he saw we wit' it
I'm richer now, make a phone call and he'll get you now
Lock down with the same family
'Cause all these new niggas be switch arounds
It's Lil Boat, fresher than Scope, gold on my throat
I pledge an oath to stay on my toes, to stay down with my bros
I keep a round, anything that my nigga want he can get it (Lil Boat)
'Cause if I call up my nigga, bet that he let you get it, loyalty
King of the Teens and royalty
Just saw your new grill, look like foil, B
Young nigga rich, fuckin' up a sack, fuckin' on your bitch

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I get that money and spend it
I'm in a 'Rari, it's tinted
I fucked his bitch now he trippin'
Bitch my name Bin and I ain't in it
I got a way with the women
I got a way with the hoes
I spend my money on money
You spend your money on clothes
I broke my arm in the bowl
And I get 20 a show
I got my diamonds from L.A
I spent a check on that Rolls
I spent the check on her purse
Then I went bought me a vert
Scrapin' the bowl then I skrrt
I'm scrapin' the bowl then I skrrt
I'm ridin' 'round the city with a stick
Make this muthfucka fishtail
I get surgical with the pump
Nigga call me Denzel, Training Day
I just might hop on the plane today
My jewelry on, but I'm plain today
Money on me, it might rain today
Give a fuck 'bout what these haters say
Bitch, I'm gon' get it
Got a friend with a friend, bitches come wit' it
Nut all on her titties, bitches gettin' freaky
These niggas wanna be me, bitch, I ball like Bibby
Snippet

Watchin' all these rappers who I'm shakin' hands with
Who I'm clappin', who I'm clappin'?
They ain't really bout that action
Hit the city with the fetty
Petty nigga fuck a, petty nigga fuck a caption
You a soft ass
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music?
Would you hold it near as it were your own?
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty
If your cup is full, may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home

[Verse]
Cold mountain water, the jade merchant's daughter
Mountains of the moon, electra bow and bend to me
Hi ho the carrion crow fol de rol de riddle
Hi ho the carrion crow bow and bend to me
Hey, Tom Banjo hey a laurel, more than laurel you say sow
More than laurel you may sow
Hey, the laurel, hey the city in the rain
Hey, hey, hey the wild wheat waving in the wind
Twenty degrees of solitude, twenty degrees in all
All the dancing kings and wives assembled in the hall
Lost is the long and loneliest town fairly sybil flying
All along the, all along the mountains of the moon
Hey, Tom Banjo it's time to matter
The earth will see you on through this time
The earth will see you on through this time
Down by the water, the Marsh King's daughter, did you know?
Clothed in totters always will be. Tom, where did you go?
Mountains of the moon, Electra, mountains of the moon
All along the, all along the mountains of the moon

[Outro]
Hi ho the carrion crow fol de rol de riddle
Hi ho the carrion crow bow and bend to me
Bend to me. Na da da da da da da da da da da da
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music?
Would you hold it near as it were your own?
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty
If your cup is full, may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow
You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river;
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you

Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love for spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive
Sugar magnolia ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight, come on out singing;
I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on honey. Come along with me

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need:
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is half way down...
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out, and I wander around, I wander 'round

Sunshine daydream walking in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes, blooming like a red rose, Breathing more freely
Ride our singin' I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, Sunshine daydream
Walking in the sunshine

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's a summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
All caught up in sunlight
Now come on out singing; I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
Take me out and I wander 'round
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walking in the tall trees, going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose, rolling over sweetly
One that I take when I walk in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Now come on and daydream
Sunshine daydream, keep on and daydream
Sunshine daydream, playing in the tall trees
Sunshine daydream, going where the wind goes
Going where, going where the wind goes
Never gonna miss this
One that I take when I get you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream, woo
Sunshine daydream, woo
Sunshine daydream, oh, I wanna daydream
Sunshine daydream, woo
Sunshine daydream, woo
Sunshine daydream, woo
Sunshine daydream, woo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Recall a daydream
Thank you
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings
Dallas, got a soft machine;
Houston, too close to New Orleans;
New York's got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no
Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay'em down
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurres to me
What a long, strange trip it's been
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"
Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurres to me
What a long, strange trip it's been
Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now get back truckin' home

[verse 1]
Mississippi river so big and wide, blond haired woman on the other side

[Chorus]
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry cause i'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 2]
I worked all summer, spring and fall, blond haired woman the cause of it all

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I saw her in dallas and el paso. said come back baby, I need you so

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Mississippi river so big and wide, blond haired woman on the other side

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Walk me out in the morning dew my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry this today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today
Where have all the people gone my honey
Where have all the people gone today
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway
I thought I heard a young man morn this morning
I thought I heard a young man morn today
I thought I heard a young man morn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Outro]
Walk me out in the morning dew my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
Ill walk you out in the morning dew my honey
I guess it doesn't really matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
Guess it doesn't matter anyway
Last leaf fallen bare earth where green was born
Black Madonna two eagles hang against a cloud
Sun comes up blood red wind yells among the stone
All graceful instruments are known
When the windows all are broken and your love's become a toothless crone
When the voices of the storm sound like a crowd
Winter morning breaks, you're all alone
The eyes are blind, blue visions, all a seer can own
And touching makes the flesh to cry out loud
This ground on which the seed of love is sown
All graceful instruments are known

[Verse]
Saint Stephen with a rose, in and out of the garden he goes
Country garden in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes the people all complain
Stephen prospered in his time, well he may and he may decline
Did it matter, does it now? Stephen would answer if he only knew how
Wishing well with a golden bell, bucket hanging clear to hell
Hell halfway twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again
Lady finger, dipped in moonlight, writing "what for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters, dawn with answer, darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet colors, call it your own
Did he doubt or did he try? Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills
Saint Stephen will remain, all he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home
Fortune comes a crawling, calliope woman, spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can. But what would be the answer to the answer man?
Lady with a Fan
Let my inspiration flow in token rhyme, suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake thee, 'til my tale is told and done
While the firelight's aglow, strange shadows from the flames will grow
'Til things we've never seen will seem familiar
Shadows of a sailor, forming winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady many years ago
Here beside him stands a man, a soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights, but lost at love
While the storyteller speaks, a door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open, and a girl is standing there
Eyes alight, with glowing hair, all that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it, in the lion's den
Which of you to gain me, tell, will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you if you will not take the chance
The sailor gave at least a try, the soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength, and not disaster

[Instrumental break]

The sailor, coming out again, the lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today, you decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice, soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light, and not to master

[Instrumental break]

Since the end is never told, we pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back, but he cannot be bought or sold

Terrapin Station
Inspiration, move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair, more than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb, to get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight, all are dim but one is bright
The spiral light of Venus, rising first and shining best
Oh, from the northwest corner, of a brand new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing, a rare and different tune

Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon, Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - If it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - But the train's put it's brakes on Terrapin - And the whistle is screaming TERRAPIN

[Instrumental]

[Lady with a Fan]
Let my inspiration flow in token rhyme, suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake thee, till my tale is told and done
While the firelight's aglow, strange shadows from the flames will grow
Till things we've never seen will seem familiar
Shadows of a sailor, forming winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady many years ago
Here beside him stands a man, a soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights, but lost at love
While the storyteller speaks, a door within the fire creaks;
Suddenly flies open, and a girl is standing there

And I know we'll be there soon, Terrapin
I can't figure out, Terrapin, if it's the end or beginning
Terrapin, but the train's put it's brakes on, Terrapin
And the whistle is screaming, TERRAPIN
Terrapin Station - At the Siding
While you were gone, these faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden. With nothing to believe in
The compass always points to Terrapin
Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again, for good or ill again
As I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion but I might as well try, might as well try
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias, tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls
In the heat of the evening when the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and was closing the door
I had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before
Well, I ain't always right but I've never been wrong
Seldom turns out the way it does in a song
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right
Well, there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
All scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by
The wind in the willow's playing, 'Tea for two'
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping, strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody is playing in the heart of gold band, heart of gold band
Well the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Woah-ho what I want to know
Is are you kind?
It's a buck dancer's choice my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me
Won't you come with me
Woah-ho what I want to know
Will you come with me?
God damn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Woah-ho what I want to know
Where does the time go?
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-ho what I want to know
How does the song go?
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home
Whoa-ho what I want to know
How does the song go?
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh (to fade)

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper, just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday, in a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City, just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls and get out when they blow

[Chorus 1]
Did you say your name was Ramblin Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill, Mama told the jailor
One heat up, and one cool down, leave nothing for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill, Papa told the jailer
One go up, and one go down, do yourself a favor

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
I'm going to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never going to end
I'm going to  march you up and down along the county line
Take you to the leader of a band

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto, just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush, aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelly, just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains and count your change and try to walk the line

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 4]
Goodbye Mama and Papa
Goodbye Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener
The wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Please don't dominate the rap, Jack
If you've got nothing new to say
If you please, don't back up the track
This train's got to run today
I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
I heard someone say "better run away"
Others say "better stand still"
Now I don't know, but I been told
It's hard to run with the weight of gold
Other hand I have heard it said
It's just as hard with the weight of lead
Who can deny, who can deny
It's not just a change in style?
One step down and another begun
And I wonder how many miles
I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
Things went down we don't understand
But I think in time we will
Now, I don't know but I was told
In the heat of the sun a man died of cold
Keep on coming or stand and wait
With the sun so dark and the hour so late
You can't overlook the lack, Jack
Of any other highway to ride
It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very few rules to guide
I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
I saw things getting out of hand
I guess they always will
Now I don't know but I been told
If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load
I don't know whose back's that strong
Maybe find out before too long
One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give
One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give
One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give

[Verse]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South colorado, west texas bound
We stopped over in santa fe
That being the point just about half way
And you know it was the hottest part of the day
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, i took off my shirt
And i tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt
When texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame;
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand
My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
And i'm as honest as a denver man can be
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And i shot him down, lord he never saw
Well i grabbed a bottle, cracked him in the jaw
Shot me another, oh damn he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
And we high-tailed it down to mexico
I love those cowboys, i love their gold
I loved my uncle, god rest his soul
Taught me good, lord, taught me all i know
Taught me so well, i grabbed that gold
And i left his dead ass there by the side of the road
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Instrumental break]

My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, and I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, oh damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
And we high-tailed it down to Mexico
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Verse 1]
I went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up in the heavens Lord I saw a mighty sign
Writting fire across the heaven, plain as black and whit
Get prepared, there's going to be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uhuh, Hey! Saturday Night!
Yeh, uhuh one more Saturday night
Hey Saturday night!

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing  down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnite, the whole place going to fly

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Turn on channel six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, put on them rocking shoes

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought He'd call it planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and roll music meets the rising sun

[Chorus]

[2]

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
Ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high

[Instrumental Break]
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand of P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan
Shine your shoes, light your fuse
Can you use them old U.S. Blues?
I'll drink your health, share your wealth
Run your life, steal your wife

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high

[Instrumental Break]
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Back to back chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song the United States Blues

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high

[Instrumental Break]
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
My my my oh my my my my
Summertime done, come and gone, my

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
Gazing at the fire
Burning by the water
Before he speaks
The world around us quiets
With eyes as sharp as arrows
And turning to the fire
He clears the air and cuts it with a feather
Many in a circle
Slowly round the fire
When he is gone
I want to know him better
No one is forsaken
No one is a liar
He plants the tree of life on our foreheads with water
He hums
There are drums
Four winds
Rising suns
We are singing and playing
I hear what he's saying
I remember breezes
From winds inside your body
Keep me high
Like I told you
I'll sing to them this story
And know why
Cold iron shackles, ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed
Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, do you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby won't you carry me back to Tennessee
Drink all day and rock all night
The law come to get you if you don't walk right
Got a letter this morning, baby all it read
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Catch a few winks, baby, under the bed
Then you head back to Tennessee, Jed
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby won't you carry me back to Tennessee
I run into Charlie Fog
Blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said
Let's head back to Tennessee, Jed
I woke up a feeling mean
Went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around, and the letters read
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby won't you carry me back to Tennessee

[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now I can feel it my feet now
Listen here it comes again!
There's a band out on the highway
They're high stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinning dizzy, Lord
The band kept us too busy we forgot about the time

[Instrumental Break]
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band, Lord
They're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight
Balls of lighting roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on
Keep on dancing thru the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No ones's noticed, but the band's all pack and gone
Was it ever there at all?
But they kept on dancing

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Outro]
Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river

Listen here it comes again!

The music never stopped

[Verse 1]
You tell me this town ain't got no heart. Well, well, well, you can never tell
The sunny side of the street is dark. Well, well, well, you can never tell
Maybe that's because it's midnight, in the dark of the moon besides
Maybe the dark is from your eyes, Maybe the dark is from your eyes 

[x3]
You know you got such dark eyes!

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street. Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart. You just got to poke around

[Verse 2]
You think you've seen this town clear through
Well, well, well, you can never tell
Nothing here that could interest you. Well, well, well, you can never tell
It's not because you missed out on the thing that we had to start
Maybe you had too much too fast. Maybe you had too much too fast 

[x3]
Or just over played your part

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Since I'm passing your way today. Well, well, well, you can never tell
I just stopped in because I want to say, Well, well, well, you can never tell
I recall your darkness when it crackled like a thundercloud
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart 

[x6]
When I can hear it beat out loud!

[Repeat Chorus until fade]

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you run off no more
Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time baby i don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
I say row jimmy row, gonna get there, i don't know
Seems a common way to go, get out and row, row, row, row, row

[Verse 2]
Here's a half dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at julie down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock you baby to and fro
Not too fast and not too slow

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace
Is the human face
But afraid we may lay our home to waste
There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
Now watch as the ball revolves
And the nighttime falls
Again the hunt begins
Again the bloodwind calls
By and by, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes
From some men's eyes
It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me
You and me
Click flash blade in ghetto night
Rudies looking for a fight
Rat cat alley, roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Bridge:]
Commissars and pin-stripe bosses
Roll the dice
Any way they fall
Guess who gets to pay the price
Money green or proletarian gray
Selling guns 'stead of food today
So the kids they dance
And shake their bones
And the politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
Heartless powers try to tell us
What to think
If the spirit's sleeping
Then the flesh is ink
History's page will thus be carved in stone
And we are here, and we are on our own
On our own
On our own
On our own
If the game is lost
Then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We can leave this place and empty stone
Or that shinin' ball we used to call our home
So the kids they dance
And shake their bones
And the politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Bridge two:]
Shipping powders back and forth
Singing black goes south and white comes north
In a whole world full of petty wars
Singing I got mine and you got yours
And the current fashion sets the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
And the radical, he rant and rage
Singing someone's got to turn the page
And the rich man in his summer home
Singing just leave well enough alone
But his pants are down, his cover's blown...
And the politicians throwin' stones
So the kids they dance
And shake their bones
And it's all too clear we're on our own
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
Picture a bright blue ball
Just spinnin', spinnin, free
Dizzy with the possibilities
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace
Is the human face
But afraid we may lay our home to waste
There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
Now watch as the ball revolves
And the nighttime falls

[Verse 1]
Standing on the moon
I got no cobweb on my shoe
Standing on the moon
I'm feeling so alone and blue
I see the Gulf of Mexico
As tiny as a tear
The coast of California
Must be somewhere over here - over here

[Chorus]
Standing on the moon
I see the battle rage below
Standing on the moon
I see the soldiers come and go
There's a metal flag beside me
Someone planted long ago
Old Glory standing stiffly, Crimson, white and indigo 

[x2]
Indigo

[Verse 2]
I see all of Southeast Asia
I can see El Salvador
I hear the cries of children
And the other songs of war
It's like a mighty melody
That rings down from the sky
Standing here upon the moon
I watch it all roll by - all roll by
All roll by 

[x2]

[Chorus]
Standing on the moon
With nothing else to do
A lovely view of heaven
But I'd rather be with you
Standing on the moon
I see a shadow on the sun
Standing on the moon
The stars go fading one by one
I hear a cry of victory
And another of defeat
A scrap of age-old lullaby
Down some forgotten street
Standing on the moon
Where talk is cheap and vision true
Standing on the moon
But I would rather be with you
Somewhere in San Francisco
On a back porch in July
Just looking up to heaven
At this crescent in the sky
Standing on the moon
With nothing left to do
A lovely view of heaven
But I'd rather be with you - be with you

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
And never could do no wrong
Had everything sewed up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 3]
Well in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you and I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Bridge]
Well, shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the jubilee
If that jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 2]
Thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
If that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

That old sun is making our instruments get mighty strange
So they're gonna be out of tune for a little while

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon around
When they come to call on you and drag your poor body down

[Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree
Shake it, shake it Sugaree, just don't tell them that you know me

[x2]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool and never could do no wrong
Had everything sewed up tight
How come you lay awake all night long

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you and I guess it's time you go

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Well shake it up now Sugaree, I'll meet you at the jubilee
If that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Chorus]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me baby, beause I'm moanin' low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold
All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man
Last fair deal in the country,Sweet Suzie
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is baby
Before you let my deal go down
Don't you push me baby, cause I'm moanin' low
And I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gotta get up in the morning and go
Everybody's breakin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on the inside straight
Well I got no chance of losin' this time
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is baby
Before you let my deal go down
Everybody's breakin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on the inside straight
Well I got no chance of losin' this time
Thought I heard a blackbird singin'
Up on Bluebird Hill
Call me a whinin' boy if you will
Born where the sun don't shine
And I don't deny my name
Got no place to go, ain't that a shame?
Thought I heard that KC whistle
Moanin' sweet & low
Thought I heard that KC when she blow
Down where the sun don't shine
Underneath the Kokomo
Whinin' boy -- got no place else to go
So many roads I tell you
So many roads I know
So many roads --
So many roads --
Mountain high, river wide
So many roads to ride
So many roads
So many roads
Thought I heard a jug band playin'
"If you don't -- who else will?"
From over on the far side of the hill
All I know the sun don't shine
The rain refuse to fall
And you don't seem to hear me when I call
Wind inside & the wind outside
Tangled in the window blind
Tell me why you treat me so unkind
Down where the sun don't shine
Lonely and I call your name
No place left to go, ain't that a shame?
So many roads I tell you
New York to San Francisco
All I want is one
To take me home
From the high road to the low
So many roads I know
So many roads - So many roads
From the land of the midnight sun
Where ice blue roses grow
'long those roads of gold and silver snow
Howlin' wide or moanin low
So many roads I know
So many roads to ease my soul

Slow up for no one, the shogun

Iowa, Iowa, Iowa (Me and my bitch)
Iowa (Bossed up, you know what I'm sayin')

[Verse 3]
B-O on the track, got us sellin' crack
Meanwhile servin' crack, box you like Jack
Helicopter pad, hundred thousand squares
Back pockets fat like a strippers bitch ass
I just bought some land to bury his bitch ass
Smokin' on that trash, floodin' her with trash
Come and try me, trial I'ma beat
Put him on his feet, now he signing
I'ma put you on some progress
Old hundred dollar bills, they the oldest
Bitch still jumpin' 'round, she on her toe, shit
Bank long like Pinocchio nose, bitch
I need me a mill' like Meek
I been dropping eights all day
You a turtle when it comes to this race
If you scared, to go to church like Mase
Hey, hey, 

[?] can you pass the light over here?
Hey, baby, you can snapshot when I'm in Leer
I like my bitch brown like a bear
Ayy, yeah
Thugger, baby, yeah
Take me to Iowa, my bitch a Iowa
Take me to Iowa
I am Kanye West, and that feels really great, especially to say this year. I came here to present my new video, but before that, I'ma talk. Now... Later tonight, "Famous" might lose to Beyoncé, but I can't be mad—I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so, you know! But for people to understand just how blessed we are. It was an expression of our now. Our fame right now. Us on the inside of the TV. You know, just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to Donald Trump... I mean, like, I put Ray J in there, bruh! This is fame, bro! Like... I see you, Amber! My wife is a G, not a lot of people's wives would let 'em say that! We came over in the same boat, now we all in the same bed. Well... maybe different boats, but you know. If you think about it, last week, it was 22 people murdered in Chicago. You know, like, people come to me like, "Man, that's right! Tell Taylor to..." Bro, like, I love all y'all! That's why I called her! So, I was speaking at the Art Institute last year and one kid came up to me and said, "Three of my friends died and I don't know if I'm gonna be the next." And it has to... you know, you have to think like, you know when you're a senior and it's like the last month and you just don't feel like doing anymore work? If you feel like you're seeing people dying right next to you, you might feel like what's the point? You know, like, life could be, like, start to feel worthless in a way. I know times for me, I sit down and talk to older, rich people, you know -- aka white -- and uh, they tell me, "Don't compare yourself to Steve Jobs, don't compare yourself to Walt Disney." And my friend Sekaya told me -- ayy, bruh, bruh!

They tell me, "Don't compare yourself to these people," right? My friend Sekaya told me it's three keys to keeping people impoverished: taking away their esteem, taking away their resources, and taking away their role models. My role models are Artists Merchants. It's less than 10 I can name in history. Truman, Ford, Hughes, Disney, Jobs, West

(Audience cheer) Bro! Broooo!

Tonight, we're here to have fun. I'm standing in front of my idol, Puff Daddy. I'm standing in front of my wife, Kim Kardashian West. I'm standing in front of the future, Chance The Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith. Bro! We are undeniably the influence, the thought leaders. I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my art and I hope y'all have a good time
The first time, the first time I met Robyn Fenty was 2005. She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was "Pon de Replay," and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. It's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called "Work."

Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna.

Captivating from day one, the iconic being that is Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them, that's often the peak, but for her, that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.

When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style, she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward.

What's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. What's most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself.

This woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one.

She's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and gentlemen, the recipient of the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award for 2016: Rihanna.

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yo, I don't care who listening
I find it kind of sickenin'
We send billions to Israel
But shit on Flint, Michigan
A country, a country founded off of immigrants
Now we wanna build a wall to keep out all the immigrants
What, what, what, what you witnessin'
Military exercises demonstrated on citizens
Anti-war petitionin', drone strike incomin'
Homeless vets decorate the street, can't get no income in
How do you save a world that can't be saved, uh?
How do you raise a child that won't behave? (Preach)
Wakin' up from the lies, I feel betrayed
I'm guessin' the rabbit hole we dug was actually just a grave
Skeletons in the closet they fossilized
Niggas want the truth sugar coated and caramelized
Life is like a science fiction book where the author dies
Well I ain't dead yet 'cause the hit ain't been authorized

[Chorus]
I hear freedom ringin' but I won't answer the phone
Because the people on the other end will not leave us alone
Mr. Officer I come in peace just know I brought my piece
And if we can't settle this peacefully the violence will increase, yeah
I don't condone racial divide I won't be cloned
I will survive I walk alone look in my eye
So give me justice give me peace
Or give my freedom back at least
So we can meet up in the street you decide

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Who you bow to?
Elected councils, full of scoundrels
Who now rule the world around you
While wearing house shoes they clown you
You wear your house or your whole house full
Regimes don't die; they change they name and the accounts move
Life goes on with or without you
Words fall on deaf ears I think they soundproof
The sound of justice makes us cringe
But how can we stand the sound?
You can't even stand your ground
A noose around your neck the sharpest minds will cut it down
Caught inside the web the internet is tightly wound
Every day a hundred K? Feel more like a couple thou'
What's a dollar to a pound? What's a pound to the crown?
Look, ay
I'm sick of waitin' man this flag I'm sick of wavin'
No more participatin', time to form our own nation
You call it integration I call that discrimination
They say it's risk I'm takin' I call it decision makin'

[Chorus]
I hear freedom ringin' but I won't answer the phone
Because the people on the other end will not leave us alone
Mr. Officer I come in peace just know I brought my piece
And if we can't settle this peacefully the violence will increase, yeah
I don't condone racial divide I won't be cloned
I will survive I walk alone look in my eye
So give me justice give me peace
Or give my freedom back at least
So we can meet up in the street you decide

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
You not an activist you're more like a re-activist
False flags, crisis actors trying to re-enact some shit
Stories don't match I never believe half the shit
While they're sneakin' pass a law we're easily distracted, ay
Tryin' to get through to these dense fucks
You're too stupid to insult
I say the shit anybody can prove
I don't know guess if it rhymes it's gotta be true
Look, cheap tricks and fabricated speeches
Blonde hair blue eyes - they even fabricated Jesus
Just look at the salary paid to teachers
It's obvious they don't want us to graduate into leaders
Clearly in court videos don't prove much
Why is news cameras in the courtroom huh?
Even if it's just a game I hear the signal louder
I think I got the message they don't really care about us

I hear freedom ringin' but I won't answer the phone
Because the people on the other end will not leave us alone
Mr. Officer I come in peace just know I brought my piece
And if we can't settle this peacefully the violence will increase, yeah
I don't condone racial divide I won't be cloned
I will survive I walk alone look in my eye
So give me justice give me peace
Or give my freedom back at least
So we can meet up in the street you decide

[Harmonizing Bridge: Jóga by Björk]

[Outro]
Fuck you Farmer Jim!
You're all alone out here on the frontier
No friends, no family, no cops, no help at all
This is the Wild West son, the Wild fucking West
There ain't no guards coming out here to save your ass
It's just you and me and a murder of crows
Waiting to pick over our dead bones
So you take a breather
You let that sink in, don't take too long, yeah?

[Intro: Chris Brown & Brandy]
So let me fuck you back
So let me fuck you back
You

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I know it's late, I know it's late
And baby I can't focus, focus
I just flew in, in town today
I'm hoping that you notice, did you notice?
I just posted my landing, oh
Wondering if the same old understanding, stands

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I know you got work pretty early, I'll be around 'bout 3:30
Usually you done by one, so baby, when I wake you up, up, up

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Just let me rock, fuck you back to sleep, girl, oh
Don't say a word, no, no, don't you talk (Oh, yeah)
Just hold on tight to me, girl
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, rock you back

[Verse 2: Brandy]
You got my whole mind frame feeling out of focus
And now I'm seeing things I ain't never noticed in you
And if you make me feel like nothing else matters
And your love got caught up in a rapture
And if you still sure in the morning after
I want it in the morning after, you
Baby, I can tell it's real, not surfaced
And we fell in love on purpose
Let me ride, I need your body, yeah
Uh-huh, sweet, come down
Just you, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hold on tight to me
Sweet, rock you back, back, back
And your love got caught up in a rapture
And if you still sure in the morning after
I want it in the morning after, you
Baby, I can tell it's real, not surfaced
And we fell in love on purpose
Let me ride, I need your body, yeah
Uh-huh, sweet, come down

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (No)
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love (Hey!)
I know you want me, and you feel me (Feel me) 'cause you never disagree
So when you wake from your sleep, girl

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Brandy & Both]
Just let me rock (Let me love you, baby, oh yeah)
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, oh (Come down)
Don't say a word, no, no, don't you talk (Oh, oh, oh)
Just hold on tight to me, girl
Fuck you back to sleep, and rock you back

[Outro: Chris Brown & Brandy]
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (Fuck you back to sleep, girl)
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love (Rock you back, oh)
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (Fuck you back to sleep, girl, ooh)
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love
Let me rock, yeah
Uh-huh, sweet, come down
Where you gonna go in your winter coat?
I wonder what you're hiding cause it's not too cold
It's already too late
Somebody's gonna get you

And if I hold you too tight
Someone else won't get to
Oh, wouldn't you know it?
I keep it rolling
Considering no one
Punching a path
Facing the blast and the moon and the math
But you still never know where your soul is attached

Oh, wouldn't you know it?
Ah, wouldn't you know it?

I'm so confused
I can't move
I can't even try
I hope you find someone to lose
Someday

Now where you gonna go like a cobra coiled
Sweating in a sweater, you got too much style
But you're never alone
Some day they're gonna get you

I hope you find someone to lose
Someday
I hope you find
I hope you find someone to lose
Someday

Ah, wait
Come back

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah

Woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Will you stay
Just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will you stay
Just a little while, babe?
Said, just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, hold up, wait a motherfuckin' second (Wait a second)
I know you stressin', you don't gotta keep me guessin' (Keep me guessin')
I'm full of questions, In return I get the silent treatment (Shh)
I don't know why I'm speakin'
You say, you say, you say it's way too late, goodbye, you leavin'
Why you got me stressin'? (Oh my God)
I could have a whole collection, just be faded in my own dimension
You so complicated, I swear that pussy Grammy nominated
Let's make some music, fuck all of the bullshit

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Will you stay
Just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will you stay
Just a little while, babe?
Said, just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Okay now, baby, don't you leave my side, don't even try
I'ma go crazy, girl, you save me, meditate me, give me peace of mind
It's only she and I, ocean floor, how deep we dive
We be high, lookin' for another fuckin' tree to climb
She was playin' hard to get, I read between the lines
Binge watched Sopranos, made it all the way to season five
I am her, she is I
She had to come to see her freaky side, leavin' me behind

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Will you stay
Just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will you stay
Just a little while, babe?
Said, just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Just a little while, just a little while, babe?

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
The way you walk in to the room, ooh-ooh (Woo)
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more (Hell no)
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?
Yeah, girl, the way you walk in to the room, ooh-ooh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more (Hell no)
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go, girl?

[Chorus (Extended): Mac Miller]
Will you stay
Just a little while, babe? (Just a little while longer)
Just a little while, just a little while (Just a little bit longer, baby)
Just a little while
Will you (The way you walk in to the room, ooh-ooh)
Stay (All I think about is what I wanna do to you)
Just a little while, babe? (I don't wanna be polite no more)
Said, just a little while (Make yourself at home)

[Outro: Paige Montgomery]
Will you...
Will you...
Will you...
Yeah, daddy
Oh yeah, right there
Oh my God!

[Intro]
*Woman panting*

[Verse 1]
You hide your skin like ya shy or did somethin' wrong
You stylish when you got nothin' on, yeah
And all I do is make these fuckin' songs
So, finally, I made a fuckin' song
And now she comin' closer
Up she goes, she wanna jump my bones
You want it, don't ya?
I was a soldier, now I'm comin' home, the war is over
Kick down the door, I hold your bends, you never break
You need to smell your sweet aroma
See, I knows you smell like cinnamon, kissin' your lips
I lick my fingertips and get your clitoris in the mix
My dick on business trips
My tongue twistin' is ticklin' just a little bit
I'm swimmin' inside of your skin like a river
In the Caribbean

[Bridge]
It's okay that you like it, babe (I like it, baby)
And it's alright that you misbehave
It's okay to be this way (This way)
To live this way, baby, baby (Ooh, baby)
Chillin' with the AC

[Chorus]
(The way we are) That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks, here we are
(The way we are) I'm takin' care of each and every part
I open up your legs and go straight for your heart
The way we are, the way we are

[Verse 2]
Said I'm too divine, I'm too divine, yeah; too divine
Who am I? Well; I'm Mr. Superfly
I'm Mr. Ooh-He-Blew-Your-Mind, hot as June, July
I wanna make your waterfall
Girl, you my paintin', you my art installation
Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall
All I wanna do is show you off, I want to put you on
Why would I ever blow you off?
Right now, let's go get lost
Jet, I've been way too high for way too long
I'm so exhausted
Whether that's your mind or line, we still get crossed
First your name is gone
Never understand until you have to stand alone
Can I have a hand to hold?
A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold
Swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand these hoes
They didn't want a man when it was, "Man, I'm broke"
And now they know me and what I don't need
You gon' see it's gon' be what's gon' be

[Chorus]
(The way we are) That's just the way that we are
You and me, super freaks, here we are
(The way we are) I'm takin' care of each and every part
I open up your legs and go straight for your heart
The way we are, the way we are

[Outro]
These hoes
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoes
Taste this, taste, taste this
These hoes

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I think I'm stuck inside nostalgia
My mind are in the times when this love was so divine
But now it's feelin' like without ya
Feelin' like how the fuck did
We get into a place we ain't accustomed to lovin' inside of
I know I'm out of my mind more often than not
You know I'm used to givin' this all that I got, yeah
It's not a waste when that smile on your face
You tell me you outta place, you parked in my spot
Okay, baby, this a piece of cake
We could lay up on the beach, you could feed me grapes
This my favorite song, spin it ‘til the needle breaks
We could quit the whole game, do the real estate thing
It's how you beat the case
Put in work, turn that pussy to the office
Be on top of your game, this here a goddess

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
And I ain't here to break a promise
I'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly

[Chorus: Njomza]
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Okay, no mishaps, this, that, and the third
Don't go back on my word, yeah, I keep that shit gift-wrapped
Your pussy a ride better than Six Flags, I'm in that
No takeaways, no givebacks
No question, we've been through adolescence
And changin' direction, yeah, I paid attention to it
It's never been easy but now it's gettin' ruthless
A little more pain, that's just better music
Girl, what's on your brain? 'Cause that head is stupid
Lotta people suck a dick, but you can execute it
Perfect timin', don't you add another second to it
Don't you ever-ever-ever-ever-ever do it
Yeah, head pollution, conflict resolution
Keep it true, everything that I do witchu

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
I ain't here to break a promise
I'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly

[Chorus: Njomza]
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Show me you, show me you, show me you
Na-na-na-na-na-na

[Outro: Njomza & Mac Miller]
We don't have to pretend
We both know how it ends
I just need your presence
Wanna feel you feel me
Yeah, you just landed from the Planet God Damn, damn
Wanna feel you feel me
Wanna feel you feel me
You just landed from the Planet God Damn, damn
Wanna feel you feel me
Wanna feel you feel me

[Intro: Robin Williams]
Do you feel like you're alone, Will? Do you have a soulmate?
Somebody who challenges you
I'm talking about someone who opens up things for you—touches your soul
You can't give back to them, you know
You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where
You're always afraid to take the first step
Because all you see is every negative thing ten miles down the road
But you can do anything you want, you are bound by nothing

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, are you my soulmate?
My angel, what do you want with me?
Too high (Too high), slow pace (Slow pace)
My eyes closed, your body all I see
I think you're too divine for my human mind
When I'm with you, what do you do? Bring me to life
No matter what, one day everyone dies (Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh)
You think you a God 'til you run out of time (Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh)
Yeah, said, when you're gone (Gone), what will you leave behind?
Yeah, do I belong sometime soon? Where goes my mind? (Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh)

[Chorus: Mac Miller, with Unknown Woman]
You the one to show me
Divine love (Love), love (Love), love (Love), love
Where was you when I was lonely
My divine love (Love), love (Love), love (Love), love?
When the stereo plays our song, sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?
I'm right here

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, why do you stay on my case?
I try to make you feel okay
Do you know (Do you know) I'm in pain?
I give you clues, you misconstrued
You continue to push me far away
Why don't you call my name?
It's like you forgot my face
I just wanna taste of everything you made of
We ain't (Nothing)
Cut the strings, my balloon, watch me fly
Yeah, said, when are you comin' through to free my mind?
Are you happy with your life?
Can I come and satisfy? Open up, let me inside
When you take off all your clothes, I am under your control
Rollin' up, you get me high (Oh, oh, oh, woah-oh; alright)

[Chorus: Mac Miller, with Unknown Woman]
You the one to show me
Divine love, love, love, love
Where was you when I was lonely
My divine love, love, love, love?
When the stereo plays our song, sounds so clear
Baby, where'd you go? What's so wrong?
I'm right here

[Verse 1]
I've been counting off one that's vague enough, my death
I've been dreaming up one that needs a little more punch, my death

[Hook]
Afterlife

[Verse 2]
I've been feeling a lot more stately, now that I know my death
I've invested in what I wear, a formal look in death

[Hook]
Afterlife

[Bridge]
Even small, surreal reflections heal
Even small, surreal reflections heal
I think you lift and rip it up

[Verse 3]
I've been counting on one that's big enough, my death

[Hook]
Afterlife

[Verse 1]
Your latest episode hit upward from
Wait and see, it's you and me
I'm on the right road, connected from
A to Z, such a relief
Take it, take it, I'll take another
Don't you tell me the wrong number
I'd like to see
The guy come who is all night long

[Chorus]
I've been calling
Leaving messages, white walls
And advantages there
I've been calling
Leaving messages, white walls
And advantages
White walls and advantages

[Bridge]
Quality of life is hanging on the line
We're taking you
We're taking you

[Verse 2]
For you, something, bud
Take us and begin to see
It's you and me
With danger egging on, as you're blighted
We could see so differently
Take it, take it, take another
Don't you tell me the wrong number
I'd like to see
The guy come who is all night long

[Chorus]
I've been calling
Leaving messages and white walls
And advantages they're gone
I've been calling
Leaving messages, white walls
And advantages
White walls and advantages

[Bridge]
Quality of life is hanging on the line
We're taking you
We're taking you
Quality of life, it called not once but twice
We're taking you too
We're taking you too

[Verse 1]
I pulled a wire
You put your hand on me
That's what I wanted you for
I don't require a certain potency
Yes and no, it was before

[Verse 2]
Ketchup on your face
The Rams won the race
That's what I tapped you for
Statues they see, what we all could be
Is that what we're really in for?

[Chorus]
Let's share champagne in the sand
Let's share champagne in the sand

[Bridge]
White shirt, black dress in the desert
Couldn't tell you how we're on hour twenty-four
I'm nameless on hour twenty-four
I'm nameless on hour twenty-four

[Verse 3]
You don't get tired
As far as I can see
I've lost my sense of time and demure
I don't require more than you could be
Let's fall back and endure

[Chorus]
Let's share champagne in the sand
Let's share champagne in the sand

[Bridge]
White shirt, black dress in the desert
Couldn't tell you how we're on hour twenty-four
I'm nameless on hour twenty-four
I'm nameless on hour twenty-four
White shirt, black dress in the desert
Couldn't tell you how we're on hour twenty-four
I'm nameless on hour twenty-four
I'm nameless on hour twenty-four

[Chorus]
Let's share champagne in the sand
Let's share champagne in the sand

[Chorus]
I dropped them in the sink
Didn't have much time to think
Your earrings, your earrings

[Verse 1]
I heard a myth about you
One I wanted to, to be true
Although it's my first time over
I'll be the first to tell you
You have such nice glassware
Was I the first to stare
At your earrings, chandeliers?
I want to grab on and swing

[Chorus]
I dropped them in the sink
Didn't have much time to think

[Verse 2]
I heard a myth about you
One I wanted to, to be true
Although it's my first time over
I'll be the first to tell you
You have such nice glassware
Was I the first to stare
At your earrings, chandeliers?
I want to grab on and swing

[Bridge]
Staying at your place
I'll do my dishes, disrespect your wishes
Staying at your place
I'll do my dishes, disrespect you

[Chorus]
I dropped them in the sink
Didn't have much time to think
Your earrings, your earrings

[Bridge]
See Jungle, Jungle, Jungle, Jenny
See Jungle, Jungle, Jungle, Jenny

[Chorus]
And you're sweet to a shoulder
And you're sweet to a shoulder

[Chorus]
See Jungle, Jungle, Jungle, Jenny
See Jungle, Jungle, Jungle, Jenny

[Verse 1]
The love has taken me by her side
And she, she won't tell me a lie
Yet people say, I wouldn't say I'm
Although I want a sweet embrace. oh
Or would you rather be mine, lay down?

[Chorus]
And you're sweet to a shoulder
And you're sweet to a shoulder
And they just keep getting older
And they play every night
And you skip every night
And you skip every night
And you skip every night
And you skip every night

[Bridge]
See Jungle, Jungle, Jungle, Jenny
See Jungle, Jungle, Jungle, Jenny

[Verse 2]
It don't mean much to me, but it's right
'Cause lady luck, she's got you down for every night
Let's take a break, take me upstate, oh
Although I may have upstaged her, oh
Break a mirror, break a mirror, break a mirror, just break, oh

[Chorus]
And you're sweet to a shoulder
And you're sweet to a shoulder
And they just keep getting older
And they play every night
And you skip every night
And you skip every night
And you skip every night
And you skip every night

[Bridge]
See Jungle, Jungle, Jungle, Jenny
See Jungle, Jungle, Jungle, Jenny

[Verse 1]
Need to feel alive
Come to feel a
Certain grief than I'd like to allow
It's all erratically great, ecstatically
The darker the leaf
Then you're slated now

[Chorus]
I've never taken something so lightly
It's the cold Vermouth
It's the truth
Now sing

[Verse 2]
Construct a real love, something real love
Contemporary in its values and what not
This time let's spend somebody content with
Trying on jeans and get on with the show

[Chorus]
I've never taken something so lightly
It's the cold Vermouth
It's the truth
Now sing, now sing, oh
I've never taken something so lightly
It's how it's how we've sinned
That's when it begins
Now sing

[Bridge]
Take another step
Take another step

[Verse 3]
Need to feel alive
Come to feel with
A sense of aesthetic and 

[?]

[Chorus]
I've never taken something so lightly
It's the cold Vermouth
It's the truth
Now sing
It's how we've sinned
That's when it begins
Now sing

[Chorus]
Too late now
Your entrances are exits with a bow
Too late now
Your entrances are exits with a bow

[Verse 1]
She's got no monastery way
Hard to ignore, she's over the praise
There are no mistakes
It's in your eyes
How can you live your life this way
Like we live on 

[?]?
There are no mistakes
It's in your eyes
Sitting in the backseat
Hoping we can meet

[Chorus]
Too late now
Your entrances are exits with a bow
Too late now
Your entrances are exits with a bow

[Verse 2]
Watching you sit, read, and sigh
The perfect length to live and die
There are no mistakes
It's in your eyes
As you give a long goodbye
Names in stone are the reason why
There are no mistakes
It's in your eyes
What's your instinct?
What's your instinct?
What's your instinct?
What's your instinct?
Sitting in the backseat

[Verse 1]
When I found my peace of mind
You opened up your mouth
And it's gone
Stretched and 

[?] align
You're wearing all my clothes
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Eyes on the floor, where you wanted to be
Eyes on the floor, where you wanted to be
How could I be yours
When what I want is nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Liner notes with designer clothes
No one's heard the news
And you're gone
If your dress knows where it goes
You'll stop the car and reverse
And it's gone

[Chorus]
Eyes on the floor, where you wanted to be
Eyes on the floor, where you wanted to be
How could I be yours
When what I want is nothing at all

[Verse 3]
Own the bars behind the stop
Your comfort comes to soon
And it's gone
Drive your cars behind the stops
No one says what they really want after all

[Chorus]
Eyes on the floor, where you wanted to be
Eyes on the floor, where you wanted to be
How could I be yours
When what I want is nothing at all
Eyes on the floor
Eyes on the floor
Eyes on the floor

[Verse 1]
You're right
This is not happening now, no no
The King and I and I know I am
Stay the night in Siam
There's good light in the bar outside of town
You tried to know what I said and who I am
The King and I and I know I am
Stay the night in Siam

[Chorus]
Make me wait and I will die
Hesitate, you won't see sunlight
Oh yeah, you try
Isolate me from others, how to stay
You won't get it away
Concentrate on what you're doing, you might
You might've made a mistake

[Verse 2]
Come inside
This is not happening now, no way
Little King and I and I know I am
Stay the night in Siam
There's a flat on the rock, could not be the bound
You tried to know what I said and who I am
The King and I and I know I am
Stay the night in Siam

[Chorus]
Make me wait and I will die
Hesitate, you won't see sunlight
Oh yeah, you try
Isolate me from others, how to stay
You won't get it away
Concentrate on what you're doing, you might
You might've made a mistake
You might've made a mistake
You might've made a mistake

[Verse 1]
We're taking off
It's like I told you
There'll be more time for garments and sweets
Gazing off, oh I can hold you
And maybe have another drink for free

[Pre-Chorus]
Put me down for another while she's asleep
Put me down for another while I read
Put me down for another, you think I'm sweet
Remind me your name

[Chorus]
Pretend I'm someone else
Pretend you're not yourself
Pretend I'm someone else
Pretend you're not yourself
Pretend I'm what you wanted
And maybe have another drink for free
Oh I'll scoot over, there's an extra seat
Pretend I'm what you wanted

[Verse 2]
We're taking off
The pilot told you
The sky's the lane for our fantasy
Blow it off, you're dropping phone calls
And stay a while to come and curl up with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Put me down for another while she's asleep
Put me down for another, no disputing
Put me down for another, quite something
Remind me your name

[Chorus]
Pretend I'm someone else
Pretend you're not yourself
Pretend I'm someone else
Pretend you're not yourself

[Verse 1: Britney]
Friday, I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it, cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Britney]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (oh yeah!)

[Chorus: Britney]
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Post-Chorus: Britney]
Baby, cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or little bars
Really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are, need you
I've always wondered what was off limits
Staring at you til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this was all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we could tell that there's changes coming
See I could tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go
Like Penelope in "Blow"
Well worth the stealing you, it's a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah
But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you

[Bridge: Britney]
Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
Cause I got me for life
Oh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul
I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keeping me alive
I don't need anything to make me satisfied
Cause the music does me good and it gets me every time

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
And as far as I can see I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me get a world that they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
Cause this hunger is driving me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speaking on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends, we don't take L's we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends

[Chorus: Britney]
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Post-Chorus: Britney]
Baby, cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
(Yeah, you make me oooh...)

[Verse 1: Akon]
I was running away from myself
Had a barrel inside of my head
I was lying awake in my bed
Thinking 'bout all the things I should have said

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
But now I'm stronger, I'm so much stronger
No more running, not any longer
And now I'm stronger, and finally I can say
That I'm not afraid, yeah

[Chorus: Akon]
I'm gonna break the silence
Cut like a laser through the dark
I'm gonna light a fire
Cause I'm not afraid, no
I'm gonna fight the triads
They are no chains around my heart
I'm gonna light a fire
Cause I'm not afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, I'm not afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, don't be afraid, I'm not afraid

[Verse 2: Akon]
Wish that you could be here with me now
I've overcome the demons inside, yeah
I keep hearing your voice late at night
Telling me, gotta fight for your right

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
But now I'm stronger, I'm so much stronger
No more running, not any longer
And now I'm stronger, and finally I can say
That I'm not afraid, yeah

[Chorus: Akon]
I'm gonna break the silence
Cut like a laser through the dark
I'm gonna light a fire
Cause I'm not afraid, no
I'm gonna fight the triads
They are no chains around my heart
I'm gonna light a fire
Cause I'm not afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, I'm not afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, don't be afraid

[Bridge: RedOne]
No, they can't hold me down
Seen it rising up from the ground
No, they can't hold me down
Seen it rising up from the ground
Can't hold me down
Can't hold me down
Can't hold me down
Can't hold me down

[Chorus: Akon]
I'm a warrior, oh mama, I'm not afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, don't be afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, I'm not afraid
I'm a warrior, oh mama, don't be afraid

[Chorus: will.i.am]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on?
Can we all just get along?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love)

[Verse 1: will.i.am, (Jamie Foxx & Mary J. Blige)]
Yo, what's going on with the world, momma?
(Where's the love)
Yo, people living like they ain't got no mommas
(Where's the love)
I think they all distracted by the drama and attracted to the trauma, mama
(Where's the love)
I think they don't understand the concept or the meaning of karma
(Where's the love)

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy, (Mary J. Blige & Cassie)]
Overseas, yeah, they trying to stop terrorism
(Where's the love)
Over here on the streets, the police shoot
The people put the bullets in 'em
(Where's the love)
But if you only got love for your own race
(Where's the love)
Then you're gonna leave space for others to discriminate
(Where's the love)

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how hate works and operates
Man, we gotta set it straight
Take control of your mind, just meditate
And let your soul just gravitate to the love
So the whole world celebrate it

[Chorus: will.i.am, Mary J. Blige, Andra Day, Nicole Scherzinger, Tori Kelly, & V Bozeman]
People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preachin'?
Would you turn the other cheek again?
Mama, mama, mama, tell us what the hell is goin' on?
Can't we all just get along?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love)

[Verse 4: Taboo, (Jessie J & Andra Day)]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
(Where's the love)
New days are strange, is the world insane?
(Where's the love)
Nation droppin' bombs killing our little ones
(Where's the love)
Ongoing suffering as the youth die young
(Where's the love)

[Verse 5: The Game]
Where's the love when a child gets murdered, or a cop gets knocked down?
Black lives, not now
Everybody matter to me, all races
Y'all don't like what I'm sayin'? Haterade, tall cases
Everybody hate somebody, guess we all racist
Black Eyed Peas do a song about love and y'all hate this
All these protest with different colored faces
We was all born with a heart, why we gotta chase it?
And every time I look around

[Verse 6: Taboo, Ty Dolla $ign, (Mary J. Blige & Jessie J)]
Every time I look up, every time I look down
No one's on a common ground
(Where's the love)
And if you never speak truth, then you never know how love sounds
(Where's the love)
And if you never know love, then you never know God, wow
(Where's the love)
Where's the love y'all? I don't, I don't know
Where's the truth y'all? I don't know

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin' people dyin'
Children hurtin', I hear them cryin'
Could you practice what you preach?
Would you turn the other cheek?
Father, Father, Father, help us
Send some guidance from above
Cause people got me, got me questioning
(Where's the love, where's the love)

[Bridge: DJ Khaled (Usher, Nicole Scherzinger, will.i.am & Justin Timberlake)]
Love is the key
(Where's the love)
Love is the answer
(Where's the love)
Love is the solution
(Where's the love)
They don't want us to love
(Where's the love)
Love is powerful
(Where's the love)

[Verse 7: A$AP Rocky & Jaden Smith]
My mama asked me why I never vote, never vote
Cause policemen want me dead and gone, dead and gone
That election looking like a joke, such a joke, man
And the weed man still sellin' dope, oh no
Somebody gotta give these niggas hope, please hope
All he ever wanted was a smoke, my gosh
Said he can't breathe with his hands in the air
Layin' on the ground died from a choke

[Verse 8: apl.de.ap & Fergie]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
As I'm gettin' older y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas
What happened to the love and the values of humanity?
(Where's the love)
What happened to the love and the fairness and equality?
(Where's the love)
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
(Where's the love)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
(Where's the love)

Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Verse 2]
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed

But it's praise that I'll get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

Can't you see we livin' in a war zone?
Guess you don't notice when you livin' in it
Like every weekend it's a man down
Ain't got no pity for the innocent so I'ma represent it
Dedicated, tell 'em,"Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe"
Hands up, can't you see we livin' in a war zone?

[Verse 1]
They left his body swangin' down in Piedmont
At a Klan rally the day before, but that ain’t mean nothing
What they say "a suicide", I say it's genocide
Hey what you got a gun for? Boy you ain’t finna ride
They run up on you like Baton Rouge, bet you finna hide
That's the difference 'tween us, I'll die to save a million lives
Appointed leader when nobody couldn't think of shit
I'll be a martyr if my great grandaughter benefit
They pull you over, ask you where your license at
Be careful reachin' for it, you know you can die for that
And this ain't nothin' new, just got cameras so you can see the shit
Got Dr. King and Abe Lincoln askin' where the freedom at
This ain't no equality
Man you ain't have no justice on your mind when you shot at me
But fuck it, this the way it gotta be
Hey listen, you won't shoot at them then shoot at me?
Boy you are not a G
Imagine Trayvon askin' why you followed me
Feel threatened, hit him and whip him, that’s when he shot him down
Do that to a grown fuckin' man, drop where you stand
Tell my grandma go on with all that prayin'
If it's a God and he in the sky, he looking down, he understand
I'm just a man, and I'm wrong for revenge
But I don't get 'em it's like tellin' him to gon' kill again
Keep fucking around, it’s going to be on in a minute

[Chorus]
Boy we livin' in a war zone
Guess you don't notice when you livin' in it
Like every weekend it's a man down
Ain't got no pity for the innocent so I'ma represent it
Dedicated, tell 'em,"Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe"
Hands up, can't you see we livin' in a war zone?

[Verse 2]
This goes to the white boy that ran in the old church
I hope you get slow murked, and they torture you slow first
Ran in our place of worship to slaughter our grandma
Won't go kamikaze for that, well what would you die for?
Hold up... I'll wait, I'll wait
Heard it from buddy who took for the fall for Watergate
The war on drugs was just a war on us
Give us all these guns, give us all this dust
Change all them laws, lock all of us up
Went from Freeway Ricky, on to BMF (free Meech)
Then hip hop came, that's when we got rich
Cause white kids gravitated to it like all us did
And that's when they got slick
Invented the technology to take our shit
Diluted all of the artistry
Pardon me, somebody tell me what happened to Alton
Sterling, killed Philando right in front of the girl
And the world saw
Everybody's reaction was, "Hell naw"
This modern day slavery, the prison publicly traded
And the jig's up
The Constitution and Emancipation Proclamation's just a fuckin' piece of paper

[Chorus]
Can't you see we livin' in a war zone?
Guess you don't notice when you livin' in it
Like every weekend it's a man down
Ain't got no pity for the innocent so I'ma represent it
Dedicated, tell 'em,"Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe"
Hands up, can't you see we livin' in a war zone?

(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, oh-woah, oh)

[Verse 1]
I'm just tryna hold onto to a dream
Out here lost and nothing's what it seems
I'm just tryna find where I belong
This must be the dark before the dawn
When the place that you were born is not where you belong
Tell me baby, what stops you from wearing a crown?
I wanna be somebody, be somebody
And I wanna go somewhere, go somewhere

[Chorus]
Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, baby
Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Back to life, life, life, life, life, life, life, baby
Back to life, life, I been waiting for all of my life
Back to life, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmhmmhmm

[Verse 2]
Climb out from the bottom baby
No more looking back only straight up
Foot on the pedal baby, it's time to find what you're made of
Everybody wants to be adored
You don't have to settle for being ignored

[Chorus]
Back to life, back to life
Nothing can break you
I will survive, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Back to life

[Bridge]
I'm not made to be locked up
If a bird don't fly, then what were wings made for?
Oh, I'm not meant to be locked up
And if I don't try, then what was I made for?

[Chorus]
Back to life, back to life
Nothing can break you
I will survive, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Back to life

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
I remember standing there groovin'
Noddin' my head, just movin'
My girlfriend dragged me to this place
Starin' at the crowd like we do
I saw this guy at the table
And that's when I saw your face
But you came over to me
As sweet as can be
And grabbed my left hand
Started steppin'
What else did I need to know
I'd say 'Yes!' if you wanted to go
Cause you were havin'
But you left me here

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
So I gotta see that boy again
Cause I gotta feel that joy again
I remember leanin', on your shoulder
Somethin' to call up, what he order?
That's why I, I am on this floor again
I wanna see that boy again
Listen to me

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
My girlfriend says introduce her
But I ain't gonna lie when I lose her
That's so nice you want to pay
Ooh you have a way with females
I didn't get your number or e-mail
What the hell was in my brain?
Oh I know that you'd believe
But I couldn't let you see
That I was stressin'
I lost my breath and
Then you grabbed your Mercedes keys
But you pulled before you leave
And I just stood there
Like I didn't have a care

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
So I gotta see that boy again
Cause I gotta feel that joy again
I remember leanin', on your shoulder
Somethin' to call up, what he order?
That's why I, I am on this floor again
I wanna see that boy again
Listen to me

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
It's like the part in the movie
The Getaway
Oh no, not the person you want
The person you want to lose him
So you pray
But the circumstances
Changes course
Which is entirely
Up to the boss
But remember
That just because it's written
Don't mean you can't play
You had to change your fate

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
So I wanna see that boy again
Cause I wanna feel that joy again
I remember leanin', on your shoulder
Somethin' to call up, what he order?
That's why I, I am on this floor, I'm on this floor
Looking for you, where did you go?
Where did you go?
I'm on this floor
I don't wanna leave without you baby, yeah
Yeah, where went my baby?
I can see you standing there

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Sandy Squirrel
Life's the ocean, and you're my world
Or the oyster and you're my pearl
You're the only one that's for me
I'm sorry Mr. Krabs
Yes I know the daughter you have
But come on man you can't be mad
I gotta squirrel livin' in the sea

[Verse 1]
You medicine girl, a medicine girl
You're so heavily in a Hell of a world
You make my mind shine like a head of a pearl
And strut through my thoughts like straight of the curls
And why why why do I feel like cryin'
Every time you leave I swim right down
I wanna call, text but I ain't no time
I know I never want it but I feel like cryin'

[Chorus]
Sandy Squirrel
Life's the ocean, and you're my world
Or the oyster and you're my pearl

But come on man you can't be mad
I gotta squirrel livin' in the sea

[Verse 2]
Wear the cowboy hat and that's so wrong
Like FlogGnaw,  and that's so dope
And I think they won't stop and that won't go
It's like bass droppin' and it won't blow
Out your window and out your car
A couple lay ways and some stringed Guitars
Gotta love picture's in an Ice cream Bar
Can this verse be shortened please? Aha

[Chorus]
Sandy Squirrel
Life's the ocean, and you're my world
Or the oyster and you're my pearl
You're the only one that's for me
I'm sorry Mr. Krabs
Yes I know the daughter you have

I gotta squirrel livin' in the sea
Sandy Squirrel
Life's the ocean, and you're my world
Or the oyster and you're my pearl
You're the only one that's for me

[Intro: TEE]
Yeah, you guys ready?
TEEさん
Katy Perry and TEE
Uh-huh, here we go!

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 3: TEE]
妖異の魔女だと 言われても
どうにも止まらんぞ 分かってても
狂喜の愛ほど 抑えられない衝動
こいつが bueno (aha!)
ゴージャスなそのlips
とろけそうなkiss
視線の先の 男どもを
一目で招く
富士山芸者も脱帽
この国の宝と並ぶほど
見てみろ マジbeautiful
ゴージャスな美貌で
イチコロ

[Bridge: TEE]
危険なシグナル
あの日から感じてる
逃れようとしても
その魔法にヤられる

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (you should know)
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse (like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for (ready for)
A perfect storm, perfect storm? (A perfect storm)
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine (mine)
There's no going back

[Chorus]
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
(Do they really know this? Let me check 'em)
You want it, let's do it, ride it, jump on it
My saddle is waitin' (Sing this if you know it)
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it

[Interlude]
Oh shit, y'all really know this
But y'all don't know this how I know this
Can I, um, fuck this up?
Let me switch it up on 'em B

[Verse]
See you're frustrated, baby, your man can't do you right
I get so excited, baby, just to get a good night
Said we don't gotta move, don't get the move
Said we can get this crunk and get this crunk, baby
Hit you with that funky sound
That's how you know it's going down
Now we up in your city, baby, I'm a T.O. nigga flexing
I'm just tryna fuck every girl, baby, that live in Austin, Texas

[Chorus]
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony (Sing this shit loud)
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it

[Outro]
Okay, hold on, hold on
Alright, okay

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
You feel that?
That's the sound of the kids...
With no fucks to give
With no luck for shit because they didn't grow up as rich
That's the sound
That's the sound
That's the sound of niggas locked in the pen
Doing a bid with more time then they should give
That's the sound of an oppressed nation
Tired of chasing villains that don't got no faces
That's the sound of a nation that don't got no patience for faux proclamations
Warlocks in churches in sacred locations
The sheriff’s a Klansman, the judge is a Mason
Not to be biased and not what your faith is
But how do I trust my own country and state that's more loyal to Satan then their own occupation?
The system is rigged, if I vote will I change it?
Greed will consume us with no moderation
Blamed for a beast I'm not sure I created
I'm not sure I'm created, like I'm inside a game I'm not sure that I'm playing
It's a whole operation
Whether it's real or whether they staged it
Shit get so tense when I go out to places if I fuck around and sneeze in the air I can break it
And people feel so violated, you feel what I'm feeling before I can say it
Before I can step in the studio to lay it
I know what my role is I know I ain't basic
But I guess the truth must hurt, I guess that's why they butthurt
All the secrets that I unearthed no stone left unturned
To learn to fly you gotta jump first
I touched the sky that's why I'm sunburnt
I change a life in only one verse
Welcome to the seventh pinnacle
Somewhere between the metaphysical and hella spiritual
I seen hell and hell is digital as well as visual
Hell is how they did the Aboriginal
Hell is when the innocent get murdered and they don't arrest the criminal
Oh my, oh my god, oh my god, take the steering wheel 'fore I do something that I ain't intend to do, no interviews!
Pacing in my living room!
B.o.B. what's gotten into you?
You wylin’ you advantage 

[censored] shit like you are invincible!
People always ask me "Jeez why you still living dude?"
Shit I wonder why I'm living too!

[Verse 2: B.o.B.]
Why I'm living too
Why I'm living too
Say whats wrong with me? Shit whats wrong with you?
'Cause me I'm feeling good
Me, I'm in my zone I look up in the sky
I know this can't be home
And I know I ain't alone
They try to take your home
They try to sway the weak, and they try to break the strong, huh
But I'm not a quitter
God's child not God's dinner
On God I'm Godzilla
Try to plot, I'll make the plot thicker, huh
See the middle class got a lot slimmer, and the upper class got a lot richer
They want a revolt, they want you to riot, they want you to try it
They wanna provoke us to keep us divided, but the people are no longer quiet
They say Bob they gon' to take you out if you keep rhyming this way!
Huh, I say fuck it we all going to die anyways

[Verse 1]
Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Shamon, ah Shamon
Lay it on me
All right

I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about

[Pre-Hook]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing

[Verse I]
... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry

[Chorus]
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

[Verse 2]
You... you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please don't leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light

[Chorus]
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

[Bridge]
Oh let me think I'm strong
Please don't bring me down
I need you tonight

[Chorus]
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

[Outro]
I... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky

Young Money in this motherfucker Squad Up

[Verse 1]
Isn't it funny how many times we can say
We've drawn the line, crossed it out, turned the page
And moved on
That's what we thought
But here I am in the same old car
Having myself another same old brown-eyed thought
Uh oh, uh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road 'til the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

[Chorus]
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
I'll fall back on you

[Verse 2]
We always let someone come in between
Talk around the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

[Pre-Chorus]
You won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
And we'll tell each other things like I love you

[Chorus]
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people that you come back to
So fall back on me
I'll fall back on you

[Bridge]
Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
But just maybe, you belong with me

[Chorus]
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people that you come back to
So fall back on me
Baby, I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me
Baby, baby, I'll fall back on you
Fall back on you, ooh, ooh
Fall back on you

[Chorus]
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go I want to  be sedated
Nothing to do and no where to go-o-oh I want to  be sedated
Just get me to the airport put me on a plane
Hurry hurry hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers I can't control my brain
Oh no no no no no

[Chorus]
Just put me in a wheelchair get me to the show
Hurry hurry hurry before I go loco
I can't control my fingers I can't control my toes
Oh no no no no no

[Chorus]
Just get me to the airport put me on a plane
Hurry hurry hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers I can't control my brain
Oh no no no no no

[Outro]
Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I want to be sedated

[x5]
I used to play the fool all by myself
You used to make me feel real good
I used to eat my food all by myself
I used to do the dishes too
I used to break your heart all by myself
I used to be the only one around...

Be yourself, there's no understanding
Something that happened that night
Be yourself, there's no understanding at all
There is no understanding, noooo

[guitar solo]

Be yourself, there's no understanding
Something that happened that night
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no
There is no understanding

Be yourself, there's no understanding, no
No understanding what happened
That night baby
Be yourself, there's no understanding
Oh
There is no me and you
Me and you

[Intro 1 - Bill O'Reilly's Meltdown]
I can't read it there's no, there's no words on it
(Okay) What is (For credits)
I don't know what that means "to play us what out"
What does that mean?
To end the show? (Yeah)
Alright go, go (In 5, 4, 3...)
That's tomorrow and that is
(5, 4, 3...) That's tomorrow and that is it for us today
And we will leave you with a
I can't do it. We'll do it live
We'll do it live, fuck it
Do it live, I'll write it and we'll do it live
Fucking thing sucks

[Intro 2]
You and me brother, in his hands
He's got you and me sister, in his hands
He's got you and me brother, in his hands
He's got the whole world in his hands

[Hook: B.o.B]
This world is not what you think it is
This world is not what you think it is
This world is not what you think it is
Am I the hand that moves or the fingerprint?

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Uh, fingertips
World is at my fingertips
Reefer in my cuticles
Police want my fingerprints
Count the fucks I give, on my left hand if I was fingerless
Middle finger shit
Tell the hookah girl to bring some tips, uh
Fingerprints identical to a genius's
Blame my temper, I don't say it unless I mean the shit
What's the difference between the critics and the hypocrites?
Same difference between Re-blood-licans and Demo-crips
Bandz

[Hook]
This world is not what you think it is
This world is not what you think it is
This world is not what you think it is
Am I the hand that moves or the fingerprint?

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Why the cost of living so overpriced?
Keep my lawyers on retainer like an overbite
When you the stoner type
A lot of weed be over-hyped
Half a pound or more, a quarter won't suffice
You see what my composures like?
Been on the road for forty nights
Never make a hoe your wife
But these days hoe is life
Always got something in the air like Poltergeist
There's your warning activity; paranormal
I feel it in every corner, aroma of marijuana
By now this shit should be legal on every corner
That'll happen once they get profits off every grower
Madness, I see Babylon and it's crashin'
I'm asking, why this was crafted, who is the admin?
The masses, feel like we're captive in this contraption
I'm spazzin', I'm Captain Stabbin'
Salute the savage
Bandz

[Bridge]
You and me brother, in his hands
He's got the whole world in his hands

[Hook]
This world is not what you think it is
This world is not what you think it is
This world is not what you think it is
Am I the hand that moves or the fingerprint?

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I, I see savages, I seen savages
Battered children, shattered families
Shots fired off so quick so fast you would think it's on accident
All done for the red for the white and the blue, like
Wait who's flag is this? (USA)
And I ask you was it an act of valour or a strange reality? (Huh?)
And they make us free thinkers feel like we the radicals (Huh?)
But the world is a battlefield
And right now we the Establishment (Woo)
When it comes to war, there's no real parameters
American pie is the sweet distraction
From what's really happening

[Hook: B.o.B]
I can see the vultures, fly over me
Watchin' me all the time
With blood on their wings
I feel 'em getting closer, closer
I feel 'em getting closer, closer

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I, see the plan is to eradicate the planet
Anyone who opposes mysteriously will vanish
The travesties are endless, the list is gigantic
The stakes have been raised, time to wheel in the cannons, it's propaganda
And all they gotta do is turn on the cameras (Lights, camera, action)
And they'll say anything to make it all look random (make it all look random)
As they hide the keys to unlock the answers
Last time I check the double standard is not a standard at all
And we fall, and we struggle just to get right back up and then fall
But we climb, and we crawl, and we fight 'til it's off
And we search through the dark
Trynna make sense of these laws just to figure out that it's flawed

[Hook: B.o.B]
I can see the vultures, fly over me
Watching me all the time
With blood on their wings
I feel 'em getting closer, closer
I feel 'em getting closer, closer

[Outro: B.o.B]
Watching over me, over me
Trying to get a hand and control of me
Controlling me, controlling me
I remind myself of myself long ago
'Fore I could drive, 'fore I could vote
All of the time, holding a grudge
'Fore I knew people could die just because
Shot from a sling, head full of buzz
I knew what I liked was not very much
High at the time, tied to the grid
Always afraid of those normal American kids

Oh, all of my spirit leaked like a cut
I knew what I needed would never be enough
I was too high to change my bid
Always afraid to be a normal American kid

Always hating normal  American empty summer days
Lightning crazed and cracked like an egg
High behind the garden shed
Painting myself as a normal American kid
I always hated it

High as high as high can loom
Under the sheets in my bedroom
I was high as high can get
Always afraid of those normal American kids
Oh, bongs and jams, and carpeted vans
Hate everything, I don't understand
High times tightening the lid
I had to get away from those normal American kids
Always hated those normal American kids
Always hated those normal American kids
I know that I'm unknowing
I'm never totally right
I'm gonna walk away slowly
Instead I bid you good night
Another goodbye
I'm gonna cry

Cry, cry, cry
Cry all day

Whatever you're withholding
I never said it was good
If I could sell it by the dozen
I'd never dare but you would
I know that you would
I'm aware that you could

Cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
Cry all night
I had a hole in my heart
I had a "company" me
It kept me whole-y from rolling
Someone into something like me
Something like me
You don't wanna be

I cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
I cry all night
I cry all day

And I cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
Cry all night
At the open mic
I sing and I stall
I fall on the knife

However, there's another
Another future to fight
I never took it so seriously
Oh, it was serious alright
Watch 'em all fight
But you can't fight it
And I cry
Cry all day
Cry all night
Cry all day
Cry all night
All day

And now the hounds are calling
I see the world I find
I'm sick of your affliction
But you're just a smartass and blind
Out of the light
Now be kind

Cry, cry, cry
Cry all day
All night
Into the light
Into the light
Into the light

[Intro: B.o.B]
It watches me, it always watches me
It watches me, it always watches me
What I see, what I see
What I see, what I see

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Lookin' ass
All them cameras, what you looking at?
With your crooked ass
I see you fuckers and I'm lookin' back
What you think I'm a terrorist?
Shit I thought I was American
Shit you niggas hilarious
Shit I'm intelligent enough to know that I don't need a president
The problems we face, whoever's elected will never take care of'em
(Why every, why every) Why every country we ever invade speak Arabic?
I gotta say, how many politicians does it take?
How many prayers does it take for Grace?
Look it's a war going on
It really don't matter what country you from
It's more than just bombs
The rich get the steak, the poor get the crumbs
It's more going on
Life is horror for many but joyful for some
Blood on the corporate song
Where you think they get the bread to pay mortgages from?

[Chorus: B.o.B]
It watches me, it always watches me
It watches me, it always watches me
What I see, what I see
What I see, what I see

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
They say nothing is more important than winning
Even if you gotta forfeit your winnings
What that make the rap game if extortion is business
Is that why all the legends have unfortunate endings?
Of course I'm relentless
Lil' hoe, of course you offended
It's more than the conspiracy you see
Of course it's intended
I'm doing more than just venting
They doing more than just killing, shit
They poison everything that's why the poor get the sickest
Now if you gargle raw cranberry juice for more than two minutes
(*spitting sound*)
Spit it out, you gon' have morgellons in it
Of course there's no indictment
Shit they endorse all the killings
The metamorphosis of mankind
The story's tremendous
Bandz

[Chorus: B.o.B]
It watches me, it always watches me
It watches me, it always watches me
What I see, what I see
What I see, what I see

[Intro: Kari Faux]
(That's right)
(That's right)

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino & Kari Faux]
All I see is zombies
Walking all around us
You can hear them coming
(They come to take your life)
You can hear them breathing
Breathing down your spine, oh

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
All I see is zombies
Hear them screaming louder
They can smell your money
And they want your soul
Here they come behind you
Try to stay alive

[Chorus: Kari Faux & Childish Gambino]
We're coming out to get you
We're all so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it
You will find there is no safe place to hide, hide
(That's right, that's right)
(That's right, that's right)

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino & Kari Faux]
All I see is zombies
Feeding all around us
All they eat are people
(And you won't survive)
They don't know what happened
They just stay alive

[Chorus: Kari Faux & Childish Gambino]
We're coming out to get you
We're all so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it
There is no way to stop it
You will find there is no safe place to hide
(That's right, that's right)

[Bridge: Kari Faux]
We're coming out to get you
We're all so glad we met you
We're eating you for profit
There is no way to stop it
There is no way to stop it

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
Do you feel alive, yeah?
Do you feel alive, yeah?
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Do you feel alive?

[Verse 1]
My mother says I'm great
And it always makes me sad
I don't think she's being nice
I really think she believes that
So now I bend my days around the people
Other people obey, whoa

[Chorus]
So sad it's nothing
Happiness depends on who you blame

[Verse 2]
I gather things can change
So maybe she's asleep in her grave
She gave her body to science
So I'm not sure what's in her place
Maybe roses or Tanqueray, whoa

[Chorus]
So sad it's nothing
Happiness depends on who you blame

[Verse 3]
I know the dead still listen
She sings a part of every refrain
Under the weight of the living
Pointing a finger
With no eyes to aim, whoa

[Outro]
So sad it's nothing
It's absolutely nothing
So sad it's nothing
It's absolutely nothing
So sad it's nothing
Happiness depends on who you blame
Some harm for the past
Others dream of at last
Days continue
Multiply multitudes
I wonder who destroys
When no one is left, rejoice
All our statues, lullabies and rented rooms
Distances no one will go
For instances no one can know
I say good night
Leave the room unsatisfied
Like a child, I lie
Almost alone, not quite

Crowded avenues
Homeless in tennis shoes
Sometimes I wish to set free
The things that still matter to me
Days continue
Like a knife might intrude
I wonder who destroys
When nothing is left, rejoice
Nothing is left, rejoice

[Verse 1]
Have you seen any mention?
It’s been quiet in detention all week
Is that so?
I saw the winter party person candidate, give a sermon
Shook his fists like this
Is that so?
And everyone sat as blank as a cake
And in love like a stupid lump of clay
Is that so?
I know a good Armageddon might have made my day, that day
Is that so?

[Chorus]
We aren’t the world
We aren’t the children
But you are my safety girl

[Verse 2]
And you know we could go and spend ourselves like money
Let’s pretend we’re hundred dollar bills
Like so
And complain every day there’s a spider in my soup
Tired of my opinion, like everybody else
Is that so?

[Chorus]
We aren’t the world
We aren’t the children
But you’re my safety girl

[Post-Chorus]
Like so
Oh, is that so?

[Chorus]
We aren’t the world
We aren’t the children
But you’re my safety girl
Sometimes when I'm fading
I fight to stay awake
Here I lie, come and take me
I'll go
I will go so far just to say goodbye

My, my in my opinion
I tried, I huff and I puff
Why am I in my skin again?

Well, I don't know how it works
So I just say goodbye

Sometimes I see sorry faces
I don't think I qualify
Be kind as the nights embrace us

Oh, oh, we tried so hard
Oh, as if I have answers
Oh, we tried so hard
Just to say goodbye

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Ayo, Brody
I don't think they stoppin' us right now (Uh), haha

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Uh, nothin' can stop me, I'm way too cocky (What?)
Turn you into chopped meat, in hockey, I'm Crosby (What?)
Sidney: All of y'all ain't fuckin' wit' me when I'm rackin'
'Cause you're, you Alex Ovechkin, haha
And I'm all sorts of nice
You the type to get strangled by a cordless mic (Haha)
You think you buzzin', I ignore your hype
Freestylin' 'cause your ass can't afford to write
And me, well, I do boast, but I'm too dope
Your whole crew chokes 'cause they know I chew most (Most)
Blue smoke and it's rolled in a cigar
Your girl wanna let me hit 'cause she know that I'm a star
You wack and can't spit, trapped in sandpits
You scruffy as a mutt, rockin' hats with dandruff, ha
I rolled a whole zip, blow it in the air (Air)
I spit cancer, now you losin' all your hair (Hair)

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Yung Brody]
I stand strong, nothin' gon' stop me
We got the verses, Big Jerm got the hot beat
We gon' blow, 'bout to let it go (Ayo, Brody)
You need to let 'em know
I stand strong, nothin' gon' stop me
We got the verses, Big Jerm got the hot beat
We gon' blow, 'bout to let it go (Ayo, Mac)
You need to let 'em know (Listen, I said)

[Verse 2: Yung Brody]
Cops tryna knock me, no one can stop me
Niggas look a little sloppy, I'm swingin' like Rocky
Strapped like an armed robbery, I'm robbin' 

[?]
I'm arrogant, athlete, ride bitches like jockeys
Yeah, I'm quicker than fast, gettin' rid of this cash
Chopper in my hand just to split your fitted in half
I'm hungover, bent, plus a hundred percent
Nice Catholic boy, so I cooked your mother for lent
Rich nigga shit, yeah, like I'm listenin' to Gucci
Pop three shells, leave 'em fizzin' like a roofie
Man I'm just a 

[?]
And I'm comin' through next
Pushin' numbers like 1-800-COLLECT (Yes)
Yah

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Yung Brody]
I stand strong, nothin' gon' stop me
We got the verses, Big Jerm got the hot beat
We gon' blow, 'bout to let it go (Ayo, Brody)
You need to let 'em know
I stand strong, nothin' gon' stop me
We got the verses, Big Jerm got the hot beat
We gon' blow, 'bout to let it go (Ayo, Mac)
You need to let 'em know

It's IRAJ and Soulja,  Sri Lanka

[Hook: MARKIA]
I hate that I love you after all you did to me
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
Feeling kinda lost cause we dont speak
Trying to be strong but im so weak
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
I ain't even thinkin bout you

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Hit the mall and im switching lanes
A lot of diamonds on my neck like six chains
Baby girl round me and you know that
Everything official i got gucci on my doormat
Jump in the whip then i smash out
We dont talk about the price we just cash out
Me and you we just doin what we do
You know im always thinking bout you
I need your love all to myself
I dont wanna see you with nobody else
She calling my phone tattos all inked up
I pick up the phone and then we link up

[Bridge: Soulja Boy]
Baby girl you know you a dime
You always on my mind
Baby girl you so fine
You know I had to make you mine, had to make you mine

[Hook: MARKIA]
I hate that I love you after all you did to me
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
Feeling kinda lost cause we dont speak
Trying to be strong but im so weak
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
I ain't even thinkin bout you

[Verse 2: MARKIA]
You ain't a ride or die, you would die to ride
Gave you TLC but then Lisa left I
Thats when our texts fly, arm out the X5
With my S6 showing me the exit
You precious and I ain't desperate
I know realness when i see it
The one I wanna be with
You can take it you can leave
With dreams so big I ain't even gotta sell em
I sit back and let Soulja Boy Tell Em

[Bridge: Soulja Boy]
Baby girl you know you a dime
You always on my mind
Baby girl you so fine
You know I had to make you mine, had to make you mine

[Verse 3: MARKIA]
Till the wheels fall off and the lights have burnt out
Said I'm riding with you
Till the wheels fall off and the lights have burnt out
But are you riding with me
I can't leave you alone, even though you did me wrong
I think we got, I think we got, thats why

[Hook: MARKIA]
I hate that I love you after all you did to me
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
Feeling kinda lost cause we dont speak
Trying to be strong but im so weak
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
I ain't even thinkin bout you

I ain't even thinkin' bout you

[Intro]
I'm talkin' 'bout my brand and you talkin' 'bout your brands
The difference is a lot of MMMMMMMMMMs to your couple hundred grand
Young Money!
Shout out to Lil Wayne for signing a lil chick from Queens
New York City

[Verse 1]
Young ma, it's the female Jay
I'm a brand accordin' to what retail say
Yeah my tours be sellin' out on presale day
Plus I got the title queen stream, press replay
Testified for my nigga to the DA's face
One time for this super old PA case
I'm still schoolin' bitches like GA State
And I'ma still ball, call me T.D. Jakes
Bars for years, niggas thought I did a bid
I'm draggin' these hoes like Harambe did the kid
Shut the club down, it was poppin' then we slid
I call my pussy liquor, I ain't talkin' 'bout a swig
But if you thirsty, I own a sangria
Shout out to Fox Brown, I don't mean Pam Grier
I got a sign that say "Lames can't hang here"
Bats eyelashes, blank stare
He be like, "You came?," I be like, "You came?"
He say my ride game smoother than a Muslanne
Every time they count me out I be like, "You sane?"
Bitch I come back like Jordan in his flu game
Every time I shoot it, it be all net
I give him ostrich, that mean all neck
Anything he need, I got on deck
And go to sleep playin' with his ballsack

[Verse 2]
Hahahah... Aaaaah! Rrrrrr...
They wanna know my recipe
They know I ball like the niggas at the ES-PYs
Strung out on the pussy so I call her Crystal Methanine
Shorty tryna give me brain like telepathy

Got a bitch lookin' like Chanel ads
Chillin' out in dem Beverly Hill pads

[Sips] Mmm.. Tastes good... Hahah...
Yo, don't ever talk about Nicki in the past-tense
Unless I fly pass that ass in a fast Bent'

You throw shade, but I sun bitch
And now you know what I'ma say, you my son, bitch

[Outro]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
No more "please, stop"
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' to make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this? Do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, whoa

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home

If you try and take it break your collar and your spine
I'm one of a kind, money followin' my rhymes
See the cash on the table? Well all of it is mine
Pockets full of 20s cause I'm all about my money
Goin' home every night with a Playboy bunny
Money, money, money all about the cream
Rules everything around me, nothing here is free
See Easy Mac, he be all about his cheese
Fresh white T, matchin' kicks lookin' clean
A crispy fitted cap with a hoodie to match
Show up to the party askin' where the pussy is at
Spit game so easy like this shit on beginner
I'm gettin' bitches naked fast, quicker than a stripper
Rollin' up a swisher full of the finest green pines

I'm like hell with my heat, I'm too hot
Easy Mac but don't forget the jukebox
See, that's my name don't wear it out
And if you don't hold your tongue I'ma tear it out
You and your mans talkin' shit? You can share a mouth
See I´m the best right now, I don't care what's out
Cause I'm just tryna get mines with the money on my mind
Stayin' on the grind like a clock and the time
I'm a hot rhymer, even better writer
Scarin' MCs, make 'em up and shit they diapers
Cause they just see what they can
Battle cats'll have to cry and pee in they pants
There goes Easy Mac
He got some good trees, let me get a G of that

[Verse 1]
In the end, when they're all gone
When the world is silent and the days are long
Just you and I, we'll be alive
We made it on our own

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody wants to think they won't
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody seems to think they won't, they won't, they won't, they won't

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm still alive but my heart is beating slow
Baby, tell me I gotta know
Are you okay? You seem too far gone
Infected, standing there all alone

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody wants to think they won't
And everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody seems to think they won't, they won't, they won't, they won't

[Post-Chorus]
The best of me, the best of me is you
The best of me, the best of me was you

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ladum, badum, mmmm

[Verse 1]
Just charge it to my account
I hope I haven't gone over my limit
With interest rates so swift
No need to scream and shout
No doubt if women are from Venus now
I'll get to them somehow

[Bridge]
All I want to do is please you
Please myself by living my life too

[Chorus]
And all the stupid things I do
Have absolutely no reflection on How I feel about you
How I feel about
All the stupid things I do have absolutely no reflection on
How I feel about you
How I feel about you yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh yes I recall
Skipping on breakfast to play basketball
Then feeling two feet small
Sometimes you read like William Shakes
Your scent is sweet like Betty Crooker bakes
I'd love to have your cake and eat it to

[Bridge]
All I want to do is please you
Please myself by living my life too

[Chorus]
And all the stupid things I do

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah

Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah

The competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne, bumpin' New Edition

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah

[Verse 3]
Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit
Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I'm that nigga bitch, got your main hoe rollin' my swishers
Bitches love Yachty, stackin' paper up so I can buy my stack
Anthrax got my trunt beatin' in my jeans, scratch
I'm too fly, rollin' up this purp got me too high
Double dippin' any bitch I want, them walk it out like I'm D.j Unk
Pull the 9 out and let 'em have it, pillow talkin' niggas swear they faggots
Talkin' 'bout you movin', blowin', countin' guap, boy, your ass cheaper than coin star
Talkin' 'bout you got the xans with the lean need to wake up from the dream
How many times I done told you before that I'm up next?
RD gettin' way too hot, RD gettin' too reckless
I can tell that he fu from the looks of his necklace
Niggas mad cause I'm stackin' guap
Fuck her friend straight for days
Fuck your hand out I got my ways, seein' goofy niggas like an xray
Hangin' out the window with the AK, this the new trap for the fly niggas
They like any of my ride or die nigga, I don't fuck with you that's on god nigga
And if you talkin' down he can catch hollowtips straight to the side nigga
Got the block hot, trail blazer, lemme show you 'round the whole trap baby
Pots and pans near the scale baby, rollin' up a whole 12 baby
I can't fuck with 12 baby, I really been stackin' up lately
Got a white bitch, look like Joseph lately , got the brown whip like a bowl of gravy
I'm a hot boy, these hoes crazy, I could never ever trust 'em

[Verse 2: K$preme]
(I cannot trust 'em)
Stick'em six feet below the ground, nigga better not make a sound
(?), but I still knew the pound
Ballin' soo hard I'm on NBA Bound
(?) now his body can't be found, your shoes drippin' you might fuckin' drown
Servin' pints all around the town, bitch I'm drippin' and dabbin', and right then I'm in the wax
Smokin' thrax, sellin' thrax, pull it out my hat like a magician
I could write you a prescription, lemme stop givin' these niggas descriptions
I make music for the young and dumb, lean in my cup got my body numb
And my blunts fatter than a swollen thumb, damn, I do not drink rum, this purple
Got me geekin' like Steve Urkle, got your bitch out past her curfew
100 pack shawty, now I'm a walkin' lift, and (?) whip the brick
(?) got the whip
Do not try to run cause I got a stick, doggin' niggas just like like Michel Vick
Whippin' soo hard, done sprained my wrist, finessin' soo hard I can't call it quits

Yo, she hit me with that killer

Body tight for the summer
Get it, get it for the winter
Real playa niggas need something that they can lay on
That shit on my mind
I need something to spend my day on
And I love her like my niggas, my niggas, my niggas
'Cause she ain't 'bout my figures, my figures, my figures
And I care less 'bout these hoes

Got the keys to the Benz
I don't even drive my shit no more

I hope that you hear what I'm saying
I'm hoping and praying, I'll say it again, I...

I said yes I was an idiot

[Verse 1]
Can you sing to this harmony?
Can you let a quartet set you free?
This tonality, doesn't disagree
Ought to be chromatically pleasin' me

[Chorus]
All that I want
Is some good loving musical thoughts

[Verse 2]
I got to see, learn this history
Pull another record from your sleeve
A mystery, if you don't believe
Slip another coin in my machine
(Baby, you're my kind)

[Chorus]
All that I want (All I wanna, hear the drum ah)
Is some good listening musical pop (And Madonna. And marijuana)
The gift keeps giving
Use what you've got  (shake it mama, upset your karma)
Not what you're missing

[Solo]

[Chorus]
All that I want (All I wanna, hear the drum ah)

[Intro]
Everything, everything, everything...

[Verse 1]
I watch her every morning
Putting on her make up
That girl comes without a warning
So addicting, I can’t get enough
She gets dressed for work, grabs her keys then she leaves
Yeah that goodbye kiss kills me

[Chorus]
There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
She’s everything I want and need
And then she's even more
When I see her face, I can’t help but think
There goes my everything
Everything, everything, everything...

[Verse 2]
Everytime we’re in a party
I still watch her from across the room
I ain’t notice everybody
They can’t even help but watch her too
Dressed up or dressed down
And she can’t help but shine
I can’t believe she’s mine

[Chorus]
There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
She’s everything I want and need
And then she's even more
When I see her face, I can’t help but think
There goes my everything
There goes my everything
Everything, everything, everything...

[Bridge]
I watch her every morning
Putting on her make up

[Chorus]
There goes my everything
My everything
My all, my love for sure
She’s everything I want and need
And then she's even more
When I see her face, I can’t help but think
There goes my everything
There goes my everything
When they met, the way they smiled
I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know
That it would never end
You should be ashamed
To show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart

Once you promised me, you know
That it would never end
You should be ashamed
To show your funny face, my friend
And there they are, they fell in love
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart

[Verse 1: Etta Bond]
To see him leave, was like watching as the sun sets
He was my accomplice
We did everything together
He was like my shadow
I was something like his warmer sweater
Turn to me, like a prayer
And anywhere I had to go
He'd take me there
Don't lie babe
I know you're scared
Sacrifice truth
'cause you chose the dare, yeah

[Chorus: Etta Bond]
2x
This can't be love
I don't do this
I don't do this

[Verse 2: Etta Bond]
Can't believe that you used to bring me breakfast
My plus-one to any guest list
Wouldn't see one without the other
When he left, I lost a limb
Felt like I lost a brother
So I turn to prayer
'Cause a life without you can't compare
Don't hide,babe, I know you're there
Are we missing out on life
Just because we're scared?
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Intro: Marie Antoinette Wright]
Alright, um, before we get started we wanted a get well shoutout to music producer Kanye West, he's doing fine, but he was in a car accident last week, so we just wanna send him our best from over here at 106 & Park and all of y'all, we hope he gets better soon, and keeps doing those hot beats that he does-does-does

[Intro: Talib Kweli & Kanye West]
Alright. In case y'all don't know, he did "H to the Izzo", he did "Takeover", he did "Guess Who's Back", he did my joint "Good to You", he did "Turn Out The Lights". Give it up for my nigga Kanye West, you know what I'm saying? Now Kanye, y'all also don't know my man got skills, he's a rapper, he's on my projects, so I want him to bust a verse, can we let my man bust a verse? What's up Kanye, what's up? (They gonna play my beat, they gonna play my beat?) Yeah, yeah, chops, listen. Woo, woo, woo, mic check, mic check-

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"
I mean two platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with me y'all

[Hook: Kanye West & Talib Kweli]
New York City here! New York City here!
New York City here! New York City here!
It's like, guess who's bizzack, back on the track with the blow
Kanye to-the, representing his gold
Guess who's come back, better than I supposed
Heard that beat, shit it's all I know
Guess who's bizzack, live from the Plaza
The Roc' is definitely in the building
Back on the track, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
It's time to change up, my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin' if I'm nice like fuckin' with a chick
Who don't give head, that's a no-brainer
Niggas back bangers you don't even know the names of
Imma bout to meet my quota, you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack nigga, you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli, that's how you get got!
Not that I'm wildin' or even promote violence
You're fuckin' up my high, can a nigga smoke in silence?
Damn, New York City in the house!
Talib Kweli gotta tell you what it's about
Because my man Kanye from the Chi' will say hi
Wave your hands from side to side
Mos Def, Kweli--
I got my man, he represent the 

[?] projects

[?]

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
I say guess who's bizzack, Kweli, Kanye, and Mos
Punk niggas getting way too close

[?] Broadway doing them all day
Niggas 

[?] but don't take it the wrong way

[?]
Doing Iving Plaza, causing disaster
You bring the time but we bring the prescription
Pick up your ears so you all could listen

[?]

[Outro: Kanye West]
I be killin' these niggas on this lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips
And since takeover, it seems like the whole hood want to get a Jimmie Jones makeover
Niggas forcing me to keep the heater
Black strap, white handle, I got Jungle Fever

[Intro]
Usher, Usher, Usher
Yeah, man

[Verse 1]
So we back in the club
With our bodies rocking from
Side to side, side-side to side
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie
Gone back to life, back-back to life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hands up
And suddenly, we all got our hands up
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby, tonight

So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, go on, get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

[Verse 2]
Keep downing drinks like there's no tomorrow

Gon' set the roof on fire

Down, down, down, da-da-down, down

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hands up

Put your hands on my body

[Verse 1]
It's 3 o'clock on the dot, see you walking
School's out and the bell just ring
So I pulled up, hop out the truck
Said to you lil mama, you a precious thing
Let me drive you home or something
You replied said, you don't need nothing
But you live more than a couple of blocks
Get up on the drop and baby girl, don't be fronting
Girl, I look swavey in my ride
I ain't these other busters, girl I'm 18, plus I drive
And I can take you places you ain't ever been before
If that don't make you comfortable
I'll drive you to your door

[Chorus]
Baby, baby girl, you are a star
When you say you're walking far
You can hop in my car
And shawty I say
Baby, girl, I know you walking long
But you ain't got to walk alone
Lead you right to your door
And I'm gon' tell you
Baby, no I ain't these other guys
And I'm young but girl, I try
I can give you a ride
If you just let me
Baby, ain't tryna call myself your man
But shawty, you should
Give me a chance
And let me drive you home

[Verse 2]
We done talked for about ten minutes
Thinking if you should trust me
Girl, I tell you I'm a good guy
The type any mother would like
You got the body and the beauty of a good wife
So I'm tryna take you by the hand
Opening the door for you
I'm saying to hop in
There's just 1, 2, 3, 4
Steps until you up in my whip
I said it's 1, 2, 3, 4
I promise girl, that I'll get you there

[Chorus]
Baby, baby girl, you are a star
When you say you're walking far
You can hop in my car
And shawty I say
Baby, girl, I know you walking long
But you ain't got to walk alone
Lead you right to your door
And I'm gon' tell you
Baby, no I ain't these other guys
And I'm young but girl, I try
I can give you a ride
If you just let me
Baby, ain't tryna call myself your man
But shawty, you should
Give me a chance
And let me drive you home

[Bridge]
Baby girl, I promise that I'm gon' get you home
But I just can't sit back and let you walk alone
'Cause the more that we keep talkin' 'bout it, talkin' 'bout it, talkin' 'bout it
I know that you don't wanna walk away from me
But girl, you got my promise
That I'm gon' keep it honest
And girl, you know, I'm honored to be able to be
Driving you home

[Chorus]
Baby, baby girl, you are a star
When you say you're walking far
You can hop in my car
And shawty I say
Baby, girl, I know you walking long
But you ain't got to walk alone
Lead you right to your door
And I'm gon' tell you
Baby, no I ain't these other guys
And I'm young but girl, I try
I can give you a ride
If you just let me
Baby, ain't tryna call myself your man
But shawty, you should
Give me a chance
And let me drive you home

[Outro]
Yeah, let me drive you home, baby
Swavey, baby, yeah
It's that real R&B for you

[Verse]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops that's where you'll find me
Oh somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
And the dream that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?

[Intro]
Too real
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 1]
Rush hour, fresh out the dealership
Me and my homies eat gefilte fish
I ain't even worried about a silly bitch
Tell the feds chill with the censorship
Members only, I'm the only member with a membership
Trying real hard not to conversate with pessimists
Who always want to see you fall down like The London Bridge
Same song sung by a bunch of kids, can I live?
Tabloids watching which crib
Competition and the bitches got my name on they lips
Takin' shots like 1 8 7 is they favorite offense
Real dawg, should've came with a fence
Smokin' tree, baby I could pitch you a tent
A lot of windows don't be selfish baby call you a friend
I should make 'em box for Benihana, wake up in the mornin' feed em left over Benihana
Eatin' sushi off her body no karate I'm the inter-sake
3 ninjas, Tum Tum, Colt, & Rocky
Bloodsport Van Damme
Polo can't manage
Even with my eyes shut, I would never take damage.(Too Real)
You should build a room for the panic
Switch my whole style up
Capoeira fight dancing
Not to say I'm Bobby gettin' fancy
I should probably change my name to Jamie
Soo Young lead me in a winehouse
Juntao kidnap her, throw her in the 'cedes
Now the asian enjoyin them some dim sum
You don't know about it need to get one
How the car new but the rims young?
You got the foreign whip? so what I'm on my 10th one

[Verse2]
Yeah, niggas we deep in this bitch, right?
Stacking on them niggas like 'Jitsu
I'm a Great White you're fish food
We should talk face to face like men do
But you too used to makin' moves how a bitch move
Probably wear the same pad that your bitch use
I'm just tryna show you what you been through
Spinnin' in the same circle like a rim do
OG in the game, strokes beard like Rick Rub'
Tokyo, they whippin' in the caddy, we can drift too
When I drift through, bad bitch mixed with hindu
She got every shoe except issues
Bag full of money, MAC makeup and a Shih Tzu
Or sake shots for my little Geisha
She'd rather die than give up our location
She gone turn to Chun-Li in any altercation
I ain't gon lie that kinda turn me on, fuck her in the 'cedes
Jitsu, Jitsu, Jitsu, Jitsu

[Outro]
This is only the beginning, the road gets tougher, now that you're a ninja, and if I told you that, I guess it would ruin the moment
So I'll tell you later

[Hook]
The things that we think but don't really say
The feelings beneath, that never escape
We all try so hard to be something great
Sometimes we just need some negative space, some negative space
Space, space, space, space

[Verse 1]
And she said:
"You don't love me like you used to
You don't call me like you used to
You should do it like you used to"
(Space)

[Verse 2 (x2)]
We always knew this end in bad blood
Who thought the end would be so close?
We always know this never add up
The watered gardens that don't grow

[Verse 3]
And I can feel your lust
I can feel your loneliness within your touch
I just wanna know how do we say trust
To make these empty promises that don't mean much
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
The things that we think but don't really say
The feelings beneath, that never escape
We all try so hard to be something great
Sometimes we just need some negative space, some negative space
Space, space, space, space

[Outro: Verse 3 (repeated)]
I can feel your lust
And I can feel your loneliness within your touch
I just wanna know how do we say trust
To make these empty promises that don't mean much
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Someone wrote this song before
And I could tell you where it's from
The 4736251 to put my mind at ease

[Chorus]
Please just have a laugh with me
'Cause you know I'm borrowing by now
These sounds, have already crowned
Come on it's a silly dream
Dreaming of the imagery unfound
The view sits nice from that cloud

[Post-Chorus]
And if you want a piece of my thoughts
There's a coin worth flipping
Why don't you toss?

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Please just have a laugh with me
'Cause you know I'm borrowing by now
These sounds, have already crowned
Come on it's a silly dream
Dreaming of the imagery unfound
The view sits nice from that cloud

[Post-Chorus]
And if you want a piece of my thoughts
There's a coin worth flipping
Why don't you toss?

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah. uhh
I just adjusted my method
They try to muddy my message
Another corrupt one elected
Another new puppet selected
This ain't a fairly tale, yeah, far from an urban legend
In a war propaganda can often be used as a murder weapon
What's the direction we're headed in?
Can't get arrested and not get neglected
Guessing my presence is threatening
Put you on game and they try to discredit it
Thanks to the Internet we can see racism isn't as dead as they said it is
Serious as getting beheaded
They edit the footage then go off for beverages
Oh me, oh my the keys unlock the closed mind, huh
Fee fi fo fum, I see the beast close by
But an eye, for an eye, for an eye, for an eye, for an eye
Soon we'll all be blind, over time, over time, over time
Bandz

[Pre-Hook]
Weed don't get me high like it used
They say I don't sound like I used to
But an eye, for an eye, for an eye, for an eye, for an eye
Soon we'll all be blind, over time, over time, over time

Hook

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
United Savages of America, huh
Corruption, extortion, torture, et cetera, huh
Looking for war that we can declare on ya
Like, "Hmmm, we can just control this whole area"
Overbearing clutch
Country run by billionaires'r'us
Evil predator
Don't want the beef if it ain't rare enough
Police scared of us
Propaganda and hysteria
What's in the dairy truck
Crops and produce sprayed in fairy dust
Budget cuts like an uppercut from the upper class
All they serving is plates of suffering succotash
I know someone in power, someone behind the mask
When I find someone, imma whoop someone ass

[Pre-Hook]
Is what you're asking for really what you are ready for?
It's time for action and that is not a metaphor
I know someone in power, someone behind the mask
When I find someone, imma whoop someone ass

Chorus

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Uhhh, I respect your silence
But I won't comply with tyrants
Or confide in dead messiahs
By now you know a lot about me
Nothing's ever private
Whatever you're looking for in life you'll more than likely find it
Guns, drugs, sex, basically everything but guidance
Most of our life we guessing shit
The rest is left to science
They just give you the dots
But see, you gotta connect the right ones
The rope is around all of our necks
But in the hood it's slightly tighter
The cause of death is bias
Because if you get shot then DaQuan did it
If a flood kill you then God did it
Get assassinated, then the mob did it
You don't know the killer unless a cop did it
We treat our problems how we treat our criminals
We lock them long as we can so we don't have to deal with them
Rain bandz
Outro

[Verse 1]
All the way from Waco to WeHo with a rabbit on her chain
Drove a little slick car to tend bar with the static on her brain
She's a little burner, burner, gonna throw you to the flame
Little ticking time bomb, time bomb, gonna blow us all away

[Chorus]
Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

[Verse 2]
Tex, he was her boyfriend with no kin always running from the law
Every other weekend, the week ends with his back in her claw
He's a livewire, wired, shooting sparks in the night
He’s a gun for a hire, hired with a bead in his sights

[Chorus]
Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, facing where the lines are broken
Oh, name your price to all this living
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, face it where the lines are broken
Oh, name a price to all that's living
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder]
See the girl with the diamonds in her shoes? Yeah
She walks around like she's got nothin' to lose
Yeah, she's a go-getter, she's everybody's type
She's a queen of the city but she don't believe the hype
She's got her own elevation, holy motivation
So I wrote some letters out in big bold type

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
I got faith in you, baby
I got faith in you now
And you've been such a, such a good friend to me
Know that I love you somehow
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
See the boy with the Stevie Wonder swag?
Ain't got a clue all the magic that he has
He's a go-getter, he's everybody's type
I'ma make it my mission, make him feel alright
He's a twelve on a ten point, rockin' out to his joint
Just say the word 'cause I could sing all night

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder & Ariana Grande]
I got faith (Faith) in you, baby
I got faith (Oh) in you now
And you've been such a, such a good friend to me
Know that I love you somehow (Love you somehow)
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith

[Bridge: Stevie Wonder, Ariana Grande & Both]
Faith
Yes I do, mmm
I get around ya and my mind goes crazy
I think about you mornin', noon, night and day
I get around ya and my mind goes crazy
I think about you mornin', noon, night and day
I got faith in you, honey (I get around you and my mind goes crazy)
I got faith in you, girl (I think about you mornin', noon, night and day)
I got faith in you, honey (Baby)
I got faith in you, girl
I met you, hallelujah

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder, Ariana Grande & Both]
I got faith (Faith) in you, baby (Baby)
I got faith (Faith; oh) in you now
And you've been such a, such a good friend to me (Woo)
Know that I love you somehow (Love you somehow)
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith (Faith, faith, baby)

I met you, hallelujah
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
Faith (Woo)

[Verse 1]
Baby, you're my Bugsy Malone and I'm your suicide blonde
You could be my film noir star, I'm your Queen of Saigon
If they don't think we're good together
Baby just forget 'em, and let bygones be bygones

[Refrain 1]
Baby, I can't go it alone, 'cause you're the one that I want
You can be my Tony Montana, and I can be your Pfeifer fire
I can take you higher, I can get you hooked on love and desire

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hello, pretty baby, you can be my cherry pie
You walk into the room, my heart goes boom
Send me to the sky

[Chorus]
So tonight are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die
Are you gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna be true love suicide?
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die

[Post-Chorus]
I be murderin' 'em, murderin' 'em, just for fun (eh)!
I be murderin' 'em, murderin' 'em, one by one (eh)!
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die
So tonight are you gonna be my soldier? (Eh)!
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde? (Eh)!
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die

[Verse 2]
Baby, you Sylvester Stallone, and I could be your Adrian
With tender lips I got you in the ring
To say my name again, say my name again, say my name again, (huh)

[Refrain 2]
Baby, I can't go it alone, 'cause you're the one that I want
You can be my Tommy Mottola, and I can be Mariah, tiger
Scream a little higher, I can get you high on love and desire

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Not since Bonnie and Clyde was two kids so good at being bad, bad, bad
I'm flirtin' with the checkout counter baby, put the money in the bag

[Chorus]
So tonight are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die
Are you gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna be true love suicide?
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die

[Post-Chorus]
I be murderin' 'em, murderin' 'em, just for fun (eh)!
I be murderin' 'em, murderin' 'em, one by one (eh)!
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die
So tonight are you gonna be my soldier? (Eh)!
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde? (Eh)!
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die

[Bridge]
Would you kill for me?
Would you die for me?
Put your hands where I can see them, put them in the air

[Chorus]
So tonight are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die
Are you gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna be true love suicide?
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die

[Post-Chorus]
I be murderin' 'em, murderin' 'em, just for fun (eh)!
I be murderin' 'em, murderin' 'em, one by one (eh)!
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die
So tonight are you gonna be my soldier? (Eh)!
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde? (Eh)!
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die

[Chorus]
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek? Then open up the curtains
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek? Then open up the curtains
Baby, it's a freakshow

[Verse 1]
I wanna know, what do you like?
What would you say, if I said I'd do anything to you you want?
I wanna know
Yeah, it's alright
New positions, bet you would like
You've been screamin', "Stop, yes, please, hon!"
Baby, you've got tricks in my head
Craziest chick you've ever had
I heard what you said in your sleep
You wanna wear, you wanna mend
I like it rough, I like it fast
I know that deep down you're a freak

[Pre-Chorus]
Just say the magic words and I'll come
I'll hypnotize you
You're gonna lose your mind, don't you know?
Baby, it's a freakshow

Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek? Then open up the curtains

Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
'Cause I'm sure you're tired of being certain
Baby, it's a freakshow
Baby, it's a freakshow

[Verse 2]
When you're alone, what do you dream?
I wanna know your fantasy
Don't matter how wrong it might be
I wanna see, know what I mean
Psycho and fun, sexy and mean
It's just different when you're with me
I want it all
I got a spell, put it on you and I won't tell
Your secret, 'cause I am your slave
You want it hard, you want it tough
I like it long, never enough
I promise that I won't behave

[Pre-Chorus]
Just say the magic words and I'll come
I'll hypnotize you
You're gonna lose your mind, don't you know?
Baby, it's a freakshow

[Chorus]
'Cause I guarantee you've never seen a show like this before
Gonna show you something that you can't ignore
Wanna take a peek? Then open up the curtains

Show, show, show, show
Show, show, show, show
Baby, it's a freakshow

[Intro]
Yeah
Oh na, na, na

[Verse 1]
Call your phone, you never picking up on the first one
Only time I swallow my pride, when the thirst come
I pick it up when you drop it down, you know I'm on one
You gon' be my baby tonight, let you hold something

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of these shadows
You can't wash away from me
You can't make a woman love you
A little boy can't be a king
Hotter than fever
Out of your mind, so I'm burned away
You think it's all about you
I be so confused 'cause

[Chorus]
You be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind, no
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind
You be wasting (Yeah), you be wasting time, oh (Huh)
You ain't on my mind, no
You be wasting (Yeah), you be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh

[Verse 2]
All of you bitches be lying to niggas and running a check up
Serving and swerving and fucking on niggas, just fucking their head up
I don't beat around the bush, I eat it, baby, let me help, put them legs up
Let me see you on that Tempur-Pedic, girl, we gon' be fucking this bed up
Girl, I know you fugazy
And I ain't gonna waste my time 'cause I know she a hater
And I know she can read my mind but do me a favor
Don't waste my time

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of these shadows
You can't wash away from me
You can't make a woman love you
A little boy can't be a king (Oh, woah)
Hotter than fever
Out of your mind, so I'm burned away
You think it's all about you
I be so confused 'cause

[Chorus]
You be wasting time, oh (Huh)
You ain't on my mind, no
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind
You be wasting (Yeah), you be wasting time, oh (Huh)
You ain't on my mind, no
You be wasting (Yeah), you be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh

[Verse 3]
Ha, they don't wanna believe a nigga
Put the dick on her, don't wanna leave a nigga
Take the panties off, on a bitch like a heat missile
My scene jumpin' on my team
Count a hundred million cash on my jeans denim
I got more numbers than your cell phone (Cell phone)
Too many bills when the mail come (Mail come)
I'm that nigga that they're scared of (Scared of)
‘Cause I'ma take a fade head off
You ain't gotta listen to a nigga
I like it 'cause I see that change when the money come
I turned to nothin' back into somethin'
Drive with the heat like the end off summer
And girl, you know it's OHB, yeah
Only hot bitches love me 'cause

[Chorus]
You be wasting time, oh (Hey!)
You ain't on my mind, no (Oh, oh, ooh)
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh
You ain't on my mind (Ooh, ooh)
You be wasting (Yeah), you be wasting time, oh (You've been wasting time)
You ain't on my mind, no (Yeah)
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh (Yeah, yeah, oh, oh)
You ain't on my mind (Oh, oh, oh)
You be wasting, you be wasting time, oh (Ooh)

[Outro]
Wasting time
Ooh
(One, two, three, okay)
You're walkin' on hot coals now, you fuck
'Cause you're a joke, yeah, you're a hoax and now I found you out
'Cause you think the brains in your head are worth
Breathing this smoke and itchy throats and being happy
And I could be your man all day and you could look inside my brain and see this one thing
But then it disappears like smoke and you're alone

I forget
How to play
The game
Everyone
Wants to come
Along
I don't know
Where you are

(One, two, three, okay)
You're starting to look really weird, oh, yeah
Your face is out of place and I can't make you out
And I forget just what you said
Yeah, it's not clear, it was about fear and getting out of here
But you're okay with me
Tear it down
It's not right
Tear it down
It's not right

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I might let her drive my Bugatti
I might let her ride my Ferrari, yeah

Money I don't need when I'm jumpin' out the Wraith
Smokin' on dope got me higher than space

Countin' up the money every day

Baby ride the wave
Catch me in my 'Rarri that's a 4AA
Catch me in my 'Rarri that's a 4AA, yeah

Now I'm fucking girls that I never fucked before
Fucking girls that I never fucked before

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
Came a long way from zero
Now I'm a neighborhood hero
Movin' that pack like I'm Nino
Takin' nigga's shit like I'm Deebo
My lil bitch she got water like FEMA
I'll be your Martin and you be my Jeana
Lil Duke and Soulja Boy in the hills leanin'
Brand new Ferrari, I don't do no Beamers
Fuckin' all these bitches I've never seen before
Fuck all my partners and fuck the whole team it go
I do this shit for my people though
And I got strips like a zebra ho
Pull out the chopper, these niggas they faster than cheetahs
My niggas buzzin' like beepers
Poured a whole 8 in a liter, this shit illegal
Step in the back when I'm smokin' a reefer
Burning like Snoop Dogg, I'm chiefin'
Niggas be flexin', they broke and they leaches
Please tell me how can I teach 'em?
Boy you get popped if you reachin'
Po we gon' stop you from breathin'
Ran it up, turned to a liter

Now I'm fucking girls that I never fucked before
Fucking girls that I never fucked before

[Outro: Soulja Boy]
Fucked before
Fucked before
Never fucked before
Fuckin' all these girls that I never fucked before
When you're in some bad light
In the climbing flood
And you kneel before them
It's common sense
It's practical
Lay low
One moment I beg
I bolt
On a thousand legs
What you can't say swallow
At the moment I'm bored
Buried more and more and more and more

I slam my finger in the door of love
God damn the judging
Strangers judge
All I want, all that I want
A burning bush or
A button to push
A chance encounter
With common sense
Common sense
Oh, I can't say what qualifies as pain
So transfixed by the wavering flame
Mortal kings of each grade and grain erased
Oh, I'm blessed

The slant may rain, knows my door
Tambourines my floor in four
Laughs and shakes my folded face where Jesus mowed my lawn

Fame has legs, blazing chrome
Amputate but it's never quite gone
Rakes in clover shown like snakes shine over rate my crime

Why kill a man when you can drive him crazy?
Why make it end when my amusement always depends on the joke?
Won't you lend me my punchline

As a favor, can you be entertained so that day I can savor whatever remains
Of hurricanes too rattled to romance massive plates of circumstances

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
New chapter, move on, look back for what?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ain't afraid to die, I done done it already
All that money on your mind I done spun it already
I was hustlin' already, I was fuckin' already, yeah
Pussy, money, weed was the subject already
See I'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it
For my woes, for my city, for my hoes, for my critics
See its TTG, trained to go, time to grind, no more CMB
Excuse my French, but you know where you can mwah, yeah
Excuse my Spanish, but its no más
I been working hard for no prize
But I'm still grateful though I show pride
And you don't see Stunna right next to me
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me
They can't put no more Weezy Baby out
That's that Cash Money vasectomy
I still got love for my enemy
Cause I know its tough to be interesting
I know its tough to be anything, but be grateful

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Ain't afraid to die, I done it already, yeah
TTG, trained to go, time to get it, yeah

Fuck later, I want mine now
Fuck later, you done fucked up now, see you later
You fucked up now, oh baby

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You are witnessing, the bomeback
Yeah, put your money where your fucking mouth at, yeah
I pull up on em bumping Keith Sweat
Them niggas never see me sweat
And tell the press I'm not depressed, I just had to press reset
I just had to get me set, and I'm not playin' skip recess
I'm a different Weezy, and I'm drippin' Fiji
In a Lamborghini with the seats wet
Hardest lesson is regret
Snorting powder on the P jet
Ask the pilot are we there yet
He said we on the ground, and we ain't leave yet
Had to step back and take a deep breath
It's hard as heck to show 'em respect
I love 'em to death but they ain't dead yet
Don't know how long I'm able to repeat that
Me I'm just tryin' to see the bread stretch
These niggas tryna see dread stress
Me, I'm just tryin' to see the dead rest
And I can't rest if I ain't pray yet

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Father forgive them for their wrongdoings
For they do not know what they are doing, Amen

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Ain't afraid to die, I done it already, yeah
TTG, trained to go, time to get it
Bitch I ain't afraid to die, I done done it already
TTG, trained to go, time to get it
You don't see Stunna right next to me
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me
You don't see Stunna right next to me
And I won't see Stunna write checks to me
And I still got love for my enemy
Cause I know its tough to be interesting
Cause I know its tough to be anything, but be grateful

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Can't lie we blessed, safe deposit box where I hide the check
Wear a hockey jersey just to hide the vest
I talked to God he deny the stress
I make women cry when they next to me
They say they blessed to be next to me
Give my kids my heart, put my mind in my music
And I let them hoes get the rest of me
Can't let this cold world get the best of me
Got the recipe for my destiny
Yeah I want them mills like Stephanie
Want the blue face hundreds preferably
This is the bounce back this is God's work
This is hard work, this is our work
This is all night graveyard work
Man this beat is godly
So I'm takin' off like a screechin' Harley
Watch the women wave cause I'm freakin' gnarly
Percs and purp got me sleepin' calmly
So I wake up and I chase the check
'Cause we ain't promised life, but we promised death
But we gon win, and I promise that
Young Money Records, you should honor that
And my vicious city got respect for me
Got killas to get at yo neck for me
You get the best of me, until the death of me
And the second me gon be the better me
Be grateful

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Ain't afraid to die, I done it already
All that money on your mind I done done it already
I was hustlin' already, I was fuckin' already
Pussy money weed was the subject already
See I'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it

I'm sure sorry about your son
I heard he was a lot of fun
And I'm sorry 'bout the way
That he ran away

You can let it go
You can let it go

Now won't you listen, honey, while I say
How could you tell me that you're gone away?
Don't say that we must part
Don't break my aching heart

You know I loved you truly many years
I loved you night and day
How could you tell to me, honey
Can't you see my tears?
Now listen while I say

After you've gone
And left me crying
After you've gone
There's no denying
You'll feel blue
You'll feel sad
You'll miss the bestest pal you've ever had
There'll come a time
Now don't forget it
There'll come a time
When you'll regret it
Someday when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine
And you'll want me only
After you've gone
After you've gone away
After you've gone
After the break up
After you've gone
You are gonna wake up
And you will find
That you were blind
To let somebody come and change your mind

After the years that we've been together
The joy and all the tears
And all types of weather
Someday, when you're down-hearted
You'll long to be right back where we started
After you've gone
After you've gone away

Oh, baby, think what you're doing
You know my love for you will drive me to ruin
After you've gone
After you've gone away

[Intro: Notorious B.I.G]
Yo
We up in the basement, you know what I'm saying?
DJ Enuff, my man Fresco
This is just me, the Notorious Biggie Smalls in full effect

[Verse: Notorious B.I.G]
Introducing the black bastard from Bedrock
Guaranteed to make heads rock, tote Glocks
Drop cops that mistake me for Rodney
Strictly head shots, I knock the twist out your dreadlocks
Who got the props? Biggie Who got the Glock? Biggie But who is he?
You can't get my description, you need a prescription
Two doses of the ferocious
Feel the weight when I'm crushing 'em, bumrushing 'em
Stuffing 'em, I put the pressure on em, hon
Lord a mercy, Jesus Christ, He's just nice, he just slice like a Ginsu
It's me, the Notorious B.I.G-G.I.E Smalls, yo!
This is for chumps that don't know who I am
I had a song on the soundtrack "Who's The Man?"
The single was dope, but the movie didn't slam
Emcees is like JJ's moms, "Damn, damn damn!"
Is it because I rip the props or beat the cops?
I got more dough than a pizza shop
Biggie Smalls is the illest
Your style is played out like Arnold and that "whatchu talkin 'bout Willis?"
7 Mac Elevens, 8 .38s nine 9s, ten MAC 10s, the guns never end!
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the Lambsbread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K!

[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Mmm, easy, back up, back up, back up, back up, uh
Turn your radio, turn your radio, off
Watch me now, baby (Baby)
Uh-uh, uh-uh

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Bitches in my ear, they sayin' they love me
Uh, you don't love Scott, you love the Kid Cudi
I ain't no fuckin' slouch, show you what I'm 'bout
My energy is a bit too precious, too drenched in them blessings
Transitionin' to my inner, I'm hearin' their voice
Tellin' me stay in focus, keep focusin', boy
Feelin' like a trilli billi
The man everywhere I go, in any city
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls galore
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls adore
Mixin' fluorescent to the core of the accoutrement
Off the tippy titty, settin' off my groupie radar
Sippin' Hen', dappin' hands off the roof of my Porsche
A fresh nigga at large, a fresh nigga go hard
All my youngins say, "Keep it goin'"
All my youngins, they dumb and reppin', they always knowin'

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Got some pride in your town, I'm spottin' 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm lookin' so cute
Sexy mama, send her way, you doin' it, honey
Them hatin' fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this, my nigga, you be here (Be here)
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here (Ain't here)
Big boss, I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)
Can't stop me, can't carry me, baby

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Kid Cudi]
Life ain't easy sober, we live so geeky (Yeah)
Did just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama (Yeah)
Phoned home to the moon, did you change your number?
If and when you get this message, need you back home
Big bro, big bro, big bro (Yeah), big bro, back home
Big bro, we need you, come home, back home
Big bro, big bro, shit's fucked, come home (Mmm)

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott & Kid Cudi]
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Nightmares kept a nigga from closin' his lids (Lids)
Since a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip
Think they gone, nah, they just dormant, the hauntings ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are comin' for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage, turn the page, relaxin', I'm whippin'
Last week, I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefin' good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?
Nah, nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call
My nieces know Uncle Scottie's so rock and roll
My princess Vada know rock and roll, Daddy got the glow

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi & Travis Scott]
Got some pride in your town, I'm spottin' 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm lookin' so cute (Yeah)
Sexy mama, send her way, you doin' it, honey
Them hatin' fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this, my nigga, you be here (Be here)
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here (Ain't here)
Big boss, I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)
Can't stop me, can't carry me, baby

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Kid Cudi]
Life ain't easy sober, we live so geeky (Yeah)
Did just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama
Phoned home to the moon, did you change your number?
If and when you get this message, need you back home
Big bro, big bro, big bro (Yeah), big bro, back home
Big bro, we need you, come home, back home
Big bro, big bro, shit's fucked, come home (Mmm)

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher

[Craig Mack]
Flip funk in the UK
Pass the ill fill
And I can feel all the Flava
Kicking from the UA- US neighbour
Kick all the Flava
Do the Mack do, what you wanna do, you savour
This step is called the BRU to the T
Bust the rhymes for free, I gets down
Mack is inside your town
Busting lyrics tourture like the missiles slow you down
Sup with B.I.G? Pass the microphone to you so I can take a puff

[The Notorious B.I.G]
Who throw gats to Guiliani?
Flows tighter than pigeon punani, try me, die G
Dangerous, since my daddy bust me out the tip of his dick
Biggie Smalls with the Wickedest shit
Spit clips, niggas split like bananas
Flavour like Tropicana; orange, mango, peach
I strangle each
Negro for they dough
Niggas get to bendin', got two cases, one pending
560 V-12 engine, niggas swimmin'
In 929 Mazdas, Tammy and Natasha
The menage-a-trois is at my crib
Like Ill and Al Skratch smokin' 50 sacks in the back of Ac's
Windows cracked, so sit back relax
Craig, crush the hash, the Beretta's in the stash

[Craig Mack]
Well, BANG! let's kick it off like a butt
More fakes than Allen front to leave you lost like a treasure hunt
From now on, y'all crossed the land
Craig Mack's the upper hand with more rhymes than the beach got sand
You're an MC, yo my original job is that mistaken raps'll guarantee you look like a slob
I got more rhymes than kids got the measles
You shooting needles, we are bigger than The Beatles
I crush , hush with the Super Sunday rush
We're trotting to the cot cause your style turns back to mush
I flip out the funk off the frame
Now you know my name- Mackalicious, ain't you got a king?
Before 10:00 Westwood, I'm no good
Shaking from here to back to Breckwood
On One FM rap show, the illest flow that you ever heard on your radio
Biggie Smalls, my motherfucking man, take the microphone and kick the wicked like a man

[The Notorious B.I.G]
I went from construction Timbs to Acs with rims
Flipping mixtapes to bitches feeding me grapes
Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna KILL FOUR PEOPLE!
Forget the dames, gimme the range and the wain
My niggas up the pawn drop top jag walls
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's the superstar status apparatus, more wings than clutches
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Lick off the wine as my seats recline
I want a presidential Rollie
So I crush MC's, the guacamole making Robin scream "Holy Molly!"
Big Poppa, off the caper, I'm that paper crusader
Playing Sega in a widebody blazer
And if you don't know now you know
My flow you pick like an afro
Wet like Soul Glo
...Uh, you don't stop...

[Notorious B.I.G]
Big Poppa, throwing niggas off of cliffs, smoking spliffs
Disappear with my bitch in a Mitsubishi Eclipse
Read my lips, I kill you, blood will spill too
Did I say thank you? I grant you
Three wishes cause I be the genie
Niggas is ass out like fat  bitches in bikinis
Read between the lines, see what I see?
I see the diary of a sick bastard
Junior M.A.F.I.A blaster
Rugers on the hips, bought coke to fill chips
More burners to fill clips, check it...
Putting coke in corner store bodegas
In the back room playing Sega Streetfighter 2
I'm inviting you, get your writing crew and their dopest rhymes
I'll get up in that ass every time
Lyrically I'm untouchable, uncrushable
Getting mad blunted in a 600 Benz
Ask your friends who's the illest
Licking shots niggas screaming Biggie Smalls tried to kill us

[Craig Mack]
I get ill...
It's time for a funk refill of rhymes that I kill as I shoot 'em in the grill
MC's, I'm not impressed
Your best don't just throw your chest
Where's the bullet proof or the wool vest, won't matter
Your chest will shatter
On the tip of my dick baby you are the badder
MC's now feel funktified
They tried but now they died

[The Notorious B.I.G]
Biggie bring big bowls of beef
Backing bitch niggas down burners bring bundles of belief
Common thief slash drug chief, syndicated
Went from 10k to 24k, competition hated, J.M. sedated
Quarantine
Big for president, busting shots past your spleen
9 millimeter dreams, Mac 11 nightmares
Which MC's do you fear? Big Poppa, Junior M.A.F.I.A, nuff said
Niggas disrespect just I dead

[Craig Mack]
Just I dead
MC's will turn red from the shot I lick, Ceaser sick
Too much shagging, too much drinking, too much thinking
MC's are blinking the third eye when I pass by
Mackalicious got the sweet potato fried for you motherfucker, I... touch the microphone
I do or die, make the hardest motherfucker cry when a MC pass by
I flip rhymes off the top of my head just like Raid I spray MC's until they dead
A vocal volcanic microphone, robotic tonic atonic
The microphone is mine so MC's panic
I get down for my ground
You could see I met James Brown in your town
Flipping funk on a Friday on my malware
In the highway, takes MC's by the driveway, driveway
Slow ill flow, so you know, head to toe
Ill bend flows when I go...
From flow to top ten... to dough...
Flow ill flow, Badboy down said so
So Biggie Smalls my man, take command
Turn each MC you see into sand

(Change of beat)

[Craig Mack]
I stretch the funk like my name was Plastic Man
Eating MC's out the can in my hip-hop wonderland
I got the venom like the snake's got the venom, I put it in 'em
Faces turn bluer than my denim
But don't look down though my name is David Banner
Flipping green on the mic cause they can't control my gamma
So stop hogging us, Mack's the erogenous
So rap full grown, see us the acrogynous
There ain't a rapper liver than the rebel
My voice don't carry treble, eat MC's like a vegetable
Crack a few stepping on the pedal
Heavy off the medal, life's stronger waiting for the sun to settle
King MC, for that I thank the LORD
Ill vocal chords sometimes you get the style bored
As we break it down, Biggie Smalls represent Brooklyn your hometown

(Change of Beat)

[The Notorious B.I.G]
Niggas in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benzito
Hitting fannies, spending chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you in your Polo sheets
6 up in your wig-piece, nigga decease
Mxwaah! May you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
.44 and 54 draws
As my pilot, steers my Lear- yes, my dear
Shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous you're just a little vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all
Death controls y'all, Big don't fold y'all
I spit phrases that'll thrill you
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

(Change of beat)

[The Notorious B.I.G]
Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns
As I crush so-called willies, thugs, and rapper-dons
Get in that ass, quick fast, like Ramadan
It's that rap phenomenon Don Dada
Fuck Poppa, you got to call me Francis M.H. White
Intake light tokes, tote iron
Was told in shootouts, stay low, keep firing
Keep extra clips for extra shit
Who's next to flip on that cat with that grip on rap
The most shady, Frankie baby
Ain't no telling where I may be
May see me in D.C. at Howard Homecoming
With my man Capone, dumbing, fucking something
You should know my steelo
Went from 10 G's for blow to 30 G's a show
To orgies with hoes I never seen before
So, Jesus, get off the Notorious'
Penis before I squeeze and bust
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
Make it hot like a kettle get
You're delicate, you better get - who sent ya?
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than Great Adventure

[Verse 1]
Callin' out in a war
You gotta play with 'em all
I caught a couple of hoe
Now I done rockin' 'em all
Time to just play with the ho
Now I'm done playin' a ho
Said we're done like woah
They're dancing for you woah
Got a couple of 

[?] stacked woah

I got couple of Benzes and you
Tell 'em a friend, like they know
I got a couple nances in ah-oh

[Hook]
Oh, I just want to know if you got it
Every time someone's shy, 

[?] it's not the best time
I just want to know if you here
And every time I'm with you, girl I wanna kiss you
Have a feelin' in me like that
And I just wanna roll round, never wanna go down, wanna go down
Every time we do it like slow now

[Verse 2]
I, I, just wanna get yourself a walkthrough
Tell em' what I'm into, and I want you
I just want that feeling like a horseshoe

[?] like a horseshoe
No, no, no, no I want you
Ohh then I'm gonna feed you
Poo Bear in a corner, yeah he's sleepin'
I said who are you leading
Yeah, you lil wetting like you bleedin'
I just think they wanna schemin'
Every time you don't wanna hold down
Beverly Hills, you wanna go down
Never wanna leave you
Oohh, never gonna leave you

[Hook]
Oh, I just want to know if you got it
Every time someone's shy, 

[?] it's not the best time
I just want to know if you here
And every time I'm with you, girl I wanna kiss you
Have a feelin' in me like that
And I just wanna roll round, never wanna go down, wanna go down
Every time we do it like slow now

[Outro]
I have a wrong feeling for a low down

[?] feelin' like oh now
Oh now, I don't mind
I need you
Oh now, I don't mind
I need you
Oh now, I don't mind
I need you

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga & Florence Welch]
Hey girl, can you hear me?
Are you holding out your heart?
Hey girl, do you feel me?
Sometimes I go too far
Hey girl, it ain't easy
I know it's pulling me apart
But darlin', don't you leave me
Baby, don't you leave me

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Florence Welch]
Hey girl, hey girl
We can make it easy if we lift each other
Hey girl, hey girl
We don't need to keep on one-in' up another
Hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl
If you lose your way
Just know that I got you
Just know that I got you

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga & Florence Welch]
Lady is it lonely?
I been callin' out your name
Tell me that you need me
'Cause I need you just the same
Everyday a heartache
I'm just tryin' to keep it sane
But I know you believe me
Baby don't you leave me

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Florence Welch]
Hey girl, hey girl
We can make it easy if we lift each other
Hey girl, hey girl
We don't need to keep on one-in' up another
Hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl
If you lose your way
Just know that I got you

[Bridge: Lady Gaga, Florence Welch & Both]
Help me hold my hair back
Walk me home 'cause I can't find a cab
And we dance down The Bowery
Held hands like we were 17 again
And then it's 4am
The sun is creepin' up again
Don't you leave me
Oh, darling don't you leave me

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Florence Welch]
Hey girl, hey girl
We can make it easy if we lift each other
Hey girl, hey girl
We don't need to keep on one-in' up another
Hey girl, hey girl
Hey girl, hey girl
If you lose your way
Just know that I got you

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Just know that
Just know that I got you
Just know that
Just know that
Just know that
Help me hold my hair back
Walk me home 'cause I can't find a cab
And we dance down The Bowery
Held hands like we were 17 again

[Verse]
Why wait to say, at least I did it my way
Lie awake, two faced
But in my heart I understand
I made my move and it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed

[Chorus]
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way

[Post-Chorus]
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, my way, my way

[Verse]
Why wait to say, at least I did it my way
Lie awake, two faced
But in my heart I understand
I made my move and it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed

[Chorus]
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way

[Post-Chorus]
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, my way, my way

[Chorus]
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way

[Post-Chorus]
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way
My way, oh way, oh way, oh way

[Intro: Usher]
I fucked up
I'm man enough to admit it
(I had it coming)
But I don't know if that makes a difference
(In time I'll show you)
And I know better
If you just give me a chance to explain
(That counts for something, need you)
I was just... I'm insecure...
I need you

[Verse 1: Usher]
How you make it feel
Way you make me feel
Said, feels so good
I like it, I like it, baby
Girl, what you doing to me
Girl, what you do to me
Don't give 'em my love
You ain't even like that
What kind of point you tryna prove?
And you hate to admit it
But you still take me back
All that shit you was talking
It don't hold no weight 'cause

[Chorus: Usher]
You always say I'm stuck in my ways (I had it coming)
You always say that I'll never change (in time, I'll show you)
I ain't always wrong, I take the blame (that counts for something)
Man up and say, I own my mistakes
(It's gotta count for something)
Girl, I need you now
Ah baby, I need you, ah baby, I need you
Help me out
Don't let me down

[Verse 2: Usher]
Girl, what I do to you
Girl, what I do to you
Do to make it this cold
Trying to get me where it hit home
You ain't even like that, I know
You ain't mean it, I know, yeah
New friends, you got new friends
They already know who he’s hitting
Better answer when a real one calling
You know who it is when you see me calling, huh
Yeah, I know I was wrong, but you knew better
Give you up, I would never

[Chorus: Usher]
You always say I'm stuck in my ways (I had it coming)
You always say that I'll never change (in time, I'll show you)
I ain't always wrong, I take the blame (that counts for something)
Yet I, man up and say, I own my mistakes
(It's gotta count for something)
Girl, I need you now
Ah baby, I need you, oh hold me down
Oh help me out

[Bridge: Usher]
Haven't always done you right and I know it, hah
I hope it ain't too late for me to show it
(Don't say goodbye)
Forgive me for what I put you through
Let me love you better
All this time (you, were, right)
You were right

[Chorus: Usher]
You always say I'm stuck in my ways (I had it coming)
You always say that I'll never change (in time, I'll show you)
I ain't always wrong, I take the blame (that counts for something)
I'll man up and say, I own my mistakes
(It's gotta count for something)
Girl, I need you now
Ah baby, I need you, ah baby, I need you
Help me out
Don't let me down

[Outro: Priyanka Chopra]
Everybody wants somebody that's got confidence
He should make me feel safe, make me laugh
Everything about him should feel sexy
His walk, his talk
He's gotta be effortless, you know?
Not trying too hard
What do you want in someone?

[Intro]
What's so complicated?
Everything's so simple when you say it
Ain't no one said the shit was easy
Know I said I'd take you out in the city
But, damn, forgive me, forgive me, forgive me
Now, fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me

[Bridge]
I'ma be real with you now, I don't know why I called her
When you called me, I was wrong, so that's why I bought ya
A couple things for your wrist that's shining in the dark
So I was hoping you'd forgive me and that's why I bought it (yeah)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
(Yeah, can't you see that I'm trying?)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me

[Chorus]
Baby I can change, can you stick around? (yeah)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
It's easy when I'm up, can you hold me down?

[Verse]
Tell me what nigga is perfect?
Tell me what nigga is right?
Tell me what nigga been with the same bitch
And she been holding it down for life
Tell me who get it right on the first try?
I know I did wrong, but what nigga is trying harder
Than the one in this song?
Can you stay down? Oh babe
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
Boo don't give up on me now
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me

[Chorus]
Baby I can change, can you stick around? (yeah)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
It's easy when I'm up, can you hold me down?
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
Baby I can change, can you stick around? (yeah)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
It's easy when I'm up, can you hold me down?
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me

[Bridge]
I ain't perfect, but smile, I'll give you amazing, worth it
A good man you deserve it
Bear with me I promise I'm working (on it)
No, I ain't changing overnight
Didn't you see me change your life?
I can admit that a lot, can we put this shit aside
You know it ain't bad all the time
Baby you see me trying
Fuck with me

[Chorus]
Baby I can change, can you stick around? (yeah)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
It's easy when I'm up, can you hold me down?
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
Baby I can change, can you stick around? (yeah)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
It's easy when I'm up, can you hold me down?
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me

[Intro]
Got a crush on a new toy
And boy its never safe
Making all of the bad choices
But its a brighter day

[Pre-Hook]
I know that I'm hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
Hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
I know that I'm hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust
Hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust

[Hook]
It's like you gambling, falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose
It's like you gambling, falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose, you gon' lose, you gon' lose
Gambling, falling for me, I'll kill you, you gon' lose it all

[Verse]
I'll send you back and forth, you'll never know you try your luck
They call me Las Vegas, you get what you pay for
Girl, I'm not your lucky card, I'ma make you take a loss
But I am worth it, love's what we wage for

[Pre-Hook]
I know that I'm, hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
Hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
And I know that I'm, hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust
Hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust

[Hook]
It's like you gambling, falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose
It's like you gambling, falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose, you gon' lose, you might lose
Gambling, falling for me, it might kill you, yeah you could lose it all

[Bridge]
I'ma make it free fall baby, fall into infinity
I'ma make it go real crazy, shit ain't ever like it seems
I'm your adrenaline, I'm your problem
I'm your amphetamine, you kiss all of me

[Hook]
It's like you gambling, falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose
Like you gambling, falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose, you gon' lose, you gon' lose
Gambling, falling for me, it could kill you, but you could win it all

[Intro]
Been through hell, now I'm hell proof
Pouring cups of whiskey to get through it
Oh sweet child of mine, gone way too soon
Lost myself and lost my faith too

[Chorus]
I've had my share of ups and downs
I've had my share of down and outs
Baptized in a river and almost drowned
That's when I figured out
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now
Stronger than ever now
Ohh

[Verse]
Walk through fire now I'm fireproof
Forever wear these scars like tattoos
Finally found paradise right in my view
And its killing me that I can't share it with you

[Chorus]
I've had my share of ups and downs
I've had my share of down and outs
Baptized in a river and almost drowned
That's when I figured out
I'm stronger than ever now, stronger than ever now
I'm stronger than ever now, I'm stronger than ever now
(Stronger than ever now)

[Verse]
Though you're gone you still live in my mind
The only thing we ran out of is time
Since you left I ain't been quite the same
I wonder if you miss me, do I make you proud
Know you're watching me, I feel your spirit
I keep you right by my side
I'm stronger than ever now, far from perfect
Life will knock you down, get back up
Fight for whats worth it
Be strong enough, I know its easier said than done

[Bridge]
Stronger than ever now
I been through it, now stronger
Stronger now, hey stronger now
All that I been through some how I found my way out
Long as I believe in me, I know I can make it
I know you'll make it, cause you're stronger
Stronger than ever now
Stronger
Real men walk
On the outside
On the outside
On the outside
And they take it for the team
The piss comes through your jeans
To the outside

Wicked boy
Wicked boy
Wicked boy

Real men hide
On the outside
On the outside
On the outside
And you think you wanna die
But I watch you close your eyes
Oh, it's alright

Wicked boy
Wicked boy
Wicked boy
Wicked boy
Bobby drives all alone to the park by the Creek
And he meets up with Jan
Passed the bill
Shakes her hand
Jan got home after ten, woke her dad, went to bed
Woke up cold
In the night
From a voice
In her head

Who are you?
I guess it's what we do
To be new
What a scheme
I guess that's what she means
In your dreams

Bobby wakes up at noon, locks himself in his room
Used a belt
On his back
Hit it hard
Made it crack
He got high later on, picks up Jan, drives her home
She don't talk
But she knows
Why the boy's
Fever grows
Who are you?
I guess that's what we do
To be new
What a scheme
I guess that's what she means
In your dreams
Made my promise and I'm keepin' it for kicks
I really didn't think that it would stain like this
I really didn't think that it would stain like this

Took my medicine, then spit it on the ground
The fingers down my throat, they make a gurgle sound
The slimy little pill is keeping you around

Wish I could come back down

Something creepy buried right below the skin
Yeah, you said you'd cut it out if I won't let you in

She said she was sorry, but I didn't really care
I didn't get it right but I was almost there

Wish I could come back down

Wish I could touch the ground

[Intro]
I just wanna
I just wanna take my time, my time, my time with you
Oooh, oooh

[Verse 1]
We're here alone while the thunder is roaring
And the windows are blowing
'Cause it's storming and pouring tonight
I put my hand on your chest
I can feel your heart
And it's beating kinda fast, so is mine
In this moment of silence, you look me in the eyes
Nothing is verbalized, but so much is said
I need you so much
The more I'm away from you, the more of you I want
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
(I need you)

[Bridge]
I want to hold you till I can't feel again
Until your soul lets me in

[Chorus]
Tell me that you wanna make love
Tell me that you wanna really make love
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah
Baby, I'm a man that believes in what it is

[Verse 2]
We're going to a whole 'nother level
When we do it, it's so true
And it's so much more than sexual tonight
When we're connected, every touch, every kiss is perfected
It's like when we finally found what we been looking for
It gets better and better with time
This is deeper than love
The more of you I have, the more of you I want
Oooh, oooh
(Oh, I need you, baby)
Oooh, oooh
(Woah)

[Bridge]
I want to hold you till I can't feel again
Until your soul lets me in

[Chorus]
Tell me that you wanna make love
Tell me that you wanna really make love
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah
Baby, I'm a man that believes in what it is

[Post-Chorus]
Oooh, oooh
Hey, hey
Oh baby, can we go deeper?
Deeper than the surface
Further than that

[Bridge]
I want to hold you till I can't feel again
Until your soul lets me in

[Chorus]
Tell me that you wanna make love
Tell me that you wanna really make love
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah

[Verse 3]
Woman and man, fight so hard
But when the two become one, we work out problems
And we fix I, whenever we get body to body
Body to body, body to body
(Ohhh, heeee, ohhhh, heeee)
(I want you)
When you so wet and I'm so hard
And when the two become one, it's like, oh my God
And then we feeling like our spirits want to leave our body
Leave our body, leave our body
(Ohhh, heeee, ohhhh, heeee)
(I want you)

[Bridge]
Until your soul lets me in
I want to

[Verse 4]
Woman and man, fight so hard

When you so wet and I'm so hard
And when the two become one, it's like, oh my God
And then we feeling like our spirits want to leave our body

[Outro]
Until your soul lets me in
(Uh, still here)
Oooh, ooh

Say you'll never leave me, say you'll never go
I love you so much

[Verse]
That night I said I was recording late
I wasn't recording late
I was just smoking, chilling, had a couple drinks
Not much of anything
And that time I flew down to the MIA
Then I went MIA
I hit up KOD with a few bands to play (hold up)
And that ain't everything
All I think about is bitches, umm
And everywhere I go they come
Double standards let everybody talk 'bout it (shit)
The tables turned around, I be throwing up six
So I ain't trying to justify
All I do
So tired of lying
All I do
All I do

[Intro]
(Love ya, love ya, love ya)
Let me, let me, hah
(Let me love ya)

[Verse 1]
It only happen once in a lifetime
I'ma meet somebody that's perfect or true, baby
You got me and I got you, baby
Tell your ex it's mine and I won't lose if you choosing, baby
Baby, you know that you're more than just a friend to me
Don't let nobody convince you that we enemies
I was down for the count, I was down we was out
And I stole that, how it would've led to me
You's my little secret
They don't know you freaky, with a chick like you I'm conceited
And when my mama fuck with you and my brother fuck with you
Need the baby in the crib where we completed
You got money, I got money, no competing
F gang but we always on some G shit
I'm on some OJ with the pussy, I'ma beat it
Beep-beep-beep-beep, BJ and repeat it
All the above is the truth
Trust in me like I trust in you
Fuck with me like I fuck with you
How am I real if I ain't real with you?
Let me love ya

[Chorus]
Let me love ya, let me love ya
Let me be the one to, let me be the one to love you
Let me love ya (wanna love you babe)
Love you babe
Hear what I'm saying, ooh ooh

(Let me love you) love you, ouu, ouu, ouuuu (let me love you)

[Verse 2]
You the realest bitch out here, we all admit that you the shit
New BMW, new tint so dark the cops gotta squint
So you driving out the city to make money that I'll never let you spend
See that's something broke niggas just will never comprehend
We hit the strip together and we tip together
Hit the lick together, oh
Hit the crib together, book the Ritz together
This is it forever, oh
Hit the jewelry, 3,000 dollar outfit
'Cause I gotta flex for my baby
We just swerved on these hoes
It's adjourned on these hoes, I wanna know

[Chorus]
(When you gon' let me babe? You gotta trust me baby)
Let me love ya, let me love ya
Let me be the one to, let me be the one to love you
Let me love ya (baby believe it)
(Wanna love you babe)
(You better know, girl I ain't taking no, I, I really love you)
Love you, ouu, ouu, ouuuu (let me love you)

Love you, ouu, ouu, ouuuu (let me love you)
(Let me love you) love you, ouu, ouu, ouuuu (let me love you)
(Who gon' treat you the best?)
(Let me love you) love you, ouu, ouu, ouuuu (let me love you)
(Let me love you down...)

[Outro]
Ready, told you I was ready
(Let me love you)
Said that I was ready for you
Ready, I'ma show you, ahhhh
(Ahhh, it never really mattered too much to me)

[Verse 1]
Everything you do is everything I know
No need to pretend, we both know what you want
Say you gotta good thing, he don't have to know
Everything you and I do, only I know it
We could make this easy
I know you don't need me, this ain't that kind of thing
It's more of a fling
That's why when you leave

[Chorus]
I don’t want no one coming through
Don't act like it's part of you
What I do in my downtime
Is what I do in my downtime
We connect, we wanna feel
That shit don't have no meaning
But what you do in your downtime
Is what you do in your downtime
That's everything I know
Girl that's everything I know
Yeah, yeah, that's everything I know
That's the only thing I know

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Left the country just to spend the weekend here to fuck me
What is not the only thing that's coming
All your friends are calling you
Like "OMG your such and such is lucky"
It's touching my soul
But little does anyone know, yeah
I've been working, I ain't perfect
I don't need you to tell me "it's yours"
You know what it is I adore
And something about it that inspires me to hit it more
You told me you coming, well shit I'll just buzz you in
Keys are still under the mat by the door
Ignore the mess
My crib ain't the cleanest from company I had the evening before, yeah

[Chorus]
I ain't the only one coming through
Don't act like it's part of you
What I do in my downtime
Is what I do in my downtime
We connect, we wanna feel
That shit don't have no meaning
But what you do in your downtime
Is what you do in your downtime
That's everything I know
Girl that's everything I know
Yeah, yeah, that's everything I know
That's the only thing I know

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Telling you should be all in, all in it, babe

[Outro]
This your shit, believe it

[Verse 1]
My corner, you'll find me every day
The boys come out
That's where we like to play
"Wanna tag along?" I said "No way."
One drop dead high
A price you're gonna pay

[Chorus]
Been around the world, been around the world
I stormed the gates inlaid in pearl
(Been around the world, been around the world
Been around the world, been around the world)
All around the world all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
(Been around the world, been around the world)

[Verse 2]
Keep dancing, like it's ya last time
With softened eyes, swimming in delight
When the curtain falls, I'm on your scene
What sweet surprise sashay to me

[Chorus]
Been around the world, been around the world
I stormed the gates inlaid in pearl
(Been around the world, been around the world
Been around the world, been around the world)
All around the world all around the world

(Been around the world, been around the world
Been around the world, been around the world)

Take it all the way, take it all the way

Been around the world, been around the world)
All around the world, all around the world

[Intro]
To the left, to the left, everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff, yes, I bought it
Please don't touch

[Verse One]
Keep talking and yes, that's fine
Could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on the tag
Come in with your bags, let me call you a cab

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard, telling me how I'm such a fool
How I'm never gonna find a man like you, got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you, ever for a second, get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Verse Two]
So, go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What'd you think I was putting you out for?
'Cause you were untrue, hauling her around in the truck that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys, hurry up before your taxi leaves

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard, telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking about, how I'm never gonna find a man like you
Got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you, ever for a second, get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Verse One]
Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head, you feel left out or looked down on
Just try your best, try everything you can
Don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away

[Chorus]
It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright

[Verse Two]
Hey, you know they're all the same
You know you're doing better on your own
So don't buy in love right now
Just be yourself, it doesn't matter if it's good enough for someone else

[Chorus]
It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright(x2)

[Verse Three]
Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head, you feel left out or looked down on
Just do your best, do everything you can
Don't you worry what their bitter hearts are gonna say

[Chorus]
It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright

[Verse]
It was a war between the exes
Now it's a war between the sexes
Before I start getting sentimental
I'm gonna have to say my vexes
I wanna shoot you in the fucking face
Get all this shit up out of my place
But I've gotta keep the furniture
Because I want to make it my space
I hope you know you give me nightmares
I see your face in the dark
I hear you whisper in my ear
You know that this is unfair
I'm gonna get you back, boy
I hope you hear this message clear
Don't call me on the telephone
Don't you dare leave a fucking message when you hear the (tone)
And if you do I'll go psycho
But I know you kinda like that

Kid Cudi, don't ever mention Ye name! I birthed you. We out here dealing with that emo shit all the time. Me, Pat, Don C, don't never mention Ye name! Don't try to say who I can do songs with. You mad 'cos I'm doing songs with Drake. Ain't nobody telling Ye who to do songs with. Respect the god! Run it back Mike.

[continued]

Me and your parents is cool. You know how many people wish they could be signed to G.O.O.D. Music, get their life changed? Had that opportunity? Never... forget that. I'm so hurt. I feel so disrespected.

Kid Cudi, we two black men in a racist world. I wore skinny jeans first. I got called names before you bruh. Why y'all gotta be coming at me? This ain't the end of the "Malcolm X" movie!

I'm out here fighting for y'all! Creatives. Artists. Independent thinkers.

Don't never mention my name! In a bad manner!

None of y'all!
I need yall to know I got so many haters within the industry and these clowns know Im bout to crush their entire existance. Everyone thinks they're soooo great. Talkin top 5 and be having 30 people write songs for them. Let me tell you something. The days of the fuckery are over. The fake ones wont be lasting too much longer.

Im the one they worry about cause they know I dont give a fuck about the corny shit they do. All my youngins out here reppin, Asap Rocky and the whole ASAP family, Travis Scott, SuperDuper Kyle, Audio Push, Hit Boy, etc, I see yall. And all u jealous chicken hearted shits I see you too.

I am the culture.

I keep silent because I dont ever wanna come off like some angry hater, but today, not only do I feel fantastic, Im feelin like taking over. I already have.

My tweets apply to who they apply. Ye, Drake, whoever. These niggas dont give a fuck about me. And they aint fuckin with me. Niggas keep you close when they see how powerful you are by yourself. When they see your greatness. Out of fear

Ive been loyal to those who haven't been to me and that ends now. Now im your threat.

Anybody got a issue with my words im glad. If you feel me, dont be scared to use your voice. I was for so long out of blind loyalty.

From here Ill let the music speak. As you were, peace and love to my supporters and true ones.  🤘🏾🌹❤️

Cudder Out

Okay, your legs just like a store: they open up and you got people in line
Been there every night for weeks at a time
You in my dreams, that's why I sleep all the time
Just to hear you say I love you, just to touch you, just to leave you behind
I told you, you don't have to worry, you'll be fine
This type of thing, I heard it happen all the time
Yeah, I just wanna see you fly
Because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high
Said nothin' better than the first time
I'll be at your service like the check-in at curbside
You don't have to spend another second on this Earth dry
Wet you like a fresh beau coop, go a second and a third time
Left you a perverse mind
And when you hungry, I can chef you up a stir fry
Get you some dessert wine, elevate ya third eye
First prize, Nobel, get a piece
Your clothes off, turn around, lemme see

Okay, I came up with a plan, it was
Take you by the hand and bring you somewhere where the sand is
Soon as we landed, we went straight into the room and played the music
Started dancin', you was takin' off your pants
It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore, I do you like a chore
We started on the bed and then we movin' to the floor
You started gettin' crazy, told me fuck you like a whore
I thought you was an angel, now you yellin' to the Lord
You used to tell me all the time I ain't ya type
Now you always wanna spend the night
Now I'm doin' everything you like
When I'm inside your pussy, damn, it feels so right (Yeah)
But I still respect ya game
Every time I'm out-of-line, you always set me straight

[Part II: Right After Love]

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey now, I'm sayin'
My only way out is a way in
I won't stop
'Til you mine, no way
Well, all my days now, they changin'
I got an angels, no more Satan
Looks like God's on my side
This time, yeah

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
Been meanin' to tell ya
You lookin' better every day
Write you letters, it's only right that
Right after love, I write my name, yeah
If it's forever or never, it's all the same
Under the weather, feel much better
When that weather isn't rain, yeah

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Ooh, Cinderella
Don't you run out of time
It feels like you've been takin'
All day, yeah
Well, wherever you came from, wherever you goin'

Right after love, I write my name, yeah
And if it's forever or never, it's all the same
Under the weather, feel much better
When that weather isn't rain

[Verse 1]
I came down the mountain
Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number
I'm wearing you still
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me
He has a funny way sayin' forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp
For somethin' he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you

[Chorus]
Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold

[Verse 2]
Got a baby sister who looks just like me
She wants nothin' more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece
From Fulton Street
The man's got a gift for gettin' what he wants
He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink, and throws her off
I get on my knees and beg you

[Chorus]
Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold

[Bridge]
I can carry you, but not your ghosts
Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh

[Chorus]
Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Oh, hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold

[Intro]
Here we go!

[Verse 1]
I can't wait to smoke them all
Whole pack like Marlboro
Blow it in your face
Blow it in your face
Blow it in your, blow it in your face
I can't wait to rev you up
Faster than you can say "Ferrari"
Tearin' up the gravel
Watch you unravel
Now it's a party
Hey, I can't wait to cast my spell
Which one, you'll never tell
'Cause I got it covered
City gravy southern
Got you drippin' like no other

[Chorus]
Get off on me
My body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceilin'
Off on me
My body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceilin'
A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all
A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all
A-YO, A-YO
We smokin' 'em all
A-YO, A-YO

[Verse 2]
I can't wait to blaze for real
Track burns like a road rail
Spin it in your face
Spin it in your face
Play it in your, play it in your face
Can't wait to get you shook up
Faster than you can try to hate it
You can try to hate it
You can try to fake it
But baby, I laced it

[Chorus]
Get off on me
My body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceilin'
Off on me
My body's got you pleadin'
Light me up and breathe in
Mirror on the ceilin'
A-YO, A-YO
Mirror on the ceilin'
(We smokin' 'em all)
A-YO, A-YO
Mirror on the ceilin'
(We smokin' 'em all)
A-YO, A-YO

[Verse 1]
Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not
Ready for you
Every part
Of my aching heart
Needs you more
Than the angels do

[Chorus]
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?

[Verse 2]
If you could
I know that you'd stay
We both know
Things don't work that way
I promised I
Wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin
And my voice gets thin

[Chorus]
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?

[Bridge]
Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And baby, you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't
See you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar

[Chorus]
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'
Goin', girl?

[Verse 1]
Give my heart a little break
Give up the life I’ve always known
Give the sun a hiding place
Behind the ocean, we’ll see it when I’m home

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s been awhile since I’ve felt this way before
I’ll be alright, someday I’ll soon drift ashore

[Chorus]
Well I (la, la, la, la) believe (la, la, la, la) in this heart of mine (heart of mine)
But I’m (la, la, la, la) not so sure (la, la, la, la) I’ll find my way this time (way this time)
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Give my heart a little break
Get out alive somewhere on the end
Dawn it breaks to find me wide awake
Patch the night take to the sky
Yeah!

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s been awhile, well I’m back to my old self again
I’ll be alright, all the troubles I find myself in

[Chorus]
Well I (la, la, la, la) believe (la, la, la, la) in this heart of mine (heart of mine)
And I (la, la, la, la) trust that things (la, la, la, la) will turn out to be just fine (be just fine)
Ooh
I'll tell you, um... Every single one of these songs, um, is about me first. Me first, um, it was like, you know, there was a period of time where I was just out, you know, just, just gone from the public, and, uh, I came to terms with the fact that... I had created this, uh, public persona, this public illusion.

And it became, it, uh, it held me hostage; like I couldn't be a real person because you're too afraid of, you know, what your, your public will say.

And at that point I had to do some dying and really accept the fact that, look, "this is who I am, and I have to be who I am, and all of us have a right to be who we are, and whenever we submit our will, because our will is a gift, it is given to us, so whenever we submit our will to someone else's opinion, you know, I mean, a part of us dies."

You know, and so it's been, um... it's been... it actually hasn't been a long time. It feels like a long time, but it hasn't been a long time. Some miraculous things have happened in a short amount of time, and uh, I'm just very blessed to be able to be here today and get to share with you some of the things I've learned.

I know some of it sounds almost cryptic and I been really just, just really... waiting for the patience and really just articulate where I'm coming from as simply as possible, so I'm working on that.

But um... you know, I know, that you know that there's, uh... you know that I know that God doesn't lie and I know that he knows how to talk to the hearts of people better than anybody else, so I don't worry about that, cause whatever he relates to whomever is listening, that's what supposed to be understood at that time, so it's all good.

But, um, this is a song called "Oh Jerusalem".
Can I get some of that tea? Some of that tea...

I know I sound raspy, but that's, hey, I used to go on tour, you know, and I'd be a prisoner. I used to be a prisoner on tour, cause I would go on tour, and tour you're supposed to enjoy and  have a good time, but I'd be this prisoner in a hotel, you know, drinking tea and, you know, telling the children, you know, "Mommy has to sleep" cause I wanted to maintain this, you know, immaculate sounding voice, but that's not realistic.

You know, reality is, sometimes I stay up late, and this is what I sound like when I wake up the next day, and you know, it's a voice.

You know, and to me, the more I, uh, I focus less on myself the more I realize I can be used to spread a message.Cause when I'm, I used to be so, oh my God, if I sound harsh and raspy I can't go out there. And that's a lie, you know, I just sound like a singer with a lot of stuff in her throat.

So...

I told the people at MTV that they got to light me better. If not people are going to keep saying, "who's that boy on stage, who's that little boy?"

Okay, we just finishing tuning.

Okay, let's see what's up

[Verse]
See I be riding through my old hood
Same old attitude
Chillin' with yo' girlfriend
Why she always mad at you?
She be like blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
Only time that she quiet
When my fingers inside her
Don't know you know I'm a rider?
Yeah I sleep in her stomach
And I sleep with a 50
Just to keep her 100
Yeah my swagger's so dummy
We so stupid so silly
I watch them girls getting lower
Then a kick in the milly, uhh
Gambino, why you got a gold chain?
Cuz girls only gunna see you when you stuntin' man
I'm coming back
Swag on row gain
Girl let me see your 2 chainz on then
So hood, whatcha talkin' bout?
Man I'm watching Law & Order on my grandmas couch
Eating lucky charms for dinner
Loser to a winner
Swag so clippers
Me and Blake Griffin
Me and Blake Griffin
Why them hoes tripping
You ever seen ballers like us both pimpin'?
Ha, we getting drunk like a Kennedy
Ha, we stay fly like the end of Greece
Yeah I got O's like CP3
Don't worry, don't you worry, don't you worry about me
I'm only worried when that period's on CPT
When that period's on CPT

[Verse 1]
I watched life inside of you grow
Every month a little bit bigger
All the things that bothered your soul
Make me smile and go crazy

[Bridge]
I wanted to start it with you
But someone said we ain't ready
I admit inside me lives fear
Fear I never wanted to show you

[Chorus]
They haunt all of my dreams
The green twins with your eyes
They haunt all of my dreams
The green twins with your eyes

[Verse 2]
We could've moved to LA
It's always sunny right out there
If I had it my way
We would've stayed where we started

[Bridge]
I wanted to start it with you
But someone said we ain't ready
I admit inside me lives fear
Fear I never wanted to show you

[Chorus]
They haunt all of my dreams
The green twins with your eyes
They haunt all of my dreams
The green twins with your eyes

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I’m in the mood
I wanna leave my lonesome home
Sometimes I’m in the mood
I wanna hear my milk cow moan
And sometimes I’m in the mood
I wanna hit that highway road
But then again, but then again, but then again, but then again
I said, oh babe, I’m in the mood for you
C'mon

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I’m in the mood (the mood)
I wanna back up against the wall
And sometimes I’m in the mood (the mood)
I wanna live in my pony’s stall
I said, sometimes I'm in the mood (the mood)
I wanna do nothing at all
But then again (again), but then again (again)
But then again (again) , but then again
I said, oh babe, I’m in the mood for you

[Spoken Interlude]
Alight everybody, how we all doing tonight?
Here at Jimmy Fallon, everybody in the audience
Everybody at home, I can't forget about you
I gotta say thanks to you
Serious nowhere that I would rather be than right here in New York City, playing this song with The Roots
And being here on Jimmy Fallon
Let's all give it up for our host, who is always so much fun
Unless you're Donald Trump
And then don't even think about messing with my hair, I'm serious

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I’m in the mood
I wanna change my house around
And sometimes I’m in the mood
I wanna change this whole town
And sometimes I’m in the mood
I’m wanna change the world around
But then again, but then again, but then again, but then again
I said, oh babe, I’m in the mood for you

[Verse 4]
Sometimes I'm in the mood (the mood)
I wanna lay down and die
Sometimes I'm in the mood (the mood)
I wanna climb up to the sky
And sometimes I'm in the mood (the mood)
I wanna laugh until I cry
But then again (again), but then again (again)
But then again (again) , but then again
I said, oh babe, I’m in the mood for you
One more time

[Outro]
But then again, but then again, but then again, but then again
I said, oh babe, I’m in the mood for you
Thank you

[Verse 1]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Sex (sex) on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep ​*horn honks*​
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
California, California girls
California, California girls

[Hook]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

[Verse 1]
Robert’s got a quick hand
He’ll look around the room
He won’t tell you his plan
He’s got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth
He’s a cowboy kid
Yeah he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet, In a box of fun things
I don’t even know what
But he’s coming for you, yeah he’s coming for you

[Hook]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet (Hit it!)
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

[Bridge]
Faster than my bullet
Faster than my bullet

[Verse 2]
Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late, and he’s coming home late
And he’s bringing me a surprise
Cause dinner’s in the kitchen and it’s packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
Then say "Your hair’s on fire, you must've lost your wits, yeah?"

[Breakdown]
Faster than my bullet
Faster than my bullet
Faster than my bullet
Faster than my bullet
Faster than my bullet

[Intro]
Hey DJ

[Verse 1]
Lady in a glass dress, I can see right through you
You act like you don't want this, but you know that you do
Since he broke your heart, girl, you say you'll never love again
And you won't let it stop, girl, but we know in the end

[Chorus]
You still dream, dream
You still dream, dream
Baby, I can make your dreams come true
Oh, oh, my lady in a glass dress, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I'm telling you I want you, but you saying you don't care
Begging you to stay with me, but you staying right there
I, when will you try?
I swear you being selfish, girl, you know that this ain't fair
Tell me that you wanna be alone when you go to bed tonight
You close your eyes

[Chorus]
Girl, you still dream, dream
You still dream, dream
Baby, I can make your dreams come true
Oh, oh, lady in a glass dress

[Bridge]
I see right through you
I see right through you

[Chorus]
You still dream, dream
You still dream, dream
Baby, I can make your dreams come true
Oh, oh, my lady in a glass dress, ooh, ooh
Oh, when I get back on solid ground
I'm gonna crawl my way to you

Oh, I once was lost and now I'm found
I'm gonna do what I should do
And when I get back on my feet again
I'm gonna run my way to you

Oh, when all is lost and come undone
I'm gonna sing out, and see ya through
But no, the water
The water flows over

Oh, when I get back off my feet again
I'm gonna crown my days a turn

So all I've been on my knees again
And I'll do it all the time

And when I get back on solid ground
I'm gonna crawl my way to you
Oh, I once was lost, but now I'm found
So here's what I'm gonna do

I sing, oh, the water
The water flows over
I sing, oh, the water
The water flows over you
All winter, we got carried
Away over on the rooftops, let's get married
All summer, we just hurried
So come over, just be patient and don’t worry
So come over, just be patient and don’t worry
So come over, just be patient and don’t worry
And don’t worry
Silver road of only sin
But I'm coming back, don't win
And the streets that rode the morning in

Light that boat on this river
Gotta know where to begin
Come on out, the other soul of Stephen
And things will never be the same again
Help me out, help me out
Cause I'm falling and I can't get back
And there isn't any number I can call for that

Oh, help me out, help me out
Cause I fall, and I was so scared
I know what was severed, and I'm rolling in

Even when the sun set
It burned my eyes
Even when the dark
Began to climb

And just because I roll the dice
And turned to worse
Together for the grace of God
Don't know why
And people wanna fight for fun
But what is a battle when the war's already been won
People wanna break what's built
There's no use crying when the milk's already been spilled

Here's a needle, here's a thread
Sew yourself up, clear your head
Here's a needle, here's a thread
Oh no, I meant exactly what I said

You might find that you're useless
No better than a hole in the ground
You might find that you're useless
No better than a hole in the ground

Well, look at all the cavemen go
Turning over to the show
Ohhh

Gonna want to run around
With someone who will let you down
Ohhh
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution
Can you hear that sound?
I can feel it in me now
Coming from the ground
From my head to my mouth
Oh can you feel it start
Like a bullet in a china shop
Oh when you start don't stop
When it starts you should never stop
No

Oh ten to the dozen
Who does, who doesn't
Who chooses who's chosen
Who must, who musn't
Who rests and who runs out
Don't ask that question
When your world's turned upside down
Oh when your world's turned upside down

I can it feel sink
I said i'd never do that again
Oh can you catch it now?
Oh like a bullet in your mouth
Like a balls and a ball of chain
Spark on another rain
Oh, can you hear that sound?
I can feel it in my mouth
Oh
Oh ten to the dozen
Who does, who doesn't
Who chooses who's chosen
Who must who mustn't
Who rests and who runs out
Don't ask that question
When my world's turned upside down
No when your world's turned upside down

Falling over this side
It feels so wrong it feels right
What it was and what it's not
Come and break it into
Pieces that begin to
What I was and what I'm not
They're calling you
Some kind of ghost
But I know that's not true

Cause time and time again I spoke
And I have spoke with you

They're saying I
Am some kind of ghost
But that's so hard to say

Maybe I'll go
Maybe you're safe
No there's no way to say

And I would love you
To come over
And I would love you to
Sleep on the ocean
Sleep on the sand
I've been very busy since the fall of man
Son of the devil
You won't understand
Now come on, baby
That's a sudden end

Speak of the devil
Inside my head
You've been very busy since the world's gonna end
Tired of the symbol
The sun, the sand
Talk a little louder, I don't understand

Gonna get the supper to the world tonight
I'm gonna fall asleep
There's a tiny little sin I've gotta do
Got to say that I'm only holding up at night
Turn with the flow, or this storm
There's a world outside, wanna let you in
There's a world outside, not going in
The world outside, won't let you in

Love, love got over that storm
Before you get somewhere
Oh, love got over that storm

I've got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
I went out for a ride, and I never came back

[Verse 1]
Don't ask me to slow down
I don't wanna go down
You won't catch me lookin' back
'Cause people like me don't live like that
I got dreams and I got plans
It's not hard to understand
There's no bottom and no top
'Cause people like me don't ever stop now

[Chorus]
If you wanna catch up to me
You better run as fast as you can
If you wanna live up to me
You better show me that you're the man
Am I going too fast?
Am I going too fast for you, baby?
Never gonna finish last
Am I going too fast for you, baby?
Mmm mmm mmm...

[Verse 2]
I got dreams, I got plans
Why's it so hard to understand?
There's no bottom and no top
'Cause people like me don't ever stop now

[Chorus]
If you wanna catch up to me
You better run as fast as you can
If you wanna live up to me
You better show me that you're the man
Am I going too fast?
Am I going too fast for you, baby?
Never gonna finish last
Am I going too fast for you, baby?

[Bridge]
Oww!
Run run run run for your life
I said run run run run run, but you better think twice
Think twice

[Breakdown]
You run like a girl

[Chorus]
Now if you wanna catch up to me
You better run as fast as you can
If you wanna live up to me
You better show me that you're the man
Am I going too fast?
Am I going too fast for you, baby?
Never gonna finish last
Am I going too fast for you, baby?
Run run run run for your life
I said run run run run run, but you better think twice
Think twice

Your love is like liquid
It fills me, it chills me
Can't hold it, control it
It runs from my touch
It slips through my fingers
The taste of it lingers
Your love is like liquid
I want it so much

[Chorus]
Liquid love
Pouring down like rain
Liquid love
Let it wash all over me

[Verse 2]
Your love is like liquid
It drenches, it quenches
It drowns me, surrounds me
It lies on my skin
It flows through my veins
Just like warm summer rain
Yes, your love is like liquid
I feel it within

[Chorus]
Liquid love
Pouring down like rain
Liquid love
Let it wash all over me
Liquid love
Flowing through my veins
Liquid love (Love, love, love)
Liquid love (Love, love, love)

My heart was frozen
'Til you came and melted it
Now my heart is molten
Turning into

Liquid love
Pouring down like rain

Let it wash all over me
Liquid love
Flowing through my veins
Liquid love (Liquid, liquid, liquid)

[Outro]
Liquid love
Pouring down like rain
Liquid love
Let it wash all over me
Liquid love
Flowing through my veins
Liquid love
Liquid love
Liquid love
Flowing through my veins

[Intro: Rihanna + (Kanye West)]
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
(Swizz told me let the beat rock)

[Verse 1: Kanye West + (Swizz Beatz)]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (God damn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (God damn)
They mad they're still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (God damn)
Yeah we still hood famous

[Hook: Rihanna + (Swizz Beatz)]
I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
(Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!)
I just wanted you to know

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Good God
Midwest coast back nigga
And don't say nigga unless of course you black nigga
Free country they say that shit in Tennessee
'Cause I got all they white daughters drinking Hennessy
I'ma go to Sal's, put some niggas on a wall
I might go to Oz take some niggas off the wall
Got the key to the city, the streets on lock
Tryna take 'em to the top, they say Chano so involved
I know
King Dolo, 3rd, even the group solo
It's been that way since my shirt had 2 polos
We the kids they keep in the back
I'm in love with my city, bitch I sleep in my hat
I'm a free agent, go and do the math
Underdog of underground, Tubman with the path
They askin' bout the help and all I do is laugh
I say God my only boss, even Moses had a staff

[Bridge: Sister Nancy + (Swizz Beatz)]

[Outro: Nina Simone]
I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

[Intro]
Yeah, hehehe

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Wake up and bake
Never hate, gotta get to this cake
I never stress but this money I stake
I brush my teeth, pray, wash my face
And thank God I stay far away from the fake
Remember days wasn't safe
Now we got thousands tucked in the safe
Target practice case you wanna come and see
I take a look in the mirror at G in front of me
Difference between havin' dreams and bein' a wannabe
And livin' comfortably
I took my dreams and made 'em somethin'
Doesn't mean that I don't wake up with the same hunger
Another mansion for my team, couple wave runners
Couple niggas want our spot but they can't take it from us
I'm busy smoking like Jamaicans
Never worry bout you niggas
Hate, you jealous, I can see it on your face
I seen 100 dollar bills falling yesterday
I heard 'em ask who fault it is then I spoke my name
Young Khalifa man

[Hook]
It's like I'm talking to a stranger
A stranger, a stranger, a stranger
Now everybody getting stranger
They're stranger, they're stranger, they're stranger
I think I'm in danger, gotta wake my game up
Gotta stay the same, watching everybody change
Ah now they're getting stranger
They're stranger, they're stranger, they're stranger

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I wrote my name on the clouds
Said no waiters allowed
Do anything to make my Taylors proud
I do a show, throw a J in the crowd
Some say I got they favorite style
You in the game, never make it out
I blow a pound, rollin' weed by the ounce
Them niggas talk but they can't amount
Big bands in my bank account
Seen it all, I've been here before
Calculate my moves but nah it's kinda difficult
I'm always switching up and doing shit in intervals
Now we professionals, nah we ain't letting go
Them niggas talk not what they doing but they moving slow
While I'm knee deep in the game, Mr. Doing More
This the part where the teacher becomes the student
And you start to realize I'm the youngin' you need to move with
Girls run up on me, tell me they love my music
Niggas try to be genuine I know it's bullshit

[Hook]
It's like I'm talking to a stranger
A stranger, a stranger, a stranger
Now everybody getting stranger
They're stranger, they're stranger, they're stranger
I think I'm in danger, gotta wake my game up
Gotta stay the same, watching everybody change
Ah now they're getting stranger
They're stranger, they're stranger, they're stranger

[Verse 3: JR Donato]
They beat me up so of course they wanna ride with us
You wasn't trapping on them blocks, you wasn't outside with us
A couple .40's, you got some 9's with us
And they can't beat us so of course they wanna side with us
They say if you ain't got no haters you ain't popping
I got pussy niggas, I got bitches pocket watching
I got blue hundreds on me in LA
I come straight from Hollywood then I pull up in the projects, go
Ay sorry homie you a stranger
One off in the head if I ever feel in danger
Started at the bottom but God damn it I done came up
Trill with my niggas, they can never say I changed up
Two cups stuffed and I get it out the mud
All I see is real hate, niggas showin' fake love
Givin' fake handshakes and that come with fake hugs
But I promise I'm the same
Forever gang-gang

[Hook]
It's like I'm talking to a stranger
A stranger, a stranger, a stranger
Now everybody getting stranger
They're stranger, they're stranger, they're stranger
I think I'm in danger, gotta wake my game up
Gotta stay the same, watching everybody change
Ah now they're getting stranger
They're stranger, they're stranger, they're stranger

[Intro: Takbar]
Pussy
You's a bitch ass nigga, nigga

What's your resume, you's a male stripper nigga
None of the real niggas in Cali fuck with you nigga
You know I'm plugged in and you know who this is talking pussy
You always showed me the utmost respect nigga
You's a bitch nigga
Never did nothing in your life how dare you play with niggas like us
What the fuck is your resume?

[Verse 1: Omelly]
Its Osama Twin Llamas and I'ma fuck around
Why you worried about Meek? Sit your gay ass down
Actin' like you that nigga when you a fuckin' clown
You wanna rumble? I got the 30 on me right now
Swing a punch, bop, bop, you goin' right down
Barkin' up the wrong tree, it's time to bite now
Ain't no more coppin' pleas, it's on sight now
Trigger finger itchin', fuck the wait, strike now

[Break: Takbar]
Nigga, you was a stripper, nigga
You copped a plea in every beef you been in nigga
You can't be fuckin' serious
You bumped your fuckin' head, you joke
Nigga you's a fu-, I can't believe this nigga, man
That'll push up like this

[Verse 2: Omelly]
Murder, murder, murder that be the case
Man this nigga outta pocket, man he softer than Drake
Drum on my lap, I'm strapped when I hop out the Wraith
Swing a punch on cuz, I knock a chunk out your face
Had a glass pot Pyrex, cookin' the flour
You had a thong up you ass, male hooker for dollars
I got enough clips, bitch, we can shoot up for hours
Get it jumpin', hit the switch like a '64 Impala
Clip fully auto whole strip'll get showered

[Break: Beanie Sigel, (Omelly) & Meek Mill]
One phone call I'm in LA in three hours
The bully, please don't bring me out of retirement
Aye Mac chill let me do my thing I got him
Ooouuu, ooouuu
Ooouuu
(You was a stripper)
Philly shit
(Nigga you trippin'
You was a stripper)
B Mac in the building, Omelly in the building
Deuce in the building
DC in the building, Yay in the building

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I can never lose, chess or checkers make a move
Drippin' in them jewels like I just got out the pool
Skinny nigga sittin' on that money like the jews
Only time we make it to the TV if it's the news
We was tryna make it out them trenches, you dig?
Young niggas trappin' out them benches, you dig?
You gon' be a felon or a witness, you dig?
All this money, murderin' is senseless, it is
Fuck 'em and tell 'em if I ain't gon' feed 'em
All this money I'm gettin', prolly ain't gon' need 'em
Niggas said that we beefin', prolly ain't gon' see 'em
I'm just pushin' them buttons on 'em and they gon' leave him
Durk checked you, Thug sonned you (what else?)
Fif dropped you (what else?), Mac oned you (what else?)
Strippers turned rappers look what we come to
You a faggot, my lady'll never fuck you
G-A-M-E, please don't tempt me
Four pound with the lemon squeeze like simply
Ridin' dirty sippin' on the eighth like Pimp C
Land at the Clearport, truck my Bentley
Comin' down Sunset, I'm not done yet
I've been to Bompton, you don't run that
Shout out to YG, where my bloods at?
Call my eses, where them guns at?
I'm with them 40 niggas, I'm never with 40 niggas
Promo your album they got you making up stories, nigga
Stripper to rapper, rapper to stripper you corny, nigga
A sucka

[Break: Meek Mill]
That's what you do to sell you album
You only gon' sell like 15 thousand the first week
I put a mil' on it
DC4 on the way
Heh, y'all niggas is crazy talk to the D's I got lawyer money

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
You was signed to a rat, you a mouse nigga
I'm sittin' on that money like a couch, nigga
Make me crumble you cookie, you Girl Scout nigga
Make me move to Calabassas, buy a house, nigga
Calabassas, Mac 10 the masks
Waiting on that red Bentley just to fly past us
Hollow tips ripple through the window, shatter glasses
Mac just landed at the port he want some action
Catch you at the drive-through, hit 'em and wax 'em
Desert eagle Sigel hit your body, slide you backwards
Make a nigga moonwalk, talkin' Michael Jackson
I don't let my goons talk, they be only clappin'
Menace to society, got guns by varieties
Teardrops on your face, you ain't got no bodies
Son you like you Ray Ray, nigga you ain't Bobby
Treat you like you Day Day, Deebo on a Friday, pussy
Somebody touch me then somebody die
Beat the body, throw a party like its Mardi Gras
I'm from Philly, nigga, all we know is homicide
Throwing millis tryna make a nigga momma cry
Brace yourself double barrel pipe
Do him like Caine's cousin Harold at the light
Weigh like 170, nigga, I don't fight
Do it with the guns or we can do it with the knife
Do this shit for fun, we could do this shit tonight
Cause we was never cool, nigga, you was just 'aight
New Jack City me and Chino on the bike
I'm sittin' back with the uzi that's your life
I'm gone

[Outro: Takbar]
Pussy
This ain't about East or West neither nigga
Its about niggas and bitches, power and money
Riders and punks
Nigga you been a bitch nigga
You don't do nothing that we do nigga
You don't get down like we do
We applying pressure on you bitch ass nigga
You know what I'm saying
Niggas already know man Tak, Bossilini, a underboss

[Verse 1]
My girlfriend gets so depressed
She never leaves the house
She doesn't even get dressed
My girlfriend always leaves a mess
She says she's gonna clean
But she always forgets

My girlfriend is there when I get home
Watching movies on TV
Or talking on the phone
Sometimes I want to leave, but I got nowhere to go
But hey, nobody's perfect
No one wants to be alone

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
My girlfriend is so unimpressed
By everything I say
You can see it in her face
I don't say much, I just hope and pray
There's been some big mistake
And buy her flowers just in case
And I don't mind it when she goes out with her friends
They drop her off drunk
And I take her up to bed
She says 'I'm sorry' and I kiss her on the head
And everything is fine
Until the morning comes again

[Refrain]

[Bridge]
I remember when we were in high school
I took her to the dance
We snuck out to the bleachers
And I thought that I might take a chance

But it never does any long-term good
To go thinking about the past
God damn this wandering mind of mine
That can't be happy with what it has

But I'm not mad
And sometimes we still laugh
And when she's just getting up
And the sun hits her right
She doesn't even look half bad

[Refrain]

[Outro]
My girlfriend gets so depressed
She never leaves the house
She doesn't even get dressed
My girlfriend is so unimpressed
By everything I say
You can see it in her face

[Intro: Darnell Boat]
Well, this is more like it
See I know these youngsters don't know nothing about this here

These youngsters swear they know something, boy
All 'em boys wanna talk about is

Boy, them youngsters is crazy, I can't even control 'em sometimes
I tell you
I love them boys though, them boys my boys

[Hook: Lil Boat]

[Verse 2: Lil Boat]
I had 3 play run in one day, can't you tell I'm sleepy
Two Japanese hoes at my show, they just wanna greet me
Fuck all the chit chat, kill promoters that's tryin' cheat me
Red bottom sneakers look like I just stepped out a TV
Bitch from Hawaii got a crib right next to the tiki
I love how you fuck me, but Lil Boat, I hate how you treat me
Lil bitch it's time to go
I been chillin' too too long, I gotta get back to my Boat

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Wop, money!
Honorable C-Note

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Fluorescent lamps in my crib, providing light for my seeds
I'm a get money marine, I sent coke in submarines
Irrigation machines, hydraulic water machines
My money counting machine sound like a sewing machine
Cash machine on the dresser, machine gun with the compressor
Dope presser machine, I'm re-rocking everything (presser)
Claim I'm laundering money but where the washing machine?
They know my trap house pump out quarters like a slot machine
In a futuristic whip look like a time machine
Old school dropped a lil' one fine machine
Making chips off coke and soda like a vending machine
Dog food with the quinoa in my blending machine
Sip so much Codeine and Sprite I need a soda machine
So I can sit it next to my joint rolling machine
And it's placed parallel to the Carbon 15
With the scope, monkey nuts, and the infrared beam
The machine don't make the man, the man make the machine
So many try to sabotage, can't stop the regime
Call me Wop the puppet master, I'm just pulling the strings
Screaming please don't look me puppet like American Me
Take a tour with me, a down south American G
Tryna flood the dirty south, East Atlantian streets
With this high grade uncut Colombian tea
Yeah I got it for cheap but you ain't get it from me
Got the high grade uncut Colombian tea
Yeah I got it for cheap but you can't get it for free

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
My money machine, my money machine
My money machine go beep-beep
My money machine, my money machine
My money machine go beep-beep
My money machine, my money machine
My money machine, my money machine
My money machine, my money machine
My money machine, my, beep
My money machine, my money machine
My money machine go beep-beep
My money machine, my money machine
My money machine go beep-beep

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
8 figure niggas man
When I say boss I mean that, ya heard me?
I'm so fuck what I sold, my toilet seats solid gold
You should see my new palace cause that bitch bigger than Lowe's
I'm a 8 figure nigga, I run the check to the ceiling
Since Gucci came home bitches back in they feelings
I'm in Dubai on parole, I Abu Dhabi my hoes
If she fuck all the rappers, she say hip hop in her soul
100 grand in all twenties, they said that I couldn't
50 grand to my bitch just cause her ex was looking
Red bottom boss, I call the yayo caucasian
Choppers sleep on the couch ready for home invasions
These pussies watching my Snap, they know that I'm strapped
On the road to the riches bitches, I'm running my laps

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
My money machine, my money machine
My money machine go beep-beep
My money machine, my money machine
My money machine go beep-beep
My money machine, my money machine
My money machine, my money machine
My money machine, my money machine

[Chorus]
She an icy lil' bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil' bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww, blaww
She an icy lil' bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil' bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww

[Verse 1]
Man the bitch got fresh at the mouth so I iced her
She said something so slick I disliked her
If you ain't getting no cash like this, you can't pipe her
But if you rock a watch like this, it entice her
Man I can't even front on the chick cause she grinding
Necklace full of diamonds, wrist and fist blinding
The type of chick that Guwop like, you can't find
It's a clause in my young bitch contract you can't sign
Her closet like Rodeo got all type of designers
And every time she leave up out the house, niggas remind her
That she the baddest bitch in the world, and they want her
But she just a material girl just like Madonna

[Chorus]
She an icy lil' bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil' bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww, blaww
She an icy lil' bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil' bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww

[Verse 2]
Chilling in the pent playing jazz, she got jazzy
She's a pretty lil' bitch, but her mouth is too nasty
The way she do the trick with her tongue, the bitch had me
She's a spoiled girl, rotten, so bad, I play daddy
See I'm the type of rich, that I give before you ask me
I got the type of dick make a rich girl start harassing
I started in the trap, then I switched and started rapping
She started drinking shots of Patron and started laughing
Ciroc and passion fruit now she sucking me with a passion
A fire breathing dragon, she riding me like a taxi
We started off as friends, and then we started smashing
Soon as she got a good dose of the macking she start bragging

[Chorus]
She an icy lil' bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil' bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww, blaww
She an icy lil' bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil' bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww

Listen to this track bitch
Woah, Wop
Hah, Wop
Woah, sheesh
Burr, toy
Skrrt, Wizop

[Verse 1]
I take the good with the bad, and the bad with the good
The plug sent the goods, so I had to flood the hood
The plug sent the bag, then I offed that too
That made me a bigger asset to the plug
But tell me how you feel when your plug tell on ya
Your partner in crime, own thugs tell on ya
Talking 20 years, 30 years, 50 years
In the cell feeling drunk like you drunk 80 beers
Homicide though, genocide when I ride
When we die, only God know where the bullets fly
In my Hummer truck, bullets coming through my car door
I got contract killers staying at my condo
Got a hole up your folk cause they sure ain't bluffin'
Gotta vest up cause I sure ain't ducking
Standing in the cold on the corner, Flat Shoals
Sold his soul to the devil for a Mac-11
100 bricks of pure coke, white like heaven
My Mexican, Catholic connect doing confession
Sitting in the pen, son just turned seven
I progress then regress and this shit is getting depressing
But I count my stash 'fore I count my blessings
And I load my weapon 'fore I eat my breakfast
The skreets keep talking and the snitches keep telling
Your whole life can change in a motherfucking second

[Chorus]
Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo
They playing games with me when they know that I'm a fool
Set it off like Queen Latifah, give me the loot or I'ma shoot
You nincompoops so rude-a-poo, you tuti-fruit, you through
I'm an animal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose
Animal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose
Gucci Mane La Flare, you prolly seen me on the news
Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo

[Verse 2]
I might manic, I go in a panic, don't see nothing but red
Off my meds, I can't sleep cause I hear voices in my head
This lil devil on my left shoulder say "shoot him in the dreads"
While an angel on the right whisper "just shoot him in the leg"
I admit that I might need some help, I guess I made a step
Man they think I need a shrink cause I fear God but don't fear death
I'm so selfish, I bought 80 pints to drink 'em by myself
A swimming pool full of drank, I dive in like I'm Michael Phelps
Louis glasses, Ferragamo belt, I'm Gucci Mane XL
YSL with the new Gazelles that match my blue Chevelle
Bitches laughing like I'm Dave Chappelle cause I stay fresh as hell
Zone 6, Zone 6. You don't like it? Kill yourself

[Chorus]
Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo
They playing games with me when they know that I'm a fool
Set it off like Queen Latifah, give me the loot or I'ma shoot
You nincompoops, so rude-a-poo, you tuti-fruit, you through
I'm an animal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose
Animal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose
Gucci Mane La Flare, you prolly seen me on the news
Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo

[Hook: Notorious B.I.G. sample]
"I grew up a fucking screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game then fucking blew up"

[Intro: Ludacris speaking over B.I.G. sample repeated]
Yeah! Dedicated to all my hustlers that's a product of they environment
Whether getting money legally or ILLEGALLY
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive man!
Yeah! Grew up a screw up baby
Got introduced to the game, I ain't took a breath yet
Let's go!

[Ludacris]
Ever since I was an embryo, waiting to shape up and ship out
Something in my brain said, "Wake up and kick out!"
Roberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out
Cause when I came I was draped up and dripped out
Snip the umbilical, spit the government chip out
Peace up, A-Town down and then I dipped out
And oh my gosh, the Osh Kosh was picked out
I slipped in, even my baby stroller was tricked out
Somebody get him, the little nigga's out of control
Put a little bit of rum in my bottle I'll dream about diamonds and gold
Gold gold, to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent
The essence of adolescence got my body feeling freshen
Freshing freshing, and it was a blessing to rhyme and start rapping
I was the best in my section with flows hard than erections
Still the best but now I'm grown with more range than a Texan
And I'm a heavyweight you niggas is lighter than my complexion

[Hook]

[Young Jeezy over the Hook]
Luda! What up homie? CTE nigga!
8732, What it do?
Jay double! Let’s get it!

[Young Jeezy]
I grew up right here, round the corner from mailman
And when the first came we was waitin' on the mailman
What you mean it ain't right? You better go get the scale man
I don't trust them anyway, You know them niggas'll tell man
First they run up in your place, now your ass got a case
Crooked ass judge send your ass out of space
8 by 6, now your ass out of place
Your girl ran through your change, Now your ass out of pockets
Speakin' of pockets, mines gots the mumps
A quarter mil' for breakfast, now what's for lunch
I got a bag full of green shit, now where's the blunts
Snuck in through the back nigga, now where's the front?
Dropped out in the eighth grade, Got money eight ways
Yo moms, fuck it I got shit to do
Listen, all you hatin' ass niggas that thought that I wouldn't last
The Inspiration on the way, ya'll can kiss my ass man

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
I'mma be all the way real with this, look
When I came into the game they ain't do nothing but doubt me
Now the whole game's changed and it ain't nothing without me
Picking up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown
Only reason you on that song is cause I turned that down
I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels, Hyundais to Bentleys
And five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's
From alright to handsome, from one room to mansions
From hanging on the block to throwing parties in the Hamptons
From, broke as a joke to rich as a bitch, I bought a
Plane and a boat and six other whips, no MARTA
From dice on the curb to stacking up chips, but harder
From birds on my nerves to chicks on my DICK! Guard your
Women dawg I went from ashy to classy
Went from a, kiss on the cheek to doing the nasty
Reach your hand up in the air and you can play with the stars
It's not the hand that you're dealt but how you're playing your cards
Boy!

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uhh, pen to the pad, metaphors on fleek
Took the words that I heard and I put em' to the beat
Press up my tape then I put it in the street
Upload my files and tweet out my link
I'ma be in ‘em comments just to see what they think
I'ma shoot me a video and put it on the 'tube
I'ma spam IG to get up my views
And DM my favorite artist, say, "I'm gonna be hu-u-uge"
Book me a show that the blogs gonna cover
And they all gon' love it
And the crowd gon' turn up, is anybody out there?
Turn up the mic, we can't hear you out here

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? Rescue all your babies
Who, who, who (ay)
Hip-Hop, won't you save me? I am just a baby

[Post-Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Nikki Jean]
Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Not gonna go crazy when I blow up
Bet they gonna go crazy when I show up
Won't listen to the haters cause I know what
Said I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up
Said I gonna be slow if I pour up
But I'm gonna be poor if I slow up
So I gotta keep it going, ain't no slow motion in here

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Tryna get the tour bus with the studio
It ain't no buts, just bootyholes (uh)
Can't be out here looking l
