and my boys
She just wanna sucky-sucky 'til I say "Oh Lord"
She gon' suck it 'cause my money longer than a cord
Momma pussy soaking wet, I feel like I'm aboard
Lil’ bitch tryna record, hold up

[Interlude]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up

[Verse 2]
Take two, I come with a few
Just in case you lick it like you do
I’ma pull up to the set with my nigga Jayroo
Pussy nigga know I'm bickin’ it with my Piru
Lame bitches know I'm not gon' fuck her, they the swoop
I'ma catch a felon with a weapon like a troop
Hop inside a foreign car, tearing up the roof (Woo)
I’ma slide ride pass 'em 'cause they do not sound like you
420, gettin' geeked out my mind, hey
420, I'ma pop out my spot, hey
420, 420, 420 nigga
420, 420, 20
Alka seltzer plus when I was standing on the block I served the J
Nigga coming back talking 'bout "Where the money?" but I come and then I lay
Going up to school, nigga blunt, nigga know them bitches laced
So geeked out my mind, fuck what the teacher say
Got a pocket full
Nose in my ring like a fucking bull
I miss you

Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and we're upside down
I know it's hard, babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
All alone, in my room..
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms, holding my heart

Oh I
Oh I
(Oh I)
Love you
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I will stay right here, yeah

I know that you want me too
Baby we can make it through.. anything
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long lights, and the bright lights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the long lights, and the bright lights
Don't you worry
'Cause everything's gonna be alright

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I just got the fuck off a plane
6 car garage, I got more than 1 job
Be a boss, go hard
Wake up, smelling kush when I yawn
Shorty wanna fuck with the king, tired of them pawns
Ain't on the top? Well, that's nonsense
Bank account full of G's, so that's all you gon' get
TSA know my face so they don't trip
Chain frost, big bitch that I'm with don't give me no lip
We done touch M's, now we on to billions
Hard to explain how these new rugs feeling
Blowin' kush up in high ceiling's
Having meetings at the crib, confidential dealings
And I ain't gotta tell you who the realest is
That's my nigga Spitta, foreign cooked chef
And where the kitchen is
Money straight where my business is
And the girls fuck with me so I'm always where the bitches is
Kid

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I see all the sexy mami's in here
Hey, ayy, Wiz I smell you up here, too
Make sure you pass that KK to the DJ booth
Aw shit, here comes Spitta on them gold BBS

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Yep, swung through, gold BBS and the spoiler kit
1986, slinging that shit
They want the family price on them bricks
But I just had a son and I only love him
So I ain't coming down on the price
Ain't no where else you gon' get shit this nice
Got cocaine white, Air Force Nikes
Bought K-Swisses for all my bitches
Put hightop troops on all my shooters
Bought the Goose down jacket from the boosters
Shootouts on the roof, racing in them coupes
She wore the Gucci frames with the door knocker hoops
And the lying motherfucker tell you I ain't the truth
Rich uncle come through, pop the truck, pull the duffel
Lay the merchandise out, get the loot, motherfucker
East side real nigga, show ya how to hustle
Outside, put the fucking Chevrolet's on the bumper
If it don't hop, nigga, park that shit
That ain't no low rider, thats a rollin' imposter
Put the stocks on fool, quit playing like you out here
2009, all kind of high
How Fly had fools on the moon trying to drive
Its a stoned duo, solid gold judo
Kicked the fuck out that game and now she won't go

[Outro]
Ladies, if you ain't go your own drinks, you gotta get out the section
You heard my man Spitta
Fellas, raise your glasses
Tip your bartenders
And make sure you take that nigga bitch
We bout to ride out
Jet Life, Taylor Gang, ow
BOY:
Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singin'

BOTH:
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

GIRL:
Baby, you're a young girl, tough girl
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

BOTH:
We will, we will rock you, sing it!
We will, we will rock you, yeah

BOY:
Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna get you some peace someday
GIRL:
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place, do it!

BOTH:
We will, we will rock you, yeah, yeah, come on
We will, we will rock you, alright, louder!
We will, we will rock you, one more time
We will, we will rock you
Yeah

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Bottle cold, the game a decade old
I'm livin' like Ox, big-ass house, weed nuggets in the bowl
I don't watch soccer, but I like the jerseys
They look good with my jewelry on
And my butter brown skin tone
Bitches choosin', but none I bring home
I break 'em off on sight
Introduced 'em to the rest of the stage, done like a couple nights
If she's really down, soul on ice like my Rollie crown
We control the town from the couch, nigga, I'm smoked out
You really want that funk U.B. delivered to us in the trunk
Andretti OG, Khalifa Kush all stuffed in one joint
I proved my point when I parked that Rolls Royce, hopped out
Forgot my phone was in my lap, my mothafuckin' screen cracked
It's all good, I'll text your bitch and have her slide through Mac
That Apple Care kicked in, bring me a new phone and an iPad back
Hustlers on the map, in pursuit of the scratch
Never would we relax, money addicts relapsed (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Two dopeboys in a Cadillac
Stayed real, struck it rich, how can you hate on that?
Two dopeboys in a Cadillac
Weed clouds in the air, diamonds in the back

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Plenty bosses, pretty watches
Pull up, they ask what it cost us
Stayin' cautious, play your posture
Never takin' any losses
We declinin' offers
Too much sauce, can't get it off us
Shout out to Sauce Walka
Foreign cars and old Impalas
Million dollars, million problems
Gotta keep them millions on us
Hate 'em, dodgin', bake 'em, watch 'em
Money, tryna make it often
Now we fathers, know that God got us
They be tryna foul us
But we never die-ers, gang lifers, rap game survivors
Paid the prices
We make history and made it twice
Off of savin' Nikes and convincin' girls to stay the night
That's our way of life, dropped 2009 to say it twice
Every day's a flight
You just hatin', dawg, that ain't advice
Got my paper right, ain't just buyin' everything in sight
Now I'm the savin' type, so my son is straight for life
Always grindin', money on the mind, Rollie tellin' time
You out of line, sayin' this gang life is not the vibe

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Two dopeboys in a Cadillac
Stayed real, struck it rich, how can you hate on that?
Two dopeboys in a Cadillac
Weed clouds in the air, diamonds in the back
Two dopeboys in a Cadillac
Stayed real, struck it rich, how can you hate on that?
Two dopeboys in a Cadillac
Weed clouds in the air, diamonds in the back

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Stay papered up, woah
Stay papered up, on gang (Oh)
Stay papered up, woah
Stay papered up, on gang (Oh)

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Heavy ass Mercedes Benz on top rims
Big chain, pink diamonds, candy ring
Couple million dollars off my own strain
Your life like a video game, Gran Turismo
I'm in that GT-R 'cause I parked the six four
I had the match for the cash
Underground garage where I stash
These niggas still in competition
When I pass, move
2009 on time whenever we come through
Avoidin' the traps, these cappin' ass bitches livin' life behind Snapchat filters
Fuck them, this is us
Still G'd up and way more papered up

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Stay papered up, woah
Stay papered up, on gang (Oh)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Okay, I only care 'bout the money
Can't no one take it from me
And I'm smilin' all the time, but nigga, ain't shit funny
Leavin' out the Gucci store, nigga, ain't shit bummy
On the paper chase on your ring, they shit runnin'
Took four years off and the checks kept comin'
All the girls wanna treat me like I'm special or somethin'
We at number one, mean we standin' next to nothin'
And the shit you rock is fake, but that's another discussion
I see a lotta dudes hate and the shit is disgusting
And I travel all the time, always gettin' through customs
And my livin' room new, everything in there custom
And the gang with me, everything I got is because 'em
Fools need better luck, they be wishin' it was them
Go on tour when I want, 50k for the clubin'
We a bunch of rich niggas and our kids'll be cousins
And don't gotta open doors, we just pushin' the button
That's on gang, life (Motherfucker)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Stay papered up, woah
Stay papered up, on gang (Oh)
Stay papered up, woah
Stay papered up, on gang (Oh)

[Verse 3: Curren$y & Wiz Khalifa]
Three hundred thousand on your block, stars in the hardtop
Come through it don't stop, unless it's bitches out
Money is all I'm 'bout, don't know how much I got
'Cause it's never enough, fill another safe up
They only play tough, they really cream puff
I roll another one, forever highed up
Uh, Off-White kicks
Tryna find a billion dollars 'fore I find the right bitch
Side kick, roll the weed up
Catch a vibe with a real nigga that'll check his bags private
Come learn how I live, me and Spitta 'bout to buy the island

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Stay papered up, woah
Stay papered up, on gang (Oh)
Stay papered up, woah
Stay papered up, on gang (Oh)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, long days, gotta recharge to run the play
Paper straight, come up with bars to get us paid
Major weight make it hard for them to imitate
Rolex tell the daytime and the date
If I eat, all my niggas gon' get a plate
If you hate, guaranteed, you ain't in the way
Clown shit, we don't entertain
Always been a young nigga with the vision and I'm still the same
Turned an idea into a strain
Do it once, I fuck with you, I respect you, you do it again
Nothin' but the best for the fam
I don't gotta flex for the 'Gram
Too many rings for my hands, so we stack 'em and stash 'em
We them fuckin' champs

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ah-ah, uh
You ain't gotta lie to kick it
You ain't close to rich enough to be in here
Papered up and stoned at every appearance
Martha's Vineyard, baby left her diamond necklace behind
At the bed and breakfast, it's fine
She got that on a heist, she'll steal a better one on the next one
I only fuck with professionals
Sniper scopes and silencers stuck inside of leather sectionals
Watch where you sit at, might hear that click-clack
I copped the BMW six pack, M package
Highway action, state mansion
That's what G's do, you smell that fire in the breeze, fool
Don't you dare call this shit a part two
This a whole 'nother animal, this that mankind mandible
Chanel drip on your television channel
Counting cake lit as a birthday candle

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Pay me just like a fan do
Real one so they don't know how much my shit they can handle
Chicks love social media, so I watch out for them scandals
Don't measure that kush, give you a handful
Gotta grind 'cause my son hungry and the rent due

[Verse 4: Curren$y]
We changed how you smoke, changed how you dress
Your whole life was blessed by the presence of the stoned legends
Ho, retrace our steps and see what you get
If you never let suckers talk you out shootin' your shot
Hustle with every breath, huh?

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
McQueen
Ounces of weed
Got your own
If you at my table
McQueen
Ounces of weed
Got your own
If you at my table
Yeah, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh, I'm from the East Side section of your area
I ain't bullshittin', corners I be hittin'
Just the morning edition, champagne, orange juice mixin'
Fell asleep in the studio, woke up on a mission
Wall Street wolf, these lil' niggas shook
When we walked in the room, they ain't know where to look
That eye contact might result in combat
My hands clean, I don't know who wrote that contract
Youngsters huntin', murdin' for hire, doin' numbers
Trade your life for a Camaro this summer
Ain't nothin' where I come from, but I come up quite different
Spittin' that zigzag, raw raps, spit shit
Major wrist get you that big bag
All the Ziploc with that motherfuckin' toe tag
But we the Taylor Gang, Jet Lyfe, us high-flyers never die
It's 20 inch BMX bikes, stomp pegs, grip pliers
Now me and Pittsburgh Slim is both post drivers
Sit by, talkin' shit about us, but you need to get like us
'Cause you know our shit is always tighter
Always flyer, we just 2009-ed you

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, no pain, no gain, I treat 'em the same
If it ain't my strain, it ain't in my brain
The boss, the man, nothing in between
Them niggas be gone as soon as they came
My car go fast, wash it in the rain
My chain is cold, diamonds in my rings
I get respect not because of fame
You hate, you lame, I don't entertain
My shoes, my fit, cost a little change
She was your chick, now she with the gang
Just rolled a zip, now I need a flame
Well known, it don't gotta be explained
My Benz, or I'm hoppin' out a plane
Jet Lyfe the gang, all of it the same
New crib, put our logo on everything
Plus worldwide, they know our name
That's on gang, Lyfe
Jet Taylor, smoke the best flavors

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I put the cheat code in
I got the money and the infinite lives, this Vice City bitch
I pray I never have to let it rip
But these the days and the times and you never know who gon' try
This that pink Polo, Ye flow, give it through the barbwire
At the top of the back yard fences to slow them motherfuckers down if they try to get in here
Ate them mushrooms and watched Scarface and now I'm pacing in my window
Back in my mind I know nobody coming
But then my third eye remind me not everybody love me
Still I slide, twisting it up
Weeding out them Chevy's, hitting switches, giving it up
Living it bruh
The vision for us was quite clear
When the smoke clears decades later we'll still be here
I don't know where them other niggas at
I ain't looking for no fools
I'm tryna remember where I parked the Benz at

[Chorus: Tommy Girl]
We been on your prey
And we do it everyday
Jet Life, Taylor Gang
And you know what to say
You know who you are from the start

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
From the beginning, niggas always started winning
Gon' remember me before I'm finished
From a place where it's hard living
Ain't no handouts
Now it's stars in the ceiling
Niggas got options when it come to cars
No more regular hoes
All I'm fucking with is superstars
From the bullshit we moving on
Rolling strong, foreign broad, need the newest car
Ain't a song unless my dog detonate the bomb
Kush got me right, hope you don't take it wrong
When I roll it up and light I need more than an eighth
I don't need nothing from you little homie, I'm straight
Jet Life, Taylor Gang

[Chorus: Tommy Girl]
We been on your prey
And we do it everyday
Jet Life, Taylor Gang
And you know what to say
You know who you are from the start

[Intro]
Hah, good one, Richard
Z cooking on the track

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Some of them supposed to go, some of them supposed to stay
I ain't tryna ruin yours, I'm tryna make a way, yeah
I be at the top, that's my favorite place
That money gonna come, I don't gotta chase it
Them bitches gonna come, I don't gotta chase em
I'ma keep getting love, I don't gotta chase it
Diamonds in my chain, watch, and my bracelet
Got love for all my dawgs, I don't gotta chase it

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
They say I smoke too much, I say I don't smoke enough
You ain't dealing with what I'm dealing with, bruh
Remembering when the crib I lived in didn't look like this
The carpet had burn holes, nigga, we was in there smoking
And thinking on how to grab us some mid
Me and my dog was close to going half on a chopper
And like a pound of weed and just lockin' in and gettin' it
But then lightening hit
Wasn't trying to change the world
But we fucked around and did it
Kept all my cars, but I kept trading in woman
Neon lights spell out my company name on the side of the building
It's going down in my life, baby girl, but I really be chilling
Reminiscing, lost wages, bum deals
I should've ran magnifying glasses on them pages and that's for real, yeah

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Some of them supposed to go, some of them supposed to stay
I ain't tryna ruin yours, I'm tryna make a way, yeah
I be at the top, that's my favorite place
That money gonna come, I don't gotta chase it
Them bitches gonna come, I don't gotta chase em
I'ma keep getting love, I don't gotta chase it
Diamonds in my chain, watch, and my bracelet
Got love for all my dawgs, I don't gotta chase it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Give it all back to my son, millions plus one
I don't do 'less it's fun, to focus the funds
I remember taking trips with weed in the trunk
Now police don't even trip when we rolling up
Legal stunts, got a pound with each our name on it
Setting up the family, that's the main focus
Game polished, did our best to keep these lames off us
Turned down what the labels offer
Now everything in our name
Influenced the game with our slang
Its all a hundred percent, never changed
All my niggas stay solid as the friend
You broke, won't never fix you again

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Some of them supposed to go, some of them supposed to stay
I ain't tryna ruin yours, I'm tryna make a way, yeah
I be at the top, that's my favorite place
That money gonna come, I don't gotta chase it
Them bitches gonna come, I don't gotta chase em
I'ma keep getting love, I don't gotta chase it
Diamonds in my chain, watch, and my bracelet
Got love for all my dawgs, I don't gotta chase it

[Intro: Problem]
Yeah, ooh
Van Gogh
Yeah, yeah, shit

[Chorus: Problem]
I'm getting loose, lil' bitch, getting loose
I don't wanna know the truth, got stars in my roof, yeah
I'm getting loose, young nigga, getting loose
I ain't going for the floof, getting head in the booth, yeah
I'm getting loose, lil' bitch, getting loose
I don't wanna know the truth, got stars in my roof, yeah
I'm getting loose, young nigga, getting loose
I ain't going for the floof, getting head in the booth, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shit, I ain't going for the floof, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no way, I ain't going for the floof, what?

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh, scrapers in the city, Daytons on the 57
Chevy chrome, suspension four switcher
LS engine, bitches came with the interior
Dope pot, stir it up, fumes got her tearing up
'79 Malibu, mash down the avenue
If them niggas really wanna race, bring the bag through
Came through in the space coupe, everything new
Umbrellas in the door, galaxy in the roof
Boss in the booth, sharks after the loot
Be cool, motherfucker, ain't nobody asked you
Goin' where the money at, came back with all that
Blabber-mouth bitch gave my niggas the treasure map
We know where it's at, muhfucker, forget a plaque
For twice what you pay, homeboy, you could get it back
We could call a private plane like a taxi cab
Crib with extended driveway and a heli-pad, bitch

[Chorus: Problem]
I'm getting loose, lil' bitch, getting loose
I don't wanna know the truth, got stars in my roof, yeah
I'm getting loose, young nigga, getting loose
I ain't going for the floof, getting head in the booth, yeah
I'm getting loose, lil' bitch, getting loose
I don't wanna know the truth, got stars in my roof, yeah
I'm getting loose, young nigga, getting loose
I ain't going for the floof, getting head in the booth, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shit, I ain't going for the floof, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no way, I ain't going for the floof, what?

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Bars in the hook's all that it took
We don't gotta ask questions, we wrote the book
This life way better than it look
You ain't gonna get to work on foot
Got these other rap niggas shook
10 years, ain't miss by a hair
You could drop shit in his whip, not in here
Proceed with care, the set keep trees in the air
No need for VIP passes, my whole team in the clear
VS in all our pieces, try to call our phone, can't reach us
We probably out the country or rolling weed up, playing FIFA
And my cars is decent, some of 'em older, some recent
Leaving my keys in, this one for today
You gon' see a new one this weekend, on gang

[Chorus: Problem]
I'm getting loose, lil' bitch, getting loose
I don't wanna know the truth, got stars in my roof, yeah
I'm getting loose, young nigga, getting loose
I ain't going for the floof, getting head in the booth, yeah
I'm getting loose, lil' bitch, getting loose
I don't wanna know the truth, got stars in my roof, yeah
I'm getting loose, young nigga, getting loose
I ain't going for the floof, getting head in the booth, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shit, I ain't going for the floof, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no way, I ain't going for the floof, what?

[Intro]
Sledgren

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Like my gin neat
Run the game, I suggest that you get floor seats
Might not leave with everything, but we for sure get a piece
Fix it up, put it on the streets
If I ain't in my 6-4, then my Benz creep
Up and down the street
Run to the money, can't nothin' else get me on my feet
We ain't even gotta watch for police
It's legal now, they allow us to grow trees
My hotel suite describe the definition of chic
Tryin' not to ash on the sheets
Got a balcony we won't see
30 mil' a year, still tryna be lowkey
And that's just me, not even to mention my OG
Get money 'fore we dip, then we proceed
It's funny how niggas get
We don't do it 'less the whole gang benefit
We stoned gentlemen

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Money is the mission, it's skrilla over bitches
Standin' in the way, fuck him and whoever with him
Pull up on her and she make a decision to get in
Yeah, your girl hella talkative 'round rich niggas
Room full of hittas and you squares can't get in
Movin' through the air, eatin' shrimp in the Gulf Stream
She in the mirror for hours, hopin' that she get seen
With us, your girl hella talkative 'round rich niggas

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Hustle is all I know, spend it and get some more
I'm stayin' on the go, hopin' it don't get slow
I'm on the paper route with my folk
Ain't part of this game, a joke
Wrap it up like a brick of coke
Call a play like a give-and-go
Ballin' for real, toss an alley oop off the pick and roll
Rollin' hundred spokes gold, my Rolex frozen
Have you ever seen a quarter of a million dollars rollin'?
Bein' drivin' like it's stolen, by a stoned stoner
One of the originals who showed you fools how to turn the internet rhymes into residuals
I put away a whole lot of loot and stayed true, that's what we do
Make it easy to choose, so guess what?
You wonderin' why she gettin' all dressed up
You in the house, messed up, all stressed, for what?
Hustle is the only thing gon' keep your lights on, fuck love

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Money is the mission, it's skrilla over bitches
Standin' in the way, then fuck him and whoever with him
Pull up on her and she make a decision to get in
Yeah, your girl hella talkative 'round rich niggas
Room full of hittas and you squares can't get in
Movin' through the air, eatin' shrimp in the Gulf Stream
She in the mirror for hours, hopin' that she get seen
With us, your girl hella talkative 'round rich niggas, yeah

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh
Like when Ricky Bobby's dad said "You first or you last"
I got all intentions on getting this cash
Rolling joints up with laser precision
I got major decisions to make
Whether to get the Maybach or just chill
My niggas is real in the feel
Blow so much marijuana smoke the smell's still in the ceiling
Owner said the club closed but we still in the building
Pullin' foreigns outside and stuffin' women up in 'em
Got a hundred grand stuffed in these expensive ass denim
Might hit the the racetrack and spend it, and come back with millions
She half Sicilian, her family don't even like blacks
I'm ashing my joint, say her dad gon' kill her
Let me borrow the Lambo and the path familiar
Got every game on Xbox
Don't need to get dressed, when I come over it's sweats and socks
Them other niggas say they like the Taylors, just stop

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Cop a new pad, and smoke one for the life that we never had (Never had)
Cop a new whip, and smoke one for the shit we could never get (Never get)
Cop a new chain, and smoke one for the time we wanted better days (Better days)
Gettin' dollars makes sense, me and my dog worked hard
So we don't mind spendin' just a little bit (Little bit)

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Actin' like a nigga that ain't ever had
Pull up in a foreign with the paper tag
This a Rolls Royce bitch, not a Jag
Keep a closet full of unpopped tags
Niggas bring that bullshit, they get zapped
Never chasin' bitches, I be gettin' cash
My roof in the trunk, joint full of skunk
My speakers blast like they from 12 gauge pump
Nigga your crew on the stump, ain't got a bag in months
Nigga my crew on the hunt, get everything we want
We was wilin' when we was young , Taylor Gang or get jumped
Jet Life, all you is a chump, knew we was the ones
To change the game and that's exactly what we done
New Orleans where I'm from, in Amsterdam catchin' stunts
New Orleans where I'm from, in Japan rollin' up
New Orleans where I'm from, motherfucker like what

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Cop a new pad, and smoke one for the life that we never had (Never had)
Cop a new whip, and smoke one for the shit we could never get (Never get)
Cop a new chain, and smoke one for the time we wanted better days (Better days)
Gettin' dollars makes sense, me and my dog worked hard
So we don't mind spendin' just a little bit (Little bit)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
Gotta have a plot to get it
This life, it costs a lot to live it
So you gotta watch the competition
Stay on point, make executive decisions
Never switch when the rest of 'em different
That money put us in the best of positions
Always maintain leverage, keep ice in the beverage
Go car shopping 'stead of clothes
You like it you get it
My closet filled with all types of shit
It's bad you'd probably work your whole life for this and I'll get it in one night
Win some lose some, my car ill as they come
And I'm 'bout to build another one soon as I'm done
I'm putting it right on the street
You know what's going down when Taylor Life (East side)
Jet Gang hook up with Monsta Beatz

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Audio dope supply the needs
Fiends itching, sniffing for new audio feeds
This how it outta be
More often, too stoned highed up bosses with good intentions to see each other winning
Taking no shorts or losses but I know that we a rarity
Something they'll never see
'Til our sons click up and commence to hustling heavily
Sacrifices made, now we sitting in them better seats
And I ain't even watching the game
I just came to floss this outfit, now I'm on national TV
Sitting court side playing my Nintendo Switch
With a Nike headband fresh from 1996
Kicks sick, collection quarantined
Deadstock 23's or some bathing apes I'm sure you haven't seen
Every verse is like a key
Could turn you to a boss if you don't know D (OG)
Drunk on power, gold bathroom fixtures and marble showers
2009 'til the end of time, its all ours

[Outro: Curren$y]
Keep the E in it
Chevy gon' switch
Nigga, we smoking weed in it
Laughing in our pictures
And I wouldn't talk about it
If nigga didn't live it
If you need to see it then you come visit
Or you can ask one of your bitches
If she bad, she probably kick it
Taylor Gang and Jet Living

[Intro: Curren$y]
DJ Fresh, DJ Fresh, DJ Fresh
A lot of motherfuckers be in the studio stressed 'cause they lyin'
It's tough to make up lies, nigga, this our life
East Side on mine
Just like every time
L, L
Interior like white wine
We don't wear jeans in here

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Slidin' in my sweats, these was fifteen hundred, you ain't got fifteen dollars
In the club takin' pictures with bottles, not even poppin' 'em
Handin' 'em back to your big dawgs and now you just watchin' 'em
This that fly doctrine, me and my Pittsburgh partner, Slim

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, can't hang if you don't swang
My gang do anything, I came to bring the pain
My strain is self-explained, you lame
And can't get it off of you yet
I toss up the set, bosses only, come correct
Horses in my bet
Porsches growlin' loud, big money portions
You made it off the porch, I let nature run its course
Play the game hard as a sport, we up and down the court
In the field, shit is real, houses in the hill
Hundred dollar bills fallin' out the sky, keep the liquor chill
Chrome grills, insides clean, that's just how we live
Quick to make the paper appear
Got your chick puttin' up silverware
Keepin' that weed smoke up in the air

[Chorus: Curren$y]
These sweats was fifteen hundred, you ain't got fifteen dollars
In the club takin' pictures with bottles and never poppin' 'em
Handin' 'em back to your big dawg, now you just watchin' 'em
This that fly doctrine, me and my Pittsburgh partner, Slim

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
And you can tell which car's mine
Cabriolet and Italian design, interior white wine
I don't wear jeans in here, I'm slidin' in my sweats
These was fifteen hundred, nigga, you ain't got fifteen dollars
In the club takin' pictures with bottles, not even poppin'
Handin' 'em back to your big dawg, now you just sittin', watchin'
This that fly doctrine
Take pictures like my Compton uncles, now they think I gang bang
Fool, I just be low ridin'
Everywhere I go, for sure, I bring that East Side in
Always outside ridin' while them other crews hidin'
Got magenta tinted diamonds, my Rolex windin'
First class seat reclinin', whack ass rapper feature declinin', I am

[Chorus: Curren$y]
These sweats was fifteen hundred, you ain't got fifteen dollars
In the club takin' pictures with bottles, not even poppin'
Handin' 'em back to your big dawg, now you sittin', watchin'
This that fly doctrine, Andretti and my Pittsburgh partner, Slim

[Outro: Curren$y]
Yeah, that's them
They gon' let us in
Got KK and Andretti in these joints
These motherfuckin' joints is like
We smokin' like three hundred dollar joints basically at this point
I don't know if you ever had a three hundred dollar joint
You hangin' 'round the wrong folks

[Intro: Curren$y]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
East side all mine, just like every time
(La musica de Harry Fraud)
Ah, ah, ah
Jet Life, Jet Life, Jet Life (Yeah, yeah)
Jet Life, Jet Life, nigga, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Jet Life, Jet Life, Jet Life (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Jet Life, Jet Life, nigga, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Uh

[Chorus: Curren$y]
If the shit fall, who could I call?
Nobody, fool, all I got is myself, dawg
So I hustle hard, a hunnid stacks in the vault
Just a lil' bounce back, make sure that we forever ball
If the shit fall, who could I call?
Nobody, fool, all I got is myself, dawg
That's why I hustle hard, a hunnid stacks in the vault
Just a lil' bounce back, make sure that we forever ball

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Yeah, youngins on handlebars, totin' sawed-offs
Just when you thought you'd seen it all
These niggas turn into Transformers when this green involved
Thinkin' that's your nigga, that's the one who plottin' to kill you
Street shit, I'm quite familiar, I was raised by dealers
Life stealers, who quite realer than them old niggas
In the background of your pictures, ho nigga
Your daddy was scared of the goons who used to drop me off at school
People ain't know the kinda shit I was off into
Silent rider, destined for dollars
Musical scholar, pennin' his own products, straight narcotics
Watch me turn this beat into a foreign with a spoiler on it

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Shit fall, who could I call?
Nobody, fool, all I got is myself, dawg
So I hustle hard, a hunnid stacks in the vault
Just a lil' bounce back, make sure that we forever ball
If the shit fall, who could I call?
Nobody, fool, all I got is myself, dawg
That's why I hustle hard, a hunnid stacks in the vault
Just a lil' bounce back, make sure that we forever ball

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, yeah
Ball forever, pocket full of mozzarella
I remember when the owner didn't let us
Now we pull our car up where our jet is
All you see is letters, T.G.O.D., we ain't dyin' never
We in the sky forever, stay applyin' pressure
Pack my bags for any weather
Boy, you broke and need to get your shit together
Silence any competition
Got the crib that I dreamed of and not to mention
Bathtub like a swimmin' pool, smokin' out and trippin'
Always handle business
Always left hella game on the table for anyone to witness
Trips to Vegas, we don't need a ticket
Blow presidential smoke and our drinks are expensive
Our wins are extensive
Penthouse, wonderful view, I live how a prince live
But back when we started, wasn't a way to predict this
Stuck to the script, made our own movie
Got a vid, it's comin' real soon, fool, you gotta see it

[Chorus: Curren$y & Wiz Khalifa]
If the shit fall, who could I call? (Yeah, yeah)
Nobody, fool, all I got is myself, dawg (Jets gang, Taylor life)
So I hustle hard, a hunnid stacks in the vault
Just a lil' bounce back, make sure that we forever ball
If the shit fall, who could I call?
Nobody, fool, all I got is myself, dawg
That's why I hustle hard, a hunnid stacks in the vault
Just a lil' bounce back, make sure that we forever ball, yeah

[Verse 1]
You're magnified in light
I watch you wade inside
I'll memorize the way the lake looks and your hands look in it
I could trace a line
Around your shoulders and spine
I fantasize, I wish you knew what I was thinking

[Chorus]
I wish that you would hold me
Without grace and ungently
I wish you'd wrap me up tight
I wish you'd hold me inside
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
I could watch you dive
For the rest of my life
I see you like a photograph or a hologram
When you cannonball and it
Splashes and the light
Catches, outstretched on the wet
Grass, it's obvious I want you bad

[Chorus]
I wish that you would hold me
Without grace and ungently
I wish you'd wrap me up tight
I wish you'd hold me inside
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
I had doubts when you coaxed me out
I can't swim so I float on my back
I watch you butterfly from the corner of my eye
I did not know you were so
Good, I wish you could teach me
I hold my breath to touch the bottom of
The lake, I swear I'd stay, I'd stay
I'd stay forever if you asked me to

[Chorus]
But I wish that you could hold me
Without grace and ungently
I wish you'd wrap me up, tight
I wish you'd hold me inside
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Close to you, close to you, close to you

[Verse 1]
Marble in a foyer
I've been lovin' on you all day
Would've stayed if you told me to stay
As you can see, I stayed anyway
I'm just not like these other girls, I swear
I just have to love you
I just wanna need you if that's okay
And you're just not like these other men out here
No, no
You just wanna hold me, and that's okay
Can I be a woman for you, baby
In a time when it's not allowed?
How am I supposed to pretend
That I don't want you the way I do? (Oh, yeah)
'Cause every time you're around me
I feel virgin all over again
And every time you're all around me
How can I renege? Boy, I just need your hand

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it okay that I'm not independent?
Is it okay that I...
Is it okay that I show weakness?
Is it okay that I...
Is it okay that I can't wait to see you?
Is it okay that I...
Is it okay to love a man right now?

[Chorus]
If you understand
Then show me your hands (Ooh, ooh)
Show me your hands
Boy, if you understand
Somebody raise a man (Ooh, ooh)
Raise a man

[Verse 2]
I've never been treated a way I didn't wanna be treated
It's hard to explain, I know it's hard to believe
I want what's comin' to me
Perfection, protection, please love
With me all night long (Oh)
Makin' love to our favorite song
Your love teaches me how to love
So deep, baby, it's so sweet
Can't wait to pass you down
To the face that resembles you and me

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it okay that I'm not independent?
Is it okay that I...
Is it okay that I show weakness?
Is it okay that I...
Is it okay that I can't wait to see you?
Is it okay that I...
Is it okay to love a man right now?

[Chorus]
If you understand
Then show me your hands (Ooh, ooh)
Show me your hands
Boy, if you understand
Somebody raise a man (Ooh, ooh)
Raise a man

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Every day and every night I pray for one accord
I adore you even more
And every minute that passes me by
We can't afford for us to be ignored
Say we need each other more than we know (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Somebody made a man
To show me how to raise a man (Ooh, ooh)
Raise a man
You can't be a man
If we don't raise a man (Ooh, ooh)
Raise a man
If you want a man
Then you gotta raise a man (Ooh, ooh)
Raise a man
If you understand
Then show me your hands (Ooh, ooh)
Show me your hands
Loose Lucy is my delight

Shadow in the alley turned out all my lights

We're gonna take a short break, we'll be right back

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin there for?
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
Get up, get on, get out of the door
All you got, why you wanna give more?

[?]

[?]
Dragon with matches lettin' loose on the town
A whole pail of water just to cool him down

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Fire on the mountain, it's turnin' around
Never gets up, and, never come down
Wrong way runner, one foot on the door
Caught in slow motion in a fall to the floor
Maybe he's speaking for the 

[?] once more
Maybe he's loaded and dying too poor
The more that he gives, the more it would take
The thin line beyond you really can't fake

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]

[?]
...in a cowboy suit
Getting much harder to please that crowd
When the music is quiet but they're getting that loud
Put it down heavy, sip it down lean
'Bout to lay it down dirty, but play it back clean

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Intro]
Some very good friends of yours and ours: The Grateful Dead

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' home
Oh now, get back truckin' home
Well now, get back truckin' home
Wow, get back truckin' home
Wow, get back truckin' home
Oh now, get back truckin' home
Wow, get back truckin' home
Get on

[Instrumental Break]

Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
Get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' home
Oh now, get back truckin' home
Well now, get back truckin' home
Wow, get back truckin' home
Wow, get back truckin' home
Oh now, get back truckin' home
Wow, get back truckin' home

[Instrumental Break]

Thank y'all

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running, running
I wonder if you care?
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green, green
I went down under the sea
Try to see what's going down
Try to read between the lines
Had a feeling I was falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice a-calling, calling
You was running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
Ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
But not a drop on me, not on me
Test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Lord, until the sun goes down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

[Chorus]
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
If it hurts you, my darling, you only got yourself to blame

[Verse 1]
Well, it's a true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Well, it's a true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Like the good book says, you gotta just reap what you sow

[Bridge]
Well, you lied, cheated, whoa-oh, for so long
Well, you lied, cheated, whoa-oh, for so long
You were wrong to do it, woman, and another queen is on your throne

[Instrumental Break]

[Harmonica solo]

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Well, you lied, cheated, whoa-oh, for so long
Well, you lied, cheated, whoa-oh, for so long
You were wrong to do it, woman, and another queen is on your throne

[Chorus]
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
If it hurts you, my darling, you only got your sweet self to blame

[Verse 1]
Maybe you'd like to give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat
And maybe you'd go away and never call
But a taste of honey is worse than none at all

[Chorus]
In that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Well, if you feel like loving me
And you've got the notion
I second that emotion
Well, if you feel like loving me
And you've got the notion
I second that emotion

[Verse 2]
Maybe you think that love would tie you down
You ain't got the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love was made for fools
So it makes you wise to break the rules

[Chorus]
Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Well, if you feel like loving me
And you've got the notion
I second that emotion
Well, if you feel like loving me
And you've got the notion
I second that emotion

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
In that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Well, if you feel like loving me
And you've got the notion
I second that emotion
Well, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is just a little too hard
I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
I'm gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bags
I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Hey, I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
Listen, I'll be waiting at the station, Lord, when that train pulls on by
And I'm going back where I belong
And I'm going north to my same old used-to-be
Well, now, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
Old coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, that coal mine (Coal mine)
That coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Hey, that's where I think I belong
Hey, got a sweet woman, Lord, yeah, who's waiting there for me
Hey, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
I said a happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
Oh, happy home (Happy home)
Hey, a happy, yes, a happy, happy, happy home (Happy home)
Hey, hey, hey hey (Happy home)
That's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Verse 1]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Refrain]
Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

[Verse 2]
You hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

[Refrain]
Laugh in the sunshine
Sing and cry through the dark
Fly through the night

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep in the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la
La, la...

All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

[Refrain]
Laugh in the sunshine
Sing and cry through the night
Fly in the dark

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep in the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la
La, la...

All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be in some dark hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Than to be in some big city, in a small room, with a girl on my mind

[Chorus]
So blow your whistle freight train
Take me far on down the track
I'm going away, I'm leaving today
I'm going but I ain't coming back

[Verse 2]
I'd rather be in some dark hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Than to be home alone knowing that you're gone
Would cause me to lose my mind

[Chorus]
So blow your whistle freight train
Take me far on down the track
I'm going away, I'm leaving today
I'm going, but I ain't coming back

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
So blow your whistle freight train
Take me far on down the track
I'm going away, I'm leaving today
I'm going, but I ain't coming back
And I'm going away, I'm leaving today
I'm going, but I ain't coming back

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, West Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about half way
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the bar room, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
Soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be

[Verse 5]
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, oh damn he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
And we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Verse 6]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Verse 1]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to the mine

[Verse 2]
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'til four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

[Verse 3]
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

[Outro]
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues, he can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling so bad
Asked my family doctor about what I had
I say, "Doctor, Doctor, Mister M.D., (Doctor)
Can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me?" (Doctor)

[Chorus]
And he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yes he did)
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All I need, all I need: good lovin’
What I need (Little good lovin')
Early in the morning, baby (Little good lovin')
Late in the evening one more time (Little good lovin’)

[Verse 2]
Come on, baby, squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy just to be alright?
I said baby, baby, that's for sure (Baby, yeah)
I've got the fever (Baby, yeah), you got the cure (Baby, yeah)

[Chorus]
And she said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yes she did)
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All I need, all I need, ow (Good lovin')
What I need (Little good lovin')
Early in the morning, baby (Little good lovin')
Late in the evening one more time again (Little good lovin')

[Instrumental]

[Interlude]
Just a little more love is all I need
Early in the morning, in the evening, in the afternoon
Just more as the day is long, yeah
I need a little love, Lordy
Ain't no warning way to tell me no, and you know I won't
Ain't no business of turnin' out
Ain't no ways to cut it loose
Ain't no way to get around it
I gotta sigh, every time you don't wanna give me your love
When you got it, when you want it and you need it, that's all you got to do
Sometimes, I wanna little love
Sometimes, a little affection
All I said, settle in my relation
All I need, all I need, a little bit of love in the morning and the afternoon
A little bit of love in the morning and the afternoon
A little bit of love in the morning and the afternoon now child
That's all your daddy needs, a dime and just a little bit of time
I got to have some of your love, I got to have some of your love
And that be a question sometime, let me ask a question, mama
How do you do? Baby, how do you do? Baby, how do you do?
Baby, how do you do now now? Baby, how do you do?
I want them seats all night long, make herself a little bit of money
When you get back home, you gotta expect some little honey
And if I don't get none, I just get a little bit nasty, yes I do
Know I do, know I do...in the evening time
Never get her next until about a quarter to nine in the morning when the day is old
Something I got to have, Lord, I got have it in the morning
Yes, I just need a bit of good ol' love
I'm gon' walk on down the street, yes I can
Walking down the street one day, I done seen my partner
I said, "Hey, man, how you doin'?" I said, "I'm just doing fine on a corner"
He said, "Guess what, man? I'm a businessman now"
I said, "What? You a businessman? What kinda business y'all in?"
He said, "Well, you name it and I got it."
I said, "Do you sell used cars?" He said, "Well, not too used."
I said, "Do you sell dope?" He said, "What you want?"
I said, "Are you a refrigerator repair service man?"
He said, "Well, you got a refrigerator?" I said, "No, I was just asking."
He said, "Whatever you want it's what you get"
Told me, told me anything you want, you can have it
I said, "Well, listen, man, I'm kinda lonesome."
He said, "Is that all?" I said, "Well, you know, things are getting kinda tight
Me and my old lady had a falling out, you understand. Getting kinda lonely."
He said, "Well, listen, how much bread y'all got?" I said, "Well, about a dollar a quarter"
He said, "Brother, dollar and a quarter? Well, maybe, I don't know, maybe I could fix you up with something."
I said, "Anything is good, man, anything that's wet and wiggles, I'll take it."
So he said, "Alright, man, listen, look down on the corner, see that girl"
I said, "Who?" He said, "See that girl down on the corner."
I said, "That's a girl? Look more like a Jersey cow."
He said, "Well, you ain't got more than a dollar and a quarter, what do you want?"
So I went down on the corner, all I could give her, and things was getting pretty good...
Like I was saying, everything was getting pretty good now
She might not be too good looking, but she sure had good old cooking
Kept on cooking in the morning for a long while
So I ask her, please mama, one more time, ask her, please mama, just one more time
I said now jump on your wagon and ride now, let me jump on your wagon and ride
Let me jump on your wagon and ride now, let me jump on your wagon and ride
Let me jump, let me jump, let me jump now baby
Let me jump on your wagon and ride on
Let me jump, jump, jump on your wagon and ride little mama
Let me jump, jump, jump on your wagon and ride now
Tell you what I was doing, the reason I was down on the street that day
Me and my other old lady had a falling out
And I knew that I needed something, couldn't get along without it
Went down and got me some riding and it ain't no doubt about it

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I was feeling so bad
Asked my family doctor about what I had
I say, "Doctor, Doctor, Mister M.D., (Doctor)
Can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me?" (Doctor)

[Chorus]
And he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yes he did)
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All I need, all I need: good lovin'
What I need, yeah (Little good lovin')
Early in the morning, baby (Little good lovin')
Late in the evening one more time (Little good lovin')

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you, come on baby, squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy just to be alright?
Baby, baby, that's for sure (Baby, yeah)
I've got the fever (Baby, yeah), you got the cure (Baby, yeah)

[Chorus]
And she said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yes she did)
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All I need, all I need, ow (Good lovin')
What I need (Little good lovin')
Early in the morning, baby (Little good lovin')
Late in the evening one more time (Little good lovin')
Give it to me

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, meet you in the tall trees Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose, rolling over sweetly
Ride out singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
My sunshine daydream, my sunshine daydream, my sunshine daydream
My sweet summer daydream, my golden daydream
Loving daydream, way out
We went over sunshine daydream, way out
Daydream, way out, sunshine daydream

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moanin' low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

[Verse 2]
All that I am asking for is one gold dollar
I'd pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country, Sweet Suzie
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 3]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moanin' low
But I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gotta get up in the morning and go

[Verse 4]
Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
And I got no chance of losin' this time
But I got no chance of losin' this time
Well, I got no chance of losin' this time

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I got no chance of losin' this time
I got no chance of losin' this time
But I got no chance of losin' this time

[Verse 1]
Mama got the rub board, sister got the tub
They're going around doing the rub-de-rub

[Chorus]
Ain’t it crazy? Ain't it crazy?
Ain't it crazy one day, to keep on rubbin’ that thang

[Verse 2]
Two old maids, they was layin' in a bed
One turned over and this is what she said

[Chorus]
Ain't it crazy? Ain't it crazy?
Ain't it crazy one day, to keep on rubbin' that thang

[Verse 3]
Mama killed a chicken and thought it was a duck
Put him on the table with his feet sticking up

Ain't it crazy? Ain't it crazy?
Ain’t it crazy one day, to keep on rubbin’ that thang

[Instrumental Break]

[Harmonica solo]

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 4]
There was two old maids, layin' in the sand
Each one wishing that the other was a man

[Chorus]
Ain’t it crazy? Ain't it crazy?
Ain't it crazy one day, to keep on rubbin' at that thang

[Verse 5]
Mama got the rub board, sister got the tub

You know it got to be crazy; ain't it crazy?
Ain't it crazy one day, to keep on rubbin' that thang

[Instrumental Break]

Mama killed a chicken and thought it was a duck
And she laid him on the table with his feet sticking up

Two old maids, they was layin' in the bed

[Outro]
Could I have a, could I have a follow spot, please? (Hit that man) (Hit that man with a spot, hit it, blap, hit me, spot.) There you are, there you are. This man just presented me with this, uh (Pussy willow) pussy willow. (Far out.) And we're gonna respond in kind by doing our most requested number

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Bridge]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 2]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Bridge]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 3]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Bridge]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 4]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Bridge]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 5]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina
Goodbye

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I'm a king bee buzzing around your hive
I'm a king bee, darling, buzzing around your hive
I can make honey baby if you let me fly up inside
I'm young and able to buzz all night long
I'm young and able, Lord, to buzz all night long
All night long, all night long
Together we can make some honey
Like the world ain't never known

[Instrumental Break]

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 2]
I'm a king bee, want you to be my Queen
I'm a king bee rider, won't you wanna be my Queen
Together now we can make some honey
That the world ain't never seen
Drove your car in my driveway
Cut your bright lights way down low
Pull your car in my driveway
Cut your bright lights way down low
I'm gonna wind up your transmission
'Til your motor won't run no more

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music?
Would you hold it near as it were your own?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air

[Chorus]
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

[Verse 2]
Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty
If your cup is full, may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men

[Pre-Chorus]
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone

[Chorus]
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

[Verse 3]
You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand, then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home

[Outro]
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby flagged a diesel down, just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time, Bobby clapping hands
We sang every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain’t worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside me, Lord, in everything I done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Looking for that home I hope she finds
And I’d trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding Bobby's body close to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing was all she left for me
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Bridge]
Lelela, lelelala, lelela, lelela, laleleha, laleleha, lalala
Leleleheee, lalala, leleleheee, lalala, leleleha, leleleha
Lala, lala, lala

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Verse 1]
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friends
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Won't you come with me
Won't you come with me
Whoa-ho what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he knows
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Verse 1]
Without a warning you broke my heart
Taking it baby, tore it apart
And you left me standing in the dark cryin'
Said your love for me was dyin’
So come on baby, baby please
I'm begging you, baby, and I'm on my knees

[Chorus]
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your lovelight, let it shine on me
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I get a little lonely in the middle of
The night
I need you darling to make things all right
Come on baby, baby please
I’m begging you, baby, and I'm on my knees

[Chorus]
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your lovelight, let it shine on me
Let it shine, let it shine, let it...

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Without a warning, you broke my heart
Taken it baby, torn it apart
And you left me standing in the dark cryin'
Said your love for me was dyin'
Come on baby, baby please
Begging you, baby, and I'm on my knees

[Chorus]
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your lovelight, let it shine on me
Let it shine, let it shine, let it...

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
I get a little lonely in the middle of the night
I need you, darling, to make things all right
Come on, baby (Come on baby)
Baby, please (Baby, please)
Begging you, baby (Begging you, baby)
And I'm on my knees (On my knees)

[Chorus]
Turn on your light (Turn on your light)
Let it shine on me (Let it shine on me)
Turn on your lovelight (Turn on your lovelight)
Let it shine on me (Let it shine on me)

[Outro]
Let it shine (Let it shine on me)
Let it shine on me (Let it shine on me)
Let it shine on me (Let it shine on me)
Let it shine
All I need, all I need
Show me your love, show me your love
Early in the morning, show me your love
Late in the evening, it's a little bit more of your lovin' too
I guess I got to keep you satisfied
My, my, my baby feels so good
My, my, my, my baby feels so fine, didn’t want it some time
When I need it, when I got to have it, really want it, baby, feels good
Goddamn
Early in the mornin’, just before, before the day is dawnin'
I just might get a little bit hungry
I just might get a little bit of a taste for my baby
That’s what I want, that's what I want
When she wake up, when she wake up
It makes me feel so nice, I know she do

[Instrumental Break]

I wanna tell you a private baby thing
Just one thing I'm gonna tell you
Want a reason to make me feel so good
Want a reason to make me feel so fine
And I'm not gonna tell y’all
I just tell ya one little thing, one little thing
Make me feel so nice, make me feel so nice and kind
'Cause she's got box-back nitties, great big enormous thighs
Working undercover with  a boar hog eye
She gotta leave my bed, with everything I saw
Hey, I can't not talk, I just can't let her go, no way
Can't let her go, can't let her go, can't let her go

[Instrumental Break]

I wanna ask everybody now, I wanna ask everybody
All you fellas, all you fellas standing around
What you doin' with your hands right now?
You have them in your pockets?
Does anybody have their hands in their pockets?
Alright, everybody raise your hands so I can see that ain't nobody got their hands in the pockets
If I find somebody who do, you in trouble because I know you're playing pocket pool
I'll tell you what now, you keep your hands outta your pockets, fellas
And I'll tell you what you do with 'em
As you might find some little lady standing next to ya
All you got to reach over and say, "What's your name?" That's all you got to do
If you want a little company this evening, don't stand around going like this, man
Ask some young lady, do she wanna do it for you
Is anybody 'round right down here, man?
Anybody down here got a little young lady on their mind that's right around them?
Anybody standing down here got a little young girl they'd like to take home this evening?
Come on, raise your hand, somebody must see somebody
Alright, how would you like to go home with that chick?
Right? All you got to do is walk over and say, "Hello, lady"
Go on, go on -- Just walk over, say, "What's your name?"
You pick out any one you want -- tell her Pigpen said it was okay
Go get one -- come on, you got to catch one
You got one? You caught one? Alright, what's your name?
Chris and Marsha have just made it!
Now, see everybody oughta do that, man
All you fellas, just walk over to some girl that you would like to get in bed with and say, "Hello"
And tell them Pigpen said it was okay
And if her mother wants to complain, tell her to write to the Congressman
Ain't none of my business, I'm just making suggestions
I suggest you play your guitar

[Instrumental Break]

How you two doin'?

[Instrumental Break]

I know...you may be kinda lonesome
Someone will come over to your house sometime
Ooh, but I tell you now, I ain't got no problem
I got my old lady, she's a good old girl
And if I get lonesome, all I got to do
I looks over my left shoulder...I say, "Turn on over"
You know she do, you know she do
And one old thing, one old thing she got
One old thing I know that she got
That sweet little thing she got...
Lay it on me like a thirsty queen
When it feels so good I can't stand no more
Ooh, my my
After everything you're pretty good
And after everything begin to get better...
It's one last thing, ask my baby to please turn on your light

[Instrumental]

We're gonna take a short break, short break, and we'll be back later

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed Cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river
Crying Leonardo words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinese

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through that cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
You said you was hurting
Almost lost your mind
'Cause the man you love
He hurt you all the time

[Chorus]
But when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 2]
You love him a little more
But you ought to love him less
Why pick up behind him
And take his best?

[Chorus]
'Cause when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 3]
You love another man
Girl, you know that I love you
But you love him, my darling
You stick to him just about, just about like glue

[Chorus]
But when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Instrumental Break]

[Harmonica solo]

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 4]
He better leave you
Or you better put him down
'Cause I just can't stand to see
See you pushed around

[Chorus]
'Cause when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
The warden led the prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before they reached my cell
"Let my guitar playin' friend sing my request"

[Chorus]
Sing me back home a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Sing me away, and turn back the years
Sing me home before I die

[Verse 2]
I recall last Sunday morning when the choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers, "There's a song my momma sang
Could I hear it once before you travel on?"

[Chorus]
Sing me back home a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Sing me away and turn back the years
Won't you sing me back home before I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
The warden led the prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before they reached my cell
"Let my guitar playin' friend sing my request"

[Chorus]
Let him sing me back home a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Sing me away, and turn back the years
Let him sing me back home before I die
Sing me back home before I die

[Verse 1]
Baby, here I am and I'm a man upon the scene
I can give you what you want, but you got to come home with me
And I’ve got a whole lot of good ol' lovin' and I got some in store
When I get through throwing it on you, you got to come back for more

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain’t nothing but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm so hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Verse 2]
An action speaks louder than words and I'm a man with great experience
I know you got you another man, but I can love you better than him
Take my hand and don't be afraid, I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free, so won’t you place your ad with me

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain’t nothin' but drugstore lovin’
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm so hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Bridge]
Give it to me, I got to have it, some of your love
And it's all I need, early in the morning, late in the afternoon and evening
And sometime too in the midnight hour I need your love
And I’m a big ole man and I can't stand it that a woman I need don't wanna give it to me
I just get a little bit hard to handle, I gotta get it some way
I just get a little bit hard to handle, I gotta get it some way
My, my, I just got to get it, you better give it to me
You better give it to me, baby
You know I'm gonna take it anyhow
Give it to me, baby, you know I'm gonna take it 'cause I had about any old heart
I got to get it, when I want it, 'cause I need it, 'cause I love it every minute
Baby, your love is what I need, hot thang, blowin' my mind, ooh...

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Baby, here I am and I'm a man upon the scene
I can give you what you want but you got to come home with me
And I've got a whole lot of good ol' lovin' and I got some in store
When I get through throwing it on you, you got to come back for more

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, I am

[Outro]
Thank you

We got a former member of The Grateful Dead hanging out here in New York
Tom Constanten's gonna join us on this next tune

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light
Into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose
From the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the
Clouds of delusion

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Mirror shatters
In formless reflections
Of matter
Glass hand dissolving
To ice petal flowers
Revolving
Lady in velvet
Recedes
In the nights of goodbye

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

[Outro]
Fortune comes a-crawling, Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna to be
You're gonna to give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad

Not fade away, not fade away

Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can’t walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning

[Verse 3]
Where have all the people gone, my honey

There’s no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Verse 1]
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
My number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
If you're ever in Memphis
You best stop down Minglewood
If you're ever in Memphis

Take a walk downtown there
Where all the women sure look good

Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
Everyone said, I'd come to no good, I knew I would pearly, believe them
Half of my life, I spent doing time for some other fucker’s crime
The other half found me stumbling 'round drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet someday
Good Lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I’m living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 3]
Pearly's been true, true to me, true to my dying day he said
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been, I’m sure she’s been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she’s been true to you"

[Verse 4]
Got up and wandered, wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl, named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I’m sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Sleepy alligator in the noonday sun
Playing by the river just like he usually done
Call for his whisky
He can call for his tea
Call all he want to now but he
Can't call me

[Chorus]
Oh no, oh no
I been there before
Ain't coming back around
There no more

[Bridge]
Hung up waiting for a windy day
Hung up waiting for a windy day

[Verse 2]
Creepy alligator coming all around the bend
Talking 'bout the times when we was mutual friends, oh no
I check my memory now
I check it quick, oh yes I will
I check it running
Some old kind of trick, my my

[Chorus]
Oh no well I
Been there before
And I ain't a coming back around
Here no more, oh no

[Verse 3]
Riding down the river in an old canoe
A bunch of bugs and an old tennis shoe
Out of the river all ugly and green
Came the biggest old alligator that I've ever seen
Teeth big and pointed and his eyes were bugging out
Contact the union, put the beggars to route
Just out of prison on six dollars bail
Mumbling at bitches and wagging his tail

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, yeah
I don't want to be treated this a-way

Combing back her yellow hair
And I ain't gonna be treated this way

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
A quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
A quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Switch-man sleeping
Train a hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you?
Can't you hear me crying?
Oh Lord, that's all I wanna do

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 3]
And I'm gonna buy me an airplane, fly all over your town
Tell everybody baby, what you puttin' down
Come on now pretty baby, I just can't, I just can't help myself
You know I need you, darling, I don't need nobody else

[Chorus]
Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you?
Can't you hear me crying?
Oh Lord, that's all I wanna do

[Bridge]
Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you?
Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you?
Tell your mama and your papa, I'm a schoolboy too
Tell your mother and your papa, baby, I'm a schoolboy too
'Cause I wanna be your chauffeur, ride around with your machine
I wanna be your chauffeur, I wanna ride with your little machine
That's all I wanna do, that's all I wanna do
Hey, and I just can't help myself, I can't help myself

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
And I'm gonna buy me an airplane, fly all over your town

You're so young and pretty, I don't need nobody else

[Chorus]
Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you?

Oh Lord, that's all I wanna do
Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you?
Good morning little schoolgirl, can I come home with you?
I wanna, I wanna be your chauffeur, ride with your little machine
And I wanna be your chauffeur, ride with your sweet little machine
Tell your mother, and your papa too
Go on, tell your mother, hey, and your papa too
I ain't gonna hurt you, darling, I'm a schoolboy too
Little girl, 'cause I don't care, oh no, I don't
I know I don't, I just wanna keep your company...come on up in here
Uh-huh, all I wanna do, what you say, no no no
I just gotta come home with you, darling, yeah, come home with you
Any old kinda way, any way
Hey, and you're looking so good, I can't get you out of my mind
Well, you're looking so good now, darling
I can't get you out of my mind all the time
No, I can't, no I...
No I...no I can't

[Instrumental]

That's all I wanna do, is come on home with you
That's all that I wanna do, darling, is come on home with you
Well, you're looking so good, I can't get you out of my mind
Oh no, I can't, well, you're looking so good, I can't get you out of my mind
'Cause you know that I don't care, 'cause you know that I don't care
Girl, I don't care what your daddy may say
I gotta come home with you any old kinda way
Little girl, I don't care
Hey, I don't care if you're only 17 years of age

Thank you, thank you

[Verse 1]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the clouds of delusion

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Mirror shatters
In formless reflections of matter
Glass hand dissolving
To ice petal flowers revolving
Lady in velvet
Recedes in the nights of goodbye

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Darkness splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long he’s got to calling it home

[Outro]
Fortune comes a-crawling, Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

High green chilly winds and windy vines
In loops around the twining shafts of lavender
They're crawling to the sun
Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and
Droop so hungry 'neath the sky
Underfoot the ground is patched
With climbing arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita
Stark and shiny in the breeze

William Tell has stretched his bow ’til it won't stretch no furthermore
When he will release it, where did the apple roll

[Verse]
High green chilly winds and windy vines
In loops around the twisted shafts of lavender
They're crawling to the sun
Underfoot the ground is patched
With arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita
Stark and shiny in the breeze
Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and
Droop so hungry neath the sky
William tell has stretched his bow till it won't stretch
No furthermore and/or it may require a change that hasn't come before

No more time to tell how, this is the season of what
Now is the time of returning with our thought
Jewels polished and gleaming
(Six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow)
Now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein
(Five men writing with fingers of gold)
Now is the test of the boomerang tossed in the night of redeeming
(Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Death don't have no mercy in this land
Death don't have no mercy in this land, in this land
Come to your house, you know he don't take long
You look in the bed this morning, children find your mother gone

[Chorus]
I said death don't have no mercy in this land
Death will leave you standing and crying in this land
Death will leave you standing and crying in this land, in this land

[Verse 2]
Come to your house, you know he don't take long
You look in the bed, find that your brothers and sisters are gone
I said death don't, death don't have no mercy in this land, in this land

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Death will go in any family in this land, in this land
Death will go in any family in this land, in this land
Come to your house, it don't take long
You look in the bed this morning, find your father's gone

[Chorus]
I said death don't, death don't have no mercy in this land
It don't vacation in this land
Death don't take no vacation in this land, in this land, hey
Come to your house, it don't take long
You look in the bed this morning, find your whole family long been gone
Death don't have no mercy in this land

[Cryptical Envelopment/Quodlibet For Tender Feet]

[Verse]
The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated, "He has to die"
And ll the children learnin', from books that they were burnin'
Every leaf was turnin'; to watch him die

The summer sun looked down on him, his mother could but frown on him
And all the others sound on him, but it doesn't seem to matter

And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended, he had to die

[Instrumental Break]

[The Faster We Go, the Rounder We Get a.k.a. The Other One]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady comes to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Comin', comin', comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' (Comin'), comin' (Comin'), comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Skippin' through the lily fields I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in it's place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never Ever Land

[Chorus]
Comin', comin', comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' (Comin'), comin' (Comin'), comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)

[Cryptical Envelopment Reprise]

[Outro]
And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended
Their minds remained unbended
He had to die

[Instrumental Break]

You know he had to die, he had to die, he had to die
You know he had to
He had to die, he had to die, you know he had to die
You know he had to die

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Last leaf fallen bare earth where green was born
Black Madonna two eagles hang against a cloud
Sun comes up blood red, wind yells among the stone
All graceful instruments are known

[Verse 2]
When the windows all are broken, and your love's become a toothless crone
When the voices of the storm sound like a crowd
Winter morning breaks, you're all alone

[Verse 3]
The eyes are blind, blue visions, all a seer can own
And touching makes the flesh to cry out loud
This ground on which the seed of love is sown
All graceful instruments are known

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Without a warning you broke my heart
Taking it baby, tore it apart
And you left me standing in the dark cryin'
Said your love for me was dyin'
So come on baby, baby please
And I'm begging you baby, and I'm on my knees

[Chorus]
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your lovelight, let it shine on me
Let it shine, let it shine, let it

[Verse 2]
Well, I get a little lonely in the middle of the night
And I need you darling to make things all right
So come on baby, baby please
And I'm begging you baby, and I'm on my knees
Turn on your light let it shine on me
Turn on your lovelight, let it shine on me
Hey, let it shine, let it shine, let it

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Without a warning, you broke my heart
Taken it baby, torn it apart
And you left me standing in the dark cryin'
Said your love for me was dyin'
So come on baby, baby please
I'm begging you baby, I'm on my knees

[Chorus]
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your lovelight, let it shine on me
Hey, let it shine, let it shine, let it

[Verse 4]
When I get a little lonely in the middle of the night
And I need you darling to make things all right
So come on baby (Come on, baby), baby please (Baby, please)
I'm begging you, baby (I'm begging you, baby)
And I'm on my knees (And I'm on my knees)

[Chorus]
Turn on your light (Turn on your light)
Let it shine on me (Let it shine on me)
Turn on your lovelight (Turn on your lovelight)
Let it shine on me (Let it shine on me)

[Outro]

Oh, I (Shine on me)
What you say?
And I don't want no one around
When I'm looking for my baby
When I'm looking for my girl
When I'm looking everywhere
I just need to find her anywhere
When I'm looking here and there, looking everywhere...
I just got to find her, I just got to find her
I just got to find her, I just gotta find my girl
What you say? What you say? What you say? Ow!

Feel like walkin', do a little talkin' too
Yes it do, yes it do
Why don't you pull your car way up inside my little driveway
Cut your bright lights low, that's all I need, darling
No no no no no no no, yes I do, yes I, yes I do
You look so good, early in the morning
You look so good, just a while for a day
Look so fine, late in the evening, darling
Look so good, you know you're gonna guide the way
I see you, and I feel like bawling
I see you, darling, and I feel like bawling
And I feel like balling up on your floor
And I feel like crawling up around your door
I guess I gotta keep on, baby...
What you say? What you say? What you say? What you say?

Oh, you might not admit it, that's a normal guy
Workin' undercover with a soul on fire

Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry this today, yeah
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Verse 3]
Where have all the people gone, my honey
Where have all the people gone today
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a young man mourn today
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey

It’s gettin' late, I'm making my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way

You're making stayin' over here impossible

If you don’t have to go, don't

Face call, good, but they knowing my name
I'm smokin' that gas, hit the shoulder, the pain
In a Rover, a Range, ain't no slow in my lane
Head for the top, blood cold in my veins
So a nigga better step back, catch that
Beat you like your stepdad
Cop a new whip, shit, jet black, bet that
Stop the braggin', fly, I can shock Aladdin
Do a 100 while the cops is passin'
And the chopper blastin'
Nigga fuckin' caught you lackin'
Rap niggas be Oscar-actin'
We never worry, them pockets packin'
I watch and learn in a proper fashion
Boy, you is weak, you is not a savage
Why do you have to be problematic?

[Chorus: Aminé]
I'm on a high (I'm on a high)
They on the low (They on the low)
You killin' my vibe (Killin' it)
Get out my zone (Get out my zone)
Said, I'm on a high (I'm on a high)
They on the low (You on the low)
You killin' my vibe (Killin' it)
Get out my zone (Get out my zone, bitch)

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Yeah, uh
Listenin' to Cameo, smokin' on the patio
Polo chinos, a Pro Club
Plottin' out the next score
Couple weeks in Cali
Smokin' the best, gettin' some rest
Then it's back to the full-court press
Niggas playin' for keeps
Tryna be the next Suga Slim, Baby or Master P
I don't pass that weed, it's all for me
I rolled it, so I'm only fo' sho gon' smoke it
Go and get your own shit
Focused on rollin' on, wrote for me and all of my dogs
Involved with takin' Jet Life, Taylor Gang to the stars
I done bought Ferraris from pennin' these rap bars
And I didn't stop there, I got so much more
Inspiration, somethin' you should reach for
See me in that Porsche, that should push you to go hard
I've done it, you can do it, ain't no difference
It's only real ones in the buildin'
Need to start really livin', make money every minute
The more things change, the more they stay the same
I stay high, peep game, sound the trumpets
And celebrate with buckets of champagne
Save the sparklers, I got the light show in my ring
And when we exit, they'll say the best just left here
And the rest is just like, yeah

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Curren$y]
This is the life, bitches and Nikes
Planes and Chucks, bottles and luxury
And all the bad bitches fuck with me
And them pussy-ass niggas don't want none of me
This is the life, bitches and Nikes
Planes and Chucks, bottles and luxury
Sports cars in the front yard
Dream big and we live large

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
All the gang rules apply when you fuckin' with the guys
Brought enough so we all could get high
She with me, don't be actin' all surprised
I get more money today than you see for the rest of your life
Tell you once, I don't gotta tell you twice
All my bitches treat me nice and my crib feel like paradise
Ain't gon' have as much fun as she had tonight
And if you got a plus one, everything alright
When it come to girls, I don't trust none
Khalifa kush, I'ma crush some, we gon' smoke 'til the sun come up
Ya nigga got a problem with it, hope he don't run up
I'ma take a shot, that's enough for both of us (Both of us)
And if you bring a friend, I'ma let her in
Andretti OG, that's the medicine
I'm tryna get high as the rent
Niggas comment on the smell, but I take that as a compliment
Don't fuck with no hatin' 'cause we don't do that
We countin' up paper, no we don't lose that
Since I leveled up, I never moved back
World of weed, bringin' all the booze
Don't stress her 'cause she gon' choose

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Curren$y]
This is the life, bitches and Nikes
Planes and Chucks, bottles and luxury
And all the bad bitches fuck with me
And them pussy-ass niggas don't want none of me
This is the life, bitches and Nikes
Planes and Chucks, bottles and luxury
Sports cars in the front yard
Dream big and we live large

[Intro: The Kid LAROI]

They lookin' at me for real

I know she couldn't believe it, nah
But I had to reassure nana
You know your grandson soft, real

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I just called my bro, I said, "Let's ball, ball, ball"
Found out my lil' cousin broke the law, law, law
Shit for me has changed and I feel so wrong
'Cause shit don't feel the same and it's all my fault

[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI]
It’s some real shit
Been a lot of places, and a lot of shit I had to deal with
But lately shit been getting to me, on some real shit
I wish I was still there
Yeah, I know I left you in the cold, on some weird shit (Yeah, yeah)
I know you been dealin’ with demons lately
I heard you been going really crazy (Crazy)
You don't gotta do this shit yourself
I’m still a baby, oh, yeah
I still complain, oh, yeah
But you could change to someone else
We've been going way too deep and you can blame me for it

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I just called my bro, I said, "Let's ball, ball, ball"
Found out my lil' cousin broke the law, law, law
Shit for me has changed and I feel so wrong
’Cause shit don't feel the same and it's all my fault
I just called my bro, I said, "Let's ball, ball, ball"
Found out my lil' cousin broke the law, law, law
Shit for me has changed and I feel so wrong
'Cause shit don't feel the same and it's all my fault

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
On some real shit
So much on my fuckin' plate, that shit be hard to deal with
I told my mom I'm only poppin' Percocets so I don't feel shit (I don't feel like shit)
And now she askin' me about the Adderall and all the pill shit
I still don't feel shit, yeah
And I try to not make my mama cry
And, my nigga, I try rappin' with melody, like na-na-na-na
Rockin' with LAROI, he a lil' rockstar
I was like 5'9, I stopped doing 9-to-5's
I stopped doing 9-to-5's, like when I was 5'9 (When I was 5'9)
But watch niggas get robbed, before I was even outside (Even outside)
Beasty and Quado died, that shit don't feel right
Didn't even say, "Bye-bye"

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I just called my bro, I said, "Let's ball, ball, ball"
Found out my lil' cousin broke the law, law, law
Shit for me has changed and I feel so wrong
'Cause shit don't feel the same and it's all my fault

[Outro: The Kid LAROI & A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
On some real shit
So much on my fuckin' plate, that shit be hard to deal with
Lately shit been getting to me, on some real shit
I was in pain ma, I was on Percocet, I couldn't feel shit
Yeah I know I left you in the cold on some weird shit
And I couldn't believe they took my bros
Made me wanna drill shit (Oh)
Been a lotta places and a lotta shit I had to deal with (Oh)
And there's so much shit up on my plate I didn't wanna deal with (Shit for me has changed and I feel so wrong)

Cold enough to-
Chill my bones
It feels like I don't-
Know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so-

Look
I don't mean to be the bad guy but-
Some would say that the shoes fit
And I been chewing on hearts like beef jerkey
So I got a lil stuck and I think I need a tooth pick
Fall fast and hard
Like I'm an Aston Martin
Off a cliff at dark
But I'm in at a bargain
Cause you ain't ever met another like me-
Young V, CD, make you go retarded-
I'm lyrically proficient when I'm driving the rhythm
But I won't let you up inside, you might need an incision
To see the corners of my mind that I often exist in
You want the pieces of my pie? Gotta make a decision
'Cause I been fizzing off the top, like a soda been shook
And I been pennin' down my thoughts, till I'm out of the books
Used to talk about the thots, ain't give 'em a look now
Listen to my hook now-
Cold enough to-
Chill my bones
It feels like I don't-
Know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so-

[Verse 1]
Y'all don't feel a nigga passion
If I go I go in fashion
All before me I imagine
I wish life was everlasting
I wish time was everlasting
Just might, ah, in the afterlife
Shall not perish, everlasting life
Could this be a nigga last tonight
Living wrong, I ain't acting right
My mind gone, I ain't wrapped too tight
Turn my mind into a platform
Feel my skin is way too black for 'em
See, I can package up these facts for 'em
And get a couple stacks to rap for 'em
Came a long time from brash decisions
Eating cash back with bad intentions, yeah

[Verse 2]
Poor positions turn to gorgeous vision
We forced our way in that door when support was missing
Cause of course we going for it like it's 4th and inches
Support it and stay aboard it, don't abort the mission, to the core
I live fast and probably die in traffic
Pass so fresh I jump out of the casket
For one last pic with my niggas
If they pour some out for me it's going straight to my liver
Devil or the angels, my favorite dilemma
So if they have to take me today just remember

[Chorus]
If I go I go in fashion
All before me I imagine
I wish time was everlasting
I wish mine was everlasting
If I go I go in fashion
I might wake up in the afterlife
Could this be a nigga last tonight?
Could this be a nigga last tonight?

[Verse 3]
Cut 'em off, cut 'em deep
Niggas just might have to pay me severance
What's the play? What's your preference?
Getting paid gaining leverage
I need mines on time, no exceptions
My grind gon' bleed your perceptions
My wants, my needs, my obsessions
Praying on my knees, my confessions
Just God, don't need no protection
No I ain't never speak to no reverend
Oh, a lot of these streets get the message
Man if karma spare me it's a blessing
I'm going out of my mind, I'm running out of my love
But it all numbs out when a nigga on drugs
In the face of the..., swear nigga don't budge
Wade in the water 'til my neck up in the flood like

[Chorus]
If I go I go in fashion
All before me I imagine
I wish time was everlasting
I wish mine was everlasting
If I go I go in fashion
I might wake up in the afterlife
Could this be a nigga last tonight?
Could this be a nigga last tonight?
Ay
Paradise waits, on the crest of a wave, her angels in flames
She has no pain, like a child she is pure, she is not to blame
Poised for flight, wings spread bright, spring from night into the sun
Don't stop to run, she can fly like a lie, she can't be outdone

Tell me the cost; I can pay, let me go, tell me love is not lost
Sell everything; without love day to day insanity's king
I will pay day by day, anyway, lock, bolt and key
Crippled but free, I was blind all the time I was learning to see

Help on the way, well, I know only this, I've got you today
Don't fly away, cause I love what I love and I want it that way
I will stay one more day, like I say, honey it's you
Making it too, without love in a dream it will never come true
Beautiful lie
You can pray
You can pay
Till you're buried alive

Blackmailer blues
Everyone in the room
Owns a part of the noose
Slipknot gig
Slipknot gig
Slipknot gig

Did someone say
Help on the way
Well, I know
Yeah, I do
That there's help on the way
If i told i was perfect i'd be lying
If there's something i'm not doing, girl i'm trying
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad (no no no)
If you see me at the party conversating
That doesn’t mean telephone numbers are exchanging
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad

You should know, these

Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby

I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go

These
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby

I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know

Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby (N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)

[Verse 1]
Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
When the night falls, my loneliness calls

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

[Verse 2]
I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

[Bridge]
Somebody who
Somebody who
Somebody who
Somebody who
Somebody who
Somebody who
Somebody who
Somebody who
Somebody who
Don't you want to dance
Don't you want to dance
Don't you want to dance
Don't you want to dance
Don't you want to dance
Don't you want to dance
Don't you want to dance
Don't you want to dance
Don't you want to dance
Don't you want to dance

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

[Intro]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Look

[Verse 1]
I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days, yeah
These days, I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And last night, I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it, I hope you can take it

[Chorus]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Verse 2]
I don't know how to talk to you, yeah
I just know I found myself getting lost with you, yeah
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And last night, I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it, I hope you can take it

[Chorus]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted (yeah)
I just don't understand it

[Verse 3: Drake]
Tell the UK tings that I soon forward

Dreamin' of the places I can get to
Drizzle, all the mandem miss you
Man like that need a visa to get you, baow
But, girl, listen
I wanna do the things that I mentioned
I wanna benefit from this friendship
I wanna get the late-night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I

[Chorus]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
Watching the ships roll in
And I watch 'em roll away again, oh

[Chorus]
Just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tides roll away
Ooh, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

[Verse 2]
I left my home in Harlem
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I got nothing to live for
Looks like nothin's gonna come my way

[Chorus]
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tides roll away
Ooh, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

[Bridge]
Look like nothing's gon' change
Everything remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes

[Verse 3]
Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

[Chorus]
So I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh-wee, sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

[Outro]
*Whistling*

[Verse 1]
It's a thin line between the love and hate (Yeah)
The tears that you cry turn into savagery
Ooh-ooh-ooh, you-ooh-ooh, look so good in that dress
I, I, I wouldn't mind seeing you in even less

[Pre-Chorus]
My love, you're no angel, no angel
My love, I can't change you, won't blame you

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the love we make
Goin' back and fourth all day
When you tryna tell me something
Baby, talk with your body
And I love the way you lie
Ain't no need to apologize
When you tryna tell me something
Baby, talk with your body
When you tryna tell me something
Baby, talk with your body

[Verse 2]
Mami, relax
Heart beating out your chest
They think you're mad, but I know you're passionate

[Pre-Chorus]
My love, you're no angel, no angel
My love, I can't change you, won't blame you

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the love we make
Goin' back and fourth all day
When you tryna tell me something
Baby, talk with your body
And I love the way you lie
Ain't no need to apologize
When you tryna tell me something
Baby, talk with your body
When you tryna tell me something
Baby, talk with your body
When you tryna tell me something
Baby, talk with your body

[Bridge]
Every time you tell me "Pipe down"
I know I gotta lay the pipe down
Every time I tell ya "Pipe down" (Pipe down)
We end up with the lights down, lights down
Every time you tell me "Pipe down" (Pipe down)
I know I gotta lay the pipe down (Whoa)
Every time I tell ya "Pipe down"
We end up with the lights down, lights down

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the love we make
Going back and fourth all day
If you tryna tell me something
Baby, talk with your body
And I love the way you lie (You lie, girl)
Ain't no need to apologize
When you tryna tell me something
Baby, talk with your body
If you tryna tell me something
Baby, talk with your body
Ooh-ooh-ooh, you-ooh-ooh, look so good in that dress
I, I, I wouldn't mind seeing you in even less

[Verse 1]
It's okay to feel so small
Got ten foot walls towering above you
You lay bare on the rooftop
No one there, nobody to love you
Colossal clouds, colors of the dark
Galaxies never found
My little spark observing it’s big spark

[Verse 2]
Turn on the stars, the street lamps of Mars
I've been waiting for the night to fall
Turn on the stars, the street lamps of Mars
I'll rest until the birds go

[Outro]
Colossal clouds, colors of the dark
Galaxies never found
My little spark observing it’s big spark

[Verse 1]
My mind is filled with galaxies
It's all I see
It's all I see
Way up in the highest trees
I feel the breeze
I feel the breeze

[Chorus]
Take me on your boat one day
We'll fade away, we'll slip away
We'll go away, we'll be away
We'll stay away

[Post Chorus]
We'll go down the longest stream
Reflected in a sunbeam

[Chorus]
Just a speck of dust in the Milky Way
We'll fade away, we'll slip away
We'll go away, we'll be away
We'll stay away

[Post-Chorus]
We'll go down the longest stream
Reflected in a sunbeam

[Bridge]
I'm not going
I'm not going
I'm not going
I'm not going
I'm not going, going, gone

[Chorus]
Just a speck of dust in the Milky Way
We'll fade away, we'll slip away
We'll go away, we'll be away
We'll stay away

[Outro]
But we are alive today
We'll be ok
We'll be ok

[Verse 1]
I'm no white dove
But I stand here with all my love
Uncover the windows
Let in the light
Grab the hand that's reaching out
Face out to an empty room where no one's there to hear their prayers
But you and I
You and I

[Verse 2]
On the road through the fog
Through the smoke with my heart in my throat
On the road through the fog
Through the smoke with my heart in my throat

[Chorus]
I'm lookin' in
I'm thinkin' out loud
Now that I've seen
I used to hide from my own mind
This battle's not mine, oh, no

[Refrain]
The building a motor on houses of paper
This world can cater for us all
The building a motor on houses of paper
This world can cater for us all
When the sun rises, it rises for us all
When the sun rises, it rises for us all

[Chorus]
I'm lookin' in
I'm thinkin' out loud
Now that I've seen
I used to hide from my own mind
This battle's mine

[Verse]
Every plant given life by His hands
Every stone placed to build pathways in the sand
There was a magical feeling surrounding that land
A mystical feeling surrounding that land

[Chorus]
And I'd curl up on my mother with the fire ablaze
My memories of then are a haze
But I can still smell the fynbos after a night's rain
And the fairies and the magic that blossomed from our brains

[Post-Chorus]
And there's a child in the treetops, is she still me?
My heart opens as the swing drops
I've got bruises on my knees
And I look up into the ether
The sunset and the breeze
Nothing has made me quite as happy
As my home, my home among the trees

[Chorus]
And I'd curl up on my mother with the fire ablaze
My memories of then are a haze
But I can still smell the fynbos after a night's rain
And the fairies and the magic that blossomed from our brains

[Post-Chorus]
And there's a child in the treetops, is she still me?
My heart opens as the swing drops
I've got bruises on my knees
And I look up into the ether
The sunset and the breeze
Nothing has made me quite as happy
As my home, my home among the trees

[Verse 1]
Why did they lie?
They said to survive I had to walk along the line
But I don't feel alive, does that mean I've survived?
Does that mean I've survived?
Does that mean I've survived?
What kind of living is this?
I don't wanna simply exist
I wanna punch with my fist
I wanna roll with the misfits
Meander in the mist
Give in to the bliss
Grab life by her wrist
Lean in for a kiss and say, "I want this"
"Oh, I need this"

[Chorus]
I wanna live like I mean it
I'm gonna take it, not leave it
I wanna live like I mean it
I'm gonna take it, not leave it
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I've never been one for leaving
But I need something to believe in
Something that shakes me
Watch how I'm waking
I'm yours for the taking
I'm newborn, I'm shaking
Never been one for leaving
But now I'm leaving
'Cause my heart's still beating
And there's nothing as fleeting
As a life before expiry
Tonight I'm feeling fiery
I'll set fire to everything
Everything that meant something
'Cause now it has no meaning
Now it has no meaning

[Chorus]
I wanna live like I mean it
I'm gonna take it, not leave it
I wanna live like I mean it
I'm gonna take it, not leave it
I wanna live like I mean it
I'm gonna take it, not leave it
I wanna live like I mean it
I'm gonna take it, not leave it

[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you be a superstar
But I tell you just be satisfied and stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (come on)
Keep yourself alive (ooh)
Take you all your time and your money
Keep you satisfied
(Listen)

[Verse 2]
Well I've loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (come on)
Keep yourself alive (ooh)
Take you all your time and your money
To keep yourself alive (keep you satisfied)
(Whoo!)
(Watch it)
(Wah!)

Keep yourself alive (hmm)
Keep yourself alive (hmm)
It'll take you all your time and your money
Honey you'll survive

[Bridge]
Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

[Chorus]
(Come on) keep yourself alive (yeah)
Keep yourself alive
All you people
Keep yourself alive

[Outro]
Keep yourself alive (come on)
Keep yourself alive
(hmm) all you people
Keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive (come on, come on)
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
Honey you'll survive

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
(Hmm) all you people
Keep yourself alive

Take you all your time and money, honey
Uh! Keep yourself alive
(Ah)
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive

[Verse 1] 

[Freddie Mercury]
Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today I know what I'm doing
Got a feeling I should be doing all right

[Chorus]
Doing all right

[Verse 2]
Where will I be this time tomorrow
Jumped in joy or sinking in sorrow
Anyway I should be doing all right

[Chorus]
Doing all right

[Bridge]
Should be waiting for the sun
Looking round to find the words to say
Should be waiting for the skies to clear
There ain't time in all the world
Should be waiting for the sun
And anyway I've got to hide away

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3] 

[Roger Taylor]
Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today God knows what I'm doing
Anyway I should be doing all right

[Outro]
Doing all right

[Intro]
Well, she's gone, gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
Oh, Lord
I said, "What a fool I've been"

[Verse 1]
I caught a train
A train to Georgia
Sixteen coaches long
Oh Lord, I said
Sixteen coaches long, yeah
Wow

[Verse 2]
I walked out
Onto the highway
Oooh, ow, ow, ow, ow
Oh Lord, I said
Greyhound bus had gone
Wow, surprise to me
Now hear this

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I walked out onto the highway
Greyhound bus at dawn
Oh, Lord
I said, "Greyhound bus at dawn"
It went a long time ago, sure did
Wow

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Oh, well she's gone
Gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
So long I said what a
Fo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oool
I've been, ooh
Ah

[Intro]
Ahh, ahh

[Verse 1]
In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever (Ooh, yeah)
Lions' den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever (and on and on and on)
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
My fairy king
(He rules the air and turns the tides)
And can see things that are not there for you and me
Ooh yeah (Too soon)
My fairy king
(He guides the winds)
He can do right and nothing wrong

[Verse 3]
(Ahh)
Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah)

[Verse 4]
They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
(Why can't you see it?)
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain
(Son of heaven set me free and let me go)
Sea turns dry no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor men's eyes
(No more)

[Outro]
Someone, someone has drained the color from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Oh, Mother Mercury (Mercury)
Look what they've done to me (yeah)
I cannot run I cannot hide
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
I have sinned, dear Father
Father, I have sinned
Try and help me, Father
Won't you let me in?

[Chorus]
Liar!
Oh, nobody believes me
Liar!

[Post-Chorus]
Why don't you leave me alone?

Sire, I have stolen
Stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should

[Chorus]
Liar!
Oh, everybody deceives me
Liar!

[Post-Chorus]
Why don't you leave me alone?

[Bridge 1]
(Liar) I have sailed the seas

(Liar) Time after time
(Liar) You're lying to me
(Liar) You're lying to me

[Intro]
I want you, ahh
Woman

[Verse 1]
Tried to be a son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, now didn’t you feel surprised to find the cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man to buckle down and to shovel shit
What'll you do for loving when it’s only just begun?

[Chorus]
I want you
To be a woman, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal people preacher, will you lead us all the same?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, I traveled around the world and found
A brand new word for day
Watching the time, mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away
Ooh, what'll you think of heaven if it's back from where you came?

[Chorus]
I want you
To be a woman

[Bridge]
I want you to be a woman
Yeah

[Outro]
You know I'm gonna save the world
Now you've just begun
Alright!

[Intro]
Ahh! Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahh!

[Verse 1]
Now once upon a time - an old man told me a fable
When the piper is - gone and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination
That is the sign

[Chorus]
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre - battle - fight

[Verse 2]
He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies -
The palm of a hand the incredible size
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre - battle - fight

[Bridge]
The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
Gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
"Ooh, keep a lookout!"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cos you gotta go south

(Ahhhh!)

[Verse 3]
Ogre-men are going home
And The great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more

[Outro]
Oh-ho-ho
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle

[Verse 1]
Had to make do with the worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is getting tired, need a rest
Well, you know what I mean
'58 that was great but it's over now and that's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya, grab ya hard, make you feel ten feet tall

[Verse 2]
Well, I hope this baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temp'rature down and the jukebox blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin' like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know that there's one thing, every single body could use
Yeah, listen to me baby, let me tell you what it's all about

[Chorus]
(Modern times) rock and roll
(Modern times) rock and roll

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Get your high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest and a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says he's gonna make you a real big big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants, think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world gonna know who you are
(Look out)

[Outro]
(Modern times) rock and roll

[Verse 1]
Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty-first of May
Died syphilis forty-four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes, he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn’t you like to know, people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

[Verse 2]
Now hear this
Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg or will I borrow?
I don't care I don't care anyway
Come on come on the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you, ah yes I told you
And that’s no lie oh no no

[Chrous]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
(Show me)

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know, people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
(Hit it)

[Bridge]
Now listen, all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don’t listen to what mama says
Not a word, not a word mama says
Or else you’ll find yourself being the rival
The great Lord before He died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're going to realize tomorrow
No, I’m not going to tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come, come on the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you once before

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see?

[Intro]
I want you, ahh

[Bridge]
I want you to be a woman
Yeah

[Outro]
You know I'm gonna save the world
Now you've just begun
Alright!

[Verse 1]
Had to make do with the worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is getting tired, need a rest
Well, you know what I mean
'58 that was great but it's over now and that's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya, grab ya hard, make you feel ten feet tall

[Verse 2]
Well, I hope this baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temp'rature down and the jukebox blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin' like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know that there's one thing, every single body could use
Yeah, listen to me baby, let me tell you what it's all about

[Chorus]
(Modern times) rock and roll
(Modern times) rock and roll

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Get your high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest and a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says he's gonna make you a real big big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants, think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world gonna know who you are
(Look out)

[Outro]
(Modern times) rock and roll

[Verse 1]
There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
Please don’t you cry anymore (Ahh)
Can't you see?
Listen to the breeze, whisper to me, please

[Chorus]
Don't send me to the path of nevermore

[Verse 2]
Even the valleys below
Where the rays of the sun were so warm and tender
Now haven’t anything to grow (Ahh)
Can't you see?
Why did you have to leave me? (Nevermore, nevermore)
Why did you deceive me? (Nevermore, nevermore)

[Chorus]
You send me to the path of nevermore (Ahh)
When you say you didn't love me anymore (A-a-a-a-a-a-ahh)
(Ahh)

[Outro]
Nevermore
Nevermore

[Intro]
So sad, her eyes
Smiling, dark eyes
So sad, her eyes
As it began

[Verse 1]
On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow, the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known

[Chorus 1]
The white queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

[Bridge]
Needing, unheard
Pleading, one word
So sad, my eyes
She cannot see

[Verse 2]
How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came

[Chorus 2]
White queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

[Verse 3]
My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's forevermore that I wait
Dear friend, goodbye
No tears in my eyes

[Outro]
So sad it ends
As it began

[Intro]
Here I stand
Look around, around, around, around, around
But you won't see me
Now I’m here
Now I'm there
I'm just a, I’m just a
Just a new man
Yes, you made me live again

[Verse 1]
A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Ooh, don't worry, baby, I'm safe and sound

[Chorus 1]
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love her so?
Yeah, she made me live again
Yeah

[Verse 2]
A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don’t feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

[Chorus 2]
Down in the city just Hoople and me
Don’t I love him so?
Ooh, don't I love him so?

[Bridge]
Whatever comes of you and me
I’d love to leave my memory with you

[Verse 3]
Now I'm here
Think I'll stay around, around, around, around, around, around
Down in the city just as you and me
Don't I love you so

[Outro]
Go, go, go, little queenie!

[Verse 1]
Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going round, gotta clear out of town
Yeah, I'm smelling like a dry fish bone
Here come the Law, gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, never, never get it any more
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

[Chorus]
Crazy (stone cold crazy, you know)

[Verse 2]
Rainy afternoon I gotta blow a typhoon
And I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

[Chorus]
Crazy (stone cold crazy, you know)

[Verse 3]
Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet
With my rubber tommy water gun
Here come the deputy, he's gonna come and getta me
I gotta get me get up and run
They got the sirens loose, I ran right outta juice
They're going to put me in a cell, if I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell?

[Chorus]
Crazy (stone cold crazy, you know)

[Outro]
Ow!

[Verse 1]
"Dislocate your spine if you don't sign" he says
"I'll have you seeing double"
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off

[Chorus]
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had

[Verse 2]
"Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
Prostitute yourself," he says
"Castrate your human pride
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried"

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off

[Verse 3]
Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain
I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money-make machine
Cross-collateralize, (big-time money, money)
Reduce you to a Muzak-fake machine
Then the last goodbye
It's a rip-off

[Chorus]
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had

[Verse 1]
My new purple shoes
Been amazin' the people next door
And my rock 'n roll 45's
Been enragin' the folks on the lower floor
I've got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best be a real individual
And when we go down to Smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kind of ritual

[Chorus]
Ooh, give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place

[Verse 2]
I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
And this same situation, just cuts like a knife
When you're young, and you're poor, and you're crazy

[Chorus]
Ooh, give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place

[Verse 1]
Buddy, you’re a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singing

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

[Verse 2]
Buddy, you’re a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you, sing it out
We will, we will rock you

[Verse 3]
Buddy, you’re an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you, sing it
We will, we will rock you, everybody
We will, we will rock you, hmm
We will, we will rock you, alright

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro]
Ooh
Yeah!
Yeah, come on!

[Verse 1]
Buddy, you’re a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

[Verse 2]
Buddy, you’re a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you
Oh yes
We will, we will rock

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, we will, we will rock you (yes)
We will, we will rock you

[Verse 3]
Buddy, you’re an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you
Come on, we will, we will rock you (yeah)
We will, we will rock
Yeah
Oh, rock you!
Right on!

[Verse 1]
Sammy was low, just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time, he'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him, "Boy, you’d better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald Bar"

[Chorus]
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together 'cause you know you should do better
That’s because you're a free man

[Bridge]
He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself, he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world, nothing would make him stay

[Verse 2]
Since he was small, had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time, he'd made up his mind
"This could be my last chance"
His boss said to him, "Now listen, boy! You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can’t you be happy at the Emerald Bar?"

[Chorus]
So honey, spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
’Cause you know you should do better
That's because you’re a free man

[Outro]
Come on, honey, fly with me

[Verse 1]
You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candlelight
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside that's turning my mind away
Oh, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

[Chorus]
(It's late) When I'm bleeding deep inside
(It's late) Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
(Too late) Even now the feeling seems to steal away
(So late) Though I'm crying, I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

[Verse 2]
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time, the more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving and I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

[Chorus]
(It's late) But it's driving me so mad
(It's late) Yes, I know, but don't try to tell me that it's
(Too late) Save our love, you can't turn out the lights
(So late) I've been wrong, but I'll learn to be right
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

[Bridge]
I've been so long, you've been so long
We've been so long trying to work it out
I ain't got long, you ain't got long
We gotta know what this life is all about

[Guitar Solo]
Tell me
Try to work it out, yeah
Ooh!
Ooh, too late
Yeah
Too late, much too late
Ah!

[Verse 3]
You're staring at me with suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight, is it making my life a lie?
Oh, you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

[Chorus]
(It's late) Ooh, but it's time to set me free
(It's late) Ooh yes, I know, but there's no way it has to be
(Too late) So let the fire take our bodies this night
(So late) Let the waters take our guilt in the tide, now
It's late, it's late, it's late
It's late, it's late, it's late

[Outro]
Oh, it's all too late
Whoa, oh, it's too late
Come on!
I'm late, ooh, late
Oh yeah
Whoa!

[Verse 1]
Another party's over
And I’m left cold sober
My baby left me for somebody new
I don't want to talk about it
Want to forget about it
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew

[Bridge]
So come and get me, let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart is on an all time low
So don't expect me to behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I’m in for a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon

[Chorus]
I'm causing a mild sensation with this new occupation
I'm permanently glued to this extraordinary mood
So now move over and let me take over
With my melancholy blues

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I'm causing a mild sensation with this new occupation
I'm in the news
I’m just getting used to my new exposure
Come into my enclosure
And meet my...

[Laughs]

[Verse 1]
I've got a question, and I expect to hear the perfect answer
(Baby don’t you lie, don't you dare pretend) , don't you dare pretend) don’t you delay
Why do you say you love me when we all know that you love all those around you?
Well, I love me too and I'm not afraid to say
Everybody hates you; they just want to see you cry
They just want to see you cry (now your thoughts keep you up at night and you ask yourself why)
Oh the birds are the people who see you and judge you on a daily
They watch you in silence; they'll envy all your talents
Still you

[Hook]
(Cry and cry for nothing)
You got everything you could ever ask for, still you ask for more
(Time and time you prove to be the names that the blackbirds call you)
Don't show them that you're weak or you'll make them see

[Verse 2]
Baby I'm one of the birds I'm sympathetic, baby I’m a friend
(the flock doesn’t fly at night) so ill help you make it right
You're the total package yet you seek unnecessary attention
And you indulge yourself deep into your depression
You’re a heart break devil, preaching all the sweet lies
But deep inside I see a lost scared, lonely girl
But indecisiveness led you hear and I can't save you
Girl I can't save you, girl it can't be undone
(Don’t listen to me because I've been lying to you)
(You believe that I love you but you're simply a fool)
(I never was a friend so don't you cry so soon)
(And nobody's on your side, you'll be the only one to lose)

[Hook]

[Ending]
Don't show them that you're weak or you'll make them dine at the
Fountain of tears, tears from your eyes
They'll smile when you're down to your surprise (to your surprise)
So please, live up to your reputation
Don't sell your soul for who you weren't meant, to be
You'll make them see

[Intro]
I love you
For so many reasons
Just some shit to vent to
Damn, Mizzy Mauri got beats
I love you
Break it down, I break it down
All my smokers roll your weed up, uh
For so many reasons
I break it down, I break it down
All my drinkers get your liq' right, yeah
Word to Jada, I'm smokin' fire, yeah, uh
Look, look, uh, yeah

[Verse]
I look at it funny, a whole lot of money
I'm juggin' it for me, ridiculous
I look at it funny when niggas that's gettin' belligerent know what the business is
All of my niggas indigenous
Nigga, take a second, please consider this
Weed, was trimmin' it
Product, was sellin' it, dream, we livin' it
Thinkin' of scammin' and schemes was givin' in
Used to be like, "Niggas over bitches"
Then my bitches kept it over real than niggas
I can feel it in my feelings
Realest shit my heart done ever said was not to chill with niggas
Now I'm backseat, I'm like Malcolm on the black street
With the album, I'm an athlete
The way I be makin' the track meet on the rap sheet (Ayy)
Look how they did our nigga from Atlanta for not bein' born in Atlanta
The government so underhanded
They handed that shit off to someone who basically scammin'
And fuckin' and duckin' the Challenger full of police
And you know you a champion out here for thuggin' it
I found a loophole that niggas ain't want me to dig in
But, fuck it, I dug in it
All of the water that sit on my neck
It just couldn't amount to the oil that I struck in it
I used to sit in the kitchen so hungry
The oodles and noodles are boilin', bubblin', bubblin'
Mama workin' shift and doublin'
Wasn't 'til late in the night I was comin' in
I was in high school, no curfew, fuckin' hoes like come again
Look at the way that they made it, the people that hated
The divas I dated, the beef and the bullets got fired
The niggas that died, the problems the reaper created
We started with nothin' and made it to somethin'
The duckin' the bullets and keepin' the blade
Love for my dawg, don't wanna be him 'cause he in the cage
I'm deep in the maze
He look at me as I'm rappin' 'bout life in the street and the reason why he in the cage
Only thing different, we both talked about it, but life didn't give back an even exchange
Speakin' of life, my nigga Ike, he doin' three of them thangs
All he ever really wanted was to feed his daughter and get her the key to the Range
Almost stacked himself a milli' in cash, I'm tryna show you niggas he wasn't playin'
He was that nigga you had to go see when you needed a re-up for thangs
I beat up and bang
Pull up the block on the side with the opps and then cleaned up a stain for me and the gang
Shout out my baby 'cause she was the same, give me the brain, Caribbean thing
She willin' and ready and ready for my Willie, just like she Vivian Banks
Shit is insane
That just went over your head like, "Oh, it's a bird, no, oh, oh shit, it's a plane"
I did it again
Pull up to the party, tell all the women to get in the Range
All of the women inside the party wanna get in, but they couldn't fit in the thing
Go on the 'Gram, scroll on the page, look at the shit that I happened to see
Look at what happened to 21 Savage, I'm knowin' that shit could've happened to me
How they gon' cut our nigga from the country for simply rappin' on beats
That happened to reach his goals, touchin' the souls
Of niggas that happened to be out trappin' the trees?
Or packin' the nines, a Gat in their spine, it's that or the back of the seat
I saw a video of his lil' daughter this mornin', it made me so happy to see
Happy her daddy was on the television, acceptin' awards and actually free
Let's keep it real, we ain't finna lie, I think everybody laughed at the memes
And then I realized that that shit is mean
You can't be jokin' 'bout somebody's freedom
Most of these people don't know the severity of a situation, know where they hearin' it
All of the blogs that filter the good and cater the bad, man, we need some clearer shit
I'm on a mission to find me some clarity
I'm on a mission to find me some clarity, nigga, yeah

[Outro]
From the north, from the north, know it's us
Yeah, I, I, I think the biggest misconception about me is, uh
If you from the gang you gon' throw it up
Somehow niggas think I'm arrogant when I say shit
If you from the gang, gon' and throw it up
From the north, throw it up
The media try to build this, you know, this thing around me like oh this lil' arrogant nigga
If you from the north then you know it's us
Peace and love, peace and love
You know when I say shit like, like I'm the best rapper alive
Peace and love, peace and love
And the best artist out
I don't say that shit to be cocky
From the north, throw it up
You know, I say that shit to show the kids
If you from the north then you know it's us
To show the younger niggas, the younger girls of the generation
If you from the gang, you gon' throw it up
Peace and love, peace and love
You know, the youth, there's no limitation
By the way, you know, free my nigga 21 as well, you know
Know it's us
If you from the gang, gon' and throw it up
Lot of y'all niggas don't know what that over the border shit be like, that shit's a hassle, nigga
If you from the gang, gon' and throw it up
That shit's the worst shit you can think of
From the north, throw it up
One Umbrella, shit
If you from the gang, then you now it's us
Peace and love, peace and love
I'm back on my swavey shit, y'all niggas know exactly what time it is, nigga
Peace and love
Canada!
Peace and love
From the north, goin' up
We gon' go so big that they gon' know it's us
If you from the gang, you gon' throw it up
Peace and love, peace and love

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go

And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah

Out of the doorway the bullets rip

'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

You can take all your clothes off if you like too, doesn't matter

[Under Pressure riff plays]
Fuck off!
Haha
This, let me tell you what we're doing here
This is the last show in the series
It sounds like a television game
We're having it filmed
If you forget about the cameras it's just you and us, right?

[Intro: Freddie Mercury]
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Roger Taylor]
The machine of a dream
Such a clean machine
With the pistons a pumping
And the hubcaps all gleam

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
With my hand's on that grease gun
Oh it's like a disease, son

[Chorus 1]
I'm in love with my car (Oh, oh yes)
Got to feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

[Verse 2]
Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So she made tracks saying this is the end now
Cars don't talk back, they're just four-wheeled friends, now

[Refrain]
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

[Verse 1]
You take my body, I give you heat
You say you're hungry, I give you meat
I suck your mind, you blow my head
Make love inside your bed
Everybody get down, make love

[Refrain]
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

[Chorus]
Every time I get hot, you wanna come down
Every time I get high, you say you wanna cool down
You say it's enough, in fact, it's too much
Every time I get a, get down
Get down, baby
Yeah
Woah

[Refrain]
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

[Chorus]
Every time I get high, you wanna come down
Every time I get hot, you say you want to cool down
You say it's enough, in fact, it's too much
Every time I wanna get down, get down
Get down get down get down get down get down get down
Make love
Get down everybody

Brian's gonna play piano in a minute!

[Intro]
This is from an album called The Game
It's called Save Me

[Verse 1]
It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you, how I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham, it seems
The years belie, we lived a lie
I love you 'til I die

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me, oh
I'm naked and I'm far from home

[Verse 2]
The slate will soon be clean
I’ll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted, all that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I am cold inside
I have no real intent
Give it to me

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh
I'm naked and I'm far from home

[Verse 3]
Each night I cry, I still believe the lie
I love you 'til I die
Yes-uh!

[Outro]
Save me, (yeah) save me, save me (Oh yeah!)
Yeah, save me, save me, ooh (Oh, save me)
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, save me, ooh
I'm naked and I'm far from home
Home

[Intro]
Ha!
Give it
Yeah
Come on
Ooh yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Take me to the room where the red's all red
Take me out of my head is what I said, yeah, come on
Hey, take me to the room where the green’s all green
And from what I've seen it's hot, it’s-a mean

[Chorus]
I'm gonna use my stack
Gimme the reh....
It's gotta be bad, baby
Got a dragon on my back

[Verse 2]
Take me to the room where the beat's all round
Gonna eat that sound, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah
Take me to the room where the black's all white
And the white's all black, take me back to the shack

[Chorus]
Gonna take no prisoners
Gonna give me the business
Got a dragon on my back
Hey, it's a dragon attack

[Outro]
Look at me
Oh
Oh oh
Ha

[Bridge]
Mmm ah
I think I'm gonna stay around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around
And around around, around, around, oh
Oh
A little bit, a while, I'm gone
Along the long, oh
Stay
Please, stay

[Chorus]
Down in the valley just you and me
You and me, baby

[Intro]
Are you in the mood for um, singing?
Give us a little help with this, it's called Love Of My Life
You remember this?

[Verse 1]
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me
You don't know it
It's alright

[Verse 2]
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love, you now desert me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Bridge]
You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side
To remind you how I still love you (I still love you)
I still love you
I still love you love you love you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Oh hurry back, hurry back, please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Outro]
Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, yeah

Thank you

[Intro]
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

[Verse 1]
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da- that's okay

[Chorus: David Bowie & Freddie Mercury]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Verse 2]
Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da

[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Bridge]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn

[Roger Taylor, Freddie Mercury]
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro]
Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

[Intro]
Flash! A-ah!
Savior of the Universe
Flash! A-ah!
He'll save every one of us

[Chorus]
Flash! A-ah!
He’s a miracle

[Chorus]
Flash! A-ah!
King of the impossible

[Verse 1]
He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us
He saves with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman
Every child, it's the mighty flash

[Chorus]
Flash! A-ah!
Flash! A-ah!

[Outro]
Just a man with a man’s courage
You know he's nothing but a man
And he can never fail
No one but the pure at heart
Will find the Golden Grail
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Intro]
Yeah!

[Verse]
So you feel like you ain't nobody?
Always needed to be somebody?
Put your feet on the ground
Put your hand on your heart
Lift your head to the stars
And the world's for your taking
(Aw yeah! You're a hero!)

[Verse 2]
So you feel it's the end of the story?
Find it all pretty satisfactory?
Well I tell you, my friend
This might seem like the end
But the continuation
Is yours for the making
(You're a hero)

Yeah Yeah Yeah
Oh yeah

[Intro: Freddie Mercury]
Come on, we're waiting for you
Yeah!

[Chorus]
A-this thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it, I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Verse 1]
A-this thing (this thing)
Called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby)
In a cradle all night
It swings (woo woo)
It jives (woo woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish, I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

[Bridge]
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

{Break}

[Verse 2]
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat (ah hum), hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready

[Roger Taylor]
Ready Freddie!

[Freddie Mercury]
Crazy little thing called love

[Chorus]
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready

[Outro]
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Take it, take it, take it
Yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love ah
Crazy little thing called love, alright
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

Let's rock, everybody, rock 'n' roll tonight - come on
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

Number forty-seven said to number three
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me."

Let's rock, everybody rock 'n' roll tonight
Everybody in the whole cell block

[Verse 1]
Get your party gown, get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating baby
Got my timing right, got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight, my little school babe

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Your momma says you don't and your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
There is no way I'm gonna lose out this time
No way

[Chorus 1]
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors, I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight

[Verse 2]
"You're such a dirty louse, go get out of my house"
That's all I ever get from you
And your family ties, in fact, I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from you guys

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you know I don't give a light, I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart in hand to put a stop to all that
Snipin' and fightin' goin' on

[Chorus 2]
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Send your little brother swimming with a brick, that's alright
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

[Guitar Solo]

Give it to me
Yeah
Alright
Go for it
Yeah

All your love tonight, yeah
Now listen to me
I want it
Yeah
All your love tonight

Every inch of it
All your love tonight
Tonight

[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Spoken]
And I feel like, you know
If you're gonna be an artist
There's a time when you just have, you know
Embrace the responsibility
And I'm just sayin' the power of music is something so special
And be able to do it on this magnitude
When you reach millions of people
It's like, why not use that for good?
Why not tell kids something that they can connect with
And use with their lives
And like, really my mission statement from day one
And I'm getting so worked up talking about this
All I wanted to do was help kids not feel alone
And stop kids from committing suicide

[Verse 1]
3 am, mustang speedin'
Two lovers, headed for a dead end
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs *does motor moves*
Runnin' through the red lights !
Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'
Big swig, toss another beer can
Too lit, tonight, prayin'
On the moonlight

Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare *get off hat*
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission
1-2 ya, the gears are shiftin'
He called, I cried, we broke !
Racin' through the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
Every John is just the same, I'm sick of their city games
WHO THE ARE YOU! GET OFF ME

-Scheiße-
When I wrote this song many years ago I said I wish that I could dance on one single prayer
I wish I could be strong without permission
But it’s a really strange thing, strength
‘Cause you gotta know what weakness feels like to have it
You gotta put up with some bull s*
So you know, I wrote about a nice sentiment about strength, and being a woman in this very sentimental song
:m SCHEIBE!

This one’s for the girls. Put your hands up, let’s dance

Ich schleiban austa be clair, es kumpent üske monstère, aus-be aus-can-be flaugen, begun be üske but-bair

[Pre-Chorus]
When I’m on a mission
I rebuke my condition
If you’re a strong female
You don’t need permission ! Hands up !

[Chorus]
I wish that I could dance on a single prayer !
I wish I could be strong without somebody there !
I wish that I could dance on a single prayer !

Love is objectified by what men say is right
Scheibe, scheibe be mine
Bull shit, be mine
Blonde high-heeled feminists, enlisting femmes for this
Express your womankind, fight for your right ! C'mon !

[Pre-Chorus]
When I’m on a mission
I rebuke my condition
If you’re a strong female
Come on. Step it up! Let’s go!

[Chorus]
I wish that I could dance on a single prayer !
I wish I could be strong without somebody there !
I wish that I could dance on a single prayer ! *raise arm up*

And I can see you all out there and I’m thinking about the stage, and the lights and how I’m gonna do the thing

And then sometimes I get a phone call right before and I’m like who is calling me?
I got a sold out arena waiting and I’m kinda busy right now!

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello, babx, you called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you see, see
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh?
You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

*does chorexo*

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
MY TELEPHONE ! MY TELEPHONE ! AND YOURE NOT GONNA REACH MY TELEPHONE !

So we're gonna walk
Through the roads of creation
We, the generation, tread through great tribulation

This is the way I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is, o-oh, when you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe that's why when we're all alone
I can hear music
I can hear music

Sounds of the city baby seem to disappear
Oh well I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

Loving you it keeps me satisfied
And I can't explain,oh no,the way I'm feeling inside
You look at me we kiss and then
I close my eyes and here it comes again
I can hear music
I can hear music

Sounds of the city baby seem to disappear
Oh well I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've been holding out so long
I’ve been sleeping all alone
Lord I miss you
I've been hanging on so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord I miss you
There’s something I have to say

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
I could kiss you
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
And the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter maaan?
We're going to come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls thats just dying to meet you
We're going to bring a case of wine
Hey, let’s go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to
You’ve been standing too long
Sometime, ya know, hey man, what's with you?"
I say, "ah, you know, I’ve been standing too long
Ya know, sometimes I feel abandoned"
I sang

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
Oh everybody waits so long
Tell me, baby why you wait so long?
Come on, come on

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
I've been walking in Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
I've been stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Shuffling on my feet
Asking people, (Ch-ch-ch), "What’s the matter with you boy?"
Sometimes I want to say to myself
Sometimes I say

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Until the philosophy
Which holds one race superior and another
Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited
And abandoned
Well, everywhere is war
Is your war

And until there’s no longer first-class and second-class citizen  of any nation
Until the color of a mans skin is of no more significance
Than the color of his eyes
I’ve got to say ‘War’, yeah
And until the basic human rights are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Is your war, hey

But until that day
The dream of lasting peace, world citizenship
And the rule of international morality, yeah
Will remain but a fleeting illusion to be pursued
But never attained
Well, everywhere is war
Is your war
War in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south, yeah

Yes, you want a war
And the rumors of war

That holds our brothers in South Africa, yeah

Sub-human bondage
Have been toppled, yeah
Utterly downstroyed
Well everywhere is
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere

War down south, yeah

Yes, you want a war
And the rumors of war
And until
And until
And ’til all these things have a meaning
’Til man learns
There’ll be always war, now
There’ll be always war
And the war in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south

Some winning
Some losing
Some dying
Some crying
Some singing
We don’t need
No more troubles
We don’t need
No more troubles
No more troubles, no more troubles

Speak happiness
Sad enough without your woes
Good morning, speak love
Sad enough without your foes, yeah

We don’t need no troubles
What we need is love

Soulja Boy on the beat
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em
Soulja Boy Tell ’Em
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Ooh, Young Drako served purple and now I'm serving lean
Pull on the block with that hundred round M16
Fifty K in the back seat
Riding round town running bricks like a track meet
Ooh, Big Drako off in this ho
Ooh, watch me crank it, watch me roll
Real street niggas got bricks for the low

[Chorus]
Watch me crank that Big Drako
Watch me crank that Big Drako
Cock back then I reload
Cock back then I let it blow
Watch me crank that Big Drako

[Verse 2]
Young Drako pull up I murk on the scene
Don't run up on Drako, get hit with the beam
Living my life just like it’s a dream
A hundred shots on the M16
Big Drako, nigga you know I be trappin'
I'm riding round town it's just me and my savage
Make the wrong move and this shit get to blastin'
This shit ain't go down, but that shit'll happen
Ooh, yeah, Big Drako off in this hoe
Watch me crank it, watch me roll
Hundred racks up on the floor
Watch me crank that Big Drako
Ooh, she all up on the door
Hundred bricks up on the floor

[Chorus]
Ooh, watch me crank that Big Drako (Ooh)

Watch me crank that Big Drako (Yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Yeah
To all the fuck niggas of the world (fuck nigga!)
All the niggas that get up, say "Fuck you" to everybody else
Talking to you

[Chorus]
Damn, it must suck to be a fuck nigga
Ol' greedy ass nigga only thinking 'bout himself
They get the fame, then get the wealth
But people are struggling, who did you help?
People are struggling, who did you help?
Who did you help, fuck nigga?
Damn, it must suck to be a fuck nigga
Ol' greedy ass nigga only thinking 'bout himself
They get the fame, then get the wealth
But people are struggling, who did you help?
People are struggling, who did you help?
Who did you help, fuck nigga?

[Verse]
I ain't made as much as you have, purses you grab
Could feed some countries out in Africa, you just go buy a Lamb
Or Bugatti or something else that depreciate when you drive it
Off the lot and holla, "Fuck it," but fuck it, I'll change the subject
The greatest reward comes with some obligations
You owe the generation after you
Since they gon' live in the world that you made
Man, where your gratitude?
You act like wasn't no more poor people struggling after you
Guess you were the last, nigga, you trash
You wouldn't never got big as you is
If the folk in the hood wasn't supporting your ass
See them same people that's taking a stand
Give you the chance, you showing your ass
I don't give a fuck how much money you have
What did you do with it? How did you use it
To make an impact and influence the world for the better?
You rather go buy some jewelry, whatever
But never should you ever think
That it's gon' last forever as soon as you blink
It'll be gone as quick as it came
And you talking 'bout when you were doing your thing
Man, all of them profits, man, how many scholarships?
How many properties did you donate to the people in poverty?
Man, I bet if any, it's not enough probably
Made it equivalent to hitting the lottery
Selfish just make you a target for robbery
Could it be possibly you don't know people are starving and dying
Is this shit not on your mind?
What is you thinking 'bout? Just 'cause you make it out
Don't mean you shit on people tryna be equal
Every day fighting oppression and you just gon' side with the evil
Man, what do you care about?
Did you not hear about black women missing?
We don't know they whereabouts
See that's what you should be calling the mayor about
Offer whatever is a fair amount
There's a water crisis down in Flint, and ain't you from Michigan?
Where is your empathy, nigga?
I promise you I see the bitch in these niggas
(Dah dah dah dah dah)
Do more with less 'cause I ain't richer than these niggas
I think I just had an epiphany, listen to ego
Where the creeps go when they're sacrificing they own people
I swear, all the money in the world ain't enough, nigga
If it mean I gotta live like a fuck nigga

[Chorus]
Damn, it must suck to be a fuck nigga
Ol' greedy ass nigga only thinking 'bout himself
They get the fame, then get the wealth
But people are struggling, who did you help?
People are struggling, who did you help?
Who did you help, fuck nigga?
Damn, it must suck to be a fuck nigga
Ol' greedy ass nigga only thinking 'bout himself
They get the fame, then get the wealth
But people are struggling, who did you help?
People are struggling, who did you help?
Who did you help, fuck nigga?

[Mike Stone]
This'll be take 37,000

[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
Yes, we are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Guitar solo]

We are the champions
We are the champions

[Ooh]
We are the champions

[Outro]

[Freddie Mercury]
That was a lovely feel, (it was)
That's exactly how it should be

[Intro]
Ooooo

[Verse 1]
Oh spending all your money
On trendy haircuts that you read were cool
And you're probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful
And I’m strugglin'
I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah, you know it for a fact
That everybody’s eating out of your hands

[Chorus]
But what do you know?
Oh you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
Oh what do you know?
Oh you don't know nothing

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, fancy seeing you in here
You're all tarted up and you don't look the same
Well I ain't seen you since last year
Yeah, and surprisingly you have forgot my name
But you know it, yeah, you knew it all along
Oh you say you have forgotten but you're fibbing, go on, tell me I’m wrong

[Chorus]
What do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I’ll still take you home
Oh, I'll still take you home
Yeah, what do you know?
Oh, you don’t know nothing, no

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da, da da
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah-woah-woah

[Chorus]
Yeah, so what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing, no
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
Yeah, so what do you know?
Oh, you don’t know nothing

[Verse 3]
You sold your soul to the fashion
Yeah, you're a Topshop princess, a rockstar too
But, where's the love and the passion?
Oh I suppose that's nothing to do with you
But it's alright, oh I'll put it all on one side
'Cause everybody's looking
You've got control of everyone's eyes
Including mine

[Verse 1]
Get on your dancing shoes
There's one thing on your mind
Hoping they’re looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through
Oh and the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Oh, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word so you're waiting and waiting and

[Chorus]
The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Well, don't you always do the same?
It's what you there for, don't you know?

[Verse 2]
The lights are flashing
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretending to dance
Don't act like it's not happening
As if it's impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same as they all do, and hope for the best

[Chorus]
The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Well, don't you always do the same?
It's what you’re there for, but no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Get on your dancing shoes
You sexy little swine
Hoping they’re looking for you
Sure, you'll be rummaging through
Oh and the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Oh, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word so you're waiting and whoa
Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live
Oh take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is

Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face, then rip the brakes out my car

You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

[Chorus]
But darlin', I'd still catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh, oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

[Verse 1]
Well, the ragman, he draws circles, up and down the block
I'd ask him what's the matter, but I know he don't talk
And the ladies they treat me kindly, and they furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart, I, I know I can't escape
Oh, mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 2]
Now, Shakespeare he's in the alley
With his pointed shoes and bell
Speaking with some French girl, who says she knows me well
And I would send a message, to find out if she's talked
But the post office has been stolen, and the mailbox is locked
Oh, oh mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Now, Mona tried to warn me, said stay away from the railroad line
She says all the railroad men, they drink up your blood like wine
And I said, "Oh I didn't know that"
But then again there's only one I've met
And he just smoked my eyelids, and he punched my cigarette
Oh, oh mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 4]
Grandpa, he died last week, and they buried him in the rocks
Now, everyone still talks about how badly they are shocked
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
When he built a fire on Main Street, and he shot it full of holes
Oh, mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Now the senator, he came down here, showing everyone his gun
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son
And me, I nearly got busted, and wouldn't it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck
Oh, mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 6]
Now the preacher, he looks so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved it to him
Then I said, "See, not even you can hide
You see, you're just like me, and I hope you're satisfied"
Oh, oh mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 7]
Now the rainman gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in"
The first was Texas medicine, the second was just railroad gin
But like a fool I mixed them, and it strangled up my mind
And now people just get uglier, and I've got no sense of time
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 8]
And when Ruthie says come see me in a honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free, 'neath her Panamanian moon
And I said, "Oh come on now, you know about my debutante"
And she says, "Your debutante knows just what you need
But I know what you want"
Oh, mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 9]
The bricks, they lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly, it all seems so well timed
And here I sit so patiently, waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all of these things twice, twice
Oh mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again
Oh, mama, can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again

[Verse 1]
Rise up fallen fighters
Rise and take your stance, again
'Tis he who fights and run away
Live to fight another day

[Chorus]
And the heathen…
(Heathen back, they, upon the wall)
Jah, Jah put the heathen back
(Heathen back, they on the wall)
And the heathen back they on the wall
(Heathen back, they on the wall)
And the heathen back
(Heathen back, they on the wall)

[Verse 2]
As a man sow shall he reap
And I know that talk is cheap
But, the hotter the battle
How much sweeter Jah victory

[Chorus]
And the heathen back
(Heathen back, they upon the wall)

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I’m going to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she’s gone
And I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die
And I'm going to sit right here until I die
Listen, I’m going to sit right here until I die

The victim didn't complain, she just screamed "shoot again"
I gave her extra rounds, my barrel twist around
I am Mr. shoot 'em down, I leave hearts on tha ground
My love is a weapon, and yes I use it well
Then I let the rose petals cover up the bullet shells
I never shoot and tell, I only shoot to kill
And the vest ain't gonna help it even if it's made of steel

[Chorus: Madonna]

Standing around in a circle
In the middle of the dance floor

Sleepy alligator in the noonday sun
Lying by the river just like he usually done, oh Lord
Call for his whisky
He can call for his tea
Call all he want to
But he can't call me

[Chorus]
Oh no
Well, I been there before
And I'm not coming back around
There no more, oh no now

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Hung up waiting for a windy day
Hung up waiting for a windy day

[Verse 2]
Creepy alligator coming all around the bend
Talking 'bout the times when we was mutual friends
I check my memory
And I, I check it quick, oh yes I will
I check it running
Some old kind of trick, oh no

[Chorus]
Oh no
Well, I been there before
And I ain't a coming back around
There no more
No, I'm not

[Bridge]
Tear down the Fillmore
Gas the Avalon

[Verse 3]
Riding down the river in an old canoe
A bunch of bugs and an old tennis shoe
Out of the river all ugly and green
Came the biggest old alligator that I've ever seen
Teeth big and pointed and his eyes were bugging out
Contact the union, put the beggars to route
Screaming and yelling, he was licking his chops
He never runs, he just stumbles and hops
Just out of prison on six dollars bail
Mumbling at bitches and wagging his tail

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
I went down one day
I went down to see a gypsy woman one day, yes I did
I wanna find out, I wanna find out
What's wrong with me and my baby
We ain't been getting down like we used to do
Like we used to do, no we're not
She told me, she said, "Baby..."
She told me, she said, "Son, all you need..."
All you need, all you got to have...
Said all you need, all you need...
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)

[Verse]
Paradise waits on the crest of a wave, her angels in flames
She has no pain, like a child she is pure, she is not to blame
Poised for flight, wings spread bright, spring from night into the sun
Don't stop to run, she can fly like a lie, she can't be outdone
Tell me the cost, I can pay, let me go, tell me love is not lost
Sell everything, without love day to day insanity's king
I will pay day by day, anyway, lock, bolt and key
Crippled but free, I was blind all the time, I was learning to see

[Instrumental break]

Help on the way, well, I know only this, I've got you today
Don't fly away cause I love what I love and I want it that way
I will stay one more day, like I say, honey, it's you
Making it too, without love in a dream, it will never come true

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
In another time's forgotten space
Your eyes looked from your mother’s face
Wallflower seed on the sand and stone
May the four winds blow you safely home

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
You better roll away the dew

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you where the four winds dwell
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
It can ring like fire when you loose your way

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

[Verse 3]
God save the child that rings that bell
It may have one good ring, baby, you can’t tell
One watch by night, one watch by day
If you get confused listen to the music play

[Instrumental break]
Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice you're gonna harvest the wind

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
You better roll away the dew
You better roll away the dew

[Verse 4]
I'll tell you where the four winds sleep
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wildflower seed on the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
You better roll away the dew
(Roll away)
Roll away the dew
(Roll away)
Roll away the dew
You'd better roll away the dew
(Roll away)

[Instrumental break]

Roll away the dew
You better away the dew
Roll away the dew
You better away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

Thank you

[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle (Ooh, ooh)
Or it could have been the wind (Ooh, ooh)
But there seems to be a beat now, I can feel it my feet now
Listen here it comes again!

[Bridge]
There's a band out on the highway
They're high stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Well, the sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinning dizzy
Lord, the band kept us too busy, we forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band
Lord, they're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight (Ooh, ooh)
Balls of lighting roll along (Ooh, ooh)
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on

[Bridge]
Keep on dancing through the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No one's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone
Was it ever there at all?
But they kept on dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Verse 3]
Well, the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

[Verse 1]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know is I could not leave her there

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 2]
Ten years the waves rolled the ships home from the sea
Thinking well how it may blow in all good company
If I tell another what your own lips told to me
Let me lay neath the roses, let my eyes no longer see

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 3]
One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining though
Come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the ribbons that she wore
And it's strange how no one comes 'round anymore

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental break with drum solo]

[Chorus]
Well, the joint was jumping, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well, it sounds so sweet now, I had to take me a chance
Rose out of my seat now, Lord I had to dance
Started moving my feet now, well a clapping my hands

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
It went down now

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, at twelve o'clock now, oh the place was packed
The front doors was locked now, I said the place was packed
When the police knocked, well, those doors they flew back

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
It went down, it went down, it went down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
Well, it sounds so sweet now, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat now, Lord I had to dance
Started moving my feet now, well a clapping my hands

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Ooh, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
It went down, it went down, it went down

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around now
Reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
We're gonna take a short break
We'll be back in just a few minutes
Everybody hang loose

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
And never could do no wrong
You had everything sewed up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
And if that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Your rain falls like crazy fingers
Peals of fragile thunder, keeping time
Recall the days that still are to come
Some sing blue
Hang your heart on laughing willow
Stray down to the water
Deep sea of love
Beneath the sweet calm face of the sea
Swift undertow

[Chorus]
Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know
See how it feels in the end
May Lady Lullaby sings plainly for you
Soft, strong, sweet and true

[Verse 2]
Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow
Tapping at the window, touch your hair
Dark as the night
You're still by my side
Shining side
Who can stop what must arrive now?
Something new is waiting to be born
Dark as the night
You're still by my side
Shining side

[Bridge]
Gone are the days we stopped to decide
Where we should go
We just ride
Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams
Gone - both dream and lie

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Life may be sweeter for this I don't know
Feels like it might be alright
While Lady Lullaby sings plainly for you
Love still rings true

[Verse 3]
Midnight on a carousel ride
Reaching for the gold ring down inside
Never could reach it
It just slips away when I try

[Instrumental break with drum solo]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
Don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
Don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
Ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand
Of P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan
Light your fuse, shine your shoes
Call this song, U.S. Blues
I'll drink your health, share your wealth
Run your life, steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Back to back, chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song the United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Blues For Allah / Sand Castles & Glass Camels / Unusual Occurrences in the Desert]
Arabian wind
The needle's eye is thin
The Ships of State sail on mirage
And drown in sand
Out in No-man’s Land
Where Allah does command
What good is spilling blood?
It will not grow a thing
Taste eternity
The swords sings Blues for Allah

In'sh Allah

They lie where they fall
There's nothing more to say
The desert stars are bright tonight
Let’s meet as friends
The Flower of Islam
The Fruit of Abraham
The thousand stories have
Come 'round to one again
Arabian night
Our gods pursue their fight
What fatal flowers of
Darkness spring from seeds of light
Bird of paradise - Fly
In white sky
Blues for Allah
In'sh'Allah

Let's see with our heart
These things our eyes have seen
And know the truth must still lie
Somewhere in between

[Announcer]
Well, before you begin, fellas, I would like to introduce the band
(I don't know who this guy is but he ain't Bill Graham)
Well, thank you, that's the nicest thing I've heard today
(Well, we'd sure like to thank the Springfield Creamery for making it possible for us to play out here in front of all you folks here, and God and everybody
This is really where we get off the best)
Well, I'm sure that these fellas are all familiar with you by now
But in honor of this occasion here and the flats out here, first, I'd like to go over to Bobby Weir -- Bob Weir, I should say, of course, it's my age, on the rhythm and the pickin', and of course you know all his songs already. But I have a little something for you, Bob, from all us folks here in, yeah, Eugene, I get it -- okay, that's for when you sing the songs, the Texan songs, yeah, down in the da-da-da-da-da-da, that's for that. Well, I hate to say, personal problems over here, but we got evicted from our house in the middle of our walnut grove, and so this is the end of any of the walnuts we'll ever have again from Maple Isle, and I'd like to present this to Phil Lesh, the bass player here. Oh yeah, now this is for, this is a nice little thing here, he's still working out good, I love the way he can do it all day long, he's steady and always has been -- we're under attack here, some mysterious vibrations -- but this is for who we've always called Bill the Drummer, who is in love with these kinda things. Bill the Drummer. And now moving over here, ladies and gentlemen, to the fella here on what you would say your left and my right, the lead Garcia player -- no, the lead guitar player, Jerry Guitar -- no, Garcia. Okay now, we've got a couple more items here. Over here on the piano is a newer addition to The Grateful Dead that I met the last two scenes out and I've enjoyed very much, and I'm glad they traded Keith out, Keith's down here on the piano, just some lickety split, good old fingers on the move, he's gotta be down here, Keith Godchaux, Keith Godchaux, ladies and gentlemen. Okay, so then, we've run right through now, another new addition for you who haven't seen The Dead here in Oregon for a while is Keith's young beautiful wife Donna who sings with the band. And I have something for you too Donna -- I don't know where you are. Okay, I got one more and then we'll begin, which is for the man who has come straight out of R.A., from Pendleton, Oregon, to go down and coordinate activities in the Bay Area with lifting equipment to the point where I gave him my bad back, now he takes it over, so I'm gonna give him a present for that occasion. I'm speaking of none other than Ram Rod

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 2]
I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
And tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Verse 1 repeated]
Since it costs a lot to win
Even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no
Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The buses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars
But I'm here by the road
Bound to the load
I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers who won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars

Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Oh, I'm drowning in you

I left St. Louis, City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
Tried to pretend it came to an end
'Cause you weren't the woman I thought I once met
But I can't deny, oh, times have gone by
I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
And I was a man when all this began
Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet
Black-throated wind whisper mix in
It's speaking of life that passes like dew
Forced me to see you've done better by me
Better by me than I've done by you

What's to be found, racing around
You carry your pain wherever you go
Full of the blues, trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't want to know
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
Capture a glance, oh, and make it a dance
Of looking at you looking at me

Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, here comes the light
Turn around, that's what I'm going to do
Oh, I'm going back home, that's what I'm going to do
Yes, I'll turn around, that's what I'm going to do
Well, I'm going back home, that's what I'm going to do
Oh I, oh I'm coming with you
Oh I, oh I'm coming with you
You've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh I, oh I'm coming with you
Oh, I'm going back home, that's what I'm going to do
Oh I, oh I'm coming with you
Alright, alright, alrighty, righty, righty
Uh, the lost kid situation has come up via the headphones
That there's a whole bunch of lost kids down in the kid tent
Crying 'cause they haven't seen their mommies and daddies for months
So, uh, if you've got a kiddie out there, go look for 'em
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental break]

Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I’m gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I’m gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Outro dialogue]

[Intro]
1, 2, 1, 2, 3

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 3]
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the lets a woman hold him in her hands
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands, ooh

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running, running
I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Lord, I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down under the sea
Try to see what's going down
Lord, read between the lines
Had a feeling I was falling, falling
Lord, I turned around to see
I heard a voice
You was running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
Ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Lord, until the sun goes down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore

Ay, we're gonna go take a short break
And drink something 'cause it's real hot up here, and regain our energy
Yeah, cop a couple salt tablets and try again
You know, this may be the first time I ever been to Oregon and it didn't rain, now it's too damn hot!

3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But i know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just lookin' for their knives
But I can tell your future
But look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing, and wait up on the sand
Daybreak, while I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Outro dialogue]

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now, he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone, like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothin's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now, he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone, like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothin's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old, rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
He's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone, like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothin's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back

[Outro dialogue]

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin', my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life;
And one's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
And now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the clouds of delusion

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Bridge]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 2]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Bridge]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 3]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Bridge]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 4]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Bridge]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 5]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
The warden led the prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before they reached my cell
Let my guitar playin' friend sing my request

[Chorus]
Sing me back home, a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Sing me away, and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die

[Verse 2]
I recall last Sunday morning when a choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers, "There’s a song my momma sang
Can I hear it before you travel on?"

[Chorus]
Sing me back home, a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive (Come alive, oh Lordy)
Sing me away, and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2 repeated]
I recall last Sunday morning when a choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers, "There's a song my momma sang
Could I hear it once before you travel on?"

[Chorus]
Could you sing me back home, a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive (Lordy, come alive, oh Lord)
Sing me away, and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die
Sing me back home before I die

Okay, now, at the risk of repetition, you'll forgive us if we do another tune in the same key...
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly
Through the night

Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep
In the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la
La...

[Instrumental break]

All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly
Through the night

Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep
In the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la
La, la...

[Instrumental]

[Outro dialogue]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
A quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
A quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You’d be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Instrumental break]

Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come 'round the bend
You know it’s the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, you know, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
I went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's going to be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Woo, Saturday night!

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the whole place going to fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Ow, Saturday night!

[Verse 3]
Turn on Channel Six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I got no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, put on your rocking shoes"

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night now
Hey, Saturday night!

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Ow! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Ow, Saturday night!

[Instrumental break]

Hanging on a Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night!
One more Saturday night
Everybody's here, boy
One more Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, ooh
Hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday night
Hanging on a Satuday night
One more Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, woo
Hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday night
Hanging on Saturday night
One more Saturday night
Woo!
One more Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday
One more Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, woo!
See y'all later, bye

[Verse 1]
South of Market in the land of ruin
You get all manner of action
Tinsel tigers in The Metal Room
Stalking satisfaction
They got them packaged up for love and money
Tattooed tots and chrome spike bunnies
Check my conscience at the DMZ
And roll on in, going to roll in it, honey
But I get a feeling like when big things collide
Like the crack before the thunder, like I really ought to hide
Here comes Metal Angel, she looks ready to ride
What's that she’s trying to show me?
What's that she's trying to show me?

[Chorus]
Picasso Moon, shattered light
Diamond bullets ripping up the night
Picasso Moon, liberate me, yeah
Ah, life’s infinite diversity, oh yeah
Great, amazing, majesty, oh yeah
And it's bigger than a drive-in movie, ooh-wee
Bigger than a drive-in movie, ooh-wee

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Hanging ten out on space and time
Redefining distance
The next skull on your necklace is mine
Cheap for such assistance
I had a job trading bits for pieces
We'd make wrinkles, advertise them as creases
Please, find my resignation enclosed
Roll with it, roll with it, we going to roll in it
Dark Angel, What's bothering you?
So strange, you'll do me all that you do
Dark Angel, you're making me blue
I guess it doesn't matter
I guess it doesn't matter, hey

[Chorus]
Picasso Moon, blinding ball
I feel the quickening, I hear the call
Picasso moon, fill the sky, yeah
Amaze and blaze and mystify, yeah
With the lunar wind, I want to fly, oh yeah
And it’s bigger than a drive-in movie, oh my
Bigger than a drive-in movie, oh my

[Verse 3]
Strikes morning; the atomic dawn
Scramble back to cover
Quick, pop your mirrored sunglasses on
My little leather-winged lover
I see your face printed on my money
Your sultry ways really move me, honey
Heart of darkness, Yea-e-yea-e-e-hoo
Why’m I laughing? This sure ain't funny
Dark Angel, now just don’t start
You'll break my spirit, you'll wreck my heart
You must have a license for practicing that art
I don't presume to imagine
No, I, I don’t presume to imagine

[Chorus]
Picasso Moon, fractal flame
Blazing lace filling every frame
Picasso Moon, wheels within wheels, yeah
The bells are ringing, it's way unreal, oh yeah
Trying to tell y'all about just how it feels, oh yeah
And it's bigger than a drive-in movie, for real
Bigger than a drive-in movie, for real
Picasso Moon, shattered light
Diamond bullets tearing up the night
Picasso Moon, fill the sky, yeah
Picasso Moon, blinding ball
I feel the quickening, I hear the call
Picasso moon, fill the sky, yeah
Picasso Moon, fractal flame
Blazing lace filling every frame
Picasso Moon, liberate me, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day which could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Verse 3]
When your big old ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Inside you're burning
I can see clear through
Your eyes tell more than you mean them to
Lit up and flashing
Like the reds and blues
Out there on the neon avenue

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger

[Verse 2]
The music's thundering
We're restless and hot
You keep firing glances across the room
And I can't stop wondering
Just what you got
I get the feeling I'm gonna find out real soon

[Chorus]
But still I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger, feel like a stranger

[Bridge]
Know it's gonna get stranger
Some things I just know

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Yes and the wheel
Gets smoking 'round midnight
You shoot me a look that says "Let's go"
Yes and it feels
Just like running a red light
There ain't no point in looking behind us, no!

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like, I feel like a stranger
Feel it's gonna get stranger
So let's get on with the show, let's go!

[Bridge]
Ooh, I feel like a stranger
Ooh, just like, just like, just like a stranger
How about you?
(Feel like a stranger) Just like, you a stranger too
(Feel like a stranger) Ooh, just like a stranger
Just like, just like a stranger (Feel like a stranger)
Just like a stranger, just like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger) Ooh, just like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger) Ooh...

[It'll be a long, long, crazy, crazy night]
(Crazy night) Crazy night (I believe he's right)
(Feel like a stranger) Silky silky, crazy, crazy night
Long, long, crazy, crazy night 

[Long, long, long, crazy, crazy night]
(Feel like a stranger) 

[Gonna be a long, long...]
Long, long, crazy, crazy night
(Feel like a stranger)  

[Long, long, crazy, crazy night]
Long, long, crazy, crazy night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Gonna see some good times, gonna get to ring that bell
I'm gonna see some good times
Sometimes you make up for when I'm not feeling well
I must be due some great times
'Cause right now, 'cause right now I feel like hell

[Chorus]
Never trust a woman who wears her pants too tight
Never trust a woman who wears her pants too tight
She might love you tomorrow, but she'll be gone tomorrow night

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I say come tomorrow I'll get my pay and I'm gonna leave this town
Come tomorrow I'll get my pay and I'm gonna leave this fuckin' town
She don't really love me
Ain't no reason to stick around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Gonna see some good times, gonna get to ring that bell
Gonna see some good times
Sometimes you make up for when I'm not feeling well
I must be due some great times
But if they don't come, if they don't come
If they never come around
Oh, oh, oh, what the hell

[Verse 1]
There are times that you can beckon
There are times when you must call
You can shake a lot of reckoning
But you can't shake it all
There are times when I can help you out
And times when you must fall
There are times when you must live in doubt
And I can't help at all

[Chorus]
Three blue stars rise on the hill
Say no more, now, just be still
All these trials, soon be past
Show me something built to last

[Verse 2]
Wind held by the collar
Yes, a cloud held by the breeze
You can walk on coals of fire
But sometimes you must freeze
There are times when you offend me
And I do the same to you
If we can't or won't admit it
Then I guess we could be through

[Chorus]
One blue star sets on the hill
Call it back, you never will
One more star sinks in the past
Show me something built to last

[Verse 3]
Built to last until time itself
Falls tumbling from the wall
Built to last until sunshine fails
And darkness moves on all
Built to last while years roll past
Like cloudscapes in the sky
Show me something built to last
Or something built to try

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
There are times when you get hit upon
Try hard but you cannot give
Other times you'd gladly part
With what you need to live
Don't waste you breath to save your face
When you have done your best
And even more is asked of you
Let fate decide the rest

[Outro]
All the stars are gone but one
Morning breaks, here comes the sun
Cross the sky, now sinking fast
Show me something built to last

Three blue stars rise on the hill
Say no more, now, just be still
All these trials, soon be past
Look for something built to last

One blue star sets on the hill
Call it back, you never will
One more star now sinks in the past
Show me something built to last

All the stars are gone but one
Morning breaks, here comes the sun
Cross the sky, now sinking fast
Show me something built to last

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Chorus]
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

[Pre-Chorus]
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of men
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall, rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Just wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 2]
I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
And tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Verse 1 repeated]
It cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Just wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no
We'll be back in just a little bit

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light
Into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose
From the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the
Clouds of delusion

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
Through the transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Whoa-oh what I want to know
How does the song go?
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Verse 1]
Little girl lost
In a forest of dreams
It's a dark old wood
And it's damp with dew
Hoot owl hoots
For a moment it seems
Something big and cold
Has got ahold of you
Just when everything gets scary
Daddy's come around for his darling again
Hold my hand with your little fingers
Daddy's loving arms are going to gather you in

[Chorus]
Ain't no way the Boogeyman can get you
You can close your eyes, the world is going to let you
Your daddy's here and he never will forget you
I will take you home
I will take you home
Gonna carry you back home in my arms
I will take you home

[Verse 2]
Long is the road
We must travel on down
Short are the legs
That will struggle behind
I wish I knew for sure
Just where we were bound
What we will be doing
And what we're going to find
Wherever we go, there will be birds to cheer you
Flowers to color in the fields around
Wherever we go, I'll be right here near you
You can't get lost when you're always found

[Chorus]
Ain't no fog that's thick enough to hide you
Your daddy's going to be right here, right here beside you
If your fears should start to get inside you
I will take you home
I will take you home
Going to carry you back home in my arms
I will take you home

[Verse 1]
I need a woman about twice my age
A lady of nobility, gentility and rage
Splendor in the dark, lightning on the draw
We'll go right through the book and break each and every law

[Chorus]
I got a feeling, feeling today, oh yeah
Just one thing I got to say
I need a miracle every day

[Verse 2]
I need a woman about twice my height
Statuesque, raven-dressed, a goddess of the night
Her secret incantations, and a candle burning blue
We'll consult the spirits maybe they'll know what to do

[Chorus]
And it's real, believe me, oh yeah, oh yeah
I can't get around it and I can't run away
I need a miracle every day

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I need a woman about twice my weight
A ton of fun who packs a gun with all her freight
Find her in a sideshow leave her in LA
Ride her like a surfer riding on a tidal wave

[Chorus]
And it's real, believe me today oh yeah, yeah yeah
One more thing I got to say
I need a miracle every day
It takes dynamite to get me up
Too much of everything is just enough
One more thing I just got to say
I need a miracle every day
(I need a miracle every day) Every day
(I need a miracle every day) Must have a miracle
(I need a miracle every day) Some kind of miracle
(I need a miracle, need a miracle) Some kind of miracle
(I need a miracle every day) Must have a miracle
(I need a miracle every day) Mmm-hmm...
(I need a miracle every day) Some type of miracle, yeah
(I need a miracle, need a miracle)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Mirror shatters
In formless reflections
Of matter
Glass hand dissolving
To ice petal flowers
Revolving
Lady in velvet
Recedes
In the nights of goodbye

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Verse 1]
In the attics of my life
Full of cloudy dreams unreal
Full of tastes no tongue can know
And lights no eye can see
When there was no ear to hear
You sang to me

[Verse 2]
I have spent my life
Seeking all that's still unsung
Bent my ear to hear the tune
And closed my eyes to see
When there were no strings to play
You played to me

[Bridge]
In the book of love's own dream
Where all the print is blood
Where all the pages are my days
And all my nights grow old
When I had no wings to fly
You flew to me
You flew to me, to me

[Verse 3]
In the secret space of dreams
Where I dreaming lay amazed
When the secrets all are told
And the petals all unfold
When there was no dream of mine
You dreamed of me

[Verse 1]
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior’s breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

[Verse 2]
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Tell "A" for the ark, that wonderful boat
(And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Tell "B" for the beast at the ending of the wood
(Bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Will it eat all the children? That would not be good good
(We bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Walking in the valley in the shadow of death
(Bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
I remember right well, I remember right well
(We bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Oh, walking in Jerusalem just like John
(We bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Goodnight

[Verse 3]
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won’t you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

[Outro]
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
I wonder if you care?
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down under the sea
Try to see what's going down
Try to read between the lines
Had a feeling I was falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice a-calling
You was running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
Ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Until the sun goes down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling all sort of bad
Asked my family doctor about what I had
I said now, "Doctor (Doctor), Mister M.D., (Doctor)
Well, can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me? (Doctor)"

[Chorus]
He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need is good lovin'
Because you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Everybody got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
A little good lovin' now baby, good lovin'

[Verse 2]
Come on baby, oh, squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy to be alright?
I said now baby (Baby), now it's for sure (Baby)
I've got the fever (Baby), you got the cure (Baby)

[Chorus]
She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need is good lovin'
Because you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Everybody got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
A little good lovin' now baby, good lovin'

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Hey, got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Well, you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Come on now and give me good lovin' (Good lovin')

[Verse 1 repeated]
Well, I was feeling all sort of bad now
Asked my family doctor about what I had
I said now, "Doctor (Doctor), Mister M.D. (Doctor)
Oh, can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me? (Doctor)"

[Chorus]
He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need: good lovin'
Oh, you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Everybody got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Give me lovin' now baby (Good lovin')

[Verse 2 repeated]
Come on baby, squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy to be alright?
I said now baby (Baby), oh, it's for sure (Baby)
I've got the fever (Baby), you got the cure (Baby)

[Chorus]
She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need is good lovin'
Oh, you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Everybody got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
You need it, you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
I need it, I got to have love (Good lovin')
I need it... (Good lovin')
Gotta have it... (Good lovin')
Oh, I need it... (Good lovin')
...all I need (Good lovin')
Everybody got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Yes, you got have lovin' (Good lovin')
You got to have love (Good lovin')
Everybody got to have lovin' (Good lovin')

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon around
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
And never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
And if that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go;
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia & Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, and it burns my eyes to see;
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
And now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia & Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
There ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed that can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock you, baby, to and fro
Not too fast, and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Verse 1]
Starve, magic mirror
I thought the crumbs of your life wouldn't dry
It hurts to see clearer
Falling like needles, the passage of time

[Chorus]
Would it hurt, would it hurt to be nearer?
Heaven is stitching across me
My chest is the crossing
The blood is parting all the time, but I don't mind

[Verse 2]
Carve magic dealer
Bring me the company I couldn't buy
As I go cleaner
Falling like needles, the passage of time

[Chorus]
Would it help, would it help to go deeper?
I am the photograph in you
The photograph in you
Still as the moment we're lying in right now

[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (Forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (Forever, forever, forever)
Everybody, everybody, the Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Now say this, forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes? Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask, if you talkin' 'bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name "Porsche" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is "Minivan"
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (Forever, forever)
Uh, throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (Forever, forever, forever)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Now say this, forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh, I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later, seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
Throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though, I still speak from my soul
Wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
Came in the game, he made his own lane
All I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, you need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
Father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds, throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, "Pssh, we messed up"
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
Studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like "Amen"
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

[Chorus: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (Forever, forever)
Uh, throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (Forever, forever, forever)
Uh, the Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Ho! I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment, uh
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: "Dawg, in due time!"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Uh, I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Oh! We gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day we die, we gon' touch the sky

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Now let's take 'em high
(Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world!)
Everybody take 'em high
(Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world!)
Now let's take 'em high
(Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world!)
Now let's take 'em high
(Top of the world, baby, top-top of the world!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like, "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now, I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
Yeah, 'fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, Lupe, touch the sky
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco & Kanye West]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd (Uh-huh)
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb (Yeah)
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth (Uh)
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge (Yeah)
To come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Kanye West]
You gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
'Fore the day you die (What?), you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly (What? What? What?)
Yeah, 'til the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Post-Chorus: Both, Kanye West & Lupe Fiasco]
Now everybody throw your hands up
Uh, I'm sky high, say I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high, I'm, I'm sky high
(Everybody throw your hands up)
I'm, I'm sky high, I'm, I'm sky high
Sky, uh, sky high, I'm, I'm sky high

[Outro: Kanye West & Lupe Fiasco]
We back at home, baby! Yeah
We back at home? Yeah, yeah
Make some noise for Lupe Fiasco right quick, yeah
Feels good to be home
Feels good to be home
Feels good to be home
Feels good to be home
Chi-town
Feels good to be home
Yeah, woo!

[Intro: Kanye West & Choir]
La la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah
That's that crack music, crack music
That real black music
La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah
Uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearin'
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure, man
Put the CD on your tongue, yeah, that's pure, man

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir]
Uh, that's that crack music, crack music
Yeah, that real black music
La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah
Yeah, uh, yeah, that's that crack music, crack music
Yeah, that real black music, black music
La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
From the place where the father's gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the Madigan's lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say, we just tryin' to party holmes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda raised they whole quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause
'Cause, dreams of being Hova
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' a President, look there's hope, man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks, man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin'
Yeah, and this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir]
Uh, crack music, crack music
Yeah, that real black music, black music
La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah
Yeah, uh, uh, listen, that's that crack music, crack music
Yeah, that real black music
La la la la la la la lah, la la la la la lah

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
You know, man, how good it feels to have strings for that chorus?

[Outro: Kanye West]
How could you let this happen?
Happen? Happen? Happen? Happen?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How’d he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin’
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls, a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin’ to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me don’t rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
What it do?

[Scratches: A-Trak & Kanye West]
What it do? What–what it do?
What–what it do? What it–what it do? Wh–what it do?
Wh–what it do? What it do?
Wh–what it do? Wh–what it do?
What it–what it do? Wh–what it do?
Wh–what it do? Wh–what it do? (You never know, homie)
Wh–what it do? Wh–what it do?

[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]
Drive slow, homie, homie, homie
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow, homie, home, homie
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow, homie, homie, homie
Live today, ’cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I’m the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious (Uh-huh)
I got the custom grill (Yeah), I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, it's evident
You see a player flicking, now how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit? (Just a lil bit)
I got my custom kings, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green (Now what?)
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder's quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, so this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow

[Chorus: Kanye West, GLC & Both]
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow
Drive slow, drive slow

[Outro: Kanye West, GLC & Both]
What up, y'all?
That's GLC in the buildin'
It's G.O.O.D. Music, baby
We love
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
You know, you know I enjoy bein' here
And I love doin' songs from the new album, but
I gotta do a joint that, if it wasn't for this one right here
I would've never made it this far
Let's see if y'all remember this joint right here

[Intro (Over Chorus): Kanye West & Audience]
Now if the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Throw your diamonds in the air, keep your diamonds in the air
Your diamonds in the air, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk–
Through the fire, through whatever, come what–
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all–
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizz-ork
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Interlude (Over Chorus): Kanye West]
Yeah, through the limits, to the wall
If y'all know this, sing along with it
What? I hear you, I hear you, I hear you
Through the– uh, through whatever, come
I can't hit that note either, fam
Yeah
Uh, uh, question

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It's more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If y'all could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
There's a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised
It's been an accident like GEICO
Y'all thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
I look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so we turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the–
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it–
Through the fire, through whatever, come what–
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Outro (Over Chorus): Kanye West & Audience]
Yeah, say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Now throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Keep your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Now keep your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the buildin', say, "Hell yeah" (Hell yeah)
Keep your diamonds in the air, keep your diamonds in the air
Your diamonds in the air, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Let's go!
One, and two, and three, and four, and get them sit-ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give–, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh, she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and–
Uh, what's scary to me
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night, I came
I came, I came, I came

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now, it's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
Unless she's talkin' 'bout freakin' out
Baby, we can work it out
C'mon, work it out, let me hear you say, work it out
Let me hear you say (Work it out)
I gotta hear you say (Work it out now)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, say what? (Maybe we can work it out)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ooh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said, "Get It Wet"
Ooh, girl, your breath is harsh
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks, yeah, I bought them cars
Still kill a nigga on 16 (Bars)
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day, girl, we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies (Now)
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit, girl, I'll still hit it, girl
One and, you brought two friends
Okay, three more, now hop in the Benz
Four-door: do y'all know the difference between a five, six– uh
Say, all the mocha lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in 'fore you start back datin'
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballers, uh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
Unless she talkin' 'bout freakin' out
Then maybe we can work it out
C'mon, work it out, let me hear you say (Work it out)
I need to hear you say (Work it out)
I gotta hear you say (Work it out now)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, say what? (Maybe we can work it out)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things they seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
That nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And people gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' on cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I can't figure it out, bring the drums in now, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
That nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Kanye West]
Uh, and I heard 'em say
With every worthless word, we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe (What?)
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Outro: John Legend & Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Yeah, and I heard 'em say
Yeah, A-Trak
John Legend, ladies and gentlemen
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
I heard 'em say
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
I heard them say
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Nothing's ever promised, no, no
Yeah, Tracey, I know how much you like John
I told y'all I'd bring you a surprise
Thank you!

[Verse 1]
I've waited for moments of clarity
Sleepwalkin’ through life like a daydream
Time's not on our side and you are out my mind
I'm free falling through my heart’s vacancy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't give up on what we've got

[Chorus]
Even though fate never goes our way
I'm gonna, gonna get to you anyway
(Don't give up on what we've got)
When the signs say that we're insane
I'm gonna, gonna love you anyway
(Don’t give up on what we’ve got)

[Post-Chorus]
I'm gonna love, I’m gonna love
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love
I’m gonna love you anyway

[Verse 2]
I'm callin' out, can you hear me?
'Cause the silence is deafening
No matter how we try
We're in a different place and time
But what we have is too good to release

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't give up on what we've got

[Chorus]
Even though fate never goes our way
I'm gonna, gonna get to you anyway
(Don't give up on what we've got)
When the signs say that we're insane
I'm gonna, gonna love you anyway
(Don't give up on what we've got)

[Post-Chorus]
I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love you anyway

[Bridge]
Don't give up on what we've got
(On what we've got, on what we've got)
Don't give up on what we've got

[Chorus]
Even though fate never goes our way
I'm gonna, gonna get to you anyway
(Don't give up on what we've got)
When the signs say that we're insane
I'm gonna, gonna love you anyway
(Don't give up on what we've got)

[Post-Chorus]
I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love you anyway
I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love you anyway

Get you off for free or put him on the payroll
Don't you do nothing for free, never ever ever, ever
Fuck all your friends, they don't want us together-ether
Stack up you some bands and settle-settle

[Verse 1]
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

[Verse 2]
Up on the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

[Verse 3]
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

[Verse 4]
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

[Verse 5]
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

[Outro]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Of Penny Lane
You thought I was rich
And I am but not how you think
I live in a Tudor house
Under the freeway in Mar Vista by the beach
When you call I take my phone to the picnic table
That I bought from the Rose Bowl
And I listen to the rushing cars above
And I think about the last time you visited me
The last time we made love
How the noise got louder and louder during rush hour
Until it sounded like the sea
And it felt like the ocean was the sky
And that I was flying because you were two feet taller than me
Until you took me in your arms
And I could touch the stars
And they all fell down around my head
And I became an angel
And you put me to bed
Happy

People think that I'm rich and I am but not how they think
I have a truck with a gold key chain in the ignition
And on the back it says: happy,  joyous, and free
Happy
And when I drive
I think about the last time my friends were driving with me
How the radio was so loud that I couldn't hear the words
So we became the music
Happy
They write that I'm rich and I am but not how they think
I have a safe I call the boyfriend box
And in it every saved receipt
Every movie theater ticket just to remind me
Of all the things I've loved and lost and loved again
Unconditionally
Happy

You joke that I'm rich and I am but not how you think
I live in a Tudor house under the freeway
Off of Rose Avenue, 12 blocks from the beach
And when you call I put your sweater on
And put you on speaker
And chat for hours underneath the trees
And think about the last time you were here lying next to me
How the noise from the cars got louder and louder
During rush hour
Until it sounded like a river or a stream
And it felt like we were swimming
But it wasn't just a dream
We were just

Happy

[Intro]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Jet
Jet

[Verse 1]
Jet, I can almost remember
The funny faces
That time you told 'em
That you were gonna be marrying soon

[Pre-Chorus]
And Jet, I thought
The only lonely place was on the moon

[Chorus]
Jet, ooh
Jet, ooh

[Verse 2]
Jet, was your father as bold
As a Sergeant Major?
How come he told you
That you were hardly old enough yet?

[Pre-Chorus]
And Jet, I thought the Major
Was a Lady Suffragette

[Chorus]
Jet, ooh
Jet, ooh

[Bridge]
Ah, mater, I want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later
Ooh, she said
She said

Was a Lady Suffragette

[Chorus]
Jet, ooh
Jet, ooh

[Bridge]
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, you know I want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later
Whoo, she said

[Verse 3]
Jet, with the wind in your hair
Of a thousand laces
Climb on the back and we'll
Go for a ride in the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
And Jet, I thought the Major
Was a Lady Suffragette

[Chorus]
Jet, ooh
Jet, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
And yeah, don't you know that I
I thought you was a little Lady Suffragette

[Outro]
Jet, ooh
My little lady
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

People, people

Someone's knockin' at the door

Come on, come on, let 'em in
Oh, let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in, yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Agnes, just stop and think a minute
Why don't you light that cigarette and
Come down now, stop and breathe a second?
Go back to the very beginning
Can't you see what was different then?
You were just popping Percocet
Maybe just four a week at best
Maybe it's sworn to clear the head

[Pre-Chorus]
Your head is so numb, that nervous breath you try to hide
Between the motions, that trembling tender little sigh
And so it goes, a choking rose back
To be reborn, I want to hold you like you're mine

[Chorus]
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why

[Verse 2]
You see the sad in everything
A genius of love and loneliness and
This time, you overdid the liquor
This time, you pulled the fucking trigger
These days, you're rolling all the time
So low, so you keep getting high
Where went that cheeky friend of mine?
Where went that billion dollar smile?

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess life is long when soaked in sadness
On borrowed time from Mister Madness
And so it goes, a choking rose back
To be reborn, I want to hold you like you're mine

[Chorus]
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why
You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why

[Intro: The Kid LAROI]
I'm tryna do it, so
People who are making dope shit can literally do the same as me
But in order to do that, the world needs to open up to Australia first
There's a lot of things in Australia that people have misconceptions about
And I say that breaking those barriers is the key to opening up Australia to the world
Cause it's not all like, Kangaroos and deadly animals and shit
Yeah, Australia needs somebody that
Nah, a group of people that
I guess open up everything for the rest of the people
(World first)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I've been movin' so damn quickly
I've been getting in my bag, I guess
Ooh, execute the plan all day
I can't get caught in all the games, I got no plans to rest
Ooh, not until I pass the test
Let me tell you that
I've been movin', I've been movin'

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
Move
I swear to God I've been on the move
It feel like I'm livin' out a movie
Almost like it's too good to be true
Now I can't lose, no more
Blue ticks in my inbox, silver tick  the hat
Like a dog from the pound boy
I done came from out the back, yeah
Motherfuckin' high stats, I'm on a song with Skies
I'm winnin' in real life

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I've been movin' so damn quickly
I've been getting in my bag, I guess
Ooh, execute the plan all day
I can't get caught in all the games, I got no plans to rest
Ooh, not until I pass the test
Let me tell you that
I've been movin', I've been on movin'

[Verse 2: Lil Skies]
Listen
I secure the bag, I'm poppin' tags, I guess
Shawty lookin' from the side, I'm 'bout the bags, you bitch
Yeah, my doors are suicide, she tried to crash the whip
I'ma motherfuckin' spend it, nigga, look at how I'm livin'
Made it because I'm gifted
I told my momma, "Stop trippin, I'm putting food in the kitchen"
Times I thought I lost it, I asked God for forgiveness
Niggas acting like bitches and we ain't with all the bitchin'!
Yeah, mad 'cause my money long
I'ma make right my wrongs
I'ma get high, no bongs
It's lit, light
And she gon' suck me off
Baby girl neck too strong
Tell me she love my songs
I hit, aight

[Bridge: The Kid LAROI]
Bet you was talking down
I got them talkin' now
I guess it's workin' now
It's lit, light
What ever goes around
Finally comes back around
And back and back around

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I've been movin' so damn quickly
I've been getting in my bag I guess
Ooh, execute the plan all day
I can't get caught in all the games, I got no plans to rest
Ooh, not until I pass the test
Let me tell you that
I've been movin', I've been movin'

[Outro: The Kid LAROI]
Movin', movin'

Ayy, I've been in my pack, yeah

Cause you know I really do need ya

Put you on lingo cause Takeoff a teacher
All of my niggas sound like they got fevers
Look at that 

[?] when we pullin' up, its nice to meet ya
My vehicle talk to a creature

Won't do no talkin' like Peter but bop off
Ridin' with the top off, me and my sawed off

Go to the booth and I turn to Clark Kent
I'm a criminal bitch, know it come with this shit
Got the Glock on yo hip and I dab with that shit
Beat the pot with a fork like it's a fist
I just spent ten thousand on my fit
Never stoppin', run and go get the profit
Pocket watcher 

[?]
Don't talk to me 'bout the plug when I'm the socket
Beat a nigga with my ice on like hockey
We from the store
Paint you a picture like art
I might feed you to the shark
Plug on the boat Noah's ark
It's time to ride in that wraith
My new bitch took that whole play
I'm whippin' up fish like filet
Put my dick in her mouth like Colgate
We gon' fuck on that bitch and don't lay
SK AK we don't play
Made a million off Jose
Sellin' mayo like OJ

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Slob on my bro, hop on my boat
Front you a four, come by the stoe
Get you some blow, stack you some dough
Fuck you some hoes, put on yo bros
Bring me my key, I'm at the door
Take a .4, pour up a four
Way from the start, I was goin' hard
I'm goin' hard, oh so hard

[Verse 1]
How many lovers can one man do?
Too many numbers, how 'bout you?
Sure hard to handle if more than two
Soon as you lock eyes, then you're screwed
But I go and say too much
I don't pay no mind enough

[Chorus]
I may be a bastard in your eyes
But I ain't fucking with all of those lies
Forever alone, I pay the price
Cause I ain't fucking with all of those lies
But I don't mind, waste your time
All of your beating is feeding me mine
Forever alone, I pay the price
Cause I ain't fucking with all of those lies

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Everyone looking for something true
Someone to love and be loved by too
Hard to get old when love is new
Never can tell what the love will do
But I go and say too much
I don't pay no mind enough

[Chorus]
I may be a bastard in your eyes
But I ain't fucking with all of those lies
Forever alone, I pay the price
Cause I ain't fucking with all of those lies
But I don't mind, waste your time
All of your beating is feeding me mine
Forever alone, I pay the price
Cause I ain't fucking with all of those, all of those, all of those lies

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Lazy lightning
That sleepy fire in your eyes
Is that desire in disguise
I keep on trying but I
I can't get through
Lazy lightning
I'd like to find the proper potion
To try to capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Just a loop of lazy lighting
Must admit you're kind of frightening
But you really get me high

[Verse 2]
Lazy lightning
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to
Lazy lightning
The way you're messing with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasing
Tell me a lie and I will swear
I will swear it's true

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Liquid loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening
You're a loop of lazy lightning

[Bridge]
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Rope of fire ever tightening (Tightening)
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
It's either lunacy or lightning
It's frightening
Loop of lazy lightning (Hoo)

[Verse 3]
Lazy lightning
They say you never start the same place
I want a double dose in my case
I'd fly a kite if I thought
Thought that would do

[Outro]
Lazy lightning
The way you always electrify me
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightning will be
My lightning, my lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Either lunacy or lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
The possibilities are frightening
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Hey, my lightning too
(My lightning too)
Come on, come on, lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Hey, my lightening too
(My lightning too)
Hey, my lightening too
(My lightning too)
Woo
(My lightning too)

[Verse 1]
Woo, dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel now
Got to help me
Well, I need some indication, good Lord, is it real now
Got to tell me, girl, now
Well, I've heard it said, baby, there's something wrong with my head now
Got to help me, girl, now
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

[Outro]
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It's sparking my imagination
Who gon' fight me now
'Cause me such excitation
Well, you got to like me now
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
My lightning too, my lightning too, my lightning too
Hey, my lightning too, my lightning too

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert
Raised in a lion's den
See, I was born in a desert
Raised in a lion's den
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Said I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
See, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
You know she wished she would

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
See, now, the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
Say now, the doctor call me crazy, and sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
But I tell ya, the preacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Chorus]
'Cause I was born in a desert
Raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert
Raised in a lion's den
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Said I was born in a desert
Raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert
Raised in a lion's den
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men
Said my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
Come on you pretty women
With your hair hanging down
Open up your windows
'Cause the Candyman's in town
Come on, boys, and wager
Roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven, boys
I'll take your money home

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes 'round again

[Verse 2]
I come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
Be one less man alive
Good morning, Mr. Benson
I see you're doing well
If I had me a shotgun
I'd blow you straight to hell

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Come on, boys, and wager
If you have got the mind
If you got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line
Hand me my old guitar
Pass the whiskey around
Want you to tell everybody you meet
The Candyman's in town

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 1]
Firefly, can you see me?
Shine on, glowing, brief and brightly
Could you imagine? One summer day
That same night be on your way
Do you remember? Hearts were too cold
The seasons have frozen us into our souls
People were saying the whole world is burning
Ashes have scattered too hard to turn it

[Chorus]
Upside out or inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Passenger, don't you hear me?
Destination seen unclearly
What is a man deep down inside
What a raging beast with nothing to hide

[Chorus]
Upside out or inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox falls down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin’ down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he stepped into the bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin’ down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over, and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack in Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin’ down
It looks like the old man’s gettin' on

[Verse 5]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won’t you come to me?"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on
And it looks like the old man’s gettin' on

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Caroline
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
Had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabama
The Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

Thank you, we're gonna take a short break, and you can too

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, you know he couldn't believe his mind
Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said tell me where your strength lies, if you please
Then she spoke so kind, talked so fair
That Samson said, Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever has lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got hands up round that lion's jaws
Then he ripped that beast, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
Great God almighty, talk

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down


I'm gonna walk right out here on the front of the stage and say 'hello' to everybody back there

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I’m still alive
Ain't no luck, I learned to duck

Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
Uncle Sam, that’s who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand
Of P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan
Light your fuse, shine your shoes
Can you use them old U.S. Blues?
Drink your health, share your wealth
Run your life, steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Back to back chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
Call this song the United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
My my my, my, my oh my, oh my, oh my
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my


Thank y'all, good evening

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles and a ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Drink all day and rock all night
Law come to get you if you don't walk right
Got a letter this morning, people, and all it read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Catch a few winks, baby, down under the bed
Then head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 3]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he, he turned to me and he said:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

I woke up a-feeling mean
Went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around and the letters read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
And I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
It's going to be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Been so long I felt this way
And time sure passin' slow
Still I know I lead the way
They tell me where I go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me
While standing on the beach, the sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will ride to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)

And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory going to be my name
And people to light my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me
It's gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
This afternoon, streets turned gray
And I watch the fire below
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no

[Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I go
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, don't worry 'bout me

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
I can tell your future
Oh, just look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]
Lady with a Fan

Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
'Til my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'Til things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

While the fire, it all forms
Smoke flies and they all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster

[Instrumental break]

The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master

[Instrumental break]

Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

Terrapin Station

Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best (Oh)
From the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - if it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - but the train's put it's brakes on
Terrapin - and the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Waffles are better (Ooh, ooh)
Waffles are better (Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
I don't eat breakfast much
But niggas look at me like I'm breakfast, lunch, and
Dinner motherfucker, makin' bread croissants
And Captain Crunch and
Eggs and lucks and
Wakin' up at seven
Just to get to work I'm eatin' Eggo's, like eleven
I don't even really wanna give the wrong impression
But he all up in my kitchen
And it look like Armageddon
He could tell it's an addiction
So I tell him my obsession
Then I fling open the fridge and ask
That nigga one question (Yeah)
'Ayy you like waffles?' (This nigga)

[Bridge]
Waffles are better
Waffles are better (Ah, ah)
Waffles are better nigga
Waffles (Fuck pancakes)
Fuck pancakes

[Verse 2]
Waffle power
Waffle power
I could eat waffles in the shower
Make it in a heart shape or a flower
All you eat is pancakes, you're a coward
I could eat a thousand in one hour
Stack 'em all up and climb the tower
Keep your damn pancakes, waffles ours
Man, fuck pancakes, they make me sick
I mean it's like I'm eatin' donuts, it's way too thick
Kinda like my lifestyle, man, it's way too rich
I don't know why you like crepes, man, they way too thin

[Bridge]
And I just want it crispy
That chicken on it dripping in honey
I know what you're missing
If you ain't with me then you're tripping honey

[Chorus]
Waffles are better (Ba da da da ba da da da da)
Waffles are better (Ba da da da ba da da da da)

[Outro]
Fuck pancakes, they taste like shit
They taste like shit, they taste like shit
Fuck pancakes, they taste like shit
They taste like shit, they taste like shit
Waffles are better (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah
Like ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah
Waffles are better (Ooh, ooh)
Waffles are better

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]
Old man down, way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty, asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine, more than my maker, though he's no friend of mine

Everyone said, I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life, I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

But I'll get back on my feet again someday
The good Lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

I'll get up and fly away, I'll get up and fly away, fly away

Pearly's been true, true to me, true to my dying day he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Instrumental break]

Got up and wandered, wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl, named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Verse 1]
I went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's going to be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Woo! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night now
Saturday night!

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the whole place going to fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Woo! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night now
Saturday night!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I turn on Channel Six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I got no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, put on your rocking shoes

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night now!
One more Saturday night now
Saturday night!

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Woo, now! Saturday Night now!
One more Saturday night now
Ow, Saturday night!

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
You've been putting it down now (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night now
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
Ow! Ow! (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, ow!

Thank you

Jack Straw, ladies and gentlemen
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin', my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia & Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
And one's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
And now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia & Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
There ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you come up no more

Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock your baby to and fro
Not too fast, and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
You see, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
Know she wish she would

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Well now, the doctor call me crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
See now, the doctor call me crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
Well, the preacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Verse 3]
See now, a couple of shots of whiskey, women round here start lookin' good
See now, a couple of shots of whiskey, women round here start lookin' good
Well, couple more shots of whiskey, I'm goin' down to Minglewood

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men
(Do it again) Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
Come on all you pretty women
With your hair a-hanging down
Open up your windows
'Cause the Candyman's in town
Come on, boys, and gamble
Roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven, boys
I'll take your money home

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 2]
I just come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
Be one less man alive
Good mornin', Mr. Benson
I see you're doing well
If I had me a shotgun
I'd blow you straight to hell

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman Comes around again

[Instrumental break]

[Harmonizing]

[Verse 3]
Come on, boys, and wager
If you have got the mind
If you got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line
Hand me my old guitar
Pass the whiskey 'round
Want you to tell everybody you meet
That the Candyman's in town

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin’
You were gone, oh gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
But it's alright 'cause I love you
And that’s not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from the cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
They're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only want to hold you, I don't want to tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It’s just that I, oh I, have gotten used to havin’ you around
My landscape would be empty, if you were gone

[Chorus]
But it's alright ’cause I love you
And that's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letter of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
Brave the storm to come, 'cause it looks like rain
Ooh, here comes the rain
Ooh, here comes the rain, oh
(Brave the storm to come)
Here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Yes, I believe it’s gonna rain, 'cause here comes the rain
Here come the pain
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here come the rain
I believe it's gonna rain today
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here come the rain
Yes, I believe it's gonna rain today
(Brave the storm to come)
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh, oh
Here come the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Whole world's gonna rain
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh, oh
Here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Yes, I believe it's gonna rain today
Oh, and it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh, oh, oh, oh
Here comes the rain
Here comes the rain (Brave the storm to come)
Here comes the rain
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Here comes the rain
1948, Christmas Eve, with a full moon over town
Stagger Lee shot Billy DeLions
And he blew that poor boy down
Do you know what he shot him for?
What do you make of that?
Billy DeLions threw the lucky dice
Won Stagger Lee's Stetson hat
Bayo, Bayo, tell me how can this be?
You arrest the girls for turning tricks
But you're scared of Stagger Lee
Stagger Lee's a madman and he shot my Billy D
Bayo, go get him or give the job to me

Delia DeLions, dear sweet Delia D
How the hell could I arrest him? He's twice as big as me
Well, don't ask me to go downtown, I won't come back alive
Not only is that mother big, he packs a .45
Bayo, Delia said, just give me a gun
He shot my Billy dead, now I'm going to see him hung
She went into the DeLion's club through Billy DeLions blood
Stepped up to Stagger Lee at the bar
Said, "Buy me a gin fizz, love"

[Instrumental break]

Stagger Lee lit a cigarette, she shot him in the balls
Pulled on her revolver, had him dragged to city hall
Bayo, Bayo, see you hang him high
He shot my Billy dead, and now he's got to die
Delia went a-walking down on Singapore Street
A three-piece band on the corner played "Near My God to Thee"
Well, Delia whistled a different tune, what tune could it be?
The song that Delia sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"
The song that woman sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"
The song that Delia sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"
The song that woman sung, "Look Out Stagger Lee"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I need a woman about twice my age
A lady of gentility, nobility and rage
Splendor in the dark, lightning on the draw
We'll go right through the book and break each and every law

[Chorus]
And it's real, believe what I say, hold on
One more thing I just got to say
I need a miracle every day

[Verse 2]
I need a woman about twice my height
Statuesque, raven-dressed, a goddess of the night
Her secret incantations, a candle burning blue
Tell it to the Lord in our midnight rendezvous

[Chorus]
And it's real, believe what I say, hold on
One more thing I've got to say
I need a miracle every day

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I need a woman about twice my weight
A ton of fun who packs a gun with all her other freight
Find her in a sideshow leave her in LA
Ride her like a surfer riding on a tidal wave

[Chorus]
And it's real, believe what I say, well, hold on
One thing more I got to say
I need a miracle every day
It takes dynamite to get me up
Too much of everything is just enough
One more thing I got to say
I need a miracle every day

[Bridge]
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle, I need a miracle)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle, I need a miracle)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle, I need a miracle)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle, I need a miracle)

[Verse 1]
Now, baby used to stay all night long
Made me cry, Lord, she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, and that's no lie
Tables turnin’, now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it’s all over now (Over now)
Yeah, I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Verse 2]
Lord, I used to wake up in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I got worried, Lord, she eased my achin' head
But now she's here and there with every man in town
Still tryin' to take me for that same old clown

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)
And I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Well, she used to run around with every man in town
Spend all my money, Lord, out playing her high class game
Put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Table’s turnin’, now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
’Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)
Yes, and I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Now, baby used to stay all night long
Made me cry, Lord, she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, baby, that's no lie
Tables turnin’, now it's her turn to cry

'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)
Yes, and I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now, over now)

Yes, and I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It'd probably burn off both your little ears

It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play, people
And please play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
And tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play, children
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round

Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Get up, get out, get out of the door
You're playin' cold music on the bar room floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Verse 2]
Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat
You say it's a livin', we all gotta eat
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete
If mercy's a business, I wish it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Long distance runner, what you holdin' out for?
Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door
The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor
You gave all you had. why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
To that thin line beyond which you really can't fake

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Verse 1]
You tell me this town ain't got no heart
The sunny side of the street is dark
Maybe that's because it's midnight
In the dark of the moon besides

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
You know you got such dark eyes!

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just got to poke around

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You think you've seen this town clear through
Nothing here that could interest you
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
It's not because you missed out
On the thing that we had to start

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Or just over-played your part

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just got to poke around

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York has got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She's lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
Well, I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, no no no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
Well, I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Hey, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar
In the end there's just a song, comes crying up the night
Through all the broken dreams and shattered years

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 2]
I’ve stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel, can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Gonna make them shine (Shine)

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see
There’s just the pavement left and broken dreams
And when you hear that song come crying like the wind
It seems like all this life was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Chorus]
Well, the joint was jumping, going around and around
Hey, now reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
Well, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well, it sounded sweet, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat now, 'cause I had to dance
Started moving my feet now, yes and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, now reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, at twelve o'clock now, oh the place was packed
The front doors was locked now, 'cause that place was packed
But when the police knocked, well, them old doors they flew back

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Woo, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound, y'all
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1 repeated]
Well, it sounded so sweet y'all, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat y'all, yes I had to dance
Started moving my feet y'all, well yes and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Ooh, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound, y'all
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Ooh, they never stopped rocking, going around and around now, y'all
Woo, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound, y'all
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around now, y'all
Woo, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound, y'all
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Outro]
No, they never stopped, they never stopped rocking
Going around and around and 'round
They were reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound, y'all
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
They never stopped rocking, going around and around
Reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound, y'all
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Woo, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound, y'all
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
Ooh, they never stopped rocking, going around and around, y'all
Reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
Ooh, they never stopped rocking, going around and around, y'all
Reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound, y'all
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

Thank you

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia & Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, and it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightnin' out of Sante Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia & Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
In another time's forgotten space
Your eyes looked through your mother’s face
Wildflower seed on the sand and stone
May the four winds blow you safely home

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Tell you where the four winds dwell
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
Can ring like fire if you lose your way

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Verse 3]
God save the child who rings that bell
Might have one good ring, baby, you can't tell
One watch by night, one watch by day
If you get confused, listen to the music play

[Instrumental break]

Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice you’re gonna harvest wind

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
I'll tell you where the four winds sleep
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wildflower seed in the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
You'd better roll away (Roll away) the dew
You'd better roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away the dew (Roll away)
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew (Roll away)
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their other men

[Verse 1]
Said I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well now, the doctor call me crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
See now, the doctor call me crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
Well, the preacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Verse 3]
See now, a couple of shots of whiskey, women 'round here start lookin' good
A couple of shots of whiskey, these New York girls start lookin' good
Couple more shots of whiskey, I'm goin' down to Minglewood

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
Well, it's T for Texas, yes and it's T for Timbuktu
Well, it's T for Texas, yes it is T for Timbuktu
Yes and it's T for New York City
Where the little girls know what to do

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women's from their other men
(And now do it, do it again) Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their other men

[Verse 1]
You told me goodbye, how was I to know
You didn't mean goodbye, you meant please don't let me go?

[Chorus]
I was having a high time, living the good life
Well, I know

[Verse 2]
The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay
Now listen here, baby, 'cause I mean what I say

[Chorus]
I'm having a hard time, living the good life
Well, I know

[Bridge]
I was losing time, I had nothing to do
No one to fight, I came to you
Wheels broke down, the leader won't draw
The line is busted, the last one I saw

[Verse 3]
Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain
Now don't think too hard, baby, 'cause you know what I'm saying

[Chorus]
I could show you a high time, living the good life
Don't be that way

[Verse 4]
Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong
Come on in when it's raining, go on out when it's gone

[Outro]
We could have us a high time, living the good life
Well, I know

[Verse 1]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 2]
Will you marry me pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me pretty Peggy-O?
If you will marry me, I'll set your cities free
And free all the ladies of the area-O

[Verse 3]
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you but your guineas are too few
And I fear my mama would be angry-O

[Verse 4]
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink
Saw me riding at the head of my soldiers-O

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, your cities I will burn
Destroy all the ladies in the area-O

[Verse 6]
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, holding back your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to your William-O

[Verse 7]
Sweet William he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William he is dead and he died for a maid
And he's buried in the Louisiana country-O

[Verse 8]
We rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three

[Verse 1]
You say you want to try again, wear it down between the lines
Well, I have a better end in mind

[Chorus]
It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see, though I know you don't mean to be
You are so far from me

[Verse 2]
There was something I had caught inside, screaming hard to make it go
And tied me down low

[Chorus]
It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see, you have been all you'll be to me
It's just too late
And we can't relate at all

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see, though I know you don't mean to be
You are so far from me

[Outro]
This time's the last time I want to say so long (So long)
This song is my last song for you
There's just nothing here to hold on to, baby (Hold on to)
Nothing to hold on to

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin’
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
But it's all right 'cause I love you, and that’s not going to change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from the cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
They're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only want to hold you, I don't want to tie you down, no
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It’s just that I, I, have gotten used to havin’ you around
My landscape would be empty, if you were gone

[Chorus]
But it's alright ’cause I love you, and that's not going to change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
Yes, it looks like rain
The storm is comin' ’cause it looks like rain
Surely rain, it looks like rain
Yes, it looks like rain
Well, the storms are comin' 'cause here come the rain
'Cause here come the rain
Well, it looks like rain and it feels like rain, Lord
Here come the rain
Yes, it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh Lord
Here come the rain
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh Lord
Here comes the rain
I believe it's gonna rain today
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh Lord
Here comes the rain
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh, oh
Here comes the rain
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh Lord, oh
Here comes the rain

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying leonardo
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I’m gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
The sun gonna shine on my back door someday
Gonna shine, gonna shine on my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I’m gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms


Thank y'all
We're gonna take a short break, we'll be back in a few minutes
So everybody hang loose

[Verse 1]
Inside you're burning
I can see clear through
Your eyes tell more than you mean them to
Lit up and flashing
Like the reds and blues
Out there on the neon avenue

[Chorus]
But I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger

[Verse 2]
Well, the music's thundering
We're restless and hot
You keep on firing glances across the room
And I can't stop wondering
Just what you got
I get the feeling I'm gonna find out real soon

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger
You know it's gonna get stranger
So let's get on with the show
Let's go

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Yes and the wheel
Gets smoking 'round midnight
You shoot me a look that says "Let's go"
Yes and it feels
Just like running a red light
Well, there ain't no point in looking behind us, no!

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger, like a stranger
You know it's gonna get stranger
If it's love then how would I know?
How would I know?
If it's real love then how would I know?
How would I know? How would I know?
If it's real love then how would I know?

Feel like a stranger, like a stranger
Feel like a stranger, like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like, feel like a stranger, stranger
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel, feel, feel like a stranger, like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger)

[It's gonna be a long long crazy crazy night]
Feel like a stranger 

[Crazy night]
(Feel like a stranger)

[It's gonna be a long long crazy crazy night]
Feel like a stranger 

[Crazy night]
(Feel like a stranger)

[It's gonna be a long long crazy crazy night]
Silky silky crazy crazy night
(Feel like a stranger)

[It's gonna be a long long crazy crazy night]
Silky silky crazy crazy night
Hey, crazy night; hey crazy night
Silky silky crazy crazy night
Hey, crazy night 

[Crazy night]
Hey, crazy night 

[Crazy night]
Silky crazy crazy night (Feel like a stranger)
It's gonna be a long long crazy crazy night

[Long crazy crazy night]
Hey, crazy night 

[Feel like a stranger]
Gonna be a long long crazy crazy
Silky crazy crazy, silky silky crazy crazy night

[Feel like a stranger]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I told Althea I was feeling lost
Lacking in some direction
Althea told me upon scrutiny
My back might need protection
I told Althea that treachery
Was tearing me limb from limb
Althea told me: now cool down boy
Settle back easy Jim

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You may be Saturday's child all grown
Moving with a pinch of grace
You may be a clown in the burying ground
Or just another pretty face
You may be the fate of Ophelia
Sleeping and perchance to dream
Honest to the point of recklessness
Self centered to the extreme

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Ain't nobody messing with you but you
Your friends are getting most concerned
Loose with the truth
Maybe it's your fire
But baby I hope you don't get burned
When the smoke has cleared, she said
That's what she said to me
You're going to want a bed to lay your head
And a little sympathy

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
There are things you can replace
And others you cannot
The time has come to weigh those things
This space is getting hot
You know this space is getting hot

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
I told Althea
I'm a roving sign
That I was born to be a bachelor
Althea told me: "Okay, that's fine"
And now I'm out trying to catch her
Can't talk to you without talking to me
We're guilty of the same old thing
Talking a lot about less and less
And forgetting the love we bring

[Verse 1]
Compass card is spinning
Your elm is swingin' to and fro
Ooh, where's the dog star?
Ooh, where's the moon?

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been too long at sea

[Verse 2]
Some days the gales are howling
Some days the sea is still as glass
Ooh, reef the main sail
Ooh, lash the mast

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
Yeah, there's a price for being free

[Verse 3]
Hear the sea birds cry
There's a ghost wind blowin'
It's calling you, to that misty swirling sea
'Til the chains of your dreams are broken
No place in this world you can be

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
Yeah, there's a price for being free
Yes, for being free

[Bridge]
Drifting, you're drifting
Drifting and dreaming
Drifting and dreaming
Maybe going on a dream
Maybe going on a feeling

[Outro]
'Cause there's a place you've never been
Maybe a place you've never seen now
You can hear her calling on the wind now
Drifting and dreaming
Go on and drift your life away
Drifting and dreaming, drifting and dreaming
'Cause there's a place you've never been
Maybe a place you've never seen now
Drifting and dreaming
Yes, I'm going on a dream
Maybe going on a feeling
Maybe going on a feeling
Maybe going on a feeling

[Verse 1]
This must be heaven
Tonight I crossed the line
You must be the angel
I thought I might never find
Was it you I heard singin'
Oh while I was chasin' dreams?
Driven by the wind
Like the dust that blows around

[Chorus]
And the rain fallin' down now
But I never know now
No, I never know, no no

[Verse 2]
This must be heaven
'Cause here's where the rainbow ends
At last it's the real thing
Or close enough to pretend
But when that wind blows
When the night's about to fall
I can hear the sirens call
It's a certain sort of sound

[Chorus]
In the rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down

[Bridge]
Holes in what's left of my reason
Holes in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin'
But I'll pull through

Never could read no road map
No, I don't know what the weather might do
But hear that witch wind whinin'
See that dog star shinin'
I've got a feelin' there's no time to lose
No time to lose

Well, I never know now
No, I never know, no no
Never, never know, no no

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been heaven
But even rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin'
And the wind is willin'
That I'm as good as gone again
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Just a Saint of Circumstance
Just a tiger in a trance
In the rain fallin' down now

[Chorus]
Rain falling down
Rain falling down
The rain falling down
The rain falling down now
The rain falling down now

Well, I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm going to go for it for sure
I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm gonna go for it for sure (That's for sure now)
I sure don't know what I'm going for

Sure don't know what I'm going for
(Never never know, no no no, hey!)
But I'm going to go for it for sure
(Maybe going on a feeling, maybe going on a feeling)

[Verse 1]
Thirty-two teeth in a jawbone
Alabama's tryin' for none
Before I have to hit him
I hope he's got the sense to run

Reason the poor girls love him
Promise them everything
Why they all believe him?
He wears a big diamond ring

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Majordomo Billy Bojangles
Sat down and had a drink with me
Said what about Alabama
That keeps a-coming back to me?
I heard your plea in the courthouse
Witness box began to rock and rise
Forty-nine sister states
Had Alabama in their eyes

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Twenty-third Psalm Majordomo
Reserve me a table for three
Down in the Valley of the Shadow
Just you, Alabama and me
Major said why don't we give him
Rope enough to hang himself
No need to worry the jury
They'll probably take care of themselves

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it’s done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, just look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I’m just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Outro]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
’Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won’t you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Outro]
Come hear Uncle John’s Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John’s Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion’s den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from other men

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
I’m a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
Know she wish she would

[Verse 2]
Well now, the doctor call me crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
Said the doctor call me crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
See, the preacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Chorus]
See, I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
See, my number one occupation

Hi...

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I've drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moanin' low
You know I'm only in it for the gold

[Verse 2]
All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down

[Verse 3]
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moanin' low
And I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gotta get up in the morning and go

[Verse 4]
Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losin' this time
Well, I've got no chance of losin' this time
Well, I've got no chance of losin' this time

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losin' this time
Well, I've got no chance of losin' this time
Well, I've got no chance of losin' this time

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Bridge]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 2]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Bridge]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 3]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Bridge]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 4]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Bridge]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 5]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina goodbye

Shawty gettin' freaky and nasty (Ooh she nasty)

[Verse 1]
A pistol shot at 5 o'clock
The bells of heaven ring
Tell me what you done it for
No, I won't tell you a thing
Yesterday I begged you
Before I hit the ground
All I leave behind me
Is only what I found

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
If you can abide it
Let the hurdy-gurdy play
Stranger ones have come by here
Before they flew away
I will not condemn you
Nor yet would I deny
I would ask the same of you
But failing will not die
Take up your china doll
(Take up your china doll)
It's only fractured
And just a little nervous
From the fall

[Outro]
Na, na na na na na na...

[Verse 1]
When the moon lays his head on a pillow
And the stars settle down for a rest
Just do me one small favor, I beg you
Please play me my baby's request

[Verse 2]
It’s the song that we heard when we started
Now the birds have all flown from our nest
But you could bring back memories departed
By playing my baby's request

[Chorus]
My baby said that she knows how it goes
But you're the one who really knows
So go ahead, just one more time and then we’ll go to bed

[Chorus]
My baby says she knows how it goes
But you're the one that really knows
So go ahead, just one more time and then we'll go to bed

[Verse 1]
When the moon lays his head on a pillow
And the star settles down for a rest
Just do me one small favor, I beg you
Play me my baby's request
Play me my baby's request
Please play me my baby's request

[Chorus 1]
Well, you can make my life complete
If you say that we could meet
For a minute on the sixty second street
Oh yeah

[Chorus 2]
The city's melting in the heat
I’ve got my flip-flops on my feet
You see me walking down sixty second street

[Bridge]
Well, time is flying by so fast
Each day quicker than the last
It means I must be having fun
I hope it carries on and on and on

[Chorus 3]
Sixty seconds of your day is all I ask of you
I only need a little time to show what I can do

Of the traffic on sixty second street

[Bridge]
Well, time is flying by so fast (Do, do-do, do)
Each day quicker than the last (Do, do-do, do)
It means I must be having fun (Wee-ooh, wee-ooh)
I hope it carries on and on and on

[Chorus 3]
Sixty seconds of your day is all I ask of you

If you say that we could meet
For a minute on the sixty second street

Just a minute on the sixty second street
Just a minute on the sixty second street
Sixty second street

[Verse 1]
No sun will shine in my day today
(No sun will shine)
The high yellow moon won't come out to play
(Won't come out to play)
Darkness has covered my light
(And has changed)
And has changed my day into night
Now, where is this love to be found?

[Chorus]
Won't someone tell me 'cause life
(Sweet life)
Must be somewhere
(Sweet life)
To be found
(Out there somewhere for me)
Instead of a concrete jungle
(Jungle)
Where the living is hardest
(Concrete jungle)
Concrete jungle
(Jungle)
Oh man, you've got to do your best yet
(Concrete jungle)

[Verse 2]
No chains around my feet but I'm not free
I know I am bound here in captivity
And I've never known
(Never known)
Happiness
And I’ve never known
(Never known)
Sweet caresses
Still, I be always laughing like a clown

[Chorus]
Won't someone help me 'cause I
(Sweet life)
I've got to pick myself
(Sweet life)
From off the ground, yeah
(Out there somewhere for me)
In this here concrete jungle
(Jungle)
I say, what do you got for me, now?
(Concrete jungle)
Concrete jungle

[Chorus]
I said that life

Must be somewhere

To be found, yeah, yeah
(Out there somewhere for me)
Instead of a concrete jungle
(Jungle)
Where the living is hardest
(Concrete jungle)
Concrete jungle

Oh man, you've got to do your best, yet

You name it
In this concrete jungle

(Jungle)
We got it
Concrete jungle, now
(Concrete jungle)
(Jungle, jungle)

[Chorus]
I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it with you
I got this Sunday, baby, I wanna spend it with you
We can do what you like, I promise then, I'll be true
I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you, oh

[Verse 1]
I don't know where to go, I don't know where to hide
Everywhere that I go, you're right by my side
You're the only girl that I have ever dreamed of
I wanna tell you everything, but everything just seems dumb

[Pre-Chorus]
I really like you, girl, really wanna dress you up
I wanna buy you for real
I really like you, girl, O really wanna feel you up
I wanna feel you for real

[Chorus]
I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it with you
I got this Sunday, baby, I wanna spend it with you
We can do what you like, I promise then, I'll be true, baby
I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you, oh

[Verse 2]
I got an upstairs, downstairs in my loft
Check the mixtape, baby, I don't talk
Yes, I run this shit, like it's hard to walk
And you think that I'm dope, like a mound of chalk
I'm recession proof, I work to relax, ho
Weird voice catch beef like a lasso
New fresh prince, you can chill in my castle
Spit real shit, so I must be an asshole, right?
Nah, that's why I'm makin' out in your car
These blogs are a dude's A&R
Got a big tip for these girls at the bar
But I don't mean money
Ever since the money, they just treat me funny
Girls look good, she can take green from me
Ain't trickin' if you got it, know what I mean, buddy?

[Bridge]
You've got your yellow sun dress on
I'm tryna write you the best song
With your Wayfarer shades, you drive me insane
I wanna hold hands, and call you pet names

[Pre-Chorus]
I really like you, girl, really wanna dress you up
I wanna buy you for real
I really like you, girl, I really wanna feel you up
I wanna feel you for real

[Chorus]
I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it with you
I got this Sunday, baby, I wanna spend it with you
We can do what you like, I promise then, I'll be true
I got this money, baby, I wanna spend it on you, oh, oh

[Outro]
Ooh-oh
Ooh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Ohh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
For real
Ohh-ohh-oh-ohh
Ohh-ohh-oh-ohh
Ohh-ohh-oh-ohh
Ohh-ohh-oh-ohh

[Verse 1]
Merry run around, sailin' up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over
When that train pulls in, you wonder where it's been
You gotta try to see a little further

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia & Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, and it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia & Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 2]
I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
Tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonely blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show that you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And please play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 1 repeated]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Outro]
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 1]
Lazy lightning
That sleepy fire in your eyes
Is that desire in disguise
I keep on trying but I
I can't get through
Lazy lightning
I’d like to find the proper potion
To try to capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

[Chorus]
You’re a loop of lazy lightning
Just a loop of lazy lighting
Must admit you're kind of frightening
But you really get me high

[Verse 2]
So exciting
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to
So exciting
The way you're messing with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasing
Tell me a lie and I will swear
I will swear it's true

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Liquid loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening
You’re a loop of lazy lightning

[Bridge]
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Rope of fire ever tightening (Tightening)
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
It’s either lunacy or lightning
You're a loop of lazy lightning

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Lazy lightning
They say you never start the same place
I want a double dose in my case
I’d fly a kite if I thought
Thought that would do

[Outro]
Lazy lightning
The way you always electrify me
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightning will be
My lightning, my lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop of loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)

[Verse 1]
Woo, well, dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel now
Got to help me
Well, I need some indication, good Lord, this is real now
Got to help me
Well, I've heard it said there's something wrong with in head now
Got to tell me, girl
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

[Outro]
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It's sparking my imagination
Bolt of lightning
'Cause me such excitation
Well, you got to like me now
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now

WOO!

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he stepped to the bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over, and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack on Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1 repeated]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Outro]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a young'un's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
And no one could change my mind, but Mama tried

One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Verse 2]
Dear old Daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause Mama tried
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

Thanks mom

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock you, baby, to and fro
Not too fast, and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Verse 1]
Reaching to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's going to be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night now
Saturday night!

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the whole place going to fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night now
Saturday night!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Turn on Channel Six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, put on your rocking shoes

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night now
Hey, Saturday night!

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
Talkin' 'bout hey now, one more Saturday night now
Ow, Saturday night!

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
(One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night

Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night now

Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, ow!

Thank y'all, good night

[Verse 1]
I need a woman about twice my age
A lady of nobility, gentility and rage
Splendor in the dark, lightning on the draw
We'll go right through the book and break each and every law

[Chorus]
I got a feeling, feeling today, yeah
Just one thing then I'll be okay
I need a miracle every day

[Verse 2]
I need a woman about twice my height
Statuesque, raven-dressed, a goddess of the night
Her secret incantations, a candle burning blue
We'll consult the spirits, maybe they'll know what to do

[Chorus]
And it's real, you see it today, yeah
I can't get around and I can't run away
I need a miracle every day

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I need a woman about twice my weight
A ton of fun who packs a gun with all her freight
Find her in a sideshow leave her in L.A
Ride her like a surfer riding on a tidal wave

[Chorus]
I got a feeling, and it won't go away, no
Just one thing that I got to say
I need a miracle every day

[Bridge]
It takes dynamite to get me up
Too much of everything is just enough
One more thing I just got to say
I need a miracle every day
(I need a miracle every day) Every day
(I need a miracle every day) Every day now
(I need a miracle every day) Not completely all the way
(I need a miracle, I need a miracle) Yeah
(I need a miracle every day) Some type of miracle
(I need a miracle every day) Some kind of miracle
(I need a miracle every day) Yeah, I need a miracle
(I need a miracle, I need a miracle)
Well, know what I'm talkin' about
(I need a miracle every day)
I need when I'm walking up and down the street
(I need a miracle every day)
Or when I'm driving in my automobile now
(I need a miracle every day)
Deep down in the midnight hour
(I need a miracle, I need a miracle)

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Every day, every day
You know it got to be the only way
(I need a miracle every day) Every day
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle, I need a miracle)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle, I need a miracle)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle, I need a miracle)
(I need a miracle every day)
(I need a miracle every day)

[Intro]
Alright, now we're gonna play everybody's favorite fun game "Move back"
Now, when I tell ya "take a step back," everybody take a step back, alright?
Right, okay, take a step back, and take another step back
And take yet another step back, and another, take a step back
Everybody feel better? What do you mean 'no'?
Now, see, all these people in front are being horribly smashed here
So that means all you people in the back have to move back some
(Bill, your friends up front won't be real bug-eyed)

As I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

She had rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls
In the heat of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before

I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Instrumental break]

Well, there ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias
Or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental break]

The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Get up, get out, get out of the door
You're playin' cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Long distance runner, one foot at the door
Caught in slow motion, fall to the floor
Drown in laughter and drew to the door
You gave all you had, why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
That thin line beyond which you really can't fake

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
But I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
And I'm in no hurry, no
It's going to be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Yes, I know I lead the way
And they'll tell me where I go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me
Shine on the beach, sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will rise to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)

And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory going to be my name
And people will light my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no
It's gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
This afternoon, streets turned gray
And I watch the fire below
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no

[Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I go
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, don't worry 'bout me

[Bridge]
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)

[Outro]
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and the foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

[Outro]
Fortune comes a-crawling, Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
Thought I heard a baby cry this today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

Where have all the people gone, my honey
Where have all the people gone today
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a young man mourn today
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Instrumental break]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I guess I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't really matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental break]

I guess it doesn't matter anyway

Thank you

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Get up, get out, get out of the door
You're playin' cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat
You say it's a livin', we all gotta eat
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete
If mercy's a business, I wish it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Verse 3]
Long distance runner, what you holdin' out for?
Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door
The flame from your stage has spread to the floor
You gave all you had, why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, West Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hey, high-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle started winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be

[Verse 5]
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, oh damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Then we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Verse 6]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I loved my uncle, God rest his soul
And he taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said, "She's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone"
Well, I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die
And I'm going to sit right here until I die
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, you know I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 1]
Well now, baby used to stay out all night long
Made me cry, Lord she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, baby, that's no lie
Tables turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now, over now
Yes, and I used to love her, but it's all over now, over now

[Verse 2]
Well, I used to wake up in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I got worried, you know she eased my achin' head
But now she's here and there with every man in town'
But still tryin' to take me for that same old clown

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now, over now
Yes, and I used to love her, but it's all over now, over now

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Well, she used to run around with every man in town
Spend all my money, Lord, out playing her high class game
Put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Table's turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now, over now
Yes, and I used to love her, but it's all over now
Over now, over now

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Well now, baby used to stay out all night long
Made me cry, Lord she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, baby, that's no lie
Tables turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now, over now
Yes, and I used to love her, but it's all over now
Say it's over, over now, over now
Yes, and I used to love her, used to love her, but it's all over now
Say it's over, over now, over now
Yes, and I used to love her, used to love her, but it's all over now
Over now, over now

[Outro]
We're gonna play a selection from our latest chart buster

[Verse 1]
1948, Christmas Eve, with a full moon over town
Stagger Lee shot Billy DeLions
And he blew that poor boy down
Do you know what he shot him for?
What do you make of that?
Because Billy DeLions threw the lucky dice
Won Stagger Lee's Stetson hat
Bayo, Bayo, tell me how can this be?
You arrest the girls for turning tricks
But you're scared of Stagger Lee
Stagger Lee is a madman and he shot my Billy D
Bayo, go get him or give the job to me

[Verse 2]
Delia DeLions, dear sweet Delia-D
How the hell can I arrest him? He's twice as big as me
Well, don't ask me to go downtown, I won't come back alive
Not only is that mother big, he packs a .45
Bayo, Delia said, just give me a gun
He shot my Billy dead, now I'm going to see him hung
She went into the DeLion's club through Billy DeLions blood
Stepped up to Stagger Lee at the bar
Said, "Buy me a gin fizz, love"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
As Stagger Lee lit a cigarette she shot him in the balls
Blew the smoke off her revolver, had him dragged to city hall
Bayo, Bayo, see you hang him high
He shot my Billy dead and now he's got to die
Delia went walking down on Singapore Street
With a three-piece band on the corner played "Near My God to Thee"
Well, Delia whistled a different tune, what tune could that be?
The song that woman sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"
The song that Delia sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"
The song that woman sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"
The song that woman sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Voices slide down off the mountain, sunlight turning red
Falls on the earth and it spreads
Even the families lower their heads as they ride
Age old faces of the mountains looming naturally
I wonder if they're looking at me, their monumental eyes I can feel

[Chorus]
In the glow of the twilight the thought of home
Reminds me now I’m reaching out to you
Anything I can do to be safe and warm in your arms
All I have from the heart of you

[Verse 2]
I'd meet you anywhere in the country or anywhere on the sea
All over the world it could be, I would follow you with the heart of me
Love calls echo in the valley, dream come true tonight
Remembering you hold me tight in tomorrow morning's light I will find you

[Chorus]
When I awoke the stars were out and shining
Shining for you and me
All I ever want to be is safe and warm in your arms
All I have, from the heart of me
All I have, from the heart of me
All I have, from the heart of me
All I have, from the heart of me
All I have, from the heart of me

[Verse]
Sunshine daydream, walking in the tall trees, going where the wind goes
Blooming, blooming like a red rose
Now come on over sweetly
Ride out singin', "I got you in the morning sunshine"
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Now come on over daydream
Sunshine daydream, hey, come along, let's daydream
Sunshine daydream, Wading in a cold stream
Crawling out your window
Going, going where the wind goes
They're never gonna miss us
Ride out singin', "I got you in the morning sunshine"
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Hoo, sunshine daydream
Hoo, sunshine daydream
Hey, come along and daydream (Come along and daydream)
Sunshine daydream, hey, come along and daydream
Sunshine daydream, hoo
Sunshine daydream, hoo
Sunshine daydream, come along and daydream
Sunshine daydream, come along and daydream
Sunshine daydream, hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sweet coming daydream

[Outro]
Thank you, we're gonna take a break

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, oh, she looked so fine
Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
And she spoke so kind, talked so fair
Samson said, Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever has lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up round the lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head, good God

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper, just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday, in a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City, just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls, get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill, Papa told the jailer
One heat up, and one cool down, leave nothing for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill, Mama told the sailor
One go up, and one go down, do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin’ Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Bridge]
I'm going to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never going to end
I’m going to march you up and down along the county line
Take you to the leader of a band

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto, just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush, aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelly, just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains and count your change and try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Bridge]
I'm going to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never going to end
I'm going to march you up and down along the county line
Take you to the leader of a band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye Mama and Papa
Goodbye Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener
The wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin’ Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose
Ramble on Rose

Don’t you love to see lovers?

[Lady with a Fan]

[Verse 1]
Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
'Till my tale is told and done

While the firelight’s aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'Til things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion’s den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
Not disaster

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

[Terrapin Station]

[Verse]
Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
Oh, from the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune

[Outro]
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - If it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - But the train's put its brakes on
Terrapin - And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, just look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Intro: Mark Avery & Eddie]
Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Goddamn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your mother****** conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Bump that, do that sh**, hit that lick
Can you afford to blow this hit? Are you that rich?
Why you care if you scared of death? Are you that chick?
Do you really think she gives a **** if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this slit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

[Chorus: Eminem & Mark Avery]
These voices, these voices, I hear them (Hear them, hear them)
And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow
(All these voices, these voices) Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party (I hear them)
(And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow)
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
(I'll follow, I'll follow)
Once again, his conscience comes into play (All these)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little chicken's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
How could you take advantage of her? She's passed out
It's easy, just cut these lights out, that's how
Then pick this chicken up, get her off Brad's couch
And leave her on the front porch at her mom and dad's house
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest (Doobiest)
You wanna get hauled off to jail?
Bump that, drop her off, ring the doorbell, then bail

[Chorus: Eminem & Mark Avery]
These voices, these voices, I hear them (Hear them, hear them)
I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow (I'll follow)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
(These voices, these voices, I hear them, hear them)
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
(I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow)
To find his wife in bed with another man

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Start breathin'? Man, you just caught your wife cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Forget gettin' divorced, cut this chicken's head off
Wait, what if there's a good explanation for this?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his ****?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna grab her?
Kick her our the house, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, you lil mothaf-
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the hell you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, **** it, what am I sayin'?
Do 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pshh)
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make yo' freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 1]
Sit enthroned in white grandeur
But tired
And shift a wisp of wayward silver hair
From your eyes
I'd never seen you unkempt before
As you whisper, darling, close the door
Well, how have I not made a note of every word
You ever said?
Time is not on our side
But I pretend that it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand

[Chorus]
Before you leave, you must know you are beloved
And before you leave, remember I was with you

[Verse 2]
Are you afraid?
How ever could you not be?
In this rosy light
This is strange
I feel a hand come through the mirror
Pointing at the light
Pointing at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me

[Chorus]
Before you leave, you must know you are beloved
And before you leave, remember I was with you
And as you leave, I won't hold you back beloved

[Bridge]
Will you sit
And talk the stars down from the sky?
Down there, forget the chaos in your eyes, love

[Chorus]
And as you leave, I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave, I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave, I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave, see my children playing at your feet

I'm gonna marry the night, I won’t give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen, live passionately tonight
I'm gonna marry the dark, gonna make love to the stark
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness, I'm a winner
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna lace up my boots, throw on some leather and cruise
Down the streets that I love, in my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner
Then I'll go down to the bar, but I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high, kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night

[Post-Chorus]
Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry

Y-you, I, you
You, I, you
Y-you, I, you
You, I, you
Y-you, I, you

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
It’s been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I’m back in town
This time I’m not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I’m not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"
There’s...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (Brian May)]
(Something), something about this place
(Something), something, ‘bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You, I, you
Y-you, I, you
You, I, you
Y-you, I, you
You, I, you
Y-you, I, you

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
It’s been two years since I let you go
I couldn’t listen to a joke or a Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me "Heart of Gold"
With a guitar humming and a no clothes
This time I’m not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"
There’s...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (Brian May)]
(There's something), something about this place
(Something), something, ‘bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face

Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

I've learned love is like a brick
You can build a house or sink a dead body

I'll bring him down,bring him down, down

[Intro: Big Sean]
Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Straight up

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Look, I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I’m worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give ’em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don’t know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I’m here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I’m way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we’re back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean, with Kanye West]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes

[Outro: Kanye West]
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 1: Jake]
Living our lives through a fisheye lens
Chronic apathy
At least we pretend in our hearts
We are apart
No aspirations in a mirrored mind
Chronic apathy
But we're fine in our hearts
We are apart

[Refrain: Jake]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Jake]
Looking straight through what lies ahead
Throw up any charm
Beg it to stay in our hearts
We are apart
Try that drive to outer space
Trust me love
We got empty weight in our hearts
We are apart

[Bridge:]
I know our time is running out
I know our names
I know our time is running out, oh
I know our names

[Outro:]
Trust me love
It don't matter 'bout the sun, moon, or the stars
Trust me love
It don't matter that the world is falling apart
Trust me love
It don't matter 'bout the sun, moon, or the stars
Trust me love
It don't matter that the world is falling apart
Trust me love
It don't matter 'bout the sun, moon, or the stars
Trust me love
It don't matter that the world is falling apart
That the world is falling apart
That the world is falling apart
That the world is falling apart
That the world is falling apart

Locked me outside
Prayin for the rain to come
Bone dry again
Guess it's true what they say
I’m always late
Say you need a little space, that I'm in your way

It hurts but I remember every scar
And I've learned, but living is the hardest part

I can’t believe what I did for love
I can't believe what I did for us
Crash and we burn into flames
Stitch myself up and we do it again

I can't believe what I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
What I did for love
I'm a fool for your games, but I always play
Can't admit it was a waste, there's too much at stake

It hurts but I remember every start
And I've learned, but living is the hardest part

I can't believe what I did for love
I can’t believe what I did for us
Crash and we burn into flames
Stitch myself up and we do it again

I can’t believe what I did for love

(food no ‘nough)
Lord, Lord, Lord
(food no ‘nough)
Lordy, Lordy, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Nigga, call me a G.O.A.T., don't call it a comeback
Seven million records, nine months, where Soulja at?
I could make the same song, bitches still play that
Run around saying that you made me, why you say that?
And I make them bitches flock to me like A.S.A.P
And I had to Amber Rose the top of the Maybach
AE, why they hate that? Where the Bay at?
Time is money, can’t let a broke bitch waste that
In L.A., them niggas be famous for a day
I don't chase clout, I just pull in Chase Bank
I got taste kush indica, the shit so stank
A nigga sent me a song, thought that shit was a prank
And I mean it in a bad way
And your bitch hit me up every Saturday
And I'm busy with your friend, try another day, uh
I start my own wave then I ride the wave
Baby don’t be sassy, nothin' don't pass me
Diamond cross, baptist, pray to me, marry me
A non-superficial thing, can't wait 'til we meet
Hunnid large for the verse, I done did three this week
Hot nigga, so close but he still out of reach
I pray the Lord my soul to keep, uh
Do what thou wilt, what you think?
Platinum first day, the album on creep

[Outro]
Motherfucker
Said the album on creep
Yeah, LA leak, let that flow sink
Yeah, let that beat breath
Goddamn Thotiana do it on her knees, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hey, this morning I woke up in a curfew
O God, I was a prisoner, too
Could not recognize the faces standing over me
All dressed in uniforms of brutality
How many rivers do we have to cross
Before we can talk to the boss… I’m singing
All we got, it seems we have lost
We must have really paid the cost

[Chorus]
That’s why we’re gonna be burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
(Burnin’ and a lootin’ tonight)
We’re burnin' and a-lootin' tonight
(Burnin’ and a lootin’ tonight)
Burnin' all pollution tonight
(Burnin’ all pollution tonight)
Oh, oh we’re burnin’…
(Burnin’ all illusion tonight)

[Verse 2]
Oh, give me the food and let me grow
Let the Root Man take a blow
I say, ‘cause all them drugs gonna make you slow now
It's not the music from the ghetto. Hey

[Chorus]
The weeping and a-wailing tonight
(Weeping and a-wailing tonight)
Weeping and a-wailing tonight
(Weeping and a-wailing tonight)
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy…hey!
(Weeping and a-wailing tonight)
(Weeping and a-wailing tonight)

[Bridge]
How many river, how many river
Do we have to cross, talk to the boss
And one more if all we got we have lost
We must have really paid a cost
That’s why we’re gonna be

[Chorus]
(Burnin’ and a lootin’ tonight)
Burnin’ and a lootin’
(Burnin’ and a lootin’ tonight)
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
(Burning all pollution tonight)
Burning all pollution tonight
Burning all…
(Burning all illusions tonight)
(Weeping and a-wailing tonight)
Weeping and a-wailing tonight
(Weeping and a-wailing tonight)
Weeping and a-wailing….Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
(Weeping and a-wailing tonight)
Who can stop the tears tonight
(Weeping and a-wailing tonight)
Stop weeping all those tears tonight
(Weeping and a-wailing tonight)
Eh

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 1]
Say, say, said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Ob-observing the hypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say, and…

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
Here, little darlin', don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Said, said, said, I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire lights, as it was
Log wood burnin' through the night
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

[Bridge]
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right

Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right

[Chorus]
So, woman, no cry
No, no, woman, woman no cry
Woman, little sister don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

[Guitar breakdown]

[Verse 2]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire lights
As it was log wood burnin' through the night
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
But while I’m gone

[Chorus]
No, woman, no cry
No, woman, no cry
Woman, little darlin', say, don't shed no tears
No, woman, no cry, eh

[Outro]
(little darlin’, don’t shed no tears)
(no, woman, no cry)
(little sister, don’t shed no tears)
(no, woman, no cry)

[Verse 1]
There's a hole in my heart
No one can take your place
Why would I want them to
There's a feeling I had that no one can replace
Time can not erase

[Verse 2]
There's a song in my heart
No one can hear but you
Why would I want them to
There's a strange melody I play without regret
I never will forget

[Chorus]
In my heart you'll never go away
You'll stay, you'll stay, you'll stay
In my soul you'll never go away
In my heart you'll never go away
You'll stay, you'll stay, you'll stay
In my soul you'll never go away

[Verse 3]
No one can take your place
I close my eyes, I see your face
I hear your voice inside my head
Reminding me, in my heart

[Chorus]
In my heart you'll never go away
You'll stay, you'll stay, you'll stay
In my soul you'll never go away
In my heart you'll never go away
You'll stay, you'll stay, you'll stay
In my soul you'll never go away

In my heart
You'll stay, you'll stay, you'll stay
In my soul you'll never go away
In my heart you'll never go away
You'll stay, you'll stay, you'll stay
In my soul you'll never go away

[Chorus]
Hey, get up, stand up, stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up, don’t give up the fight
Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

[Verse 1]
Preacher man, don't tell me heaven is under the earth
I know you don't know what life is really worth
It's not all that glitter is gold
Half the story has never been told
And, now you see the light
Stand up for your rights

[Chorus]
Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

[Verse 2]
You see, most people think Great God will come from the sky
Take away everything And make everybody feel high
But if you know what life is worth
You will look for yours on earth
And now you see the light
You stand up for your rights

[Chorus]
Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

[Verse 3]
We’re sick and tired of your ism schism game
Die and go to heaven in Jesus' name, Lord
We know and we understand
Almighty God is a living man
You can fool some people sometimes
But you couldn’t fool all the people all the time
And, now you see the light
You stand up for your rights

[Chorus]
Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

[Bridge]
Don’t give up the fight
Don’t give up the fight
Don’t give up the fight
Don’t give up the fight
Don’t give up the fight
Don’t give up the fight
Don’t give up the fight
Don’t give up the fight
Don’t give up the fight
Don’t give up the fight
Don’t give up the fight

Your body all on the ground
Lay it down because I want something
Just look in my eyes and reach for the sky, girl
When you scream, "I love it"
And it's sounding like
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Baby, when you love me
It's sounding like
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Baby, just scream it loud

[Post-Chorus]
I want her right now
I need her body (Oh, woah, woah)
We turn the lights down
Give it to me, baby

[Verse]
Baby, you won't be neglected
Gon' take my time, might be impressive
You get what you want, get it all from me
You can get on top of me when you ready
Girl, I love how you do it
When you speed up, then you go slow
You know I love it

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't understand when you make that booty dance
Then you turn that ass around
Can I go longer? Yes, I can
We getting hotter by the hour
Making love up in the shower
You're my girl and I'm your man
Do it all over again

[Chorus]
Your body all on the ground
Lay it down because I want something
Just look in my eyes and reach for the sky, girl
When you scream, "I love it"
And it's sounding like
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Baby, when you love me
It's sounding like
Oh, oh-oh, oh

It's sounding like
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Baby, just scream it loud

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story - money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
It's my story I'm sticking to it
Drama man I been through it
I'm turned on by this shit
Life's a bitch, so I can put my dick into it
They wrote me off, counted me out
Now I make so much I can't counted Ahhhhhh
Got your bitch so wet I'm drowning out
Spilled milk, I make her cream
The world's a court, I owned the team
And across these haters over, made them pull their hamstring
Yeah I do big things, write big checks
Good weed, Greats sex
Black Panties is on deck
Constipated ain't out yet
20 Years, what's that like 5 careers?
I'm just a nappy headed nigga from the chi
I ain't so supposed to be here

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story - money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Came from humble beginnings now I'm cocky with my spending
They say "life is just a game" and I thank God that I'm winning
Models roll my indo, I beat the pussy, Django
Them niggas talking money, I got more digits in my gate code
She make a pole disappear like hocus pocus
You're ain't never gon' find another nigga this focused
I got every block, every street corners sold up
Whatever club represent my city, throw it up
I own the game, coach last player shown up
Okay, haters throw fitted never showed up

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story - money, cars, bad hoes

And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, 2 Chainz...
Velcro, I'm sticking to it, hatin', I've been a victim to it
Your conversation is sanitation, ain't no hesitation when I finna do it
I stick it in (uh) switch it up and try to hit a friend (uh)
Live it up and count my dividends, roll, like cinnamon
Woah, big face Benjamin's
As she lookin' at me like ye'en ain't nothin' but a star
I looked at her like this ain't nonthing but a car
If you ride with them you ain't going that far
But if you ride with me, crib so big we can play hide-and-seek
You can confide to me, ride me like I ride the beat
Pilot seat, I need a co-pilot, kiss a ass in both mouths
Them talking both lips, what you know 'bout boat trips?
Drop her ass at the Chocolate Factory (yeah)
We did them 12 Play's (yeah)
And you know who you is girl
We been fuckin' since the 12th grade, goddamn

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story - money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it

[Verse 4: R. Kelly]
Pull up to the club at about three
I'm killin' it, guilty no plea
I'm leaving out at 6 with a dime piece
By 9 o'clock, we on round three
I speak of rain they say I'm crazy like they didn't know
See I'm not crazy but my talent, man, got bipolar
Say she's a church girl but man she's blowing holy smokes
Showed her the Jesus piece now she got the Holy Ghost
They asked them in a interview, "why do he love these girls?"
The only thing he had to say was, "motherfuck the world!"

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story - money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it
And I'm stickin' to it, and I'm stickin' to it

[Verse 1]
The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

[Bridge]
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you've always known
The many ways I've tried

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me waiting here
A long, long time ago
Don't keep me standing here
Lead me to you door

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me waiting here
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door

[Verse 1]
Freeze your laugh in time
I just can't trust my mouth
Your smile imprints itself
As a portrait on my shelf
Things I wish I said
They get trapped in my head
If I just wrote them down
I'd have a book by now

[Chorus 1]
My mind has no escape
When she is so far away
Futile coldcase
But I wish you could stay

[Verse 2]
Take a walk with me
My mind goes by the sea
Always feel so close
'Cause I'm wearin' all your clothes
Please don't close the blinds
I like the natural light
Speedin' way too fast
And I can't even drive

[Chorus 2]
My mind has no escape
When she is so far away
Futile coldcase
But I wish you could stay
My mind has no escape
When she is so far away
Futile coldcase
But I wish you could stay

[Verse 1]
These voices, all in my head
Never to whisper again
Never to sing me to sleep
Oh, but a dream
Right there, caught out in the rain
Drenched in a memory of pain
Soaked by the old sour taste
Let's hope for the better

[Chorus]
Play to the mind, wide open
Awaken the beast by the meadow
Playful at least, I'm hoping
Show you the doorway to my soul

[Verse 2]
Come to the root of the cause
Producer will can the applause
I mention it's not my fault
Yet my effort was needed
So I grab for some inner resource
Most certainly blind to the force
Letting the world takes its course
We've now superseded

[Chorus]
Play to the mind, wide open
Awaken the beast by the meadow
Playful at least, I'm hoping
Show you the doorway to my soul
Play to the mind, wide open
Awaken the beast by the meadow
Playful at least, I'm hoping
Show you the doorway to my soul

[Bridge]
Always in my brain
I'm trapped in a magical maze
Not feelings of hopelessness
I'm facing the mess that I've made
Always in my brain
I'm trapped in a magical maze
Not feelings of hopelessness
I'm facing the mess that I've made
Made, made, made
Made, made, made, made

[Chorus]
Play to the mind, wide open
Awaken the beast by the meadow
Playful at least, I'm hoping
Show you the doorway to my soul
Play to the mind, wide open
Awaken the beast by the meadow
Playful at least, I'm hoping
Show you the doorway to my soul

[Outro]
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye

[Intro]

Niggas don't want drama
Word around town I fucked his baby mama
Yeah, kaboom, boom, with your son in the other room

[Outro]
Smoke dope, smoke dope, got big gas
Pull up, drop top, that's paper tag
Yeah, he got drugged out the club by the security
I know he big mad

[Verse 1]
Vacant angel, crimson light
Darkened eyelash, darkened eye
The white light of the living room
Leaking through the crack in the door
There was never need for more
Things we're meant to understand
Crawling closer to your hand

[Chorus]
To the poison image
Brave surrender
Kiss the water

[Verse 2]
After all my teeth are gone
After all the blood is drawn
The white light of the waiting room
Leaking through the crack in the door

[Chorus]
Through the poison image
Brave surrender
Kiss the water

[Outro]
Through the mirror, mountain view
She has one green, one eye blue
I can see her smiling through
The white light of the living room
Leaking through the crack in the door

[Verse 1]
Dogs eyes in the headlights of the driveway
Cool autumn rain
Bugs died on your windshield on the freeway
Wonder if you'll be the same
Centuries flower

[Chorus]
And we have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power

[Verse 2]
Moth flies in the window of the kitchen
You hang up your coat
Cold lips and gold eyes listen
There's something that I want you to know
Turn on the shower

[Chorus]
'Cause we have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power

[Verse 3]
No resolution, no circling dove
Still caught in the jaw of confusion
Don't know what I'd do for love
But stay another hour

[Chorus]
'Cause we have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power

[Verse 1]
Doesn't it seem strange
Searching for a hidden page
The fairy’s cage
Coming of true age
Leave the costume on the stage
The silkworm's rage
Iridescent thread, beautiful and dead
Billions of worms were boiled to make the bed

[Chorus]
Strange, see the luna moth cry
Lime green tears through the fruit bat's eyes

[Verse 2]
Scatter and destroy
Every power you enjoy
To lay with the void
Twirling of the dime, splitting of the mind
Drawing constellations ’til the stars align

[Chorus]
Strange, see the luna moth cry (Cry)
Lime green tears through the fruit bat's eyes (Eyes)

[Outro]
You have wings of gold
You will never grow old
And turquoise lungs
You have never been young
You have wings of gold
You will never grow old
And turquoise lungs
You have never been young

[Verse 1]
Too hot to breathe
Too hot to breathe
Too hot to breathe

[Chorus]
Jenni's in my room
Jenni’s in my room
Jenni's in my room

[Verse 2]
Her skin so bare
The fragrant air
Her vacant eye

[Chorus]
Jenni's in my room
Jenni’s in my room
Jenni's in my room

[Verse 3]
The signal swarms
The portal forms
She calls me through

[Chorus]
Jenni's in my room
Jenni's in my room
Jenni's in my room

[Chorus]
Jenni's in my room
Jenni's in my room
Jenni
Jenni's in my room

[Verse 1]
To my UFO friend
Goodbye, goodbye
Like a seed in the wind
She's taking up root in the sky
See her flickering
Her system won't even try
To defend and ripen
In the radio action

[Verse 2]
She'll never return again
Polarize, polarize
The seasons will bend
There will soon be proof
That there is no alien
Just a system of truth and lies
The reason, the language
And the law of attraction

[Chorus]
Just like a bad dream
You'll disappear
Another map turns blue
Mirror on mirror
And I imagine you
Taking me outta here
To deepen our love
It isn't even a fraction

[Verse 3]
Switch to another lens
The last sunlight
I don't need any other friends
The best kiss I ever had is the flickering
Of the water so clear and bright
To leap in, my skin
And I could feel the reaction

[Chorus]
Just like a bad dream
You'll disappear
Another map turns blue
Mirror on mirror
And I imagine you
Taking me outta here
To deepen our love
It isn't even a fraction

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Just like a bad dream
You'll disappear
Another map turns blue
Mirror on mirror
And I imagine you
Taking me outta here
To deepen our love
It isn't even a fraction
Jodi
Please turn the pages for me
You seem so free
You know I'm barely, barely

Wrap me in silk
I want to drink your milk
You hold the key
You know I'm barely, barely

Parker Lake Beach
All of the sunnys swimming
I wanna see
To feel my body sinking, sinking

She gives me gills
Helps me forgive the pills
She makes me sing
She is both dreamer and dream
And dream, and dream, and dream

[Verse 1]
Caroline, Caroline
I never could leave you to struggle
Hold the line, hold the line
I’ll be there on the double
In time, in time
Everyone does see trouble

[Chorus]
And you don’t need to know why when you cry
You don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you cry

[Verse 2]
Violet’s eyes, Violet plays
Going back home to the Great Lakes
Where the cattail sways
With the lonesome loon
Riding that train in late June

[Chorus]
With the windows wide by my side
With the windows wide
With the windows wide by my side

[Verse 3]
And the clusters fell like an empty bell
Meteor shower at the motel
Where the empty space is a saving grace
Making good time and doing well
Still the question sings like Saturn’s rings
Maybe she knows and she won’t tell

[Chorus]
But you don’t need to know why when you cry
You don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you cry

[Verse 4]
And I find you there in your country flair
Middle of the river in a lawn chair
With your wrinkled hands and your silver hair
Leaving here soon and you know where
To where the cattail sways with the lonesome loon
You’ll be riding that train in late June

[Chorus]
With the windows wide by your side
With the windows wide
With the windows wide by your side
You don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you cry
No one can be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
No one can be my woman, be my woman
Be my woman

One ear to the ground
One dog at my neck
One tongue to my tongue
Wanting to protect me from, from

No one can be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
No one can be my woman, be my woman
Be my woman

One ear to the floor
My dog barking loud
Couldn't tell for sure
Where the screaming sound
Was coming from, from
One ear to your womb
Puppy on the floor
Baby’s coming soon
Wonder if she'll know
Where she's come from, from
From, from
From, from

[Intro]
Yeah
Ch-Ch-Ch, Ah-Ah-Ah
Huh, yeah
Drako, yeah
Hoo

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
These niggas be pussy
Pull on they block I'm smoking on cookie
.223 bullets I shoot then I took it
Make the wrong move you get filled up with bullets
380 turn his dreads to a mullet
Whipping that dope like I’m cooking up cookies
Most of these rap niggas they be pussy
I mixed the Bathing Ape with the Stussy
Pop on your block then I shoot it up
Young Drako, nigga put bricks in a armored truck
Make the wrong move I'ma pop up
Whippin' that dope and then trap ’til it lock up
In high school I had 50 bricks in my locker
Sippin' lean it came straight from the doctor
A young rich nigga, you know that I'm whippin' it
Sippin' on lean it came with prescription
Real street nigga, pull up on Akademiks (Pull up)
Man, I miss the Actavis
I been here for 200 pint, I wasn't taxing 

[?]
Chopper hit him made the nigga do back-flips
Serve a hundred junkies down it's a quick trip
Ice on my Rollie like I got a busted lip
Ice on my wrist like I got a broke wrist
They wanna snitch but they don't know shit
Serving white girl, same color lotion
Calm the fuck down with all that commotion
Sippin’ lean in my emotions
Make the wrong move, Young Drako he gone smoke ’em
I prefer different tones in my choker (Four tones)
I buss down and gave him a Rollie
She talking to Drako like she really know me
I went to Dubai, just me and Kobe
Crashed the Bentley truck like it was stolen

[Verse 2: Go Yayo]
Skrrt, skrrt
I crashed the Bentley truck, went and bought a Lamb'
HoodFame USA, you know we go ham
Cook up that dope like your Granny cookin’ spam
Lamborghini truck, bitch this ain't no Ram
Every nigga diss, on foe, he got blammed
Official killer, I'll do it on it cam
Tax on that work, call me Yayo Uncle Sam
HoodFame USA, shoot you in your face
Sip so much lean, you would thought I got lifes
Cut Throat ENT ain't duckin’ no beef
Only run from police, you try me it's a murder case
Left the Draco, hit ass with my other K
Drop another tape and raise up the murder rate
Go Yayo a dope boy, move weight by the plane
My auntie snorting dope right up off the plate
I know I'm skinny but lil' bitch I got weight
King of my city, OG in my state
Couple youngin's touch your face
I keep that thuwop with me like that bitch was my bae
Fuck her in the trap, ain't going on dates
You kissing that bitch and I'm fuckin' her face (Free)
HoodFame youngin, I'm the champ, first place (Champion)
Give my heart up to a tramp, no way (No)
Nigga play and he get blammed, closed case
Now he lost and never found, no trace (Where?)
Came a long way eating food off a tray (Long way)
If you don't wanna die, stay the fuck out my way, bitch
Yayo!
Fuck nigga

[Verse 1: Dr.Dre]
Slip Into some fucked up shit with me
The U.S confessed
They're army wanna get with me
Four-four and a semi give me and some room
There's a real life platoon
On the streets the residents
Wonderin if the president is for us
Droppin more bull than taurus
Ignorin us
So should i let the nine go buck
Cause see i really don't give a fuck
And blast
I see a puff of big black smoke into my gun
I let the gun blast the cop that was fuckin with my property
Watchin me
Stoppin me from my bussiness
I push it like dope
So fuck my vote
You know niggas ain't shit nigga

Or else ain't no more malt liquor it's only vodka

Phone smell like tears how my dawg get up in there
He roll for his peers now we all look like sinners
Now we outchea eatin', I thought we all would be at dinner, yeah
Don't let this shit distract you from your purpose, bruh
They just trying to stop what you been workin' for
You said that you'd buy your mama a whole crib
But now your kid ain't got no crib, you doin' a whole bid, shit
That ain't where you ’posed to be
Thousands in the crowd, that’s just what you supposed to see
I told her that you supposed to just lay low, stay close to me
Let me do all the workin', I know that we both could eat

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Supposedly, we all should be destined for the same fate
Tryna impress all these niggas just to save face
Bigger guns, bigger whips, we in the same race
Then we end up in the same place

[Chorus: T-Pain]

Bling, blow, put that gun up, fuck these niggas

Runnin' in place and can't make no ground
I keep tellin’ my dawg to make they own sound
Put them O's down, the police comin' and it's over now
Yeah, havin' that pack ain't where it's at
Put your city on the map, and leave that bitch behind your back
'Cause them niggas gon' start hatin' all the sudden
And if they can't find you, they make examples out your cousin
What the fuck is goin' on with niggas?
Somethin' wrong with niggas
You make that cake and can't feel safe in your own home with niggas
But if you can't stay out that place, then you belong with niggas
And you gone raise that lil baby to be a grown lil nigga

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Supposedly, we all should be destined for the same fate
Tryna impress all these niggas just to save face
Bigger guns, bigger whips, we in the same race

[Verse 3: Profit Dinero]
Swear my grind was hard as I hustled hard
Prayin' for these blessings, gave it all to God
Ain't nobody have faith in Betty grandboy
Pain made a phone call and now I'm headed north
It's shame my own city hate to see me shine
Bitch, I'm focused on these millions, we need every dime
NappyBoy to the death, I'm talkin' dotted lines
Got everybody lookin' froze like a broken spine
Knew my time was comin', all it took was patience
Actions speak louder than words, so now they really hatin'
Business over bullshit when we at the occasion
And you know we 'bout them chips like a trip to Vegas
Made it out the hood but still love Ty
1700 forever, RIP to Jah
Made a vow to my son that I would never stop
And if I ever got a chance, I would never flop

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Yeah, yeah
Man, I swear that I got one up on these niggas
Bling, blow, put that gun up, fuck these niggas
Use that second chance to make a better plan
Be a better man or it's whatever, man
Yeah, my dawg go on and light that blunt up for my nigga
Bling, blow, put that gun up, fuck these niggas
Use that second chance to make a better plan
Be a better man or it's whatever, man

The greatest of all time, check my stats, bitch (Check my stats, bitch)
But you look like Wayne, you sound like Wayne, we gettin' catfished?
Callin' me a has-been when the only thing I have been
Is everything they haven't been
Looking like my mannequins
Somethin' like some amateurs, I call 'em Tunechi Scavengers
I need to sue they managers
All these lil' robots, do they even include the batteries?
Kiss my gluteus maximus
This ain't that and that ain't this, feel like I been cloned, dawg
I just cut your song off, that shit sound like womp-womp
I just cut some me on, that shit lit like neon
Grammys on my shelf
I know some bitches that deserve they panties on my shelf
But they didn't have no underwear
I'm on a planet somewhere else, on a Xan and somethin' else
If these rappers is my sons, as a parent, I have failed
I'm the G.O.A.T
I don't even fuckin' write, but one motherfuckin' quote
Is better than everything you ever motherfuckin' wrote
That's true, she got a G.O.A.T. tattoo
I got a G.O.A.T. statue, you gotta quote that too
From the G.O.A.T. mouth

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish, Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
I don't like stayin' at home
When the moon is bleeding red
Woke up stoned in the backseat
From a dream where my teeth fell out of my head
Cut it up, cut it up, yeah
Everybody's on something here
My godsend chemical best friend
Skeleton whispering in my ear

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down it is

[Chorus: Billie Eilish, Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
It used to take one
Now it takes four
You don't get me high anymore

[Verse 2, Billie Eilish, Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Runnin' through emergency rooms
Spinning wheels and ceiling fans
My handshake, cellophane, landscape
Mannequin fakin' it the best I can
Cadillac, Cadillac red
No hands on the steering wheel
I'm crashing this save-a-ho puppet show
UFO obliterate the way I feel

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS]
Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down it is

[Chorus: Billie Eilish & FINNEAS, Billie Eilish]
But nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
It used to take one
Now it takes four
You don't get me high anymore
You don't get me high anymore
You don't get me high anymore
Huh huh huh huh, huh huh huh huh
Huh huh huh huh, huh huh huh huh

[Verse 1]
Watching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
They're traveling the holy land
Opening telegrams
Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you pray
All your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear

[Chorus 1]
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers, they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best-laid plan
Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you pray
All your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear

[Chorus 1]
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers, they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

[Chorus 2]
You pray til the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And you’ll believe you’re loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

[Outro]
Ah-shake-it-baby
Shake it, shake it

(shake it shake it what's my line)

I feel like a sail-boat
Adrift on the sea
It's a brand new day
So when-you-gonna-phone me?

(shake it shake it what's my line)

I could take you to heaven
I could spin you to hell
But I'll take you to New York
It's the place that I know well

(shake it shake it what's my line)

Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
(shake it shake it what's my line)
Wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well

[Chorus 1]
I duck and I sway - (what's my line)
I shoot at a full moon - (what's my line)
So what's my line?  Shake it shake it baby
Oh shake it shake it, ooh

Because love is the answer
Love's talking to me
I'd scream and I'd fight for you
You're better than money

(shake it shake it what's my line)

We're the kind of people
Who can shake it
If we're feeling blue
(shake it shake it what's my line)
When you're feeling disconnected well
I sure know what to do
(shake it shake it what's my line)
Ah shake it, baby
Ah shake it shake it

[Chorus 2]

Blue Jean
I just met a girl named Blue Jean

She got a police bike
She got a turned up nose

(Dancing with the big boys)

Something's going on in society
(Dancing with the big boys)
You chew your fingers and stare at the floor
(Dancing with the big boys)
One wrong word and you're out of sync
Talking 'bout a hands-on policy
(Big boys)

Death to the trees
(Dancing with the big boys)
They weren't bad, they weren't brave
Nothing is embarrassing
Dancing with the big boys

(instrumental interlude)
Nothing is
Nothin' is ...
Embarrassing
There are too many people, too much belief
(Dancing with the big boys)
Where there's trouble there's poetry
(Dancing with the big boys)
Your family is a football team
(Big boys)
This dot marks your location
(Dancing with the big boys)
Loneliness in a free society
(Dancing with the big boys)

This can be embarrassing

Don't look down, no-ooh-oh-ooh

I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy
Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name

But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

Don't' look, don't look down
Don't look down
They're making sort of crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy
Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name

But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear

But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake

But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
Brrrrrr-rrrah!

[Verse 1]
I've seen the city
I took the next flight
For Borneo

They say it's pretty
I like the T-shirts
In Borneo

Some wear Bob Marley
Others in "Playboy"
Or Duvalier

Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo

Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day...
But even in springtime
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter
I'll reply with a broken spear
The dusky mulatto
In nylons and tattoos

[Chorus]
Hot juice in coke bottles
We dance in the sand
Well, they twirl and they tumble
(tumble & twirl)
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
(tumble & twirl)
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble

I've been to Leon's
Ah, he's got nine daughters
And a stereo

They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo

When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
(percussion and mixed-bass interlude)

Brrrrah!
I like the free world
They say it's pretty
This time of year
They tumble and twirl
(tumble and twirl)
I'll tumble and twirl
I like the free world
I like the free world
They say it's pretty

Brrrrah!
No one can blame you
For walking away
Too much rejection, uh-huh
No love injection

Life can't be easy
It's not always swell
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
Cause it hurts like hell

But down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground:
A land serene
A crystal moon
Ah..Ahh...

It's only forever
Not long at all
Lost and lonely
That's underground
Underground
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
Heard about a place today
I, I'm underground
Nothing ever hurts again
Heard about a place today
Daddy, get me out of here
Where nothing ever hurts again
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
I, I'm underground
Sister, sister, please take me down
I, I'm underground
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here

No one can blame you
For walking away
Too much rejection
No love injection

Down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground;
A land serene;
A crystal moon
Ah..

It's only
It's only forever
It's not long at all
Lost and lonely
That's underground
Underground
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
Heard about a place today
Nothing never hurts again
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
I'm, I'm underground
Sister, sister, please take me down
I'm, I'm underground
Daddy, daddy, get me out
Wanna live underground
Wanna live underground
Wanna live underground
Wanna live underground
Wanna live underground
Wanna live underground
Wanna live underground
Wanna live underground
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
I'm, I'm underground
Sister, sister please take me down
I, I'm underground
I, I'm underground
I, I'm underground
Daddy, daddy, get me..
Daddy, daddy, get me..
Wanna live underground..
Sister, sister, take me down

[Chorus]
(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Stay in) Stay in
(Fade out) Fade out
(Day in) Hoo hoo
(Day out) Oh hoo hoo

[Verse 1]
She was born in a handbag
Love left
On a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
Nothing seems to make a dent
Going to find her some money, honey
Try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about
(Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Stay in) Stay in
(Fade out) Fade out
(Day in) Hoo hoo
(Day out) Oh hoo hoo

[Verse 2]
First thing she learns is
She's a citizen
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Someone rings a bell
And it's all over
She's going out of her way
Stealing for that one good rush
(Ah)

[Chorus]
(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Stay in) Stay in
(Fade out) Fade out
(Day in) Hoo hoo
(Day out) Oh hoo hoo

[Verse 3]
She could use a little money
She's hanging on his arms
Like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey
She's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
Late night, big town
Police, shake down

[Chorus]
Day in
Day out
Stay in
Fade out
Hoo hoo

(Day in)
(Day out)
(Stay in)
(Fade out)

[Verse 4]
(Day in) She's got a ticket to nowhere
(Day out) She's going to take a train ride
(Stay in) Nobody knows her, or knows her name
(Stay out) She's in the pocket of a home boy
(Stay in) Oh she's going to take her a shotgun, pow
(Stay out) Spin the grail spin the drug
(Stay in) She's going to make them well aware
(Stay out) She's an angry girl
(All over)

[Chorus]
(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Stay in) Stay in
(Fade out) (Fade out) Fade out

[Outro]
(Day in) And there's angels everywhere
(Day out) Suddenly shooting her down
(Day in) Shooting her with video, drugs, bullets, and promises
(Day out) Angels in a ton of sound... And it's—
(Day in) Day in
(Day out) Day out
(Day in) You stay in, or ya...
(Day out) Ya fade out, fade out
(Day in) Fade out
(Day out) Ha, and ya...
(Day in) Fade out

[Intro]
Time will crawl
Time will crawl

[Verse 1]
I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
(Time will crawl)
'Til the 21st century lose
I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon, and he—
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot and he—
He made him fly through a hole
'Til he grew real old, and he—
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

[Chorus 1]
Time will crawl
'Til our mouths run dry
Time will crawl
'Til our feet grow small
Time will crawl
'Til our tails fall off
Time will crawl
'Til the 21st century lose

[Verse 2]
I saw a black, black stream
Full of wide-eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm, warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years (and the)
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

[Chorus 2]
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
Time will crawl:
'Til the 21st century lose
(Go!)

[Instrumental Interlude - keys]
Time will crawl!
Time will crawl

[Instrumental Interlude keys-
Guitar solo - extended sax solo]

[Verse 3]
You were a talented child
You came to live in our town (ooooh ...)
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went off (ooooh ... )
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

[Chorus 1]
Time will crawl
And our heads bowed down
Time will crawl
And our eyes fall out
Time will crawl
And the streets run red
Time will crawl
'Til the 21st century lose

[Chorus 1]
Time will crawl
And our mouths run dry
Time will crawl
And our feet grow small
Time will crawl
And our tails fall off
Time will crawl
'Til the 21st century lose

[Chorus 1]
Time will crawl
And our heads bowed down
Time will crawl
And our eyes fall out
Time will crawl
And the streets run red
Time will crawl
'Til the 21st century lose

[Outro]
Time will crawl
For the crazy child
Time will crawl
We'll give every life
'Til the 21st century lose
For the crackpot notion
Makin' my love
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far

Mm-hmm-hmm
Uhm hmm hmm uhm...
(repeat uhmm hmm-hmm's X 3)

Eddie boy lit like paraffin
Spending two weeks
In a crack house
Burns on his brain
Like Chernobyl

Dean was seen
With a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone for pray for
Until I met you
Life is like a broken arrow
Memory a swinging door
I could be your great misfortune
I can make you happy
Every day of your life!

Makin' my love
Like a shining star;
Taking my love
Just a touch too far

Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice
'cause love left holes
And four small kids breaking her heart

I've got windows, I've seen much vice
I've touched down with vermin
Cowardice, lice

And I say
Nobody cares what you do
Please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune ...
But you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man!

Makin' my love
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far
Peter met Frank
Formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads out of shape for the name of Trotsky, Sinn-Fein, Hitler cash down
No hope heroes cover the page
With debts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs
Threw it all away
For life in the grave (life in the grave)

Life is like a broken arrow
Memory a swinging door
I could be your great misfortune
Well, I could make you happy
Every goddamn single day of your life!

Makin' my love
Like a shining star
Like a shining star ...
Babe that's what you are
Like a shining star (oh)

Makin' my love (making my love)
Like a shining star (like a shining star)
Taking my love (taking my love)
Just a touch too far (just a touch too far)
Making my love (making my making my making my love)
Like a shining star (like a shining star)
Taking my love (making my love)
Just a touch too far (just a touch to, uh far)
Making my love (making my love)
Like a shining star (huh, like a shining star)
Taking my love (taking my love)
Just a touch too far (touch too far)
Making my love (mmm -hmmm-hmm-hmm)
Like a shining star (mmhmm)
Taking my love (mmhmm)

[Verse 1]
When I believed in nothing
I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint
In some place
I called her name
And though my days were slipping by
And nights so cruel
I thought I'd die

[Prec-Chorus]
She danced her little dance 'til it made me cry
She was shaking like this honey doing that

[Verse 2]
When I needed soul revival
I called your name
When I was falling to pieces
I screamed in pain
Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real
Swept over me

[Pre-Chorus]
You danced a little dance 'til it made me cry
She was shaking like this honey doing that

[Chorus]
Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down

[Verse 3]
When all your faith is failing, Call my name
When you've got nothing coming, Call my name
I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head
Until the bad stuff breaks

[Pre-Chorus]
Dance my little dance 'til it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

[Chorus]
Never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

[Outro]
Oh no

I promise I climb on her, she climb on me
She want me to get out the streets, but I refuse to leave
She live life just like a kid and new Js on her feet
Her booty big as the sea, she don't eat Mickey D's
She wanna get her tubes tied, no kids, no
She like the fact that I bang red like a seminole
Nigga screaming RIP Os, no cheerios
Bitches think we falling out 'cause the Jeep don't got doors
But they wrong, man, they all wrong
I won't last forever, I'm gon' stay strong
Like the relationship on Molly, we gon' last long
I got apartments, I got lofts, I got homes, no loan
No fussin' and tussin', no
No bussin', no fussin', and cussin', no
No bussin', I love shit

You know I played her to the right like a kingpin

Alright
My favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story. They do more than just set the scene or paint the picture. The writing I love the most places you into that story, that room, that rain soaked kiss. You can smell the air, hear the sounds, and feel your heart race as the character's does. It’s something F. Scott Fitzgerald did so well, to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations, that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment.

I'm highly biased, but I think that the way music can transport you back to a long-forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time. To this day, when I hear "Cowboy Take Me Away" by the Dixie Chicks, I instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old, sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in Pennsylvania. I'm clutching a guitar and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time, rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house. When I hear "I Write Sins Not Tragedies" by Panic! At The Disco, I’m transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of Hendersonville, Tennessee, with my best friend Abigail, euphorically screaming the lyrics. When I hear "How to Save a Life" by The Fray, "Breathe (2AM)" by Anna Nalick, or "The Story" by Brandi Carlile, I immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end. When I'd get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew, I would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room – just being alone with those songs (Those are all from the Grey's Anatomy soundtrack. My commitment to that show truly knows no bounds). I'm convinced that "You Learn" by Alanis Morissette, "Put Your Records On" by Corinne Bailey Rae and "Why" by Annie Lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs.


I love writing songs because I love preserving memories, like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had. I like to use nostalgia as inspiration when I'm writing songs for the same reason I like to take photographs. I like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times. I want to remember the color of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever.

The fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of. I thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being, well, universal. You'd think that as pop writers, we're supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to, so you'd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic… AND YET the ones I think cut through the most are actually the most detailed, and I don’t mean in a Shakespearean sonnet type of way, although I love Shakespeare as much as the next girl. Obviously. (See "Love Story," 2009).

In modern pop, songs/bops/chunes including extremely personal details like "Kiki, do you love me" and "Baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover" have been breaking through on the most global cultural level. This year on tour, I got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from Cuba singing about Havana.

I think these days, people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to. We like being confided in and hearing someone say, "this is what I went through" as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles. We actually do NOT want our pop music to be generic. I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive. This glimpse into the artist’s story invites us to connect it to our own, and in the best case scenario, allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories. It's this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal, or made us cry, dance, or escape that truly stands the test of time. Just like a great book.

[Verse 1]
The color of my face, it changes by day
But when the cold comes through it washes away
I wanna paint it so that it stays the same
The blood inside me is a dark purple shade

[Verse 2]
I feel it coming, don't know where I can stay
My eyes go cloudy almost every day
Wish I could speak, but I have nothing to say
All I can show you is this piece of my-

[Verse 3]
I waste my time in the morning and evening
Caught in a feeling
I lose my mind looking up at the ceiling
It's just a feeling
It's just a feeling
It's just a feeling
It's just a feeling

[Verse 4]
I could spend the day and think of all of the ways
Spend the day, tucked away
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Outro]
It's just a feeling
It's just a feeling
Every time I think about the things we used to do
Places we used to go
I just want to go back to those days
And relive it all over again with you
Oooh!

Daydreaming of a time you and I used to make sweet love
Reminiscing of the secrets, that we shared between both of us
Puts a smile on my face when I think how we run and play, yeah
Walked in the park after dark to get a kiss in our hideaway

It reminds me of the good old days
It reminds me of the good old days, yeah

We used to talk about our dreams
And how we would live and bathe, girl
Remember playing on the phone with each other for hours
Hours, yeah
And when you walk by me and smile, I swear I smell peppermints
You and me young and free, holding hands, so innocent
And it reminds me of the good old days, yeah
It reminds me of the good old days, yeah

(Doo-Doo, Doo-Doo-Doo)
(Doo-Doo, Doo-Doo-Doo)
(Doo-Doo, Doo-Doo-Doo)
(Doo-Doo, Doo-Doo-Doo)
Flipping back through the photographs, girl
(Doo-Doo, Doo-Doo-Doo)
(Doo-Doo, Doo-Doo-Doo)
All of the memories got me wishing I had you back
(I had you back)
Oooh, in my arms, girl
(Back in my arms)

Cause it reminds me
It reminds me of the good old days, of the good all days
When you used to love me, baby
Hoo!
It reminds me of the good all days
We vowed from our heart, yeah
That we would never part, babe
It reminds me of the good all days, girl
I remember when weekday, late night coming in
(It reminds me of the good old days)
Memories of you and me, making love until the week
Yeah, baby
(It reminds me of the good old days)
Girl, it reminds me
Yeah-Yeah
Used to get it, girl
(It reminds me of the good old days)
Any time, anywhere, didn't care
Hoo!
(Yeah)
Hoo!
Hoo!
Walked in the park, baby
(It reminds me of the good old days)
Kissing at the door, baby
You and me running free, getting back the memories, girl
(It reminds me of the good old days)
Ba-Ba-B-Da
Ba-Ba-B-Da
Ba-Ba-B-Da
Ba-Ba-B-Da

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
At a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

[Chorus]
Driving that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones you better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come 'round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you), about you (About you)
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you, yeah

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Don't complicate it (Yeah)
'Cause I know you and you know everything about me
I can't remember (Yeah) all of the nights
I don't remember when you're 'round me (Oh, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you), about you (About you)
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you, yeah (Uh)

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away (Oh no)

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Well, the joint was jumping, going around and around
Hey, now reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
Well, no, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well, it sounded sweet, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat, well, 'cause I had to dance
Started moving my feet, yes and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, now reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
Well no, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
Woo!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Well now, twelve o'clock, something like that, oh the place was packed
The front doors they was locked, 'cause that place was packed
But when the police knocked, well, them old doors flew back
They flew back

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound, y'all
Well no, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1 repeated]
Well, it sounded so sweet y'all, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat y'all, oh I had to dance
Started moving my feet y'all, well yes and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Yeah, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
Well no, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Ooh, they never stopped rocking, going around and around now
Woo, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound, y'all
Well no, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Ooh, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound, y'all
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Ooh, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
No, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound

Thank you, don't go away
(We're gonna take another short break and we'll be back with another set in a few minutes)
I'd like to thank John Cipollina, Lee Oskar, Matthew Kelly, and Greg Errico back there on the drums

[Verse 1]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light
Into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose
From the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the
Clouds of delusion

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around
(Coming around) Coming around (Coming around)
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around, y'all)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty, asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best
More than my wine
More than my wine, more than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said, I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life, I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet someday
The good Lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 3]
Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Got up and wandered, I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl, named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day good-bye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and the foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

[Outro]
Fortune comes a-crawling, Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling all sort of bad, y'all
Asked my family doctor about what I had, y'all
I said now, "Doctor (Doctor), Mister M.D., (Doctor)
Oh, can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me? (Doctor)"

[Chorus]
Well, he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need is good lovin'
Well, you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
You got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Plenty good lovin', good lovin'

[Verse 2]
So come on baby, oh, squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy to be alright?
I said now baby (Baby), oh, it's for sure (Baby)
I've got the fever (Baby), you got the cure (Baby)

[Chorus]
She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need is good lovin'
Well, you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
You got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Can you give me some lovin'? (Good lovin')

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1 repeated]
Well, I was feeling all sort of bad, y'all

Oh, can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me?" (Doctor)

[Chorus]

Happy New Year!

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back in the woods among the evergreens
There in an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go;
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go;
Go Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by would stop and say
"My my, but that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go;
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go;
Go Johnny go, go, go Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
His momma told him "someday you will be a man."
You will be the leader of a big old band"
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Seeing Johnny B. Goode tonight

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go;
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go;
Go Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go;
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go;
Go Johnny go, go, go Johnny B. Goode

[Outro dialogue]

The Grateful Dead, please

They're the greatest rock and roll band that ever was, The Grateful Dead

[Intro: The Grateful Dead]
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
(I remember quite well, I remember quite well)
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

[Verse: The Grateful Dead]
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon my savior’s breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

[Outro: Bill Graham]
One big one, whatever you've got left, whatever energy you have
One more time please, The Grateful Dead...

[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It’s been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle
Or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now
I can feel it my feet now
Listen, here it comes again!

[Bridge]
There's a band out on the highway
They're high stepping into town
It’s a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Well, the sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinning dizzy
Lord, the band kept us too busy
We forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band
Lord, they're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight
Balls of lighting roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on

[Bridge]
Keep on dancing through the daylight
And greet the morning air with song
No ones's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone
Was it ever here at all?
But they kept on dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Outro]
Well, the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn’s a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Lord, I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down to the sea
Try to see what's going down
Lord, and read between the lines
Had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling
You was comin' after me
Back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked into a bar door
It was all night pouring, pouring, pouring
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Until the sun goes down
'Til it go down, 'til it go down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore

[Verse 1]
Baby used to stay out all night long
Made me cry, Lord she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, and that's no lie
Tables turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Verse 2]
Well, she used to run around with every man in town
Spend all my money, Lord, out playing her high class game
Put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Table's turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Yes, I used to wake up in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I got worried, you know she eased my achin' head
But now she's here and there with every man in town
Was still tryin' to take me for that same old clown

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
My baby used to stay out all night long
Make me cry, Lord she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, baby, that's no lie
Tables turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Our crack equipment crew is tending to a problem here

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
Even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don’t you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 2]
I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
Tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonely blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show that you don’t ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 1 repeated]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And please play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don’t you let that deal go down

[Outro]
Don’t you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don’t you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don’t you let that deal go down
Don't you...

[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a youngin's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I’m bound
And no one could change my mind, but Mama tried

One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, ’cause Mama tried

[Verse 2]
Dear old Daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause Mama tried
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause Mama tried
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Instrumental break]

My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, and I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
Well, I grab a bottle, crack him in the jaw
Shot me another, well hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
And we high-tailed it down to Mexico
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left him lyin' there by the side of the road
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
If you will marry me, I will set your cities free
And free all the people in the area-O

I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you but your guineas are too few
And I fear my mama would be angry-O

What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink
Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, all your cities I will burn
Destroy all the people in the area-O

[Instrumental break]

Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, combing back your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to your William-O

Sweet William, he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William, he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William, he is dead, and he died for a maid
And he's buried in the Louisiana country-O

As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin’
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
But it's all right 'cause I love you
And that’s not going to change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from the cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
They're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only want to hold you, I don't want to tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, have gotten used to havin’ you around
My landscape would be empty, if you were gone

[Chorus]
But it’s alright 'cause I love you
And that’s not going to change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs, written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
Brave the storm to come, it surely looks like rain
Brave the storm to come, ooh, ooh
Looks like rain and it feels like rain
Brave the storm to come
Here come rain
Looks like rain, feels like rain
Brave the storm to come
Looks like rain
Brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, ooh
Here come the rain
Brave the storm to come (Brave the storm to come)
Looks like rain, and feels like rain
Oh, here comes the rain
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain
Brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain
Brave the storm to come (Brave the storm to come)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain
Brave the storm to come
Here comes the rain
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain
Brave the storm to come
Oh, 'cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain
It looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day which could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I’m on my way, on my way

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
When your big old ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What’s the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Oh, across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

[Instrumental]
Left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Caroline
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rollin' 'cross the Georgia state
Had motor trouble it turned into a struggle
Halfway 'cross Alabam'
The 'hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Instrumental break]

Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on the midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
'Cause people are there who care a little about me
They won't let the poor boy down
Sure as she you're born, she bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Instrumental]

Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
And flying over to the Golden State
The pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be headin' in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'
And the poor boy's on the line

Thanks folks, we're gonna take a short break
Y'all can do whatever you want to
I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

She had rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

In the heat of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before
Well, I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Instrumental break]

Well, there ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias
Or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental break]

The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Get up, get out, get out of the door
You're playin' cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Long distance runner, one foot at the door
Caught in slow motion, fall to the floor
Drown in laughter and drew to the door
You gave all you had, why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more that it takes
That thin line beyond which you really can't fake

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental break]

Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling all sort of bad, y'all
Asked my family doctor about what I had, y'all
I said, "Doctor (Doctor), Mister M.D., (Doctor)
Oh, can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me?" (Doctor)

[Chorus]
He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need is good lovin'
Well, you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Everybody got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Plenty good lovin', good lovin'

[Verse 2]
Come on baby, squeeze me tight
Well, don't you want your daddy to be alright?
I said now baby (Baby), oh, it's for sure (Baby)
I've got the fever (Baby), you got the cure (Baby)

[Chorus]
Everybody, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need is good lovin'
Well, you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Everybody got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Give me good love, my baby (Good lovin')

Yeah yeah, got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Everybody got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Everybody got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Everybody got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Everybody got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Everybody got to have lovin' (Good lovin')

I think we broke something

[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
Ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one say she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:

[Verse 4 repeated]

I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
And I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
It's going to be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
This afternoon, streets turned gray
And I watch the fires below
Still, I know I lead the way
They'll tell me where I go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me
Shine on the beach, sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will rise to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)

And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory going to be my name
And people will light my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no
It's gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Been so long I felt this way
Time's sure passing slow
My time coming, any day
I know where to go

[Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where to go
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no

[Bridge]
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no (Ooh)

[Outro]
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well, he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel
Love's for real, not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar
In the end there's just a song, comes crying up the night
Through all the broken years and vanished dreams

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down, there’s nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams
And there's still that song, comes crying like the wind
Down every lonely street that’s ever been

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Bridge]
I've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel, can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Gonna make them shine (Shine)

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
It all rolls into one, nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold for very long
And there's still that song, come crying like the wind
It seems like all this life was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue
Saint Stephen will remain
All he lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home

Fortune comes a crawlin'
Calliope woman
Spinnin' that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Verse 1]
Reaching to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's going to be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo! Saturday night now
One more Saturday night now
That's right, Saturday night now

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the whole place is going to fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo! Saturday night now
One more Saturday night now
Ow, Saturday night

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Turn on Channel Six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, break out your rocking shoes

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo! Saturday night now
One more Saturday night now
Ah, Saturday night

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo, Saturday night now
One more Saturday night now
Ow, Saturday night

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
(One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night now

Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night

Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
OW! (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night

Thank you
Lady with a Fan

Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
'Til my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'Til things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster

[Instrumental break]

The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master

[Instrumental break]

Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

Terrapin Station

Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
Oh, from the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - If it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - But the train's put it's brakes on
Terrapin - And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
And if that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

From the other direction, she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try

I knew right away she was not like other girls

She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and was closing the door

Been there before

Well, I ain't always right but I've never been wrong
Seldom turns out the way it does in a song
Once in a while you can get shown the light

Well, there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes

Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad

Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine

[Instrumental]
Chameleon changing colors-while a crocodile cries
People rubbing elbows bit never touching eyes
Talking off their marks, revealing still another guise
Genuine imitation life

People buying happiness and manufactured fun
Everybody doing what everybody's done
People count on people who can only count to one
Genuine imitation life

All the pretty clouds are a lovely shade of black
You find the night direction, someone tears up all the track
People worship crosses, fingers cross behind their back
Genuine imitation life
Genuine imitation life

Old friends get together but it’s solitaire they play
Everybody's rainbow done in different shades of gray
It's a lovely place to visit but I wouldn’t want to stay
In a genuine imitation life
Genuine imitation life
Genuine imitation life

{Beat switch}

{Verse 2}
Yea, timing is money and money is time
Hustle like I'm bout to run outta time
Step to a chump in the front of the line
Get on my level I been in the mix
Blue in Rick Rari like optimus prime
Most of these niggas be poppin' these pills
Don't know what they talkin' they outta they mind
They sippin' that lean and poppin' the perkies a thousand a time
They say that they goons get knocked for a body they droppin' a dime
You said he a hitter
Why you was lyin'?
Yea, livin' that shit I was rappin
They rappin the shit I was trappin'
We catch them niggas in traffic
The FN five-seven drop 21 on 'em no savage

[Verse 1]
Everything that happened was a blur
I flip through a map inside a gas station
I see where I am and where we were
We blew 15 hundred on the way just tryna make it
When we finally got to Hollywood
We stayed 11 days in that place right off of Wilcox
You were saying we would catch a break
But you were tired, I could see it on your face
And you were scared, I could see it on your face
Our fingers laced up
I missed the way the winter tastes
I miss that wooden staircase we raced up

[Verse 2]
I heard a screech on the 101, I rubber neck
And watch 'em wreck, some rotten things suppressed and bottled up
A half-image flashes of us laughin' piss-drunk
Then a half-image flashes of us fightin' piss-drunk
Lightning hit the stump in a stretch of white heat
Barreling through Omaha, floatin' tumbleweed
Startles me awake, the car starts to shake
I glanced at your hair-tie around my handbrake

[Chorus]
I was a brilliant speck of light across a lonely landscape
I was a brilliant speck of light across a lonely landscape
I was a brilliant speck of light across a lonely landscape

[Bridge]
Now are you okay?
Sometimes you holler in your sleep
You say your whole head feels like a faucet when it leaks
You say your whole head feels like a white noise machine
You say your whole head feels like a colony of bees

[Outro]
I was lured out by a light
And I couldn't tell what time it was
I was afraid of it
But I was compelled towards it
And it pulled me in

[Verse 1]
Oh baby
I'm lonely, and I'm fucked up by myself
Could you come here?
Well, I'm wasting and I'm anxious
I'm fading from myself
Could you come here?
And say you'll stay the night

[Chorus]
'Cause it's been a while
Since I've seen you smilin' (Here, here)
And yeah, you know it's been a while (Here)
Since I've seen you, since I've seen you smilin' (Smilin', smilin')

[Verse 2]
Well, oh baby, could you come down?
I think I'm freaking out and I'm drunk
And I don't think I can beat it
I'm paralyzed, I'm terrified of bein' alone
When you said...

[Chorus]
'Cause it's been a while
Since I thought about the good things
All the bright light things
All the good times that we had
Oh it's been a while being (Here)
Since I've made you, since I've made you smile
And I'm chained to myself
Tell me why I can't help myself
I hurt myself, I lost myself
I'm lost

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]

[Outro]
I can't help myself
I hurt myself
I lost myself
I'm lost

[Verse 1]
Hands grip the back of the wide lens
You tell me to smile and I do
I'm wide-eyed when I think about you
I'm wide-eyed when I think about you
Glory, glory, well, I could cry now
So I avert my eyes and I do
And I'm red-eyed when I think about you
And I'm red-eyed when I think about you

[Chorus]
See ya later
No way, no way, no way
See ya later

[Verse 2]
Hands on my chest when you lie down
A sea of grey and black around you
I get dog eyes when I think about you
I get dog eyes when I think about you
Glory, glory, why do you hide now?
Save me, save me now
Your new eyes look pretty on you
Your new eyes look pretty on you

[Bridge]
On you, babe
On you, babe
On you, babe
On you, babe
On you, babe
On you, babe
On you, babe
On you, babe

[Outro]
Oh, if I die today
Will it be without grace?
Will it be violent? Will it be tame?
Will I be silent? Will I be brave?
I don’t wanna go
Don’t wanna go

[Verse]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back
Comic book colors on a violin river crying leonardo
Words from out a silk trombone

I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Verse]
Look for a while at the China cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed Cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back
Comic book colors on a violin river crying Leonardo
Words from out a silk trombone

I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I’m gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Guitar solo 1]

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I’m gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Guitar solo 2]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
I feel tears welling up from down deep inside
Like my heart's got a big break
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful that I may never shake
You might think that I'm taking it hard since you broke me off with a call
You might wager that I'll hide in sorrow and I might lay right down and bawl

[Chorus]
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the back stretch
Heartaches a-going to the inside
My tears are holding back, trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the back stretch
Heartaches a-going to the inside
My tears are holding back, trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

[Chorus]
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the back stretch
Heartaches a-going to the inside, my tears are holding back, trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running, true love scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches, and the winner loses all

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the back stretch
Heartaches a-going to the inside
My tears are holding back, trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter’s summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, it's evenings and songs of its own

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it’s close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, it's evenings and songs of its own

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, it's evenings and songs of its own

[Solo outro]

[Chorus]
Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I’m going to sit right here until I die

[Guitar solo 1]

[Verse 2]
Well I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she’s gone
Well, I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you, big river, more than me

[Chorus]
Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die
Till I die

[Guitar solo 2]

[Outro]
Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die
And I'm going to sit right here until I die
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
Ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand of P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan
Shine your shoes, light your fuse
Can you use them old U.S. Blues?
I'll drink your health, share your wealth
Run your life, steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Back to back chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song the United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
My my my oh my my my my
Summertime done, come and gone, my

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just look to see the sights
I can tell your future
Look what's in your hand
But i can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While i'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Outro]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak daybreak on the land

[Verse 1]
Loose Lucy is my delight
She come running and we ball all night

[Chorus 1]
Round and round
And round and round
And round
Don't take much to get me on the ground

[Verse 2]
She’s my yo-yo, I'm her string
Listen to the birds on the hot wire sing

[Chorus 2]
Yeh-yeh
Yeh-yeh
Yeh-yeh
Yeh, singing, "Thank you, for a real good time!"

[Verse 3]
I got jumped coming home last night
Shadow in the alley turned out all my lights

[Chorus 1]
Round and round
And round and round
And round
Don't take much to get me on the ground

[Verse 4]
Loose Lucy, she was sore
Says I know you don’t want my love no more

[Chorus 2]
Yeh-yeh
Yeh-yeh
Yeh-yeh
Yeh, singing, "Thank you, for a real good time!"

[Verse 5]
Be-bop baby how can this be?
I know you been out and cheating on me

[Chorus 1]
Yeh-yeh
Yeh-yeh
Yeh-yeh
Yeh, singing, "Thank you, for a real good time!"

[Verse 6]
Cross my heart and hope to die
I was just hanging out with the other guys

[Chorus 2]
Yeh-yeh
Yeh-yeh
Yeh-yeh
Yeh, singing, "Thank you, for a real good time!"

[Verse 7]
Went back home with two black eyes
You know I'll love you till the day I die

[Chorus 1]
Yeh-yeh
Yeh-yeh
Yeh-yeh
Yeh, singing, "Thank you, for a real good time!"

[Verse 8]
I like your smile but I ain't your type
Don't shake the tree when its fruit ain't ripe

[Bridge]
Yeh-yeh

[x3]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world

[Verse 1]
A pistol shot at 5 o'clock
The bells of heaven ring
Tell me what you done it for
No, I won’t tell you a thing
Yesterday I begged you
Before I hit the ground
All I leave behind me
Is only what I found

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
If you can abide it
Let the hurdy-gurdy play
Stranger ones have come by here
Before they flew away
I will not condemn you
Nor yet would I deny
I would ask the same of you
But failing will not die
Take up your china doll
(Take up your china doll)
It's only fractured
And just a little nervous
From the fall

[Outro]
Na, na na na na na na...

[Part 1]
Winter rain, now tell me why
Summers fade, and roses die
The answer came
The wind and rain

Golden hills, now veiled in gray
Summer leaves have blown away
Now what remains? The wind and rain

And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (flowing)
Flowing ’till the waters all are dry (flowing)
The loving in her eyes

Circle songs and sands of time
And seasons will end in tumbled rhyme
And little change
The wind and rain
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (flowing)
Flowing 'till the rivers all are dry (flowing)
The loving in her eyes

(Winter gray and falling rain)
(We’ll see summer come again)
(Darkness falls and seasons change)
Gonna happen every time
(Same old friends the wind and rain)
We'll see summer by and by
Summers fade and roses die
(You'll see summer come again)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky

[Part 2: "LET IT GROW"]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

Let it flow, greatly grow, wide and clear!
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again!

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing

Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield!

What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of men
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle

[Verse 1]
All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar
In the end there's just a song comes crying up the night
Through all the broken dreams and vanished years

[Chorus]
Stella blue, Stella blue

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams
In the end there's still that song comes crying like the wind
Down every lonely street that's ever been

[Chorus]
Stella blue, Stella blue

[Verse 3]
I've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel, can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Going to make them shine (shine)

[Instrumental break]

It all rolls into one and nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold, for very long
And when you hear that song come crying like the wind
It seems like all this life was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella blue, Stella blue

"Thank you."

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling so bad, asked my family doctor about what I had
I said, "Doctor, Doctor, Mister M.D., (doctor) can you tell me (doctor), what's ailing me? (doctor)"

[Chorus]
He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need: good loving
Because you got to have loving (good loving)
Everybody got to have loving (good loving)
A little good loving now baby, good loving

[Verse 2]
So come on baby, squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy to be alright?
I said baby, now it's for sure
I've got the fever, you got the cure

[Chorus]
He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need: good loving
Because you got to have loving (good loving)
Everybody got to have loving (good loving)
A little good loving now baby, good loving

[Bridge]
Hey, got to have loving (good loving)
Well, you got to have loving (good loving)
Come on now and give me good loving (good loving)

[Verse 3]
Well, I was feeling sort of bad now
Asked my family doctor about what I had
I said, "Doctor, Doctor, mister M.D. (doctor)
Can you tell me (doctor), what's ailing me? (doctor)"

[Chorus]
He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need: good loving
Hey, now you got to have loving (good loving)
Everybody got to have loving (good loving)
Give me, give me, give me some loving (good loving)
Come on now, everybody get right, (got to have loving)
You may be weak or you may be blind (got to have loving)
But even a blind man knows when the sun is shining (got to have loving)

[Outro]
So turn it on now (got to have loving)
Turn on, turn on your light (got to have loving)
Give me, give me, give me some loving (good loving)
Hey, now you got to have loving (good loving)
You need it, I need it, well you got to have loving (good loving)
Say it again now, good loving
Well turn on your light, you won't regret it (good loving)
You got to go for the good and get it (good loving)
Everybody, they got to have loving (good loving)
Hey, now you got to have loving

[Verse 1]
Must be getting early
Clocks are running late
Paint by number morning sky looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere
Light a candle, curse the glare
Draw the curtains I don't care cause it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Verse 2]
I see you've got your fists out, say your piece and get out
Guess I get the gist of it but it's alright
Sorry that you feel that way
The only thing there is to say
Every silver lining's got a touch of grey

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Bridge]
It's a lesson to me
The Deltas and the East and the Freeze
The ABC's we all think of
To try to give a little love

[Verse 3]
I know the rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears but it's alright
Cow is given kerosene
Kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene but it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Verse 4]
The shoe is on the hand it fits
There's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit because it's alright
Oh, well, a touch of gray, kind of suits you anyway
That's was all I had to say but it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Chorus 2]
We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive
Lady with a Fan

Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
Till my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'till things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster

The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise

The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

Terrapin Station

Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
(Oh)
From the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - if it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - but the train's put it's brakes on
And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

At a Siding

While you were gone
These faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden
With nothing to believe in
The compass always points to Terrapin

Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again
For good or ill again

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, it's evenings and songs of its own

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, it's evenings and songs of its own

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, it's evenings and songs of its own

[Solo outro]

[Verse 1]
In the timbers of Fennario
The wolves are running 'round
The winter was so hard and cold
Froze ten feet 'neath the ground

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 2]
I sat down to my supper
It was a bottle of red whiskey
I said my prayers and went to bed
That's the last they saw of me

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 3]
When I awoke, the dire wolf
Six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window
All I said was, "Come on in"

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 4]
The wolf came in, I got my cards
We sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the queen of spades
But the cards were all the same

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Don't murder me

[Verse 5]
In the backwash of Fennario
The black and bloody mire
The dire wolf collects his due
While the boys sing round the fire

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Outro]
No, no, no
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day which could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Verse 3]
They say that when your ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Outro]
Across the Rio Grandio, across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grandio, across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grandio, across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grandio, across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grandio, across the lazy river

[Verse 1]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light
Into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose
From the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the
Clouds of delusion

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall
Of diamonds

[Verse 2]
Mirror shatters
In formless reflections
Of matter
Glass hand dissolving
To ice petal flowers
Revolving
Lady in velvet
Recedes
In the nights of goodbye

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall
Of diamonds

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin’ down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he stepped to the bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin’ down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over, and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack on Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hick’ry just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin’ down
And it looks like the old man's gettin’ on

[Verse 5]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Outro]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin’ on

[Verse 1]
As I was walking round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers and
Bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was
Into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the thick of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matches and
Was closing the door
I had one of those flashes:
I'd been there before
Been there before

[Verse 4]
I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Verse 5]
Well, there ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a
Touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Verse 6]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Chorus 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Chorus 2]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry this today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Verse]
Where have all the people gone my honey
Where have all the people gone today
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Chorus 2]
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a young man mourn today
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Chorus 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't really matter anyway

[Outro]
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
Guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Verse 1]
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music?
Would you hold it near as it were your own?

[Verse 2]
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air

[Chorus]
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

[Verse 3]
Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty
If your cup is full, may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men

[Verse 4]
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone

[Chorus]
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

[Verse 5]
You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running, running, running
I wonder if you care?
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down to the sea
Try to see what's going down
Try to read between the lines
Had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
Turned around to see
Heard a voice a-calling, calling, calling
You was coming after me
Back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
Ducked into a bar door
It was all night pouring, pouring rain
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Until the sun goes down
Till it go down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left

But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger that my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And as last here I

Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina good-bye

[Verse 1]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
In her long brown hair
I don't know, it must have been the roses
All I know is I could not leave her there

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there

[Verse 2]
Ten years the waves rolled the
Ships home from the sea
Thinking well how it may blow
In all good company
If I tell another what
Your own lips told to me
Let me lay neath the roses
Let my eyes no longer see

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there

[Verse 3]
One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining though
Come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the
Ribbons that she wore
And it's strange how no one
Comes round anymore

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there

[Verse 1]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
In her long brown hair
I don't know, it must have been the roses
All I know is I could not leave her there

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there

[Verse 1]
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Chorus 1]
I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would

[Verse 2]
Doctor call me crazy, some says I am some says I ain't
Doctor call me crazy, some says I am some says I ain't
The preacher man call me a sinner
But his little girl call me a saint

[Chorus 2]
Couple of shots of whiskey, women round here start lookin' good
A couple of shots of whiskey, women round here start lookin' good
Couple more shots of whiskey
I'm goin' down to Minglewood
T for Texas, yes and it's T for Timbuctoo
T for Texas, yes and it's T for Timbuctoo
Yes and it's T for Morrison
Where the little girls know what to do

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk
Virginia, California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound
It rode me past Raleigh, and on across Caroline
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
Had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Half way across Alabama
The Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
People are there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as she bore me, she bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until your deal come round
Don’t you let that deal go down

[Verse 2]
I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until your deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
And tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show that you don’t ever know
Watch each card you play and
Play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until your deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Outro]
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Well Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, you know he couldn't believe his mind
Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said tell me where your strength lies, if you please
Then she spoke so kind, she talked so fair
That Samson said, "Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever has lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 3]
Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got hands up round the lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
But I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
And I'm in no hurry, no
It's going to be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Yes, I know I lead the way
And they'll tell me where I go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me
Shine on the beach, sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will rise to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)

And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory going to be my name
And people will light my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no
It's gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
This afternoon, streets turned gray
And I watch the fire below
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no

[Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I go
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, don't worry 'bout me

[Bridge]
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter’s summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, it's evenings and songs of its own

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And there follows his wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it’s close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, it's evenings and songs of its own

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, it's evenings and songs of its own

[Solo outro]

[Verse]
Old man down, way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty, asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine, more than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said, I'd come to no good, I knew I would pearly, believe them
Half of my life, I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling 'round drunk on burgundy wine
But I'll get back on my feet again someday
The good lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should
I'll get up and fly away, I'll get up and fly away, fly away
Pearly's been true, true to me, true to my dying day he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been."
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you."
Got up and wandered, wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl, named bonnie lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Verse 1]
In another time's forgotten space
Your eyes looked from your mother's face
Wallflower seed on the sand and stone
May the four winds blow you safely home

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
You better roll away the dew

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you where the four winds dwell
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
It can ring like fire when you loose your way

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

[Verse 3]
God save the child that rings that bell
It may have one good ring, baby, you can't tell
One watch by night, one watch by day
If you get confused listen to the music play

[Instrumental break]

Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice you're gonna harvest the wind

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
You better roll away the dew
You better roll away the dew

[Verse 4]
I'll tell you where the four winds sleep
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wildflower seed on the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
You better roll away the dew
(Roll away)
Roll away the dew
(Roll away)
Roll away the dew
You'd better roll away the dew
(Roll away)

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Roll away the dew
You better away the dew
Roll away the dew
You better away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

"Thank you."
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on
Under the willow, we can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you

Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love for spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive
Sugar magnolia ringing that bluebell, caught up in sunlight, come on out singing;
I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on honey
Come along with me

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine?
Yes, indeed

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, when the moon is half way down...
Sometimes when the night is dying, I take me out, and I wander around
I wander 'round

Sunshine daydream walking in the tall trees, going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose, breathing more freely
Ride our singin'
I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream walking in the sunshine
Lady with a Fan

Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
Till my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'till things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster

The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise

The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

Terrapin Station

Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
(Oh)
From the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - if it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - but the train's put it's brakes on
And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

At a Siding

While you were gone
These faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden
With nothing to believe in
The compass always points to Terrapin

Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again
For good or ill again

[Verse 1]
I went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's going to be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night!

[Verse 2]
Everybody’s dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the whole place going to fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night!

[Verse 3]
Turn on Channel Six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I got no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, put on your rocking shoes

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night!

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought he’d have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night!

[Verse]
I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking thru the streets of Soho in the rain
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fook's
Going to get himself a big dish of beef chow mein
Hi ho, the werewolves of London
If you hear his howling around the kitchen door
You better not let him in
Little old lady got mutilated last night
Werewolves of London again
Hi ho, werewolves of London
He's the hairy-handed gent who ran amok in Kent
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair
You better stay away from him, he'll rip your lungs out Jim
I'd like to meet his tailor
Hi ho, werewolves of London
Well, I saw Lon Cheney walking with the Queen
Doing the werewolves of London
I saw Lon Cheney Jr. walking with the Queen
I saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's
And his hair was perfect
Hi ho, the werewolves of London, draw blood
Way down upon Sycamore Slough
A white man sings the blues
Selling roses of paper mache
With flecks of starlight dew
I swiped a bunch and threw it your way
Where hazy moonlight glowed
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Way down upon Shadowfall Ward
End of the avenue
Run, hide, seek in your own backyard
Mama's backyard won't do
All night long I sang Love's Sweet Song
Down where the water flowed
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Moonlight wails as hound dogs bay
But never quite catch the tune
Stars fall down in buckets like rain
Till there ain't no standing room
Bright blue boxcars train by train
Clatter where dreams unfold
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Way down upon Seminole Square
Belly of the river tide
Call for me and I will be there
For the price of a taxi ride
Night double-clutches into today
Like a truck downshifting its load
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Thread the needle
Right through the eye
The thread that runs so true
All the others I let pass by
I only wanted you
Never cared for careless love
But how your bright eyes glowed
Way down down along Lazy River Road

[Verse 1]
Your rain falls like crazy fingers
Peals of fragile thunder keeping time
Recall the days that still are to come
Some sing blue
Hang your heart on laughing willow
Stray down to the water
Deep sea of love
Beneath the sweet calm face of the sea
Swift undertow

[Chorus]
Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know
See how it feels in the end
May Lady Lullaby sing plainly for you
Soft, strong, sweet and true

[Verse 2]
Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow
Tapping at the window touch your hair
So swift and bright
Strange fingers of light
Float in air
Who can stop what must arrive now?
Something new is waiting to be born
Dark as the night
You’re still by my side
Shining side

[Bridge]
Gone are the days we stopped to decide
Where we should go
We just ride
Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams
Gone - both dream and lie

[Chorus]
Life may be sweeter for this I don't know
Feels like it might be alright
While Lady Lullaby sings plainly for you
Love still rings true

[Outro]
Midnight on a carousel ride
Reaching for the gold ring down inside
Never could reach
It just slips away but I try

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind-man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don’t give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 1]
Been walking all morning went walking all night
I can't see much difference between the dark and light
And I feel the wind And I taste the rain
Never in my mind to cause so much pain

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind-man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don’t give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 2]
From day to day just letting it ride
You get so far away from how it feels inside
You can't let go cause you're afraid to fall
But the day may come when you can't feel at all

[Bridge]
The words come out like an angry stream
You hear yourself say things you could never mean
When you cool down you find your mind
You got a lot of words you've got to stand behind

[Outro]
Comes a time when the blind-man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill, only love can fill, only love can fill

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
But I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
And I'm in no hurry, no
It's going to be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Yes, I know I lead the way
And they'll tell me where I go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me
Shine on the beach, sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will rise to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)

And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory going to be my name
And people will light my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no
It's gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
This afternoon, streets turned gray
And I watch the fire below
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no

[Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I go
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, don't worry 'bout me

[Bridge]
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)

[Verse]
When I was just a little young boy
Papa said "son, you'll never get far
I'll tell you the reason if you want to know
Cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go"
Well baby, baby wants a gold diamond ring
Wants it more than most any old thing
Well when i get those jelly roll blues
Why i'd go and get anything in this world for you
Down to the jewelry store packing a gun
Says "Wrap it up. I think i'll take this one"
"A thousand dollars please," the jewelry man said
Dupree he said, "I'll pay this one off to you in lead"
Well you know son you just can't figure
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad -
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad
Judge said "Son, this gonna cost you some time"
Dupree said "Judge, you know that crossed my mind"
Judge said "Fact it's gonna cost you your life"
Dupree said "Judge, you know that seems to me to be about right"
Well baby, baby's gonna lose her sweet man
Dupree come out with a losing hand
Baby's gonna weep it up for awhile
Then go on out and find another sweet man's
Gonna treat her with style
Judge said "son, I know your baby well
But that's a secret i can't never tell"
Dupree said "judge, well it's well understood
And you got to admit that that sweet, sweet jelly's so good"
Well you know son you just can't figure
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad
Same old story and i know it's been told
Some like jelly jelly - some like gold
Many a man's done a terrible thing
Just to get baby that shiny diamond ring

[Verse 1]
Inside you're burning
I can see clear through
Your eyes tell more than you mean them to
Lit up and flashing
Like the reds and blues
Out there on the neon avenue

[Chorus]
But I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger

[Verse 2]
Well, the music’s thundering
We're restless and hot
You keep on firing glances across the room
And I can't stop wondering
Just what you got
I get the feeling I’m gonna find out real soon

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger
You know it's gonna get stranger
So let's get on with the show
Let's go

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Yes and the wheel
Gets smoking 'round midnight
You shoot me a look that says "Let's go"
Yes and it feels
Just like running a red light
Well, there ain't no point in looking behind us, no!

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger, like a stranger
You know it's gonna get stranger
If it’s love then how would I know?
How would I know?
If it’s real love then how would I know?
How would I know? How would I know?
If it's real love then how would I know?

Feel like a stranger, like a stranger
Feel like a stranger, like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like, feel like a stranger, stranger
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel, feel, feel like a stranger, like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger)

[It's gonna be a long long crazy crazy night]
Feel like a stranger 

[Crazy night]
(Feel like a stranger)

[It's gonna be a long long crazy crazy night]
Feel like a stranger 

[Crazy night]
(Feel like a stranger)

[It's gonna be a long long crazy crazy night]
Silky silky crazy crazy night
(Feel like a stranger)

[It's gonna be a long long crazy crazy night]
Silky silky crazy crazy night
Hey, crazy night; hey crazy night
Silky silky crazy crazy night
Hey, crazy night 

[Crazy night]
Hey, crazy night 

[Crazy night]
Silky crazy crazy night (Feel like a stranger)
It’s gonna be a long long crazy crazy night

[Long crazy crazy night]
Hey, crazy night 

[Feel like a stranger]
Gonna be a long long crazy crazy
Silky crazy crazy, silky silky crazy crazy night

[Feel like a stranger]

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the clouds of delusion

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental]
Look for a while at the China Cat Sunflower
Proud-walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copper-dome Bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy-quilt stargown
Through a dream night wind

Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandana
Like a one-eyed Cheshire
Like a diamond-eye Jack
A leaf of all colors plays
A golden string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

Comic book colors on a violin river
Crying Leonardo words
From out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell
Beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle wing palace
Of the Queen Chinee

I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

The Sun will shine in my back door someday
The Sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

I wish I was a headlight, on a North bound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a North bound train
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain

I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle (Ooh, ooh)
Or it could have been the wind (Ooh, ooh)
But there seems to be a beat now, I can feel it my feet now
Listen here it comes again!

[Bridge]
There's a band out on the highway
They're high stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Well, the sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinning dizzy
Lord, the band kept us too busy, we forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band
Lord, they're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight (Ooh, ooh)
Balls of lighting roll along (Ooh, ooh)
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on

[Bridge]
Keep on dancing through the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No ones's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone
Was it ever there at all?
But they kept on dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Verse 3]
Well, the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle

Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle
Coming, coming, coming around
Coming around, coming around, in a circle

[Instrumental]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I’m gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

The Sun will shine in my back door someday
The Sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

I wish I was a headlight, on a North bound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a North bound train
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain

I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I’m gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now, he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone, like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothin's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now, he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone, like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothin's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old, rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
He's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone, like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothin's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back

[Instrumental]
Well the first days are the hardest days, don't you worry any more
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street, there is danger at your door
Think this through with me, let me know your mind
Wo, oh, what I want to know, is are you kind?

It's a buck dancer's choice my friend; better take my advice
You know all the rules by now and the fire from the ice
Will you come with me? Won't you come with me?
Wo, oh, what I want to know, will you come with me?

Goddamn, well I declare, have you seen the like?
Their wall are built of cannonballs, their motto is "Don't tread on me"
Come hear Uncle John'n Band playing to the tide
Come with me, or go alone, he's come to take his children home

It's the same story the crow told me; it's the only one he knows
Like the morning sun you come and like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate, barely time to wait
Wo, oh, what I want to know, where does the time go?

I live in a silver mine and I call it Beggar's Tomb;
I got me a violin and I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice, I can hear your voice
Wo, oh, what I want to know, how does the song go?
Come hear Uncle John's Band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about, here beside the rising tide

Come hear Uncle John's Band playing to the tide
Come on along, or go alone, he's come to take his children home
Wo, oh, what I want to know, how does the song go


Red and white, blue suede shoes, I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Gimme five, I'm still alive, ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag, rock the boat, skin the goat
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hidin' out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand of P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan
Shine your shoes, light your fuse
Can you use them ol' U.S. Blues?
I'll drink your health, share your wealth, run your life, steal your wife
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

Back to back chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song the United States blues
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse]
Carve your name
Carve your name in ice and wind
Search for where
Search for where the rivers end
Or where the rivers start
Do everything that's in you
That you feel to be your part
But never give your love, my friend
Unto a foolish heart
Leap from ledges
Leap from ledges high and wild
Learn to speak
Speak with wisdom like a child
Directly from the heart
Crown yourself the king of clowns
Or stand way back apart
But never give your love, my friend
Unto a foolish heart
Shun a friend
Shun a brother and a friend
Never look
Never look around the bend
Or check a weather chart
Sign the Mona Lisa
With a spray can, call it art
But never give your love, my friend
Unto a foolish heart
A foolish heart will call on you
To toss your dreams away
Then turn around and blame you
For the way you went astray
A foolish heart will cost you sleep
And often make you curse
A selfish heart is trouble
But a foolish heart is worse
Bite the hand
Bite the hand that bakes your bread
Dare to leap
Where the angels fear to tread
Till you are torn apart
Stoke the fires of paradise
With coals from Hell to start
But never give your love, my friend
Unto a foolish heart
Unto a foolish heart
Compass card is spinning, helm is swinging to and fro
Oh, where is the dog star, oh, where's the moon
You're a lost sailor, been away too long at sea

Somedays the gales are howling, sometimes the sea is still as glass
Oh, raise the main sail, oh, lash the mast
You're a lost sailor, been away too long at sea
Now the shorelines beckon, there is a price for being free

There's a sea bird cryin' and there's a ghost wind blowing
And it's calling you, to that misty swirling sea
Till the chains of your dreams are broken
No place in this world you can be

You're a lost sailor, been away too long at sea
Now the shorelines beckon, there is a price for being free

You pay for being free, I'll tell ya freedom don't come easy
Free don't always come for free
Sometimes it's hard to know what to believe in
Where to go, who to go, where to be, who to be
That means you're driftin'.... driftin'
Yeah driftin' and dreamin', really goin' on a dream now
Really goin' on a feelin', really goin' on a feelin'
Driftin', driftin' and dreamin'

Cause it's a place you've never been
Maybe a place you've never seen now
You can hear them callin' on the wind
Driftin' and dreamin', driftin' and dreamin'
Really goin' on a dream now, really goin' on a dream now
Really goin' on a dream now

This must be heaven, tonight I cross the line
You must be the angel, I though I might never find
Was it you I heard singing, Oh while I was chasin' dreams
Driven by the wind, like the dust that blows around
And the rain fallin' down, but I never know
Got to be heaven, cause here's where the rainbow ends
If this ain't the real thing, then it's close enough to pretend
When that wind blows, when the night's about to fall
You can hear the silence call, it's a certain sort of sound
Like the rain fallin' down

Holes in what's left of my reason, holes in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin', but I'll pull through
I never could read no road map, I don't know what the weather might do
But when that rich wind whines and I see the dark star shine
I got a feeling there's no time to lose, no time to lose
Never know now, just don't never know, no
Well it's been heaven, but even the rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin' and the wind is willin'
And I'm as good as gone again
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Just a Saint of Circumstance, just a tiger in a trance
And the rain fallin' down, well, you never know, just don't know
Listen, sure don't know what I going for, but I'm gonna go for it for sure...

[Verse 1]
My brother Esau killed a hunter
Back in 1969
And before the killing was done
His inheritance was mine
But his birthright was a wand to wave
Before a weary band
Esau gave me sleeplessness
And a piece of moral land
My father favored Esau
Who was eager to obey
All the bloody wild commandments
The Old Man shot his way
But all this favor ended
When my brother failed at war
He staggered home
And found me in the door

[Chorus]
Esau skates on mirrors anymore
He meets his pale reflection at the door
Yet sometimes at night I dream
He's still that hairy man
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land

[Verse 2]
Esau holds a blessing
Brother Esau bears a curse
I would say that the blame is mine
But I suspect it’s something worse
The more my brother looks like me
The less I understand
The silent war that bloodied both our hands
Sometimes at night, I think I understand

[Chorus]
It's brother to brother and it's man to man
And it’s face to face and it's hand to hand
We shadow dance the silent war within
The shadow dance, it never ends
Never ends, never ends
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse, yet again
Yet again
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land

[Verse 1]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Verse 2]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Verse 3]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge]
Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day good-bye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

[Outro]
Fortune comes a-crawling,Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Verse 1]
A man and a woman come together as strangers
When they part they're usually strangers still
It's like a practical joke played on us by our maker
Empty bottles that can't be filled

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
Give it just a minute
And it will blow away, blow away

[Verse 2]
You fancy me to be the master of your feelings
You barely bruise me with your looks to kill
Though I admit we were sometimes brutal in our dealings
I never held you against your will

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
Give it just a minute
And it will blow away

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Your case against me is so very clearly stated
I plead no contest, I just turn and I shrug
I've come to figure all importance overestimated
You must mean water when you get on your knees and beg me for blood

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
Give it just a minute
And it will blow away, it'll blow away

[Outro]
Like a feather in a whirlwind (Blow away)
Just as surely, as surely as the world spins (Blow away)
Oh, it'll blow, it'll blow, it'll blow away (Blow away)
Ooh, it'll blow, give it just a minute, give it just a minute
And it'll blow away
Give it just a, give it just a little minute now
And watch it blow, watch it blow away
Let it blow, let it blow away
Watch it blow, watch it blow, watch it blow away
Wait a minute...
Give me just a little piece of your time, baby
Give me just a little second now
All I'm asking for is just a little minute
A minute 'til you listen, listen to, listen, listen to me close
Come on, give me an ear
Are you out there? Can you hear me? Let me know
You want love, you want love
You think you got love right here in your hand
You're holding on tight to
You think you got love, you think you got love right here in your hand
And it's like you wanna put it inside you
It's like you wanna put it deep inside you
It's like you wanna keep love in your heart
And the only way you know you'll know to do is not to let it go
It's like you think you're in a cage, it's a jail cell
It's like you don't think love can get past through ribs
It's like you don't think love can get out
Get away from you as long as you hold it inside
But you're wrong
The only thing you do is keep in that caged cell
Keeping love out, keeping it out, keeping it away
You've gotta open up the door
You've gotta open up the door and let love in
Let it come and go
Do you wanna know love?
Do you wanna know real love?
Real love you don't hold inside
Real love you can let go
And it'll come back, it'll fly right back to you, yes it do
That's real love
So help me out, help me out a minute
Would you help me out?
Sing it after me, I want real love
Said I want real, real love
I want real, real, real love
I want real, real, real love, give me real love
Real love, real, real, real, real love

[Verse 1]
Went to see the captain, strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 2]
Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rocking of the boat
And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float
I won't leave you drifting down but whoa it makes me wild
With thirty years upon my head
To have you call me child

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 3]
The bottles stand as empty
As they were filled before
Time there was and plenty
But from that cup no more
Though I could not caution all
I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Outro]
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 1]
I was drinking last night with a biker
And I showed him a picture of you
I said "Pal, get to know her, you'll like her"
Seemed like the least I could do

[Verse 2]
'Cause when he's charging his chopper
Up and down your carpeted halls
You will think me by contrast quite proper
Nevermind how I stumble and fall
Nevermind how I stumble and fall

[Verse 3]
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For a taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, baby
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Yeah, at least I'm enjoying the ride

[Verse 4]
Ah, miss sweetie, little soft-core pretender
Somehow baby got hard as it gets
With her black leather chrome spiked suspenders
And her chair and her whip and her pets

[Verse 5]
Well, we know you're the reincarnation
Of the ravenous Catherine the Great
And we know how you love your ovations
And the Z-rated scenes you create
Yeah, the Z-rated scenes you create

[Verse 6]
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For a taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, baby
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Yeah, at least I'm enjoying the ride

[Verse 7]
You analyze me, attempt to despise me
And you laugh when I stumble and fall
There may come a day I will dance on your grave
If unable to dance I will crawl across it
Unable to dance I will crawl
Yeah, unable to dance I'll crawl, yeah

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 8]
You must really consider the circus
'Cause it just might be your kind of zoo
I can't think of a place that's more perfect
For a person as perfect as you

[Verse 9]
And it's not like I'm leaving you lonely
'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
But I know that you'll think of me only
When the snakes come marching in
When the snakes come marching in

[Verse 10]
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For a taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, baby
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride

[Outro]
Ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying, enjoying the ride
Ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying, enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying, enjoying the ride
Ride, ride, ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
Ride, at least I'm enjoying the ride
Ride, at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride, yeah
At least I'm enjoying the ride

[Verse 1]
You say you want to try again, wear it down between the lines
Well, I have a better end in mind

[Chorus]
It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see, though I know you don't mean to be
You are so far from me

[Verse 2]
There was something I had caught inside, screaming hard to make it go
And tied me down low

[Chorus]
It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see, you have been all you'll be to me
It's just too late
And we can't relate at all

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see, though I know you don't mean to be
You are so far from me

[Outro]
This time's the last time I want to say so long (So long)
This song is my last song for you
There's just nothing here to hold on to, baby (Hold on to)
Nothing to hold onto

[Verse 1]
If you wanna know what time it is, you don't have to ask
If you wanna know what something is, you don't have to ask
If you wanna know whats real or not, you don't have to ask
If you wanna know what time is now, you don't have to ask
You don't have to ask, you already know

[Verse 2]
If you wanna leave just close your eyes, you don't have to ask
If you wanna go and lose your mind, you don't have to ask
If it's peace that you're looking for
You got the key to every door, you already know

[Bridge]
If there's a way out you'll find out and free all and be all beyond
You never wonder what sky you been under that made you forget all this time

[Verse 3]
If you're looking for it, you don't have to ask
You can see it plain as day, you don't have to ask
If you try to find us true, just take a look at you, you don't have to
Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The buses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars
But I'm here by the road
Bound to the load
I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers who won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars

Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Oh, I'm drowning in you

I left St. Louis, City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
Tried to pretend it came to an end
'Cause you weren't the woman I thought I once met
But I can't deny, oh, times have gone by
I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
And I was a man when all this began
Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet
Black-throated wind whisper mix in
It's speaking of life that passes like dew
Forced me to see you've done better by me
Better by me than I've done by you

What's to be found, racing around
You carry your pain wherever you go
Full of the blues, trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't want to know
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
Capture a glance, oh, and make it a dance
Of looking at you looking at me

Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, here comes the light
Turn around, that's what I'm going to do
Oh, I'm going back home, that's what I'm going to do
Yes, I'll turn around, that's what I'm going to do
Well, I'm going back home, that's what I'm going to do
Oh I, oh I'm coming with you
Oh I, oh I'm coming with you
You've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh I, oh I'm coming with you
Oh, I'm going back home, that's what I'm going to do
Oh I, oh I'm coming with you

[Verse 1]
Operator, can you help me, help me if you please
Give me the right area code and the number that I need
My rider left upon the midnight flyer
Singing like a summer breeze

[Verse 2]
I think she's somewhere down South, down about Baton Rouge
But i just can't remember no number, a number I can use
Directory don't have it, central done forgot it
I've gotta find a number to use

[Verse 3]
Trying to check out her number, trying to run down her line
Operator said that's privileged information
And it ain't no business of mine
It's flooding down in Texas, poles are out in Utah
Gotta find a private line

[Verse 4]
She could be hanging round the steel mill
Working in a house of blue lights
Riding a getaway bus out of Portland, talking to the night
I don't know where she's going, I don't care where shes been
Long as she's doing it right
Long as she's doing it right

[Verse 1]
I told Althea I was feeling lost
Lacking in some direction
Althea told me upon scrutiny
My back might need protection
I told Althea that treachery
Was tearing me limb from limb
Althea told me: now cool down boy
Settle back easy Jim

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
You may be Saturday's child all grown
Moving with a pinch of grace
You may be a clown in the burying ground
Or just another pretty face
You may be the fate of Ophelia
Sleeping and perchance to dream
Honest to the point of recklessness
Self centered to the extreme

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Ain't nobody messing with you but you
Your friends are getting most concerned
Loose with the truth
Maybe it's your fire
But baby I hope you don't get burned
When the smoke has cleared, she said
That's what she said to me
You're going to want a bed to lay your head
And a little sympathy

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
There are things you can replace
And others you cannot
The time has come to weigh those things
This space is getting hot
You know this space is getting hot

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 4]
I told Althea
I'm a roving sign
That I was born to be a bachelor
Althea told me: "Okay, that's fine"
And now I'm out trying to catch her
Can't talk to you without talking to me
We're guilty of the same old thing
Talking a lot about less and less
And forgetting the love we bring

[Verse 1]
Merry run around, sailin' up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over
When that train pulls in, you wonder where it's been
You gotta try to see a little further

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or
Rain is falling from a heavy sky
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
This is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way
Like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner
Where it's been waiting to meet you
What do you want me to do
To watch for you while you are sleeping?
Well please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming, too
Look into any eyes
You find by you, you can see
Clear through to another day
Maybe it's been seen before
Through other eyes on other days
While going home
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon long ago

Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams
To another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted
With words half spoken
And thoughts unclear
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
A box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through

Just a box of rain
Wind and water
Believe it if you need it
If you don't just pass it on
Sun and shower, wind and rain
In and out the window
Like a moth before a flame
It's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
But it's just a box of rain, or a ribbon for your hair;
Such a long long time to be gone
And a short time to be there
Well the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door

Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Woah-ho what I want to know
Is are you kind?

It's a buck dancer's choice my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice

Will you come with me
Won't you come with me
Woah-ho what I want to know
Will you come with me?

God damn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go

Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Woah-ho what I want to know
Where does the time go?

I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune

Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-ho what I want to know
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

Whoa-ho what I want to know
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh...
I'm bundled up, it's cold in the car
I burrow like an animal in the bend of your arm
You quiet up; it's black where we are
I stumble like an idiot, away from the bar

Teary-eyed, teary-eyed I forget where I parked
I can't stand up
You remind, you remind, you remind me of her
Is it bad luck?

Is that bad luck?
Are you bad luck?

In a dream, we got married outside
Everything gleamed, wedding rings and white
In a dream, we got married outside
Everything gleamed, wedding rings and white
Would you take me for life?
Would you take me for life?

[Verse 1]
Sit enthroned in white grandeur
But tired and shift
A whisper of wayward silver hair
From your eyes
I'd never seen you unkempt before
As you whisper, "Darling, close the door"
Well, how have I not made a note of every word you ever said?
And time, is not on our side
But I'll pretend that it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand

[Chorus]
Before you leave, you must know you are beloved
And before you leave, remember I was with you

[Verse 2]
Are you afraid
However could you not be in this rosy light?
This is strange
I see a hand come through the mirror, pointing at the light

[Chorus]
Before you leave you, must know you are beloved
And before you leave, remember I was with you
And as you leave, I won't hold you back, beloved

[Bridge]
We'll sit and talk the stars down from the sky
And I'll not forget the chaos in your eyes, love

[Chorus]
And as you leave, you must know you are beloved
And as you leave, I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave, I won't hold you back, beloved
And as you leave, see my children playing at your feet

[Chorus]
I keep it juicy juicy, I eat that lunch (Yeah)
She keep that booty booty, she keep that plump (Yeah yeah)

When I turn around and touch it, keep your eyes on that, that, that, that, that, that

Eat that up, and in the night, he see that
In the dark, and in the ride he keep that
Keep it running, like it plump, he need that
Need the rump and need the thighs, he eat that
Eat that up and in the night, he see that
In the dark, and in the ride he keep that
Keep it running

[Chorus]
I keep it juicy juicy, I eat that lunch (Yeah)

Ayy, ayy, bitch

[Chorus]
Do not disturb me
Know you thirsty ass bitches gon' be thirsty
Know you hatin' ass niggas wanna murk me
All of my exes don't deserve me
Curve them same way them bitches curved me

[Verse 1]
Red and purple, Vince Carter on the jersey
Keep a bad lil' mamacita lookin' curvy
My 40 Glock Milly Rockin' it's movin' sturdy
If she ain't fuckin' me proper, I do her dirty
'Bout to fuck this older chick, she in her thirties
Keep an FN and a stick for every journey
You want this dick, lil' mama, you gotta earn it
Phone airplane mode, don't disturb me
Walkin' Birkin then I'm telling my lil' bitch to ball
All that low money budget shit turn my bitches off
She got a taste of the sauce, look how it drip, baby
She see a young nigga ballin'

[Chorus]
Do not disturb me
Know you thirsty ass bitches gon' be thirsty
Know you hatin' ass niggas wanna murk me
All of my exes don't deserve me
Curve them same way them bitches curved me

[Verse 2]
And you heard me
Took my style and now you need to reimburse me
I see the police, they wanna serve me
But none of that fuck shit don't concern me
Go 'head, drop that ass, pop the tag
The bag Chanel, she got to brag
She got a man, she cuffed, my bad
She let me touch it, lil' Tory lucky, ayy
Lambo doors, gave 'em no mercy
She don't smoke with me, but she take a Perky
I'm 'bout to wax, lil' mama, my vision blurry
Phone airplane mode, do not disturb

[Chorus]
Do not disturb me
Know you thirsty ass bitches gon' be thirsty
Know you hatin' ass niggas wanna murk me
All of my exes don't deserve me
Curve them same way them bitches curved me
Trap door in your apartment
And a million decorations
The street looked pretty from the window
And the city sparkle like a bracelet
The city sparkle like a bracelet
City sparkle like a bracelet

I wish you would let me touch it
I wish you would let me taste it
Power line, power line
Valentine, valentine
Strobe light, deer head, hourglass

Exhale, exhale
Could you tell a dirty tale?
Witchcraft, witchcraft
Look at me and cast a spell
Look at me and raise the dead
Ahh, ahh, ahh, tongue out
Light beam, light me
Snow print, sun out
The bass drum rattle whiskey and the drug
(I can eat ya up)
The bass strong rattle whiskey in a cup
(I can eat ya up)
Strobe light, deer head, hourglass
Strobe light, deer head, hourglass

[Verse 1]
I thought I saw your shadow in an old doorway
But when I looked again, I thought I made a big mistake
It was someone else who looked a little like you
But now I know, ah ha ha, ain't no one like you
I'll tell you why I know, babe

[Chorus]
Hey, 'cause I'm looking for you, looking for you
Yeah, I'm looking for you
That's all I do, that's all
I'm looking for you, looking for you
Yeah, I'm looking for you, that's right
That's all I do, yeah-yeah

I've been to many places around the world
I've studied many faces of every little boy and girl

But I'm looking for you, I'm looking for you
Just looking for you
Baby, I'm looking for you, I'm looking for you
Look, look, looking for you
Hey nah nah nah, let me tell you, baby

The earth ain't flat
I finally made the decision, and that is that
And now I know, there's only one place to be
You know where that place is
Yeah, for you to be with me

Babe, I'm looking for you, looking for you, I'm looking for you
I'm looking for you
I'm looking for you, looking for you
Yeah, I'm looking for you

Tell me, I'm looking for you, through and through
Only looking for you
Baby, I'm looking for you, baby be true
'cause I'm goin' looking for you

I'm looking for you
I'm looking for you
Looking for you

I'm looking for, I'm looking for, I'm looking for
I'm looking for, I'm looking for, I'm goin' looking for you

I'm looking for, I'm looking for, I'm looking for
I'm looking for, I'm looking for, I'm looking for you
I'm looking for, I'm looking for, I'm looking for
I'm looking for, I'm looking for, I'm goin' looking for you

I'm looking for you
I'm looking for you
I'm looking for you
As long as we're together, it's gonna be just fine cause I heard it on the wind
Howling through the middle of the mind
A little pinch of pepper, a little speck of spice
Stir it in the cauldron and come up with something nice

As long as we're together, it's gonna be just fine cause I heard it on the wind
Howling through the middle of the mind
Yeah, I heard it on the wind, howling through the middle of the night

A little dash of magic, a little splash of light
Jump aboard my broomstick, come and join me for a flight
As long as we're together, it's gonna be just fine
Well, I heard it on the broosmtick, dashing through the middle of the night
Yeah, there I was, out on my broomstick again

And he told me once and he told me twice, but I heard in the middle of the night
A little dash of magic, a little splash of light
Put it in your camera and it's gonna turn out alright
As long as were together, it's gonna be just fine, yeah, all the time, yeah
You know I heard it on the broomstick, howling through the middle of the mind
While I was on my broomstick. Well, I heard it on the wind
Howling in the middle of the night
Oh yeah, as long as we're together, gonna be alright

[Verse]
I can't believe it, something happened not so long ago
I know it isn’t something I dreamed about

[Pre-Chorus]
It's real, so real
When she looks into his eyes, I feel

[Chorus]
Love come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down
And it isn't gonna stop ’til I get to the bottom of this whole affair

[Bridge]
I saw the look she gave
They must think I just got to town
It's one of those things you don't wanna talk about

Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down

[Verse]
So let's forget it 'til I can make it on my own
Although it won't be something to brag about

[Pre-Chorus]
It's real, so real
When she looks into his eyes, I feel

[Chorus]
Love come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down
And it isn't gonna stop ’til I get to the bottom of this whole affair

[Bridge]
I saw the look she gave
They must think I don’t get around
It's one of those things you don’t wanna talk about
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down

[Pre-Chorus]
It's real, so real
When she looks into his eyes, I feel

[Chorus]
Love come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down
And it isn't gonna stop 'til I get to the bottom of this whole affair

[Outro]
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down, come tumbling down
Love come tumbling down
Love
If I give my love again to you, mm
Will it be the same love that we once thought was true?
Will it be the same love, mm?
Will we feel the same love?
Will it be the same love that you once made to me?

The love you made to me, the love you made to me
The love you made to me
The love you made to me, the love you made to me
The love you made to me

If it's nothing like the first time, we’ll enjoy it right or wrong
Why keep referring to the worst time, when you've waited for so long?
Waited for so long?

Though it may not be as good as new
Well, still, it must be better than the pain that I went through

Will it be the same love?
Will it feel the same, love?
Will it be the same love that you once made to me?
The love you made to me, the love you made to me
The love you made to me
The love you made to me, the love you made to me
The love you made to me

[Verse 1]
I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There, all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved

[Pre-Chorus]
When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me

[Chorus]
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to prove
Move me, baby

[Verse 2]
You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
I know it's no improvement
When you move, I'll move
You're S. Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequence
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

[Pre-Chorus]
When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

[Chorus]
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to prove
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

[Verse 1]
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before it always leads me here
Leads me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting), lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
For me to say what I'm about to say
Could take a bit of courage
But I can summon up enough of this and maybe more
Without your love I know I'd find it difficult
No reason to continue
So how can anyone live not knowing what love is?

I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before
I don't wanna think about it anyhow
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before
We don't have to talk about it
No, not now

Need a lie, when I don't have to lie
It get me into trouble
And I've been keepin' out of trouble for a long time now
So this is true, it's me for you eternity
Can go and last forever?
But while we're taking our time
I pity those that love left behind
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before?
I don't wanna think about it anyhow, anyhow?
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before?
We don't have to talk about it
Oh, not now?
Talk about it now?
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before?
I don't wanna think about it, think about it anyhow ?
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before
I don't have to talk about it no, not now??
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before?
I don't wanna think about it think about it anyhow?
I can't imagine how it feels to never been in love like this before
We don't have to talk about it
No, not now
I don't wanna talk about it, no, not now

[Verse 1]
There is a town in North Ontario
With dream, comfort, memory to spare
And in my mind, I still need a place to go
All my changes were there

[Pre-Chorus]
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes

[Chorus]
Leave us
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless

[Verse 3]
Well babe, can you hear me now?
The chains are locked and tied across my doors
Baby, baby sing with me somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes

[Chorus]
Leave us
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless

[Harmonica outro]
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
My country boy’s on the way, I’m finna serve him
I want you to hold this K, and don’t act nervous

He claim that he a boss but he never took a loss
Playing both sides, that’s that shit that’ll get your ass offed
Got some shooters on a budget, they’ll kill your ass for nothing
Run up on you with that carbon, 40 clip into his noggin
They vicious

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Your bitch is naked washing dishes
She like my lifestyle, she say we live too religious
Two thousand for my gators, them bitches look itchy
Bitches got bumps, and I’m rich like Donald Trump
Driving around with that pump, pockets look like a lump
Weed smelling like skunks, blunts big as a stump
Bitches wan’ fuck Young Thug and they wanna fuck on Duke, uh
Thugger not with the bullshit, baby I just want fun
Boolin’ out in the 

[?] baby, I came up off midget
Now we not getting pulled over but my whole crew got them tickets
Baby I’m YSL, I’d love to come to the funeral
No I’m not no physic but I got powers just like Yugi-oh

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
My country boy’s on the way, I’m finna serve him
I want you to hold this K, and don’t act nervous

Got some shooters on a budget, they’ll kill your ass for nothing
Run up on you with that carbon, 40 clip into his noggin
They vicious

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
I’m in the front of the line like the motherfuckin’ hearse do
I know Thugger killed verse one, I’m ‘bout to kill verse two
DK in a new Ferrari, damn we runnin’ ‘round the lobby
We so high off life, and we ain’t got no fucking option
Reel them ducks in, we call it going fishing
Washing machine all that money, we call it cleaning dishes
Making birds take a bath, we call it shaving pigeons
And I ain’t PeeWee Longway but your ho know I’m dealing
I’m cold hearted, I don’t got no feelings
In that new drop top, I don’t got no ceilings
The roof is absent, ball like I got cancer
I’m the man in Atlanta, ask your favorite dancer

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
My country boy’s on the way, I’m finna serve him
I want you to hold this K, and don’t act nervous
Them goons around me, and they working

[Verse 1]
Uh
I'm flying private through Cloud 9
Yeah, if you got a problem, I'm Einstein
Yeah, I'm yawin' I'm so tired of ballin'
Yeah, Only selling work to them workaholics
Got guns bigger than you nigga, I don't fuck with new
Niggas
I blue's your bitch ass hopes somebody give you rhythm
I got animal all in my flow
Take your shoes off at the door
Niggas feed these bitch's lies
Nigga don't food poison my ho
I buy my drugs for the low
Like a coupon on at the store
My nigga's like Kanye with that good
My nigga's like Lou Rawls with that blow
Niggas sayin they racked up
Don't let that Q-ball leave you broke
I know you want a pat on the back
But then those fools goin' see you choke
I saw yo' bitch and she said, she tryin' to move on and let go
Boy I get up in that pussy and hit her with moves
You don't even know
Niggas be trippin' over these hoes
I done came too far to get close
I've been outchea gettin' bread
And I don't need you all in my loaf
If you stick your neck out there
I'll have my goons all at your throat
Niggas be lukewarm at the most
And when I'm through ballin' I coach
Shout out to my nigga Mac
Gettin' his boo on in that Ghost
I'm still coming off the top of the dome but it be on a
Tombstone if I wrote it
Tunechi

[Verse 2]
My kids already rich and they don't even know
These nigga's sayin' they playas, they ain't even scored
My bitch rolling my weed, she don't even smoke
Everybody following me, I ain't even Moses, nigga
Uh
My cologne illegal in nine countries
I found a way like it was hiding from me
Yeah, my weed good, my sex better
Bitch, don't text me no love letters
I'm ahead of the game, I need a blowjob
Most of these hoes ain't got no job
And these niggas goin' buy em' everything
You goin' fuck around, and get the ho robbed
I'm ahead of the game, I need a haircut
Used to hug the block, I mean bear hug
And tell them rats the AK go Rat-a-Tat, like snare drums
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Dick harder than a armadilla'
MLK would be proud of me, cause I do this shit for all my
Niggas
Her mouth, pussy, or asshole, life is full of hard decisions
If she ain't fuckin', she get the boot
Let me write this bitch a parking ticket
Ain't got time for love life
All I know is get paid
I'm high like Bonjour
Twisted like french braids
I got my own shoes, SLIME
T, I feel like MJ
I'm working that graveyard shift
Man these nigga's been dead

[Verse 3]
Uh
I feel asleep in that pussy and I didn't even know
I woke up and acted like I didn't even know her
Yeah
Don't fuck with these fuck nigga's, you already know us
I'm looking for that loud pack, weedman bring the noise
Yeah
Pass that weed to the next nigga
Blunt longer than a tongue twista
Hoes want this scud missile
Imma ball, like Crystal
Lil Tunchi league, young sex pistol
New money, no wrinkles
I'm hard headed, Ocho
Dedication Cinco
Uh

[Outro]
What up 5?
Rocko fuck with me!

[Chorus 1: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I’m feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I’m feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on

[Verse 1: Del The Funky Homosapien]
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I’m under each snare
Intagible, bet you didn’t think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin’ tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit and fuse, you think is fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one go

[Chorus: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I’m feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on

[Instrumental music playing]

[Chorus continue]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on

[Verse 2: Del]
The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhytm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But pecussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought  is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

[Chorus: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on

[Instrumental music playing]

[Outro: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on

Run, running throughout
A letter pass down to the mainsail
Stop fiends alright
A letter sent through century
Stop fiends alright

Man son keep me in clarity
Faceless sigh on the side
Capsules speak of the time gone by
Just pass on by

Wishing everything was a time-stop
Gaining up till it's fine
Sitting on the hill of illusion
Stop friends tonight
A letter sent through century
Stop friends tonight

I'm gonna make it feel right
I'm gonna make it feel alright

[?]

[First Half]
-goin'
I'm just laughing 'cause you goofy off of 

[?], yeah
Got some problems but you keep on callin' Spaceman
He gon' getcha all the signals
He gon' getcha all the signals

[Second Half]
-that's fair
If your player on the side keep it fair, fair
Let them both know they each wanted there, there
So my conscious be clear where I stay (Stay)
Just had a conversation with the mirror
I ended up not having much to say
Said "Today is for the lovers and the leaders
I hate to tell you, it just ain't your day"

So this is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
You'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you

And it's a complication with the voices
Rounding all around inside my mind
I used to think this heart had lots of choices
But they all lead to your doorstep every time

This is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
You'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you
So this is my apology
My words, my tears, are all me
Laid out in front of you
Like a grasp for truth
On a Sunday afternoon
This is a song for you

This is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
And you'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you
Ooh
I still love you

I had a conversation with the mirror
It ended up not having much to say

[Intro]
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I couldn't hear what
You tried to tell me
I thought that I knew all I need to know
I didn't understand that
The doors you would open
Could take me to somewhere
I wanted to go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can be strong for you now
You taught me how

[Chorus]
I learned from you that
I do not crumble
I learned that strength is
Something you choose
All of the reasons
To keep on believing
There's no question
That's a lesson
I learned from you

[Verse 2]
You know where to find all of my hiding places
And there are no secrets from you I can keep
You let me know how you feel
Pulling no punches
And I never knew that kind of honesty

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm grateful for all of the times
You opened my eyes

[Chorus]
I learned from you that
I do not crumble
I learned that strength is
Something you choose
(Something you choose)
All of the reasons
To keep on believing
There's no question
That's a lesson
I learned from you

[Bridge]
You help me to stand on my own
And I thank you for that
It saved me, it made me
And now that I'm looking back
I can say, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I learned from you that
I do not crumble
I learned that strength is
Something you choose
All of the reasons
To keep on believing
There's no question
That's a lesson
I learned from you
(I do not crumble)

[Chorus]
I learned from you
I learned that strength is
Something you choose
All of the reasons
To keep on believing
There's no question
That's a lesson
I learned from you, yeah-yeah
(I learned from you)
I learned from you
He's old like the raspberry cold
Coming in the window
His gloom room
Flowers blooming out like armadillos

He looks to the left at the yellow lines
Moving with the traffic
His veins have turned to plastic blinds

He was new like the violet dew
Water looking at him through
The telescopic mountain view
Where the stars were still laughing

He lept into the northern sky
Filled his lungs with peach pie
Never even wondered why

Go with the yellow light
Your mind is a dandelion
The weight of your crooked spine
Is returning to snow
And though you are mostly now machines
Not electrical in dreams you're a rose
He's old like the raspberry cold
Coming in the window
His gloom room
Flowers then blooming out like armadillos

He walks with the owls in the yellow moon
Walks like a river lapping
His blood is thick and tacking

He was new like the violet dew
Water looking at him through
The telescopic mountain view
The stars were still laughing

He lept into the northern sky
Filled his lungs with peach pie
Never even wondered why

Go with the yellow light
Your mind is a dandelion
The weight of your crooked spine
Is returning to snow
And though you are mostly now machines
Not electrical in dreams you're a rose

He looks to the left
He looks to the left
He looks to the left
He looks to the left
Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave, but don't leave me
Look around
Choose your own ground

Long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down
It's time to dig another one

For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

[Chorus: Akon]
Honey I'm home
I don't know what it is, but it keeps callin' my name
Can't imagine me leavin' this game
I'll tell you what it is, it's the money that calls
To closin' all these fast ass hoes
It got me married to the streets, married to these streets, married to these streets (streets)
It got me married to the streets, married to these streets
Yeah yeah
Honey I'm home
2 Chainz
Noddles, let's get it!

[Verse: 2 Chainz]
The feds tappin' phones, so I talk in code
The shit jumpin' at the gym and I ain't talkin' pro's
Polo on my drawers, Bentley on my driveway
I was in the trap while you was on Myspace
Money on my mind state, increase the crime rate
Pinky ring so big, you can see it on a blind date
Car game, I rate, whip parked outside
SS on it, and that stands for South Side
Outside, coolin', deuce and the juices
2 cups on me, shout out to Houston
We got a problem Houston
They take my style, they boostin'
They lame and they all knew it
Ask your girl and they all knew it

[Chorus: Akon]
Honey I'm home
I don't know what it is, but it keeps callin' my name
Can't imagine me leavin' this game
I'll tell you what it is, it's the money that calls
To closin' all these fast ass hoes
It got me married to the streets, married to these streets, married to these streets (streets)
It got me married to the streets, married to these streets
Yeah yeah
Honey I'm home
I don't know what it is, but it keeps callin' my name
Can't imagine me leavin' this game
I'll tell you what it is, it's the money that calls
To closin' all these fast ass hoes
It got me married to the streets, married to these streets, married to these streets (streets)
It got me married to the streets, married to these streets
Yeah yeah
Honey I'm home

[Outro: Akon]
Yeah yeah
Honey I'm home
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Honey I'm home
Yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Honey I'm home
Little more love, just a little love
When it feels like first time lovers
Ain't no distance between love birds
一见钟情
想把你捧在手心
在我身边就不要走了
So I can really get to know ya

Sleep here alone, but you know it's better with you

我的想念 为你翻覆
有了你 就不再 是个单数

I know u know I know 你有感觉
所以我们雀跃 每个半夜
想跟你一起 撒野
所有不愉快 都消灭
无法自拔 为你放下防卫
黏在一起 一分一秒 不要浪费
做有氧运动 shake it, shake it 锻炼
The way you call me, girl 不让你心碎
Yea yea yea 你像杯香浓咖啡

Dance with ya, put ya foot in spin ya round romance ya
Tonight, I'm here to set ya free bird

Sea to sea we seeing cities swipe the double visa
Ain't nobody flying like us, living la vida

That vibe that make ya get up out ya seat so mama grab your hand and movement
Bodies breaking every rule and ain't nobody suing
Cuz ain't nobody fly like us, ain't nothing to it

I can sleep here alone, but you know it's better with you
You could be by yourself, but you know it's better with two

I can sleep here alone, but you know it's better with you

[Chorus]

To my crib, to my crib, that's where we go

[Verse 1]
Money so long, can't fold up
Hunnid hoes soon as I showed up

Pouring champagne, we slowed up

Niggas be talkin' but I just be walkin' and my gang is all with the shit
Came here with bitches, we leaving with bitches
We drunk and we all gettin' lit

Rolling that weed up and sparking it
Ain't drive my car, I don't park the shit

Ball out, do the same thing tomorrow, da gang

[Chorus]
I can't believe I changed the game like ain't no done before

[Verse 1: Mac DeMarco]
To all the days we were together
To all the time we were apart
Of each other's lives, heart to heart
And so I had a late arrival
So we never saw the start
Of each other's lives, heart to heart

[Refrain: Mac DeMarco]
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart

[Verse 2: Mac DeMarco]
And though it seems so quick and easy
Sentimentally assumed
Walking parallels, heart to heart
To all the days we were together
To all the time we played apart
In each other's lives, heart to heart

[Refrain: Mac DeMarco]
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart

[Outro: Mac Miller & Mac DeMarco]
Weo! Weo! Weo! Weo!
Heh-heh
Hey cowgirl
Hey cowgirl
Will you stay on the farm
Or will you come on back with me?
Hey cowgirl
Give up all of your stars to watch some TV
Hey cowgirl
What's it gonna be?
Hey cowgirl
Try the big city lights for a little while
Hey cowgirl
Sure as hell ain't no stars down the dairy aisle
Hey cowgirl
What's it gonna be?
Hey cowgirl
What's it gonna be?

[Verse 1]
Brother's hands
This time it’s in brother's hands
Baby, are you satisfied?
Is this all that you had in mind?

[Chorus]
On the square
Live a life that isn't there
Square it up
Call me once you’ve had enough

[Verse 2]
Brother's hands
Feel the grip of brother's hands
Maybe it's been rectified
Locked outside and left to die

[Chorus]
On the square
Live a life that isn't there
Square it up
Call me once you've had enough
On the square
Live a life that isn't there
Square it up
Call me once you've had enough

[Verse 1]
I'm the preacher
A done decision
Another creature
Who's lost its vision

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it go
Reel it in
For the creature
On television

[Chorus]
There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree

[Verse 2]
I'm a fixture
A split decision
A pretty picture
A superstition

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it go
Cash it in
For the creature
On television

[Chorus]
There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree
There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree

[Verse 1]
Sick of the city, locked in with all the pretty people
You need a vacation
Somewhere that no one ever would dream to go
Somewhere mundane, hop on the train
See where it goes
Finish your ride, hop off and hide
Now that you're finally alone

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, yeah
Honey, you're finally alone
Oh, yeah, yeah, ho

[Verse 2]
Out in the country, tending to all the pretty cattle
It turns out the cowboy dreams of the city
Who could have ever known?
Hop on a plane, fly out to Spain
Inténtalo, yeah
Pick up your bags, cure your jet lag
Now that you're finally alone

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, yeah
Honey, you're finally alone
Oh, yeah, yeah
Honey, you're finally alone
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Honey, you're finally alone
Oh, yeah, yeah, ho

[Verse 1]
Hope you had your fun
All those days are over now
The sunset's at the skyline
Say goodnight and kindly take your bow

[Chorus]
March on, little doggy
March on, little dog

[Verse 2]
Hope you got your fill
All those days are over now
The river's all dammed up
So fill your cup and kindly take your bow

[Chorus]
And march on, little doggy
March on, little dog
March on, little doggy
March on, little dog

[Verse 1]
Passin' around, your blood and your body
No conversation to ease up your mind
And nobody seems to see the outside of it
Preoccupied, and nobody's hiding it

[Chorus]
Preoccupied, nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, nobody's hiding it

[Verse 2]
Opened your mind, filled it with bullshit
Locked up your heart, without even knowing it
It must be a sign, the days that we're living in
Preoccupied, and nobody's hiding it

[Chorus]
Preoccupied, and nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, yeah, and nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, and nobody's hiding it

[Verse 1]
As the years blow by, baby
The more I come to know myself
The more it seems my love grows for you
And surely I'd be dead, baby
Had I gone with someone else
For this and more, my love sold to you

[Chorus]
K, anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
K, settle down, turn around, and take this song, and let it play

[Verse 2]
Got to know your heart, baby
Still so much for me to learn
And as I do, my love stays with you
And surely I'd be done, baby
Had I made another turn
Glad the turn that I made was you

[Chorus]
K, anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
K, settle down, turn around, and take this song, and let it play
K, anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
K, settle down, turn around, and take this song, and let it play

[Verse 1]
Holdin' out
Another day has come and let you down
All of our yesterdays have gone now
Tearin’ up
Lookin' for a shoulder to prop you up

[Pre-Chorus]
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone

[Chorus]
And that don't mean your dream is over
And that don’t make your heart beat slower
Such a shame to complain
When all of our yesterdays have gone away

[Verse 2]
Holdin' on
An image of a memory, another song
All of our yesterdays have gone now
Call me up
When you need a shoulder to prop you up

[Pre-Chorus]
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone

[Chorus]
And that don't mean your dream is over
And that don't make your heart beat slower
Such a shame to complain
When all of our yesterdays have gone away
And that don't mean your dream is over
And that don't make your heart beat slower
Such a shame to complain
When all of our yesterdays have gone away

[Verse 1]
Baby blue
I know how things have changed for you
Remember that the days are numbered
Springtime turns to summer
With or without you
Little man
The autumn came and changed up your plans
Remember now their dead had gone
No one wants you singing along

[Chorus]
More and more and more and more
More and more and more and more and more

[Verse 2]
Baby blue
I've been making changes too
Remember now the time's been spent up
There's no place left to rent out
There ain't much else for you to do
Skyless moon
Maybe spring will change up your tune
Remember now its dead had gone
Memories keep singing their songs

[Chorus]
More and more and more and more and more
More and more and more and more and more
More and more and more and more and more
More and more and more and more and more

[Verse]
Another night
You don't sleep at all
You lay awake
Waiting for her call
But it never comes
And it never will
One more love to fall
Down from your windowsill

[Chorus]
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye

[Chorus]
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
(So long, darling)
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Love at first sight only makes you blind
First you lose your senses
Then you drop your self-defenses in time
Head over heels is a big mistake
Suddenly you're falling
And ecstasy is calling your name

[Chorus: Madonna & Babyface]
Never love a stranger
Never put your heart in danger
Never fall in love with someone you don't know
Love takes time to grow
Love takes time

[Verse 2: Madonna]
One goodnight kiss and it won't be long
When arms are intertwined
It's so difficult to find something wrong
One night of fun and you come undone
Anyone can hurt you
Better hold on to your virtue and run

[Chorus: Madonna & Babyface]
Never love a stranger
Never put your heart in danger
Never fall in love with someone you don't know
Love takes time to grow
Love takes time

[Bridge: Madonna and Babyface]
We never see the forest for the trees
We always fall in love with first impressions
Words in the night seem to vanish with the light
And you wake up and you're all alone
There's no one home

[Chorus: Madonna & Babyface]
Never love a stranger
Never put your heart in danger
Never fall in love with someone you don't know
Love takes time
Never love a stranger
Never put your heart in danger
Never fall in love with someone you don't know
Love takes time to grow
Love takes time to grow
Love takes time to grow

[Verse 1]
I've never felt a love like this before
You touch my hand and I am seeing stars
And I'm so scared you'll leave me all alone, no
'Cause you're the only one that ever feels like home
Oh oh

[Chorus]
We collide, like the lightning in the clouds
We collide, like the raindrops falling to the ground
If you cross your eyes, I'll be there, be there, be there, baby
'Cause when we collide, you save me, ah ooh

[Verse 2]
I feel your body breathing next to me
It's like a tidal wave, it's crashing down on me
I want to understand the words you say
'Cause you're the only one that will take me
You can take me back there now

[Chorus]
We collide, like the lightning in the clouds
We collide, like the raindrops falling to the ground
If you cross your eyes, I'll be there, be there, be there, baby
'Cause when we collide, you save me, ah ooh
We collide, like the lightning in the clouds
We collide, like the raindrops falling to the ground
If you cross your eyes, I'll be there, be there, be there, baby
'Cause when we collide, you save me, ah ooh

[Outro]
We will collide, our hearts alive
Love never dies, love never dies
We will collide, our hearts alive
Love never dies, love never dies
We will collide, our hearts alive
Love never dies, love never dies
We will collide, our hearts alive
Love never dies, love never dies
We will collide

[Intro]
Talk about an, talk about an, talk about an, talk about an
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You're more than inspiration (that's right), for every situation (uh-huh)
You make me lose my patience (yeah)
No I can't stand the wait, I need you asap (asap)
When you come around I ain't never going 'bout my way (my way)
I hope you understand that (yeah)
You bring out the best and leave the negative
After I've just had the worst day
Who you love is actually irrelevant
And you should be prescribed for every case

[Chorus]
My antidepressant baby (oh woah, hey hey)
My antidepressant baby
Oh, you make me smile when I wanna frown, oh yeah (oh yeah, oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm so blessed to be in your presence (I'm so blessed)
So modest you ain't worried about fame (about fame)
Reminded that you’re needed, of essence
So effortlessly, you're amazing
Conversations so engaging (go on)
Talented, so entertaining
You win me over and over again, yeah

[Chorus]
My antidepressant baby, (too slow?, oh woah, hey hey)
My antidepressant baby
Oh, you make me smile when I wanna frown, oh yeah (that's right)

[Bridge]
I'm so blessed to be in your presence (yeah)
So modest you ain't worried about fame (about fame)
You're more than inspiration (let's go), for every situation (for every situation)
You make me lose my patience (you make me lose my patience)
No I can't stand the wait, I need you asap (asap)
When you come around I ain’t never going 'bout my way (way, yeah)
I hope you understand that

[Outro]
You bring out the best and leave the negative (negative)
After I've just had the worst day (day)
Who you love is actually irrelevant (ah)
And you should be prescribed for every case
My antidepressant baby (oh woah, hey hey)
My antidepressant baby
Oh, you make me smile when I wanna frown, oh yeah (wooh, wooh)

[Intro]
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I’ll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now
Don’t stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time

[Verse 1]
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that’s why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I’m travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you

[Chorus]
Don't stop me now
I’m having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call
Don't stop me now, ’cause I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now, yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

[Verse 1]
Guess it's true, I’m not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

[Chorus]
Oh won’t you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Outro]
Oh won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain’t love, it’s clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Intro]
This is how we do it!
(This is how we do it!)
Sha la la la la la lo!
This is how we do it

[Verse 1]
This is how we do it
It's Friday night, and I feel all right
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, "Monty, yo, we made it!"
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

[Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and its all because
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor
(This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back
(this is how we do it)

[Intro]
Young Drako, nigga
2019, man you know what it is (Ayy, Dil')
Yeah, uh

[Chorus]
Fuck with gang, nigga and I hit the killswitch
Geeking off a Percocets, nigga can't feel shit
Run up on gang, get hit with the whole clip
I hit my show, after that sell a brick

[Verse 1]
Make the wrong move get filled up with hollow tips
Riding round town in that Limousine stretch whip
Hop out that cut with my finger on trigger finger, pool stick
35 thousand, bust down Rollie wrist
Aye bruh bruh, who the fuck is this?
Word around town I been fucking his bitch
Nigga talking shit, I empty the clip
Brand new Bentley truck, that's my whip
VVS diamond, you should of went to Elliott
That 30 clip long like that nose on an elephant
Do a drive-by in a Lamborghini
Geeked up off of Percocets
I hit the pot with a fork and a strap with that glizzy
I just came back from New York
Run up on Drako, your ass gon get torched
Fucking your bitch, her pussy so moist

[Chorus]
Fuck with gang, nigga and I hit the killswitch
Geeking off a Percocets, nigga can't feel shit
Run up on gang, get hit with the whole clip
I hit my show, after that sell a brick

[Verse 2]
Walk in this bitch with a stick on me
Cuban link, pint of Actavis, with a bad bitch on me
Run up on Drako, I'm leaving you history
A million dollars, that's a lot to you?
But really, that ain't shit to me
I'm double cup sipping Promethazine
Pull up on my block, I'ma spray up the whole street
Fuck that shit, nigga I kill the whole beat
Bust down my Rollie, it look like a centipede
Pull on the block with a Drako, spray heat
I make these rap niggas remember me
Black and yellow diamonds, feeling like Wiz Khalifa
Diamonds a bumblebee
Took off like a rocket, ain't nobody stopping me
Coppin two bricks, and now I'm coppin three
Walk in the Louis store, I'm on a shopping spree
Watch out how many of these rap niggas gon copy me
Diamonds in my mouth, clean it with Listerine
Smoking on dope, playing the Soulja Game
Big Backwood, tasting like Krispy Kreme
Stretched Lambo look just like a Limousine
Big chopper, get to spraying up the whole street
I am Big Soulja, nigga who gon check me?
I spent 30 thousand for my neck piece
I got a condo, it's right on South Beach
No Limit Soulja, I'm feeling like Master P
Back in High school, I had more money than the faculty
And I put that shit on my momma
You run up on Drako, get hit with the thunder
I shoot with the dice and I'm hitting my number
I'm pissing out lean, I need me a plumber
I went to school high and still got a diploma
Young street nigga, I fuck on your momma
Sipping codeine, smoking marijuana (Yeah)
Gang

[Stanza 1]
You move like water sweet baby sweet waiter
making the night smile to no one you cater
silent wood worker from midnight till later
my lover my laughter my armor my maker
The way that i feel with you is something like aching
inside of my stomach the cosmos are baking
a universe hung like a mobile
the alignment of these planets unique
in me the earth moves around the sun
no land all sea
water world
sun chaser
tropic of cancer
southern equater
i'm the crying crustacean
sunbathing on paper
moon.
Let's rewrite the beginning of this primordial ooze
shall we my love
Am i being brazen for saying this year makes me feel
like we could've wrote it better
than him?
But who am i
just a girl in love dreaming on paper
rearranging the salt for the pepper
in love with you
my quiet waiter
Summer
blue
Forever
call me when you're done with work
i'll pick you up later
the darker the better

[Verse 1]
My mother told me one day
She's tired of my sad songs
But loving you has only
Made me cry twice or so
The day that I said I loved you
You didn't say it in return
That was the day I realized
That silence is actually hurt

[Chorus]
And I am done changing words
Just so my songs sound prettier
I just don't care if it hurts
'Cause it hurts me too

[Verse 2]
I hate that feeling at night
When I thought my eyes were closed
But they were open the whole time
It was just too dark to know
And what am I 'posed to do when
My dad cries in front of me?
Do I just close my eyes and
Pretend like I didn't see?

[Chorus]
And I am done changing words
Just so my songs sound prettier
I just don't care if it hurts
'Cause it hurts me too

[Verse 1]
Not sure what day it is
When I stopped counting it
My time's been wasted
Been thinking of him
I wonder if he remembers my brother's name
I only said it once but was he listening?

[Verse 2]
It's the little things
That just aren't the same
I used to make my bed
But now I see no point in it
He's awake the whole time that I'm asleep
Maybe that's why I don't see him in my dreams

[Verse 3]
Don't know what to do (Don't)
I have nothing to do (No)
There's nowhere to go (Go)
I just stay at home
I sent a pigeon with a note to his house
I hope he hung it up but probably threw it out

[Chorus]
I sent a pigeon with a note to his house
I hope he hung it up but probably threw it out
I wish I knew but I am too afraid to ask
I should just let it go but I can't not look back

[Chorus:]
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all feel right
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all go loud
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all feel right
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all go loud

Well, hey there shawty with the big, brown eyes
I know you got something that I really do like
If you rock with me, I can make you mine tonight, tonight

[Verse 1:]
My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isn't me
I'm waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone
Asking what I do isn't any of your business
Looking at my crew like you're something you fit in with
I don't even know if you thinking what I'm thinking
But I'm thinking 'bout your body, would you lay down for a minute?
Well, hey there shawty with the big, brown eyes
I know you got something that I really do like
If you rock with me, I can make you mine tonight, tonight

[Chorus:]
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all feel right
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all go loud
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all feel right
Can you feel my love, can you feel my love baby?
Can you feel my love, make it all go loud

My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isn't me
I'm waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone
My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isn't me
I'm waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone

[Verse 2:]
Is there an essence to the problem
If you ask me, I can solve them
If you need me, then I need you
And there's more than I can take than this love could be
More than amazement, more than entertainment
And if you need me (mumbles)
My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isn't me
I'm waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone
My conscience is killing me, this nonsense just isn't me
I'm waiting for you to come take me or leave me alone

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?
You want me to love you, but how much do you love me?
If I was wrong then you was wrong too, you're the one I’m holding on to
You're the one that broke the code that was on the phone and started scrolling through
You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
First off this started when you broke in my phone (aye girl)
And I know how you like to blame me for everything
Girl, but you were wrong (but you were wrong)
But do it really matter though?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I feel like me and you girl, we had it all
I'm wishing on a star
Girl, tell me where you are or how you been
Gotta tell you now, we may never speak again
Baby when you’re wrong I gotta let you know that you're wrong
You know you should of never went upstairs and broke into my phone

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?
You want me to love you, but how much do you love me?
If I was wrong then you was wrong too, you're the one I'm holding on to
You're the one that broke the code that was on the phone and started scrolling through
You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Girl I miss the days when it was just you and me
Me and you going through the storm, baby tell me do you still believe
Or is it all gone?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I feel like me and you girl, we had it all
I'm wishing on a star
Girl, tell me where you are or how you been
Gotta tell you now, we may never speak again
Baby when you're wrong I gotta let you know that you're wrong
You know you should of never went upstairs and broke into my phone

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?
You want me to love you, but how much do you love me?
If I was wrong then you was wrong too, you’re the one I’m holding on to
You're the one that broke the code that was on the phone and started scrolling through
You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?

[Verse 3: (?)]
Hold on
Bet you didn’t think I knew that code huh, no
Bet you didn't think I'd go upstairs and call that girl huh, no
Bet you didn't think I threw your phone into that door huh, no
I expected you to have something there but not them photos
And I found that text, I really don’t know what we gon' do next
I really don't know how we gon' fix it, boy look at this mess
Been crying all night and my makeup ruined, boy look at this stress
Boy look at this stress, boy look at this stress

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?
You want me to love you, but how much do you love me?
If I was wrong then you was wrong too, you're the one I'm holding on to
You're the one that broke the code that was on the phone and started scrolling through
You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?

[Verse 1]
You said you can't change your haircut
But it looks good anyway
I kinda wonder where you got it
And I doubt you even paid

[Chorus]
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you

[Verse 2]
I wonder if you got home
But we just said goodbye
You looked back at me once
But I looked back two times

[Chorus]
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you

[Outro]
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck
Still smells like you
The right side of my neck

[Verse 1]
Looks like I've been crying again over the same thing
I wonder if anyone has ever cried for me
Nothing means anything, at least anymore
Even my tears have gone room temperature

[Chorus]
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more

[Verse 2]
I was sitting here last year, the same time ago
Still wearing the same thing, these aren't even my clothes
I just don't change that much 'cause who's to impress?
There's nobody around when I'm at my best

[Chorus]
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more

[Verse 1]
I'm losing my mind
Why the hell did I paint these walls white?
And I wonder, what's the point of this life?
Sometimes I'll pray but I will never close my eyes

[Verse 2]
I want to be happy
Find a man with an old name just like me
And get over how my dog is my best friend
And he doesn't even know what my name is

[Chorus]
Jonny, did you ever love me?
Jonny, help me figure it out
Not that I've paid attention
But you haven't said it out loud
Jonny, do you see what you're doing?
What you're making me think about?
This wasn't 'posed to be a love song
But I guess it is now

[Bridge]
Jonny, maybe you'll never hear this
Or maybe it's stuck in your head
Well, I hope it makes you cry
The way that I did

[Chorus]
Jonny, did you ever love me?
Jonny, help me figure it out
Not that I've paid attention
But you haven't said it out loud
Jonny, do you see what you're doing?
What you're making me think about?
This wasn't 'posed to be a love song
But I guess it is now, isn't it?

[Verse 1]
I want my time back, I want my time back
I want my time back with you
I only want that, I only want that
I only want that with you

[Chorus]
Why won't you come here to visit?
Why do you only speak of it?
When will you come to Atlanta?
I want to see you here in Atlanta

[Verse 2]
I don't want no one, I don't want no one
I don't want no one but you
I don't want no one, I don't want no one
I don't want no one but you

[Chorus]
Why won't you come here to visit?
Why do you only speak of it?
When will you come to Atlanta?
I want to see you here in Atlanta

[Outro]
Mm-mm
Mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm
Mm-mm
Mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm

[Verse 1]
I miss your house on the hill
The one with your room on the right
I miss your voice, you're the only one with it
It reminds me of what used to be mine

[Verse 2]
I miss you in Chattanooga
I drive through there all the time
And I listen to you when I feel like crying
It reminds me of what used to be mine

[Verse 3]
I miss your shirt that didn't fit right
I've worn it to sleep once or twice
I try not to go where I first met you
It reminds me of what used to be mine

[Verse 4]
I only see you on occasion
Some form of you, not in real life
Right now your picture's all over Atlanta
No matter which way that I drive
It reminds me of what used to be mine
You remind me of what used to be mine

[Intro: Faye Webster]
What do you prefer?
I don't have that much
I don’t offer
I don't have that much

[Chorus: Faye Webster & Father]
What do you prefer?
I don't have that much to offer
Can you just give me all your time?
I’m gonna try to give you mine
What do you prefer?
I don't have that much to offer (Yeah, boom-boom-boom, boom)
Can you just give me all your time?
I'm gonna try to give you mine

[Verse: Father & Faye Webster]
A lot of niggas wrote the check so they could take this flow
A lot of bitches try to flex and now they tryin' to get chose
A lot of niggas shouting "Awful!" (When did you join?)
You been fuckin' up the whole time but swear you on point (Oh, oh, ahh)
Sometimes the girl of your dreams need to stay in your dreams
You can fuck with the team but don't fuck on the team
I know a lot of niggas hate me in the depths of they soul
Started out as young, hot, turnin' into LaCole (Why, why, why?)
Why my heart so cold? Yeah
Why my wrist on froze? (Nigga, ice cold, yeah)
2PM in L.A., my girl ain't got on no clothes, yeah
Shouting, "Nigga, we made it!" (We made it)
All my chains on, why these niggas is hatin’? (Yeah, boom-boom-boom, boom)
I should stop asking people for assistance (Yeah)
I don’t like to get caught up in commitments (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's just stop asking (Ayy) these hoes for forgiveness (Uh-huh)
Yeah, she thinkin’ some unfinished business (Uh-huh)

[Chorus: Faye Webster & Father]
What do you prefer?
I don't have that much to offer
Can you just give me all your time?
I'm gonna try to give you mine
What do you prefer?
I don't have that much to offer (Yeah, boom-boom-boom, boom)
Can you just give me all your time?
I’m gonna try to give you mine

[Verse]
Jonny, who was it that said
"A white wall may seem empty
But it's ready to be filled
And, in its readiness, needs nothing
It stands complete"
Was it you?
I don't remember
But it makes me wonder
Jonny, why couldn't you be ready, too?
I was ready, ready to be happy
Ready for that long look that never ends
And, now, I don't know what to do
Yes, Jonny, I'll say it
This is a love song, isn't it?
Yes, well, I guess this is how it ends
A strange poem about a plain and ready white wall
One with many questions
And a dog as speechless as that same wall
And the sorrows of love's slow passing
Goodbye, Jonny

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
One day we were at home rehearsing
When we heard a funny noise
Opened the backdoor to find out
It was a dude with a British voice
Stood there, said his name was James Corden
And we hadn't heard of him

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He told me he built a time machine
Described all the things he'd seen, yeah
And he said:

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers & James Corden]
"I've been to the year 2019
You won't believe who the new President is
It's the guy who hosts "The Apprentice"
And it's pretty weird, super weird"

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He showed us the future through the portal
And we saw everything
Spider-Man, and another one, and another one
And another one
Found out there's a mascot called Gritty
He made us terrified

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas & James Corden]
We thought the future would be the best
So what's new with Kanye West? Yeah (Uhhh...)
He said:

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers & James Corden]
"I've been to the year 2019
TV has changed, now it's all on your cell phone
You can filter any photo
Look! I'm a dog, a sexy dog"

[Post-Chorus: Jonas Brothers, Nick Jonas, & James Corden]
I took a trip to 2019
Twitter sucks, Instagram is thriving
Everybody's wearing really tight jeans
You'll be married (That's surprising)
I took a trip to 2019
So many brand-new milks we're trying:
Cashew, almond, flax milk, oat milk
Rice milk, soy milk, hemp, and goat milk
I took a trip to 2019
Lonely Kevin's still the best meme
Everybody is obsessed with flossing

[Bridge: Jonas Brothers, Nick Jonas, & James Corden]
He said that Blockbuster is shut down
And Apple makes watches now, yeah
I've been to the year 2019
Fyre Fest was a total disaster
And The Rock is now a big actor
Box office champ, Dwayne Johnson (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I said:

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers & James Corden]
"I've been to the year 2019
There's dogs on planes, for emotional reasons
The Kardashians have had 15 seasons
They're everywhere, we're keeping up
I've been to the year 2019
Some things have changed, but it still can get better
And our band is back together and doing fine, doing fine"

[Verse 1]
You cheated, you lied to me, you can't pretend
This thing can't go on, this has to end
There's more to lovin', there's more than just the thrill of the chase
You say you're sorry but you leave a bitter taste

[Chorus]
If you want me around, stop bringing me down
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone (When I'm gone)
If you want me around, stop working it out
You're gonna want me to stay, I'll be gone

[Verse 2]
You told me you love me but we're not even friends
This thing can't go on, this has to end
My biggest mistake is that I gave you too much
Love can never work without trust

[Chorus]
If you want me around, stop bringing me down
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone (When I'm gone)
If you want me around, stop working it out
You're gonna want me to stay, I'll be gone
Don't bring me down, I'll be gone
Don't bring me down, I'll be gone

[Verse 1]
You cheated, you lied to me, you can't pretend
This thing can't go on, this has to end
There's more to lovin', there's more than just the thrill of the chase
You say you're sorry but you leave a bitter taste

[Chorus]
If you want me around, stop bringing me down
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone (When I'm gone)
If you want me around, stop working it out
You're gonna want me to stay, I'll be gone
If you want me around, stop bringing me down
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone (When I'm gone)
If you want me around, stop working it out
You're gonna want me to stay, I'll be gone
If you want me around, stop bringing me down
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone (When I'm gone)
If you want me around, stop working it out
You're gonna want me to stay, I'll be gone
If you want me around, stop bringing me down
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone (When I'm gone)
If you want me around, stop working it out
You're gonna want me to stay, I'll be gone

[Intro]
Breathe in, breathe out
I say a little prayer
How the Gods above
Could be so unfair

[Verse 1]
I'm not so good when I'm alone
I don't like what I see
I never measure up
To what the world would like to think of me

[Chorus]
I know there's someone out there
Waiting for me
There just has to be
Has to be

[Verse 2]
Go on, go on
Don't sit there like a fool
You've graduated from
A different kind of school

[Verse 3]
I should be glad that I'm alive
It could have been much worse
I might have never loved at all
And never known what I am worth

[Chorus]
I know there's someone out there
Waiting for me
There just has to be
Has to be

[Bridge]
Breathe in, breathe out
I say a little prayer
How the Gods above
Could be so unfair

[Outro]
I'll just be glad that I'm alive
It could have been much worse

[Verse 1]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen
When your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Verse 2]
Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken
You understand, don't pretend to be weak
Don't turn away, I need you to speak
If I leave you
You'll wish that you had spoken

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Verse 1]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Outro]
If I could melt your heart
I traded fame for love
Without a second thought
It all became a silly game
Some things cannot be bought
I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
Went running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly
And now, I find
I changed my mind
I found a new religion

[Chorus]
Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love

[Verse 2]
I traveled 'round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone
I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt fulfilled
And now, I find
I changed my mind
I found a new religion

[Chorus]
Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love
Face the truth
No substitute for love

[Bridge]
I've had a change of heart
I'll make a brand new start
No famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can't buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can't try
No Ferris wheel, no heart to steal
Laughter in the dark
No one night stand, no far off land
Fire that I can't spark

[Chorus]
Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love
Face the truth
No substitute for love
Substitute for love
Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love
Face the truth
No substitute for love
No substitute for love

[Verse 1]
Kiss me, I'm dying
Put your hand on my skin
I close my eyes
I need to make a connection
I'm walking on a thin line
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

[Chorus 1]
Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?

[Verse 2]
Touch me, I'm trying
To see inside of your soul
I've got this thing
I want to make a correction
I'm not like this all the time
You've got this thing

[Chorus 1]
Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?

[Bridge]
I'm so 

[?]
Looked on as something shocking
Kiss me
Kiss me
You've got this thing

[Chorus 2]
Do I know you from somewhere?
Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?
Do I know you from somewhere?
Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?

[Outro]
This time I mean it
This time I really mean it
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?
Kiss me
Kiss me
Touch me
Touch me
Why do all the things I say...

[Verse 1]
When I was very young
Nothing really mattered to me
But making myself happy
I was the only one
Now that I am grown
Everything's changed
I'll never be the same
Because of you

[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

[Verse 2]
Looking at my life
It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one
I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins

[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to-
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

[Bridge]
Nothing takes the past away
Like the future
Nothing makes the darkness go
Like the light
You're shelter from the storm
Give me comfort in your arms

[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need

[Verse 1]
Sky fits heaven, so fly it
That's what the prophet said to me
Child fits mother, so hold your baby tight
That's what my future could see

[Verse 2]
Fate fits karma, so use it
That's what the wise man said to me
Love fits virtue, so hold on to the light
That's what our future will be

[Chorus]
Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go?
I think I'll follow my heart
It's a very good place to start

[Post-Chorus]
Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as I go
Traveling down my own road
And I'm watching the signs as they go
Traveling, traveling
Watching the signs as I go

[Verse 3]
Hand fits giving, so do it
That's what the Gospel said to me
Life fits living, so let your judgments go
That's how our future should be

[Chorus]
Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go?
I think I'll follow my heart
It's a very good place to start

[Post-Chorus]
Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as I go
Traveling down my own road
And I'm watching the signs as they go
Traveling, traveling
Watching the signs as I go

[Verse 1]
To have and not to hold
So hot, yet so cold
My heart is in your hand
And yet you never stand
Close enough for me to have my way

[Verse 2]
To love but not to keep
To laugh, not to weep
Your eyes, they go right through
And yet you never do
Anything to make me want to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a moth to a flame
Only I am to blame

[Chorus]
Ba ba da ba ba ba
What can I do?
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I go straight to you
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I've been told, mmm
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram, abahu purusakaram)

[Verse 3]
To look but not to see
To kiss but never be
The object of your desire
I'm walking on a wire
And there's no one at all
To break my fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a moth to a flame
Only I am to blame

[Chorus]
Ba ba da ba ba ba
What can I do?
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I go straight to you
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I've been told, mmm
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram)
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram)
You're to have (and yet you never do)
Not to hold

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a moth to a flame
Only I am to blame

[Chorus]
Ba ba da ba ba ba
What can I do?
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I go straight to you
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I've been told, mmm
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram)
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram)
You're to have, not to hold
(And yet you never do)

[Outro]
You're to have
Not to hold
To break my heart
Mmm
Only I am to blame
Only I am to blame
Am to blame
Abahu purusakaram
Abahu purusakaram

[Chorus 1]
Never forget who you are
Little star
Never forget how to dream
Butterfly

[Verse 1]
God gave a present to me
Made of flesh and bones
My life, my soul
You make my spirit whole

[Chorus 2]
Never forget who you are
Little star
Shining brighter than all the stars in the sky
Never forget how to dream
Butterfly
Never forget where you come from
From love

[Verse 2]
You are a treasure to me
You are my star
You breathe new life
Into my broken heart

[Chorus 1]
Never forget who you are
Little star
Never forget how to dream
Butterfly

[Bridge]
May the angels protect you
And sadness forget you
Little star
There's no reason to weep
Lay your head down to sleep
Little star
May goodness surround you
My love I have found you
Little star
Shining bright
You breathe new life
Into my broken heart

[Chorus 2 - Variation]
Never forget who you are
Little star
Shining brighter than all the stars in the sky
Never forget how to dream
Butterfly
Flying higher than all the birds in the sky
Never forget who you are
Little star
Never forget where you come from
From love

[Outro]
Little star
Little star
Little star
From love

[Verse 1]
You do not wear it on your sleeve
You never did, I've never seen you bleed
You've got so many secrets, I don't know who you are
You keep yourself from being hurt
You can't feel much of anything, I'm sure
I never know just how you feel, I don't know if it's real

[Chorus]
Be careful with my heart, you could break it
Don't take my love for granted, things could change
Be careful with my heart, this is not a game
Be careful, be careful things could change

[Verse 2]
Some days I think I'll lose my mind
You're so unhappy, sometimes you're so unkind
Then I see you smile and I know why I stay
I cannot live my life this way
There's so much more, I know that I should say
You have to feed my soul and I think you should know

[Chorus]
Be careful with my heart, you could break it
Don't take my love for granted, things could change
Be careful with my heart, this is not a game
Be careful, be careful things could change

[Bridge]
Envy and doubt, I'm not your friend
Let all your secrets go, tell all your demons, no
Love is a bird, she has to fly
Go to the core of you, I want much more of you (Mmm)
I want to know your secrets, I don't know who you are

[Chorus]
Be careful with my heart, you could break it
Don't take my love for granted, things could change
Be careful with my heart, this is not a game
Be careful, be careful things could change
Be careful with my heart, you could break it
Don't take my love for granted, things could change
Be careful with my heart, this is not a game
Be careful, be careful things could change

Bitch walked out my door, you know I ain't even sweat her
Peanut butter jelly, purple diamonds, Cinderella

After all, it’s just another day

Yeah man! Play those NY drums!
Let’s show how we do it! Downtown!

[Verse 1]
Just another way to prove
I love you, when it's hard today!
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say that makes me mad I’ll turn away
I'll turn away!
I'll turn away!

[Pre-Chorus]
And think of different ways to keep my spirits up, and choreograph hours with playful, joyous thoughts

[Chorus]
We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey I lcve you ! *smiles*
And after all, it's just another day

[Verse 2]
Oh, I could use some two or three!
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I walk alone down a different street!
And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today

[Pre-Chorus]
And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts
I'll laugh in humble ways

[Chorus]
We both know I could learn a thing or two, about behaving, but I lxve you!
And after all it's just another day

Come on, Mark! *point*

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause he made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Born this way)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Interlude]
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be (Don't be, don't be)

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M
Hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (Same DNA)

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Born this way)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Interlude]
(Way) Don't be, don't be...
(Way) Church

[Breakdown]
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, cholo descent
You're Lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied, or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause baby, you were born this way

[Bridge]
No matter gay, straight or bi, lesbian, transgendered life, I’m on the right track baby I was born to survive, no matter black, white, or beige, chxla or orient made, I’m on the right track, baby I was born to be brave!

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes

I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Outro]
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, hey

I was born this way-hey! *hugs dancer*
She said she's waiting for when she will break
Don't let it be today
Don't let it be today
'Cause her and I have things we'd like to try
Some feelings she still hides
Until she finds the wine

She's absolutely shameless
Just like the sky whenever it's too bright
Sometimes it hurts my eyes
But I don't need my sight

If I feel her sass and I can taste her laugh
She's never really mad and she smiles when she is sad
She can't fool me
She can't fool me

But she can take me away
Or up any stairway
The further we can stray
The better are the days
I am a flower that's never seen the sun
I guess that I'm too young
But the soil, it weighs a ton
And I can't breathe
Uncover me

[Verse 1]
Turn a boy into a good man
Make a queen feel like a princess
One kiss at the perfect moment
Bruises start to heal

[Chorus]
That's what love can do
It’s not what love can't do
That's what love can do
Oh, I’ll tell you what you do to me
Every day, I find something else that makes me believe
'Cause that's what love can do
Baby, that's what love can do, I know, babe

[Verse 2]
You are now the most important
You and I have built this fortress
One night, we could make it alright
There's no need to run, ooh

[Chorus]
That's what love can do
It's not what love won't do
That’s what love can do
Oh, I’ll tell you what you do to me
Every day, I find something else that makes me believe
'Cause that’s what love can do
Baby, that's what love can do everyday

[Bridge]
When the morning comes
I see your eyes and feel the sun
I know I'm right where I belong
And you may not know until you grow
Who you are or what you know
Not everybody finds a love like us

[Chorus]
That's what love can do
That’s what love can do
That's what love can do
Oh, I'll tell you what you do to me
Every day, I find something else that makes me believe
'Cause that's what love can do
Baby, that's what love can do every day
Yeah, yeah, uhh, they, fuck... alright, uhh, yeah
They ask me if I'm tyler, the nasty nigga that used to be in 7th grade watching Degrassi
But y’all niggas in your whips with your rims and your hat with the brims, rolling right past me
But I could give a fuck about what you doing, who you screwing, who you booing
I got these bitches brewing in my gold pot, you could see the rolex, the gold watch
See them gold Supras but you won't stop

You on that fake shit, that True Religion, Abrecrombie, Pastal

And when your bitch seen me, she be like, Oh My God you’re so skinny but man you're so swell

Older than the ice cream shoes I have that's growing mould
And they say Ace he a genius, I said I play piano make songs of big penis
Cause when I have to, listen to Neptunes shit I'm never Mars or Venus

Nigga you can paint this here's the motherfuckin brush
All you niggas running but I’m still not in a rush and I’m winning
No braces off, but I'm grinning
Don’t believe in God but I'm sinning, hingin

[Verse 1]
Let's play a game
Let’s just pretend like you don't know who I am
Believe it if you say that you're not a fan
Act like I’m interested in some other man, man, man
Turn on the lights (The lights)
So that the cameras flashing won't be so bright (So bright)
Ain't like the crowd ain't getting big outside (Outside)
They're wanting details on how I live my life, my life, my life

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
There's no escape from the fame
To somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain
But the question still remain

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody’s girl?
Somebody loved by everybody

Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?

Too many people blocking the front door
We go our different ways, oh, we want more
Another gig I got don’t end 'til four, four, four

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no escape from the fame
To somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain
But the question still remain

Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga and Britney Spears]
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh

And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy
K-kind of busy, k-kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Verse 3: Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, both]
Not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight, I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing
Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('cause I'll be dancing)

Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies

[Pre-Chorus 1: Stu Mackenzie]
Don't matter to kiss and
Put back, poor fishies should be free

[Chorus: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim
I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim

[Post-Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]
Oh, your heart's a hook
Ego tied in knots, baiting fate
Don't do it
You ain't a god
Don't hunt salmon, carp or cod

[Verse: Stu Mackenzie]
Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies

[Pre-Chorus 2: Stu Mackenzie]
It seems like cruelty to me
You ain't hungry, leave them be

[Chorus: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim
I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim

[Post-Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]
Oh, your heart's a hook
Ego tied in knots, baiting fate
Don't do it
You ain't a god
Don't hunt salmon, carp or cod

[Verse: Stu Mackenzie]
Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies
Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies

[Bridge: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
I have been fishing and
I don't want to catch none
I have been fishing and

[Outro: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
I have been fishing and
I don't want to catch none

Well, up jumped the boogieman
He ate mumma's babies
And shot the policeman
And went down to the nightclub
And shocked all the patrons
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogieman
With the room in his hand

[Chorus]
Causing mayhem
’Cause he's the boogieman
Causing mayhem
'Cause he’s Boogieman Sam
(Boogieman Sam)

[Verse 2]
Well, up jumped the boogieman
He stole from a punter, the exact shoes he wanted
To carve holes in the floorboards
And dance like a demon
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogieman
With the room in his hand

[Chorus]
Causing mayhem
'Cause he's the boogieman
Arms are flailing
'Cause he's the Boogieman
(Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, Boogieman)
Doing damage
'Cause he's the boogieman

’Cause he’s Boogieman Sam
Boogieman Sam
Yeah, yeah

To a bird, what's a plane?
A shiny flying elephant
To a tree, what's a house?
Is that even relevant?
Does a bird know its name?
To a bird, what's a plane?

[Verse 1]
To a cow, what is a car?
It's a deadly predator

[Chorus]
To a bird, what's a plane?
A shiny flying elephant
To a tree, what's a house?
Can it think at all?
Does a bird know its name?
To a bird, what's a plane?

[Verse 2]
To a cloud, what is a breeze?
It's a predetermined sneeze
To a seal, what is real?
Surely more than it can feel

[Chorus]
To a bird, what's a plane?
A shiny flying elephant
To a tree, what's a house?
Is that even relevant?
Does a bird know its name?
To a bird, what's a plane?

[Outro]
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?

Underestimated technology
I'm addicted to tablet screens
No escaping battleground PUBG
Computer games ain't for me

[Chorus]
Can't relate face to face with modern day youth
Outdated, the post-millennial will get you
I was born in the echo boom
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial

[Post-Chorus]
I was only born in '92
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial
The cruel millennial

[Verse 2]
White dog shit, not on my nature strip
Calcium bone conspiracist
Berenstein Bears read to as kids

What in the world is going on? (What in the world is going on?)
That pretty picture's looking wrong (Picture's looking wrong)
If happy is all you wanna be
Then I can see that the painting ain't painted with love
What in the world is going on here?
Your past is built upon your fear
And happy is what you'll never be
I'm afraid that you're lacking some free will

[Refrain]
Your real's not real
Your real's not real

[Verse 2]
What in the world is going on? (What in the world is going on?)
Can't we all just get along? (Can't we get along?)
Our candy is melting in the sun
Can anyone be a martyr from hereafter?
What in the world is going on now?
Your farm is full of sacred cow
And happy is what you'll never be
I'm afraid that you're lacking some free will

[Refrain]
Your real's not real

[Verse 1]
Well, I fake a lot of symptoms to be a different person
I try to listen
I try to be primed for a reason to go back to sleep
That's not to say there's no relief
I like it when it happens, you don't
You're happy? When you show it, I won't
The cycle keeps repeating, I can't escape the rip
There's no stopping what this is

[Verse 2]
Back in the day your style was impressive
Infectious, stress-less
Disposition had it all, nothing but rapport
Full of what you're empty of
I hide my riches in embarrassing sheets
That reek of suspicious happenings
'Cause I'm a different person and that will make you sick
There's no stopping what this is

[Bridge]
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
You're a load bearing friend and that is what makes this hard
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
And all that I know is one of us has to wring it out

[Verse 1]
Your eyes change like the seasons
Your eyes they make me speechless
And you know I met you for a reason, woah
Maybe lessons they can teach us

Teach you and I to give each other everything

[Chorus]
We should raise the bar
We set the standards

Let's take it to the next level babe

Gotta feel secure, if you wanna be sure

Teach us how to run, teach us how to fly
Teach you and I to give each other everything

Here we have Larry Hoover's lawyer with us today and it’s a prisoner that we're focused on. He has six life sentences and they have him next to the unibomber doing 23 and 1 … Really the reason why they imprisoned 

[Larry Hoover] is because he started doing positive for the community. He started showing that he actually had power, he wasn't just one of a monolithic voice but he could wrap people around, so there’s theories that there's infinite amounts of universe, and there's alternate universe, so it's very important for me to get Hoover out because in an alternate universe, I am him. And I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago, just like how I'm moving back to Chicago and it's not just about, you know, getting on stage and being an entertainer, and having a monolithic voice that's forced to be a specific party.

“You know, people expect that if you're black you have to be Democrat. I have conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat they say – you know first of all, it’s a limit to amount of jobs, so the fathers lose the job and they say, ‘We’ll give you more money for having more kids in your home.' And then we got rid of the mental health institutes in the 80s and the 90s and the prison rates just shot up. And now you have Chiraq, what people call Chiraq, which actually, our murder rate is going down by 20 per cent every year. I just talked to the superintendent, met with Michael Sacks, that’s Ron's right hand man. So, I think it's the bravery that helps you beat this game called life. You know they tried to scare me to not wear this hat, my own friends, but this hat, it gives me power in a way.

“You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home. And also I’m married now into a family that, you know, not a lot of male energy going on, it's beautiful though. But there's times where, you know, it's something about, I love Hillary, I love everyone, right, but the campaign “I'm With Her” just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son. It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. You made us Superman, that's my favorite superhero, and you made a Superman cape for me.

“Also as a guy that looks up to you, looks up to Ralph Lauren, looks up to American industry guys. Non-political, no bullshit 

[looks at media members] – put the beep on it, however you want to do it, five seconds delay – and just goes in and gets it done. Right now, you gave me the heart to go to Adidas. When I went in, in 2015, we were a $14 billion company losing $2 billion a year. Now, we have $38 billion market cap. It's called “The Yeezy Effect.” And went and I said, “You have to bring manufacturing on-shore. Not even on-shore, into the core. It's not about the borders. The core of Adidas, and Chicago, is the core of middle America, and we have to make middle America strong.

“So, I had the balls, because I have enough balls to put on this hat. I mean, this Adidas thing made me a billionaire. And I could have lost $200 million walking away from that deal. But even with that, I knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal, than to have no fathers in Chicago, with no homes. And when we do have prison reformation, not rehabilitation, because they didn't have the abilities in the first place. We never had anyone who taught us, they didn't teach us. Then any specific deal, anything, that we bring jobs into America. And that we provide a transition with mental health and the AmeriCan education curriculum that Jim has worked on. Larry Hoover also has a curriculum that he's worked on. We have Montessori curriculums that we worked on. WeWorks has beautiful curriculum. The Waldorf establishment has a curriculum. We have meditation.

“There's a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things, that puts us back into that trap door that's called the 13th Amendment. I did say, “abolish,” with the hat on, because why would you keep something around that's a trap door. If you building a floor, the constitution is the base of our industry, of our country, of our company. Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Uni-bomber, you gotta remove all that trapdoor out of the relationship. The four gentleman that wrote the 13th Amendment, and I think the way the universe works is perfect, we don't have 13 floors, do we? You know, the four gentleman that wrote the 13th amendment didn't look like the people they were amending. Also, at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read, or African Americans, to read. So, that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you'd get locked up! And turned into a slave. Again, so what I think is, we don't need sentences, we need pardons. We need to talk to people.

“I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and NFL. He looked at my brain, it's equal on three parts. I'm gonna go ahead, drop some bombs for you. 98 percentile IQ test, I had a 75 percentile of all human beings when it was counting eight numbers backwards, so I'm gonna work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent, Tesla, Freud. So, he said that I actually wasn't bipolar, I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10-20 years from now, where I wouldn't even remember my son's name. So, all this power that I've got, and I'm taking my son to the Sox game and all that, I wouldn't be able to remember his name, from a misdiagnosis. What we need is, we can empower the pharmaceuticals and make more money. That's one thing, I've never stepped into a situation where I didn't make people more money. So, we can empower pharmaceuticals, we can empower our industries, we can empower our factories, we can bring, not only Adidas on shore, we could bring Foxconn and set up a factory in, I think, Minnesota 

[corrected by Trump that it's Wisconsin].

“Yeah, Wisconsin. They have 4,000 jobs, people making 53,000 a year. And one of the things we gotta set is, Ford to have the highest designs. The dopest cars. The most amazing. I don't really say, “dope,” I don't say negative words and try to flip ‘em. We just say positive, lovely, divine, universal words. So, the flyest, freshest, most amazing car. And what we start with, is – I brought a GIF with me right here. 

[Scrolls through iPhone to show Trump.] This right here is the iPlane 1. It's a hydrogen powered airplane, and this is what our president should be flying in. We're gonna have Apple, an American company, work on this plane.

“What I need Saturday Night Live to improve on, or what I need the liberals to improve on is, if he don't look good 

[pointing to Trump], we don't look good. This is our President. He has to be the freshest, the flyest, the flyest planes, the best factories. And we have to make our core be empowered. We have to bring jobs into America, because our best export is entertainment and ideas. But when we make everything in China and not America, then we're cheating on our country, and we're putting people in positions to have to do illegal things to end up in the cheapest factory every, the prison system.”

[Outro]
Oh, what a crime against women kind!
Open and closed
Entirely honest
I’ve been waiting I’ll wait for you
Just a few more days then it’s through
Don’t you know I hate to ask you why... but why?

All of the feels
You’re in the same place that I wanna be in
All alone
It’s just that I wanna be here taking it slow
I’m just taking it slow
Taking it slow
All of the feels
You’re in the same place that I was that year
Keep in mind
It’s just that I wanna be here taking it slow
I’m just taking it slow
Taking it slow

So yesterday I felt so...
Is that what you mean?
Is that what you mean?
If I could go back in time I wouldn’t change a thing
You say I never listen but what does that mean?
Don’t you know I wouldn’t lie?
I wish we would get along but you’re close to being gone
And now it’s time to look the other way and say
It’s nothing personal
We need some time alone
Don’t you know I hate to ask you why
So it goes back again

All of the feels
You’re in the same place that I wanna be in
All alone
It’s just that I wanna be here taking it slow

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs something to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say (Say)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it (Got it)
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (Wanted)
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)
I'm no good at goodbyes

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My argue possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered (Yeah)
And I don't want ya to never go outside (Outside)
I promise if they play, my niggas slidin' (Slidin')
I'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' (Ridin')
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)
I'm no good at goodbyes

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)
I'm no good at goodbyes

I'm that classy mami with the Marilyn Monroe body

Ghetto fabulous, glamorous, it's effortless

Designer scarf, work of art, rockin' vintage Gucci

[Verse 2]
I'm that girl wearing Chanel pearls
Chandeliers in my ears from Bailey Banks & Biddle's
Ya feelin' my style, ya feelin' my flow
Hair chic, smells sweet, like flow to flow
I'm the lady sippin' Bailey's while I strut like a model
If the ladies wanna hate me, I just send them a bottle
I know I got it, but don't flaunt it even though brothas want it
Dancin' dirty while I'm flirtin', 'cause he checkin' up on me

[Chorus]
You can find me in da club, sippin' on some bub

Shining with all my fancy things
My crib, my car, my clothes, my jewels
Why you mad? 'Cause I came up, and I ain't changed

You can find me in da club, sippin' on some bub

[Verse 1]
Hopped up out the gym
Just to hop up on these gems
Hopped up out the bed
With some breakfast, toast and jams
Buttered with the spread
Fix my OJ with the jams
Ducking from the feds
Like a nigga facing ten (Hell nah)

[Beat switch]
I ain't tryna spend time behind the pen (Hell nah)

[Gunz N Butter playing at concert]
"No" is just a word
That people say when they're afraid
And if you say "no" to me
Then I will fight you till I’m free

Say freedom, brotherhood
Justice, just say "yes"
Say freedom, brotherhood
Justice, just say "yes"

'Cause "no" is just a word
That people say when they can't cope
And if you say "no" to me
Then I will fight you till I’m free

Freedom, brotherhood
Justice, just say "yes"
Freedom, brotherhood
Justice, just say "yes"

'Cause "no" is just a word
That people say when they are lost
And if you say "no" to me
Then I will fight you till I'm free
Say freedom, brotherhood
Justice, just say "yes"
Freedom, brotherhood
Justice, just say "yes"

Say freedom, brotherhood
Justice, just say "yes" to me

[Verse 1]
Yes I do, I believe
One day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, these days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
Oh, but the feeling is much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side
Next to you, next to you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
Mmm

[Verse 2]
Reaching out to you
Oh, can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you like crazy, like crazy, like crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
Oh, but the feeling is much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side
Next to you, next to you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]

[Bridge]
Lay me down tonight
Lay me down tonight
Lay me down tonight
Lay me down tonight

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side
Next to you, next to you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
Can I lay by your side
Next to you, next to you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Verse 1]
Don't run away, come closer
I'll take you away from sadness
Let me lift you out of the darkness
Let me sooth your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
The shadow of your smile stays on my mind
And every song I hear, reminds me of you

[Chorus]
Every breath, every step, I'm closer to you
Every day (Every day), everything (Everything) reminds me of you
I can't forget you at all

[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid, come to me
I know that you've been hurt and you're scared
Let me fill your heart up with gladness
Let me take you there

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything you say stays in my heart
Everything I do, I'm thinking of you

[Chorus]
Every breath, every step, I'm closer to you
Every day (Every day), everything (Everything) reminds me of you
I can't forget you at all

[Bridge]
Love means letting go of fear
And I have nothing but love for you, my dear
I can't forget

[Chorus]
Every breath (Every breath), every step (Every step), I'm closer to you
Every day (Every day), everything (Everything) reminds me of you
Every breath (Every breath), every step (Every step), I'm closer to you
Every day (Every day), everything (Everything) reminds me of, of you
I can't forget you at all

[Outro]
I won't forget you at all

[Verse 1]
When I first saw your face
I knew that I could not hesitate
You said, "Baby don't go too fast
If we do, then it may not last"
Time went on and I waited for you
I didn't know what else I could do
I thought that we'd always be together
You said, "Hold on, it just gets better"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I believed you
I kept holding on
You think that I could never leave you
You think I'm not that strong, you know

[Chorus]
Love won't wait (Love won't wait)
Forever and a day (Love won't wait)
Love must live in the here and now
Don't ask me how I know (Love won't wait)

[Verse 2]
So here I am with my heart on my sleeve
You said, "Baby put your trust in me"
But I have come to the end of the line
And you have taken up all of my precious time
I need to be something special to you
Everybody's somebody's fool
Won't be a fool, no, you got me all wrong
You won't know what you had 'til it's gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I believed you
I kept holding on
You think that I could never leave you
You think I'm not that strong, you know

[Chorus]
Love won't wait (Love won't wait)
Forever and a day (Love won't wait)
Love must live in the here and now
Don't ask me how I know (Love won't wait)
Love takes time (Love takes time)
And you've been taking too long (Way too long)
And time never waited for anyone
Don't wait too long or I'll be gone (Love won't wait)

[Bridge]
There wasn't anything that I wouldn't do
You led me on, you even said, "I love you"
How can we go on when it's tearing us apart?
Are you going to break my heart?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I believed you
I kept holding on
You think that I could never leave you
You think I'm not that strong, you're wrong

[Chorus]
Love won't wait
Love won't wait, ooh
Love won't wait (Love won't wait)
Forever and a day (Love won't wait)
Love must live in the here and now
Don't ask me how I know (Love won't wait)
Love takes time (Love takes time)
And you've been taking too long (Way too long)
And time never waited for anyone
Don't wait too long or I'll be gone (Love won't wait)

[Outro]
How much longer can I wait for you?
Can I keep holding on?
I've got to be strong
Got to say good-bye (Love won't wait)
How much longer can I wait for you?
Hesitate for you, baby
I've got to be strong
Got to say good-bye
Good-bye
Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can’t help falling in love with you?

-(Oh, here's when it gets hard)
Like a- wait
Like a river flows
Like a river flows
-(I'm just gonna not play it)
Surely to the sea
My darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can’t help falling in love with you

[Verse 1]
Breathe the air again, it's a beautiful day
I wish this moment would stay with the Earth
Some primal paradise
But there you go again, saying everything ends
Saying you can't depend on anything, or anyone

[Chorus]
If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide
Or run for your life
Or stand here and spend it with me
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?

[Verse 2]
And we would live again
In the simplest of ways
Living day after day
Like some primal animals
We would love again
Under glorious suns
With the freedom that comes with the truth, mmm

[Chorus]
If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide?
Or run for your life?
Or stand here and spend it with me?
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?

[Bridge]
So it finally came to pass
I saw the end of the world
Saw the madness unfold like
Some primal burial
And I looked back upon
Armageddon
And the moment of truth
Between you and me

[Outro]
If we had five more minutes of air to breathe
And we cried all through it
But you spent them with me
On our last few drags of air we agreed
I was and you were happy

[Intro]
Yeah, I like it

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 1]
We've been through it all, though it could be worse
We've been moved around in a state of alert
There's nothing new or sharp about the cutting edge
If they build a wall, let's jump the fence, I'm over this

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cold stares can never put the fear in me
What we built here is godly
They can't gentrify the heart of kings
Let's just not talk about it
If I make a move, you're coming with me

[Chorus]
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
The people that you came with? Coming with me
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
The people that you came with? You're coming with me

[Post-Chorus]
Hey
(Okay now) Hey now
(Just don't stay down) Uh, can't stay now
(Let's go shake down) Until we get what we need, oh yeah
(Okay now) I'm okay now
(Just don't stay down) Yeah, can't hold me down
(Let's go shake down) And let it fall like the leaves, I wanna know

[Verse 2]
We couldn't stand to see our children shot dead in the streets
But when I finally took a knee
Them crackers took me out the league
Now I'm not much for games
But I play for keeps
And we salute King James for using his change
To create some equal opportunities

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cold stares can never put the fear in me
There's a movement we've been groovin' on
You can move or stay your ass asleep
Let's just not talk about it
Everything they tried to hide
We're taking back for yours and mine

[Chorus]
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
The people that you came with? Coming with me
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the neighbors? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
People that you came with? You're coming with me
What about the love
What about the seed? It's coming with me
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
People that you came with? You're coming with me

[Outro]
Okay now
Just don't stay down
Let's go shake down (Shake, shake, shake, shake)
Okay now
Just don't stay down
Let's go shake down (Shake, shake, shake, shake)

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I don't mind waitin’ if it don't take too long
I don't mind stayin’, baby, we drove your car
I don't mind pacin' outside, but, damn, it's cold
It's too cold, it's too cold

[Verse 2: Jazmine Sullivan]
Oh, damn, oh, friend
Too much fun in the AM
I forgot my keys and my clothes
Is your girl comin' home?
'Cause it’s cold now and I’m locked out (Locked out)
Oh, hell, too real
Waitin' outside in my good heels
I forgot my keys and my clothes
Is your girl comin’ home?
'Cause it's cold now and I'm locked out

[Verse 3: Anderson .Paak]
Say what I’m gon' do? What I'm 'posed to say?
You gon' get me killed, I'ma catch a fade
She'll be home soon, yeah, she'll be on the way
I just hit the 1, shit, I'm in the Palisades
You gon' have to pull up, uh, the fire escape, uh
Open up the window, get your little thangs
Get your little keys, get your little rings
Just free in the wind, though, before she see your face

[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Darlin', I have to be moved from afar
The truth is the only thing worth holdin' onto anymore (Anymore)
Untie me, let me loose from the cord
I'm so gone, so far, I deserve more (More, I deserve more)
Yeah

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I'm beggin' you (I beg)
I'm beggin' you, please, come home (Please)
No one even begs anymore (Come home)
I'm beggin' you (I beg)
I'm beggin' you, please, come home (Please)
No one even begs anymore (Come home)

[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Who should I rest blame upon
When all of the signs are brightly drawn
And point back to your open arms? (Point back to your open arms)
Back too soon, but I'm here for the last of support
No longer bound by a broken heart (Bound by a broken heart)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I'm beggin' you (I beg)
I'm beggin' you, please, come home (Please)
No one even begs anymore (Come home)
I'm beggin' you (I beg)
I'm beggin' you, please, come home (Please)
No one even begs anymore (Come home)

[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Somewhere in a plane over water
My love, my love
Home base, wifey turn it off before I touch down

[Verse 3: André 3000]
You're all I need, all of me on my knees
Normally harmony, bumblebee, hummingbird
I'm a nerd, study you
What are you, WWF?
We fightin', we might need counseling
Possibly moreso me
Sounds to me frowns'll be grounds to leave
Hounds'll be lookin' for you before you drop a tear, apres diem
Stop pretending that I ain't him
I ain't them, dim sum dumpling
I remember when you start dyeing them silver hairs
And start hiding from your age
I ask, "Why? How come?"
Amazin' how time can run away from us
I'm no nun, you're no priest, but I promise, hun, you gon' see
A phenomenon, come with me
Like it's Ramadan, I don't eat
Like it's Comic Con, I'm a freak for you (Yeah!)
I'm begging now, pretty please with cherries on top
Hairy wet twat
Harriet Tub-man, I don't give up
And if your gut tells you to strut, then strut
Then I'll hail you a car, but what man won't beg?
You know I'm nutmeg
I will show up on a lil' moped
With a lil' puppy, it'll be fluffy
You will un-toughen, we can discuss it
You know I'm sufferin', I do miss my friend
I don't like my fin bent up, Tilikum, well, that's ill-informed
Sweet stuff, Willa Wonk', we stuck, Billabong
'Least at minumum we gon' get along
Peace and inner calm, geez, it's been a long
T-I-M-E, um, please, I'm feelin' dumb
Please, I'm feelin' dumb
Please, I'm feelin' dumb

[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
How do you mend when you're worlds apart?
Ooh, carry on
Ooh, from the start
Somehow, we fell in love, then fell right out of touch
And ooh, that was hard
But ooh, here we are
And it’s easier to walk away
Than to look for what would make you stay
Remember when we first met?
We were havin' so much fun
So, now, how can we both forget
Tellin' each other, "We’re the one"?
We would make love (We would make love)
At the drop of a hat
Remember that? (Yeah)
I remember you and me (You and me)
Close as any two can be (Two can be)
Now we're strangers in the night (In the night)
Awkward and uptight

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Both]
Oh baby, do you wanna make it better?
Uh, ha, do you wanna stay together?
Hey, if you do, then let's please
Make some new memories

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
When you take somebody for your own
It can't survive on history alone
Yeah, meet me at the hotel, motel
Though we got a room at home
Go to a place that we don't know so well
It be nice, add a lil' spice
Try some new seduction (You and me)
Show each other how (Show each other how)
Uh, give each other new instructions
On what makes us feel good now
I just wanna make you feel good now
(Uh, feel good, don't it? C'mon)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak, Smokey Robinson,  & Both]
Do you wanna make it better? (Yeah)
(Just wanna make it right, c’mon)
Do you wanna stay together? (Uh)
(I meant when I said it)
And it’s easier to run away
Than to look for what would make you stay
Do you wanna make it better?
(Uh, feel good, don't it? C’mon)
Do you wanna stay together? (Yeah)
(Just wanna make it right, c'mon)
If you do, then let's please
Make some new memories
Do you wanna make it better?
(Uh, feel good, don't it? C’mon)
Do you wanna stay together? (Yeah)
If you do, then let's please (Just wanna make it right, c'mon)
Make some new memories
Do you wanna make it better?
(Uh, feel good, don't it? C'mon)
Do you want to stay together? (Yeah)
If you do, then let's please (Just wanna make it right, c'mon)
Make some new memories
Do you wanna make it better?
Do you wanna stay together?

[Part I]

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Huh, I see you reachin', baby, what are you reachin' for?
That don't look easy, baby, that must be so hard
I see you reachin', reachin' out, stretchin' out to God
That don't look easy, baby, that must be so hard

[Verse: Anderson .Paak]
Baby, I feel your pain
But to try and save you now is what I won't do, what I won't do
(Look out) Keep tryin'
(I'ma tell 'em, look out) I ain't tryna save you now
I feel your pain
But to try and save you now is what I won't do, what I won't do

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Huh, I see you reachin', baby, what are you reachin' for?
That don't look easy, baby, that must be so hard
I see you reachin', reachin' out, stretchin' out to God
That don't look easy, baby, that must be so hard

[Part II]

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I see you too much, baby, I need to (Take some space)
You kiss me too much, baby, forgot to (Wipe my face)
I treat you too much, baby, why don't you (Ever pay?)
I think you're too much, baby, I need to (Pump my brakes)
(I think I'm doin' way too much, I)
How can one thing mean so much to you and (So little to me?)
You stay here too much, baby, you know it's (Not your place)
You're sniffin' too much, baby, I had to (Hide my yay')

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I think I'm doin' way too much, I
Way too much, way too much, hey
How can one thing mean so much to you and (So little to me?)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Lalah Hathaway]
I think you're doin' way too much, settle down (Settle down)
Somebody needs to calm you down (Calm you down)
I think you're doin' way too much, settle down (Settle down)
Somebody needs to tell you
Hey, woah, woah (Uh, uh, ha, ha)
Settle down (Settle it down)
Woah, woah, woah, yeah
Nigga, sit yo' ass down (Sit yo' ass down somewhere)
Woah (Woah-woah)
Woah, settle down (Settle it down, settle it down)

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
I'm givin' this up baby, before I (Blow my brains)
I see you next lifetime, baby, what did (Badu say?)
You'll always be loved, baby, the one that (Got away)
Let's keep in touch, baby, I got your (Number saved)
Uh, I gotcha, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I think I'm doin' way too much, I
Way too much, way too much
How can one thing mean so much to you and (So little to me?)
(Don't mean much to me)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Lalah Hathaway]
I think you're doin' way too much, settle down
(Way too much, yeah)
Somebody needs to calm you down
(Somebody needs to calm you, ha)
I think you're doin' way too much, settle down
(I think you're way too much)
Somebody needs to tell you
(Somebody needs to, somebody needs to)
I think you're doin' way too much, settle down
(Way too, way too much, yeah)
Somebody needs to calm you down
(Slow it down, yeah)
I think you're doin' way too much, settle down
(Way too, way too much, much)
Somebody needs to tell you
(Ha, c'mon, oh, oh-woah)
Settle down (Settle it down)
(Somebody needs to tell you)
(Oh, oh-woah, huh)
Nigga, sit yo' ass down
(Sit yo' ass down somewhere, somewhere, oh-woah)
Oh-oh, settle it down (Settle it down)
Somebody needs to tell you (Oh, oh, yeah)
Settle it down (Slow it down)

[Outro: Lalah Hathaway]
Ooh
Sa-da-da, da-do-na-da-da-da-dow
Ba-bwa-da-bwa-bwa, bwa-bwa
So-do-da-do-da, la-ba-do-be-dwa-mm-day
So-bo-do-de-do-de-dwa-dmm-day, do-day
Oh, bwa-bwa-bwa

[Intro: Sonny LoSpecchio & Calogera Anello]
You're only allowed three great women in your lifetime
They come along like the great fighters, once every ten years
Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson, Joe Lewis
Sometimes you get 'em all at once
Me? I had my three when I was sixteen
That happens, what are you gonna do?
Maybe she's your first great one
Thanks a lot, Sonny
I think I'm gonna go for one

[Verse 1]
This is not some super conventional
Extra slick talk meant to convince you all
Master classes reduced to simple form
There's nothing formulaic about it
This, more that
Papa told you only open the door if he opens it first for you
Mama, sit down, help me get through
Is this how you felt on the day you found it?

[Chorus]
Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, oh, ooh
'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool
Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, oh, ooh
'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool

[Verse 2]
This is not some take you out for lunch
Wine and dine you and cha you on counter tops
Fill your mind with cotton candy hearts
What's the odds you stay a while?
This, more that
Get to know me, kiss me slowly, hard to focus
They just don't make 'em like this no more, whoa
But I think I've found it

[Chorus]
Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, oh, ooh
'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool
Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, oh, ooh
'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool

[Break]
Cha, cha-cha-cha
Bah-bah, bah-bah-bah-buh-bah
Bah-bah, bah-bah-bah-buh-bah
Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, ooh
Bah-bah, bah-bah-bah-buh-bah

[Bridge]
Somebody go (Somebody go)
Somebody go (Somebody go)
Somebody go get me
I'm 'bout to go (I'm 'bout to go)
I'm 'bout to go (I'm 'bout to go)
I'm 'bout to go in deep
That's not what I thought it was
But it's more than I bargained for
Somebody go (Somebody go)
Somebody go get me sober

[Verse 3]
Yeah
They gon' have to come for me
Came out my comfort zone to be amidst your company
Somethin' about the way you never gave it up to me
But let me know that I can get it  any day of the week
If talk is cheap, well then, I'm broke
With both hands on the sweeper, cleanin' up dirty secrets
Told you don't ever give me that gushy, but I didn't mean it
Bring her home and I'ma bust it out the residence
When I get the gushy, I go dumb like the President
Yes, lawd, I'm way up, word to Sacagawea
If the gushy was a sneaker, it'd be moccasin trainer
If the gushy wasn't so sweet, I could save it for later
But every time I fuck with someone else, I wish you was there
Kinda douchey I know, how the fuck I get here
I got hoes, I got hoes, we don't need to go there
On my way out a zone, somebody gon' give me body
Pick my feet off the floor, boy, I think I'm fallin'

[Chorus]
Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, oh, ooh
'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool
Beh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo
Oh, oh, ooh
'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool

[Intro]
Can't do it
Can't do it
Huh, and there it is, my wit's end
They brought me out my mind
You know I'm caught beside myself
Pissed off and shit outta luck
Hey, I've thought 'bout puttin' up
I don't have the time, oh, not today
(You know that's impossible)

[Chorus]
Does somebody got some shit to say?
You know what? Fuck it
Like yada yada
Oh, you know everythang (Can't do it)
But not today (Can't do it)
But not today

[Verse 1]
My one and only, closest homie, we've carried on for days
I wanna burn another one down, but I'll go off in a blaze
Yeah, I need to put it out
But I don't have the time, oh, not today
(You know that's impossible)
Does somebody got some shit to say?

[Verse 2]
Darker days were bound to come (It's what it seems)
Through eyes of Brenda's only son (All I could see)
When the dreams become reality (Could it be)
It's hard to keep a smile off the mug (Look at me)
Casually talkin' that global warmth
As if the temperature didn't blow out your perm
Our days are numbered, I'd rather count what I earned
My greatest summer was spent on festival runs in Europe
Chicken wings and sushi, I've gotten used to the perks
Narrowly escapin' the holy war on the turf
Turf, yes, Lord

[Verse 3]
Came a long way from them open mics at Leimert
Forgive me if I walk like I got a chip on my shoulder
Label tried to play me like I didn't do all the work
I found another way through the open gate and my purpose
Now I'm goin' crazy like (Right)
If they forget the dot, I'm chargin' double for the purchase
Lo and behold, my little one
I've been gone for far too long
If I ever take this life for granted, you showed me just how dumb
But the longer I stay, the less I'm paid (I don't have the time)
Oh, not today
(You know that's impossible)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Need me a lil' baby
Who gon' love me and touch me the right way
Need me a lil' baby
Who gon' run up and jump in the fight with me
Need me a lil' lady
Who gon' keep it buck like Milwaukee
Need me a lil' lady
Who gon' show off, gon' show off
Get right with me, right with me

[Post-Chorus: Sonyaè Elise]
You could be a chosen one
Kiss me with your native tongue
Shoot it if you holdin' some
Miss me 'til the mornin' come
Beat it like you're hittin' a drum
Freak me 'til the world is done
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Need me a lil' baby
Who gon' love me and touch me the right way
Need me a lil' baby
Who gon' run up and jump in the fight with me
Need me a lil' lady
Who gon' keep it buck like Milwaukee
Need me a lil' lady
Who gon' show off, gon' show off
Get right with me, right with me

[Post-Chorus: Sonyaè Elise]
You could be a chosen one
Fuck these niggas, all of them
Shoot it if you holdin' some
Kiss me 'til you make me cum
Beat it like you're hittin' a drum
Freak me 'til the world is done
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse: Anderson .Paak]
Uh
Can't get enough, look at that
Make you walk, pistol grip on
From the kitchen to the livin' room
To label me as the one, debatable
But second to none, that suit me like a tailored suit
And a nigga up, up like Sailor Moon
Brought a totally different energy up in the room
Heard your fans want to keep you in the underground, cool
When I blow up, said I did it for MF DOOM
No cap, no cap
I keep it one hundred, blowin' hundreds at The Beverly
All facts, all facts
Go look for another and come back and say you'll never leave
Your neck, your back
I could bust it open, super soaker, make the pussy leak
I could break it down and put it back together properly
I know what you want and I know what you need

[Outro: Anderson .Paak & Sonyaè Elise, Sonyaè Elise]
We should be lovin' each other crazy
We shouldn't wait 'til the day our days are through
We should be more than each other's baby
We don't have to, but we have to
We don't have to do it, but we have to
We should be lovin' each other crazy (We should)
We shouldn't wait 'til the day our... are through
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
We should be more than each other's baby
We don't have to, but we have to
We don't have to do it, but we have to
We should be more than each other's baby
We don't have to, but we have to
We don't have to do it, but we have to
We should be lovin' each other crazy
We shouldn't wait 'til the day our days are through
We should be more than each other's baby
We don't have to, but we have to
We don't have to do it, but we have to

[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Yuh, yuh

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
She was a fan, but her friend didn't care
I like the ones who buy they own damn beers
If you wanna toast to the life that you live
Pour enough shots for the whole year
Jet black hair, baby, jet black hair
Matte black Jeep with the Rubicon grill
Ooh, it's been a while, baby, don't go there
Ooh, it's been a while, baby, come here

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Shaped like pear, baby, jet black hair
You bought the drinks and I paid no care
Hold a nigga down, don't go nowhere
Ooh, it's been a while, baby, come here

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Brandy]
We peakin'
Hands above us
Feels like someone lifted me
We peakin'
Arms like covers
Feels like someone sent for me

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Yuh, yuh
We goin' in there from the window sills
I don't mind if they watch, I don't care
Who gon' love you when your love ain't there?
Baby, that ass is just unfair
Jet black hair, baby, jet black hair
At least two grams in your blunt wrapped there
These two hands always land up on the small of your back
Should I ask if eyes can go there?

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You bought the drinks and I paid no care
Couple more shots, we can all get to bed
Yes, Lord, like you livin' on a prayer
Play too much, baby, come here

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Brandy]
We peakin'
Hands above us
Feels like someone lifted me
We peakin'
Arms like covers
Feels like someone sent for me (Sent for me, yeah)
We peakin'

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak & Brandy]
If this is the mood, then you should know
I have to be honest, I love it
We peakin'
If this is the mood, then you should know
I have to be honest, I love it
We peakin'

[Verse 3: Anderson .Paak & Brandy]
And the coldest part is I'm not even there
I watch your feed, but I don't feed into that
Just give me the news
I miss all the parties, but I'm still the best dressed, clean
As the curtain on him pulls back

[Chorus: Brandy & Anderson .Paak, Anderson .Paak]
Hands above us
Feels like someone lifted me
Arms like covers
Feels like someone sent for me
We peakin'
Han
