me for the show

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac diggin' on a well
Mama come quick with the water witch spell
Cool clear water well you can't ever tell

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Abraham and Isaac diggin' on a well
Mama come quick with the water witch spell
Cool clear water well you can't ever tell

[Verse 1]
Went to see the captain, strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 2]
Saw your first ship sink and drown
From rocking of the boat
And all that could not sink or swim
Was just left there to float
I won't leave you drifting down, but whoa, it makes me wild
Thirty years upon my head
To have you call me child

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 3]
The bottles stand as empty
As they were filled before
Time there was and plenty
But from that cup no more
Though I could not caution all
I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Outro]
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Prelude]

[Instrumental]

[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
Winter rain, now tell me why
Summers fade, and roses die
The answer came
The wind and rain

[Verse 2]
Golden hills, now veiled in gray
Summer leaves have blown away
And what remains?
The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The loving in her eyes

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Circle songs and sands of time
And summers will end in tumbled rhyme
And little change
The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The loving in her eyes

[Outro]
Winter gray and falling rain
We'll see summer come again
Darkness falls and seasons change
(Gonna happen every time)
The same old friends, the wind and rain
(But we'll see summer by and by)
Winter gray and falling rain
(Seasons change and roses die)
We'll see summer come again
(Don't they know, gonna happen every time)
Darkness falls and seasons change
(Seasons change and roses die)
The same old friends the wind and rain
(Like a song that's born to soar the sky)

[Part 2: Let It Grow]

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds
Silver beads, pass into the sea

She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
And she's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Refrain]
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Refrain]
Let it grow, greatly grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Round and round...
So it goes...
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
He's blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine

[Verse 3]
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet someday
The good Lord willing, if He says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 4]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him
I said to him, "I'm sure she has been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Verse 5]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 2]
Come down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, combing back your yellow hair
Prettiest lady in the area-O

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will marry you me? I will set your city free
And free all the peoplе in the area-O

[Verse 4]
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you, sweet William-O
Well, I would marry you but your guinеas are too few
And I fear my mama would be angry-O

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
What would your mother think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mother think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mother think if she heard my guineas clink?
Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers-O

[Verse 5]
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, all your cities I will burn
Destroy all the people in the area-O

[Outro]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Instrumental]

We're having technical difficulties, as you might have assumed. We'll be with you in a minute

[Intro]
One, two, one two, three, four

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
And sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She's lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
You're sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, no, no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Hey, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Get back

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Goin' where the water tastes like wine
Goin' where the water tastes like wine
Goin' where the water tastes like wine
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Goin' where the climate suits my clothes
Goin' wherе the climate suits my clothes
Goin' whеre the climate suits my clothes
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
I'm goin' down the road feeling bad
I'm goin' down the road feeling bad
I'm goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
I'm goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, oh
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Woo, Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keep rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the place is gonna fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hеy, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Woo, Saturday night

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I turn on Channel 6, thе President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues"
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, break out your rocking shoes"

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, woo, Saturday Night now
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Hey, Saturday night now

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought He'd call it Planet Earth
Worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it come
When the rock and roll music meet the rising shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday Night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now
Hey, Saturday night now
Hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Everybody get right now (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night now, hey
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night
AH (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday night, one more Saturday night, hey, hey
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
AH (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, hey (OH)

We love you

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
Ain't no luck, I learned to duck

[Verse 2]
Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 3]
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hands that shook the hand
Of P.T. Barnum, and Charlie Chan
Shine your shoes, light the fuse
Can you use them old U.S. Blues
I'll drink your health, share your wealth
Run your life, steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Back to back, chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song them old United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Outro]
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
(My, my, my, my, my, oh, my, oh, my)
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

Thanks a lot. Good night, everybody, we'll see y'all later

[Verse 1]
You're the one
Best friend of mine
The one I need and stay a while
We can sit and talk for hours and make it home for dinner time
We would write the names of those we fancied from our favorite shows
Now I see you pulled from my side whenever you used to stay

[Chorus]
This is not a breakup, but I fear as though I'm reading it
When I’m warmly of this feeling, but I fear that I’m not coming along
We would walk to school sometimes
You'd hold my hand
Now I don't think I understand
How you can barely even pick up the phone
But I still think of you
Beside me as I'm crying
But I don't really know why
I just know I don't wanna be on my own
I'll have to find another friend
I can call mine so I'll treat you as if you've died
Because I know now you just strung me along

[Post-Chorus]
I'm just across the road
I posted you a note
I wanted you to read
It's asking you to meet
You tell me that you can’t
I want a second chance
You mean a lot to me
Just hug me when you're free

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Benny The Butcher]
What it do, Loc? Yeah (Yeah)
We up in this motherfucker
On some murder murder, kill kill shit (Uh)
Yeah, (The Butcher comin', nigga)
Some real hip-hop shit

[Verse 1: Benny The Butcher]
Yo, murder music, just for this type of shit they could ban us
'Cause this what they gon' play when they wipe they prints off they hammers
I'm really like that, I ain't just write this shit for the camera
I did in my city what Michael Vick did in Atlanta (Yeah)
Cash saved for insurance, them bad days wasn't for us (Nah)
Still hood, roach clips and the ashtrays on my foreign (Haha)
In L.A., R&B bitch drunk with her hands around me
The night Swizz introduced me to Nas at a Grammy party (Uh-huh)
When my shrimp introducеd me to hard, I had grams around me (No)
A star player nеver asks for the ball, they just playin' around me
Niggas heard I took a shot, they was askin' if I was good
I looked the shooter right in his eyes when that trigger got pulled
Huh

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Jadakiss]
Murder music, mur-murder music
Murder music, murder music (Yeah)
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music (Ha-ha)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah, some come through the water (Uh-huh)
Some come through the border (Uh)
Some of them get caught, but that's dependin' on the porter (Yup)
Old niggas hidin', young niggas slidin' (Ughn)
I'm bein' a man just protectin' and providin'
My only concern is if it cooked right (That's it)
My chain yellow, way the diamonds set up, it make it look white (Ooh)
Kill you for nothin' 'cause they petty (Uh)
Cut into dog food with the fetti (Yup)
They young but they ready (They ready)
No crowd, I get my applause off the beat
I'm a boss so I make sure all of us eat (All of us)
Say, a couple funerals'll bring a war to a cease (Woo)
And remember, it ain't no reward for the streets
This is not normal (Nah) dickey suit is how we dress formal (Yeah)
The way I'm ridin' these tracks like a porno (Woo)
Aight then, what's up then? (What's up?) I'm bustin'
Every control substance I touched it, I know it's disgustin' (Agh)
I'm just stackin', call me El Guapo (Uh-huh)
And I bet you never had a brick from El Chapo (Never)
Tuesday, I just play the crib and make tacos (Woo)
A lot of niggas frontin' like they nice, but they not though
Y'all spoke that up, now soak that up (Soak that up)
They done pulled my coat, nigga, the GOAT got up, what's up?

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Busta Rhymes]
Murder music, mur-murder music
Murder music, murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music

Murder music, (Yo) mur-murder music

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I only got time to murder shit
I bang 'em while deafening both ears (Uh-huh)
When I'm makin' niggas black
And rip couches and throw chairs (Uh-huh)
At times I be unleashin' the wrath that most fear (Uh-huh)
I don't discriminate, I even body close peers
See I'm suggestin' most you niggas should get to steppin' to the rear (Uh-huh)
And fuck what most you niggas'll talk, I don't care (Uh-uh)
If you don't rep it right, you shouldn't come around here (Oh no)
Adjust one level up, make sure a nigga sound clear
They wanna stop, and wanna stare (They do)
They hate that I'm the best and it's greatness in the flesh and it's pointless to compare (Uh-huh)
You need to scribe this jewelry I write to save this shit on a server (Uh-huh)
And type the way that I speak for movin' space on a cursor
I'm not an advocate for violence, but push me, I'ma push you further
The script, hand on my hips, squeezin' the grip a little firmer (Huh)
These dumb niggas don't realize that it's better to be a learner
(Stupid ni-)
But when you don't is when you get the feelin' of burner
Shut the fuck up, it's better to be watchers, listeners, and observers
'Cause if you not, you'll fuck around, that's how niggas like you get murdered

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Murder music, mur-murder music
Murder music, murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music

[Outro]
Murder was the case, the-the, the case
The case was murder
FRANK SINATRA
Hi there, and Merry Christmas. From FS for CS; Frank Sinatra for Christmas Seals.
We got a song here about mistletoe and holly, too might important fixin's come Christmas time, but it takes other things too, like Christmas Seals, to make our Christmas' truly merry.
Because Christmas Seals fight tuberculosis, Christmas Seals help keep each of us off the sick list of TB and on the gift list of good health.
So for jolly Christmas, Christmas Seals, and mistletoe and holly.

[Verse 1]
I can't carry the weight around, baby
How could I have ever belonged?
Learnin' all my lessons, dangerous impressions
Pushed you right out of my world
I know that you and I have tried very hard to find a different result
But how can we be patient when we're always racin'
And no one's ever there to hold

[Chorus]
Forever love
Oh forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love
Forever love
Oh, it's forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love, forever love

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Impossible, impossible
It's possible, anything's possible

[Verse 2]
So come on over, baby, start the healin'
Let me get a good look at you
'Cause I miss our discussion, whisperin' and blushin'
Secrets that only we know
And if you ever need a friend, baby
I can be the one that you want
And if you’re ever down and out, baby
I will be the one that you want
You can lean on me anytime, baby
For anything you want and need
Oh, I don't need a reason
Memory or a season
Every day I will believe

[Chorus]
Forever love
Oh, it's forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love, forever love

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Forever love
Oh, forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love
Forever love
Oh, it's forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love, forever love

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Impossible, impossible
It's possible, anything's possible

[Intro]
A day without a rhyme
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Without a strong rhyme to step to

[Verse 1]
Step into my world, let the lyrics lead the way
It's a place of escape that deviates from the everyday (Uh)
A resort of a sort, it's for your mind though
So you relax them acts, and me, I let the rhyme flow (Uh)
So you can follow it, chew it before you swallow it
The lyric is a delicate thing, you shouldn't holler it
And yell it (Uh), it's 

[?], give your lyrics your all
But remember one thing, a weak rhyme could be your downfall (Uh) Take it from me (Uh, uh, uh) 'cause I'm a hip hop authority
Poetry redemption is our number one priority (Uh)
A day without a rhyme is like a day without sunshine
How can you unwind without a funky drum line? (Uh)
I can't see it, let the Ken Wood kick
Why? 'Cause rhyming is my game, and the mic is like a joystick (Uh)
I never lose, my lyrics sting like a hornet
I get ready for help, this for the town before the storm hits (Uh)

[Bridge]
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Without a strong rhyme to step to

[Verse 2]
Perform is eternal, and in my lifetime
I hope I never have to see a day without a rhyme
Legendary, the lyrical olympian
Merciless and cruel, I rule 'cause I'm the champion
Defending my position like a heavyweight fighter
A dope rap writer, deadly as a poisonous spider
Yeah, no comparison, the women seem mysterious
My lyrics work as servants, leaving listeners delirious
Under my hypnosis on the edge of their seat
It's like a science fiction movie, with groovy hip hop beats
So just relax and you'll enjoy the double feature
Let my vocals take control of your soul, then let the rolling reach you (Uh)
You can't ignore the dance floor anymore
The rhymes are mind blowing for the fancy and the hardcore
Hip hop lovers who pump it as a past-time
The furthest sent from their mind, a day without a rhyme

[Chorus]
A day without a rhyme
Without a strong rhyme to step to
A day without a rhyme
Without a strong rhyme to step to

[Verse 3]
Floating atop a growing sea of MC's
Liquidating sucker rappers like a fatal disease
That's right, I flick lives like boogers from my fingers
My assassin has my back, smoking dope just like a gunslinger
I'm just a merciless dog, you know the time (Huh)
I'd rather die than go a day without a rhyme
You see, a lyric is a poet's personal emotion
A pocket full of holes, he throws a deep devotion
(?) is stretching, keeps the roof constantly running
My craftiness and cunning makes the floor 

[?] so stunning
It's as dumb as it can be, there's not an MC who can hang with me
They like to battle but they never wanna bang with me
'Cause I'm a real, dirty and dogmatic 

[?]
In fact I'm just a dope rhyme fanatic
I like to rock the party every time I get a chance to
But on a day without a rhyme what would you dance to?
(?) but no, it's nothing like this
The drums are death, and my DJ has a crisp twist
Larger than life, dear mayor of the new school
Flushing rappers out like a motherfucking whirlpool
Bloodthirsty, a witch and a boy, yeah
The MC destroy your boy, what can I do for you?
You don't want me, you'll never survive
You'll be eaten alive the very second you are mine
So do yourself a favour, save your breath
And take a step to me and you'll step into the arms of death
And quite frankly, that will be a real slither
I rarely use the (?), is it time to feel the flipper, boy?
This '89, my rhymes are clicking like clockwork
I need a Grammy, so I'm a piece of chalk work
(?) entertaining you, I kick fiction
But don't be alarmed if you hear a contradiction, that
Who's to say what the future might bring?
By the grace of Allah, I'll just continue doing my thing
Creeping the math, and then that constant movement
But do say lyrics that can stand no improvement, so
Yo, if you were sleeping, or napping, or waking
You know who you are, I guess you're just breathtaking
I write the rhyme to strike you like a lightning bolt
With every finishing stroke, another rap is smoke
So I'm the 'Deej' this year, the microphone musketeer
This is the year of the merciless Ameer (Word!)
(?), there's no lying in my dialogue
'Cause when I go out, I'm going like a raw dog
Well this was fun, I hate to break but I gotta run
My homie's landing on my box with the 911
See you next time, but in the meantime
Try not to go even a single day without a rhyme

[Outro]
W-Without a strong rhyme to step to
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Without a strong rhyme to step to
W-Without a strong rhyme to step to
A day without a rhyme
Yeah, dog, that was dope

[Verse 1]
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that cannot be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

[Bridge]
(Love, love, love)
(Love, love, love)

[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

[Verse 2]
There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy

[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
All you need is love (All together now)
All you need is love (Everybody)
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

[Outro]
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Oh, love is (Love is all you need)
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Oh, love is (Love is all you need)
(Verse 1)
Niggas is scared to fuck with the Dog cause I'm shady
You remember that kid from runnin up and down from Buildin 80?
The highs are Extreme and the lows are suicidal
Got me reachin for the Bible cause I, think I'm genocidal
Faggots think I'm bluffin but I'm not
They Say that I be buggin cause I be makin it hot
Knowin all I got is my, nuts and my word
Though I'm never seen, the Dark is always heard
I speak for those who speak with Glocks through frequent blocks
Where the objective is to put in twelve, stay alive and leavе with knots
From little rocks bein sold
Then mothеrfucker, if you LIVE to see 40 then you old
And me bein the way I am, got the Devil close to me
And That's the reason why I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I chose to be, on some Dark shit
Rip apart shit and start shit until whenever I depart bitch
That hard shit, will get yo' ass stretched 
Laid the fuck out
I'm on the edge, Life is played out
I made out, kinda good with my last couple of runs
Up the, coast with a couple of keys, couple of guns
Funds wasn't the issue, it was other shit
That had me on some flippin on my brother shit, stealin from my mother shit
Cry'd by myself, and couldn't hide from myself
And if I pushed my wig then Id died by myself

[Chorus 2X: DMX - singing]
Deeper and deeper
With every move I make I'm fallin
Deeper and deeper
These souls from underground keep callin

(Verse 2)
Why is it that I do what I do?
Why is it that only to these streets can I be true?
I ain't never been shit, my peoples been told me so
Hold me yo; these niggas don't know me yo!
Cause they ain't out that mob that's out to get niggas
Rip niggas, hit niggas when you split niggas
Long as there's bodies to be caught, there's shotties to be bought
Hotties that transport, fake Gotti's to extort
I cry for help but niggas don't, hear me (AHHHH!)
Niggas don't understand me! That's why niggas fear me
Hit the old neighborhood cause I'm bout to end it
Stressin shit that I went through and what I BEEN did
Niggas I offended, will have to take it as a loss
Cause in a minute, what I'm thinkin is about to look like sauce
Gots to pay the cost and this time it's gon' cost me my life
One love to my shorty and my wife
Step to the ledge - would I, could I, should I?
Dont Really understand what im seein with my good eye
The hood I, came up in showed no mercy
Unforgiven is the many plagues that cursed me
The worst we went through would make the average man crumble
Learnin to walk, and it hurts when you stumble
Figure out the jungle and you live, if not you die
On my knees, hands up to the sky, why

[Chorus 2X: DMX - singing]
Deeper and deeper
With every move I make I'm fallin
Deeper and deeper
These souls from underground keep callin

(DMX)
It gets Deep, Deeper and Deeper
Niggas in the sleeper
It gets dark baby
The final muthafuckin call
Niggas dont even know
The Final Muthafuckin Call

(Verse 3)
What must I go through to show you shit is real?
And I ain't really never gave a fuck how niggas feel
I Rob and I steal, not 'cause I want to, 'cause I have to
And don't make me show you what the MAC do
If you don't know by now, then you slippin'
I'm on some bullshit that's got me jackin' niggas flippin'
I Let my man and them stay pretty, but I'ma stay shitty
Cruddy, it's all for the money, is you with me?
Get the bitches and I'll commit the crime
When it's on, we transform like Optimus Prime
I'll form the head, roll out, let's make it happen
If we ain't gonna get it with this, we'll take your cap
Bustin' off, dustin' off the softest niggas
Money with the biggest mouth, yo, let's off this nigga
Up north, this nigga never made a sound
Breathe too fuckin' hard and you're gettin' bust down

[Chorus 2X: DMX - singing]
Deeper and deeper
With every move I make I'm fallin
Deeper and deeper
These souls from underground keep callin
(DMX)
Final Call Baby
Yeah

Only Real Niggas Gon Be Able to Understand What Im Sayin
Ya know what i mean Baby

Lyrics from the snippet (via Instagram)

[Verse 1]
Get down like get around
I'm the shit, legit, big wig in this town
Sit down or get clowned
Big leaps and big bounds
Big verbs and big nouns
Boss moves in my crip walk shoes
I bet on my own niggas and I did not lose
Fuckin' niggas up with this Rick Rock groove
Tick, tock, make your body rock, we meet up at the Marriott
Niggas deep while you niggas sleep
Outside pockets full of heat, bitches in the back sleep
Niggas don't like it, but niggas peep
I make the rules and break 'em if I want to

[Verse 2]
Dragged up, I done hit the switch, let it work out
Old block full of old schools
Thick bitches, they gon' chew
The Dogg's making bread with my niggas at Def Jam
And ain't nobody fuckin' with the Legion Of Boom
I don't play around, master plan
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
When I said I'd like to smash every tooth
In your head
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
When I said by rights you should be
Bludgeoned in your bed
And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her walkman started to melt
Bigmouth
Bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
To the Human race
Bigmouth
Bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
To the Human race
Bigmouth
Bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
To the Human race
Bigmouth
Bigmouth
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
To the Human race...

[Chorus: Windser]
Next year's gonna be better than this year
Next year's gonna be better than this 'cause
New Year's Eve comin' with a fresh kiss, yeah
Next year's gonna be better than this year
Next year's gonna be better than this year
Next year's gonna be better than this 'cause
New Year's Eve comin' with a fresh kiss, yeah
Next year's gonna be better than this

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Next year's my come up
I've been lackin' but I can feel that it's the one
All the last three-sixty-five-one sucked
Like God group texted the world and dumped us
Bah, bah, bah, you better watch my bounce back
I'ma be the man in here
Glass to the sky, like we tryna grab the chandelier
I'd like to take this opportunity and toast to me
For bein' exactly who I'm supposed to be
'Cause life is gonna do what life does
I don't wanna look back and regret who I was
Let go of the expectations and then fire one
Forget the tally sheet before all my time's up
And I, know I gotta roll with it
I'm well aware the universe doesn't owe me shit
I know that, all of this pain means the growth, I think
That next year's gonna be better than this (Let's go)

[Pre-Chorus: Windser & Macklemore]
I'm still an optimist, yeah, I
Got a lot to live on time
Ain't foolin' that shit 'cause next year's gonna be better than, better than (Go)

[Chorus: Windser & Macklemore]
Next year's gonna be better than this year (Woo)
Next year's gonna be better than this 'cause
New Year's Eve comin' with a fresh kiss, yeah
Next year's gonna be better than this

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I'm sick of missin' out, sick of the fear and doubt
I'ma get spiritual soon, live in the here and now
Alone in my room, but you gon' hear me loud
And clear, let's start it at the top of the year
I want, one last cigarette, one last sip of it
One last secret, one last little bit
One last upper, one last sedative
One last supper with the devil and his relatives
And I was gonna change my ways
I was just waitin' for that day to pull myself up out of that page
Run that route and make a play, so sick of sittin' on the bench
It's finally to get in shape and livin' like a scrimmage
Thinkin' that I'll get another day now, no
I ain't wait up for coach marchin' band
I'ma go and parade in my zone, goddamn
Man in the mirror finally got on, fuckin' next year
The time is now to press go and I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus: Windser & Macklemore]
I'm still an optimist, yeah, I (Uh-huh)
Got a lot to live on time (Yes)
Ain't foolin' that shit 'cause next year's gonna be better than, better than (Go)

[Chorus: Windser & Macklemore]
Next year's gonna be better than this year (Woo)
Next year's gonna be better than this 'cause
New Year's Eve comin' with a fresh kiss, yeah
Next year's gonna be better than this
Next year's gonna be better than this year (Woo)
Next year's gonna be better than this 'cause
New Year's Eve comin' with a fresh kiss, yeah
Next year's gonna be better than this
Let's go

[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
My lyrics is crazy
They must be crazy
My lyrics is crazy

[Verse 1]
Kris is the Pharaoh, with bow and a arrow
We double the barrel gorilla apparel
The mightiest pharaoh don't think of a battle
My lyrics is comin' so crazy
Spittin' immaculate the actual factual front to the back of you
Clappin' and crackin' you hackin' the mac for you
Look at them laugh at you
Lyrics is coming so crazy
Spittin' with me now you see what I am teaching
Your mind I am reaching with all that I'm teaching
That love and that peace and it never will weaken the truth I am speaking is crazy
Truth I am speaking get used to repeating
The youth I am reaching
With proof of this teachin' I speak for a reason
So they can beliеve in the truth of MCin' it's crazy
Crackin' the back of thеse rappers
I'm passin' these actors, I'm faster
Spittin' metal natural rippin' clubs forever
We be coming better, spreading love forever, crazy
You hearing a pro, I'm spittin' the flow that you know
Higher level thinking I come to show
Knowledge of self is a thing you must know
You see what they playing, they steady betraying
The culture we making, exploiting and taking
Look at them faking what we are creating
Now you mistakin' what's real and what's fakin'
This thing they do for the money they making
They sell out their people, their culture, their nation
Sell out their soul for a radio station
So they could be playing in heavy rotation
You see what I'm saying, our culture they taking
But that's not enough, it's our spirit they breaking
And only the culture can see what I'm saying
'Cause only the culture will see them betraying
You see what they playing, you see what they saying
And you can not see us, our people they slaying
Well, maybe you do, and then maybe you don't
And then maybe you will and then maybe you won't
But it's our community, that's who's at hope of
The greed and the crime and the police are chokin'
The TV is playin' that okely-doke while our people are dyin'
You seein' them choke with that cheatin' and lyin'
They tellin' our people, now this is they hope
But did anything change with the last vote?
The time before that did we pass something?
All we've been getting is Chapter 11
While racists with weapons are shooting our reverends
A message from Heaven with all that you getting
Get understanding, overstanding this lesson
With all of the blingin' and cash that you getting
You stumble for sure it's the poor you neglecting
The thieves and the liars they all in your section
I'm bringing my people in different directions

[Chorus]
Crazy
My lyrics is crazy
I'm coming so crazy
Ha, they must be crazy

[Verse 2]
Yo
So here goes another my sisters and brothers
It's obvious KRS ain't like these others
I've been out the bed while they under the covers
I spit off the head while they babble and stutter
Not three and not two but the one is my number
I'm spitting my written I tour every summer
With every year I get younger and younger
But some want to doubt and continue to wonder, is crazy
They continue to blunder, is crazy
They continue to slumber
What I'm teaching is what I'm expressing
I'm teaching the streets that the mind is a weapon
Like anything you can perceive in perception
It's what you will manifest all in your section, it's crazy
Set up your own direction, crazy
Don't get caught up on complexion, crazy
This is that reason I'm spitting and books getting written
'Cause you be forgetting, it's crazy

[Chorus]
Crazy
My lyrics is crazy
I'm coming so crazy

[Chorus]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Verse 1]
Nobody ever loved me like she does
Oh, she does
Yeah, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Oh, she do me
Yes, she does

[Chorus]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Bridge]
I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that has no past (Seeking past)

[Chorus]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Verse 2]
And from the first time that she really done me
Oh, she done me
She done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Oh, she done me
She done me good

[Chorus]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Outro]
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me let down
Can you dig it? Don't let me down

[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a small boy
No one else compared to you, no way
I always thought heroes stayed close
Whenever troubled times arose
I didn't know
Ain't always how it goes

[Verse 2]
Every single word you told me
I believed without question, always
To save all of us, you told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself

[Chorus]
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?

[Verse 3]
And you could store an ocean in the holes in any of the explanations that you gave
And while you still had time, you had a chance
But you decided to take all your sorrys to the grave

[Chorus]
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?
Did you hope I'd never doubt?
Never one day work it out?

[Part II]

[Intro]
You were runnin' for cover
Doin' like any other
Fallin' out with a lover
You didn't know that I suffered
What a thing to discover
If there was time to recover
One on one with each other
Just a boy and a father, what I'd give for another

[Verse 1]
Everything that I have, wouldn't need this for long
Never speak of the time, that you left us alone
Me and Steve on our own

[Chorus]
I wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play all my songs
Know the words? Sing along

[Verse 2]
(This time) Wanna tell you 'bout the time
I was in Abbey Road
Or the time that I had Mick Jagger on the phone
I thought of you when he spoke

[Chorus]
I wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play all my songs
Hear your voice, sing along

[Verse 3]
(This time) I wanna say "its alright"
You're just a man after all
And I know you had demons
I got some of my own, I think you passed them along

[Chorus]
I wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play all my songs
Hear your voice, sing along

[Intro]
It's VB!

[Verse 1]
Are you too high? why can't you pick up the phone?
This tactic doesn't work 'cause I see you dancing on your own
I've missed the fact that you're throwing panties on the bed
I'm steady dreaming of times I'd rather be instead

[Chorus]
I tried to give you space so I wasn't controlling you
Gave you all the reasons why I don't smell like I used to
Tell me all your lies and I'll act surprised
Even try and make myself look in your eyes but
Bet you probably told on your friends for what they think of me
So then you can call me and talk all of thе stress
I don't think you realize thе way I'll despise you
Give me a good reason, maybe I'll surprise you

[Verse 2]
And my resilience to not come different there before
How we shared everything and more
I was safe, we were rised into Bath but despite, we were fighting all night
Cruisin' city tape but our right
Voice so loud, I missed the red light
Mental warfare with you can't compare
To right there with my friends, drop you right there instead

[Chorus]
I tried to give you space so I wasn't controlling you
Gave you all the reasons why I don't smell like I used to
Tell me all your lies and I'll act surprised
Even try and make myself look in your eyes but
Bet you probably told on your friends for what they think of me
So then you can call me and talk all of the stress
I don't think you realize the way I'll despise you
Give me a good reason, maybe I'll surprise you

[Verse 1]
Pull the plug in September
I don't wanna die in June
I’d like to start planning my funeral
I've got work to do
Pull the plug, make it painless
I don't want a violent end
Don’t say that you'll always love me
'Cause you know I'd bleed myself dry for you
Over and over again

[Chorus]
Doomsday is close at hand
I'll book the marching band to play as you speak
I'll feel like throwin' up
You'll sit and stare like a goddamn machine
I’d like to plan out my part in this
But you’re such a narcissist
You'll probably do it next week
I don’t get a choice in the matter
Why would I? It's only the death of me
Only the death of me

[Verse 2]
Pull the plug, but be carеful
I don't wanna die too soon
I think there's good in you somеwhere
I’ll hang on 'til the chaos is through

[Chorus]
Doomsday is close at hand
I'll book the marching band to play as you speak
I'll feel like throwin' up
You'll sit and stare like a goddamn machine
I'd like to plan out my part in this
But you're such a narcissist
You'll probably do it next week
I don't get a choice in the matter
Why would I? It's only the death of me

[Bridge]
It was so quiet
No friends and family allowed
Only my murderer, you, and the priest who told you to go to Hell
And the funny thing is I would've married you
If you'd have stuck around
I feel more free than I have in years
Six feet in the ground

[Chorus]
Doomsday is close at hand
I booked the marching band
To play as you speak
I feel like throwin' up
You sit and stare like a goddamn machine
I'd have liked to plan out my part in this
But you're such a narcissist
That you did it on Halloween
I had no choice in the matter
Why would I? It's only the death of me

[Verse 1]
Lying awake in a dreaming state
Riding on a holiday ride
Getting sidetracked, turn on my back
Heavy with the gravity glide
And I'm nobody's boy
Just your wet clothes hanging on the line

[Verse 2]
Red tail, look at her sail
Going for the money on the moon
She goes high up, her beak is stuck
La-da-da-da listen to her tune
Now she's nobody's bird
Just a red grape hanging on the vine

[Verse 3]
Cactus, practice
Everyday awake at 5:03
Greeting the hot sun of a gun
Condo in a succulent city
Wearing nobody's pants
Just a sharp suit busy with the ants

[whistling]

[Verse 4]
The white snow, look at her flow
Riding on the wind to meet thе roof
It's a long way from heaven to hay
Falling on the hill to makе a poof
And on everybody's mind
Is wrapped a blanket of another kind

[Verse 5]
Time, time, where's the time?
Have another glass of purple tea
If it's okay, I'd like to stay
Even though you recently met me
Hell, I'm not even here
I'm just a bubble floating in your beer (fear)

[whistling]

[Verse 1]
'Til I'm brave enough to call you
I just fall through every time
I wish I'd waved when I saw you
Just watch you passing by

[Chorus]
So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined

[Verse 2]
And you gave me no answers
And you asked me no lies
You just gave me an amethyst
From your jewel glass as you cried

[Chorus]
So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined
So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined

[Verse 3]
And we shared in the basement
As the fern bent to the window
And we drew to lightning
As the water soaked the pillow

[Chorus]
So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined
So much coming through, every hour too
Can't get enough of you
You come around, I'm ruined
You come around, I'm ruined

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
If you wanna roll me
Then you gotta roll me all night long
And if you wanna use me
Then you gotta use me 'til I'm gone

[Chorus]
I'm not a fallen angel, I just fell behind
I'm out of luck and I'm out of time
If you don't wanna love me, let me go, oh
I'm runnin' for the last train
I'm runnin' for the last train home

[Verse 2]
If you wanna know me
Then you gotta know me through and through
(Da, doo-doo, doo, da, doo-doo
Da, doo-doo, doo-doo)
And if you're gonna hurt me
Then you gotta hold me next, next to you

[Chorus]
No matter how you work it, things go wrong
I put my heart where it don't belong
So if you're comin' with me, yeah, let me know, oh
Maybe you're the last train
Maybe you're the last train home

[Post-Chorus]
I'm on the last train runnin'
I'm on the last train runnin'
And I surrender, and I surrender
I'm on the last train runnin'
I'm on the last train runnin'
And I surrender, and I surrender

Lyrics from Listening Party

[Intro: Donda West]
Two lessons that he passed along to his children
The first is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family
The second was that, no matter what, you love unconditionally
It is that kind of love that made my father the kind of father and the kind of man he is
He vowed that he would never walk away from his family, and he never has
So what is enough?
To my way of thinking it's only enough for each one of us to become champions in our own right

[Verse: Kanye West & Donda West]
I know you wanted me to bring
I know I wish I could be
I could never fall in love
Hell nah, nah, don't fall in love
Don't lеt them abandon me
And not the dеmandin' me
How could I say to never leave?
That my, my, my family
My, my, my family, my family, I'm losing my family
I'm losing my family, losing my family
Bow down to another ring
I thought I'd never see
Oh, the Lord led to me
Writing on the wall
That thought was only
She's screaming at me
"Daddy, why did you leave?"
"Daddy, how could you leave?"
"Come back to mother and me"
"Come back tonight, daddy, please"
"Daddy, how could you leave?"
(Two lessons that he passed along to his children)
"Daddy, how could you leave?"
(The first is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family)
We all know I won't leave
(The second, is that no matter what, you never abandon your family)
My family, that's all me
(Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family)
I wish I never screamed
(Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family)
Alcohol is so mean
(Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family)
These things, these things, these things
(Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family, is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family)
These things, these things
(Is that, no matter what, you never abandon your family)
Things that I never mean (It is that kind of love)
Come love me
(That made my father the kind of father and the kind of man he is)
And love me
(He vowed that he would never walk away from his family, and he never has)

[Verse 1: 2D]
On the cloud of unknowing
My world seems open
Every satellite up here is watching
But I was here from the very start
Trying to find a way to your heart

[Verse 2: 2D]
All the days of forgetting
They've gone out with the tide
Lost at sea somewhere, waiting
Like setting suns at the rodeo
Trying to find someone you'll never know

[Verse 3: 2D]
Oh, the sinking love
On the cloud of unknowing
Every satellite up here is waiting
Waiting to see what the morning brings
May bring sunshine on its wings

Lyrics From Snippets

[Verse: Common]
...you free us to reach us, to see us
Mama always said that I had your features
When I was young, I learnt a power of the tongue
And how ever I speak it, it's how I will become
And young Solomone...

... reveals your glory
This is the story of redemption
A change of condition, the purpose and attention

So I

In God's country, in our country
Remind me that don't define me
God, I will always follow your lee
You never 

[?] me wrong
Cause you are our God
In God's Country we all free
We got a number one Victory Royale
Yeah, Fortnite, we 'bout to get down (get down)
Ten kills on the board right now
Just wiped out Tomato Town
My friend just got downed
I revived him, now we're heading south-bound
Now we're in the Pleasant Park streets
Look at the map, go to the marked sheet
Take me to your Xbox to play Fortnite today
You can take me to Moisty Mire, but not Loot Lake
I really love to Chug Jug with you
We can be pro Fortnite gamers
He said
"Hey broski, you got some heals and a shield pot?"
"I need healing and I am only at one HP"
Hey dude, sorry, I found nothing on this safari
I checked the upstairs of that house but not the underneath yet
There's a chest that's just down there
The storm is coming fast and you need heals to prepare
I've got V-Bucks that I'll spend
More than you can content
I'm a cool pro Fortnite gamer (cool pro Fortnite-)
Take me to your Xbox to play Fortnite today
You can take me to Moisty Mire, but not Loot Lake
I really love to Chug Jug with you
We can be pro Fortnite gamers
La-la-la-la-la-e-ya
La-la-la-la-la-e-ya
La-la-la-la-la-e-ya
Will you be my pro Fortnite gamer? (Pro Fortnite gamer)
Can we get a win this weekend?
Take me to Loot Lake
Let's change the game mode and we can Disco Dominate
Let's hop in an ATK
Take me to the zone
I'm running kind of low on meds, I need to break some stone
Dressed in all his fancy clothes
He's got Renegade Raider and he's probably a pro
He just shot my back
I turn back and I attack
I just got a Victory Royale
A Victory Royale
Take me to your Xbox to play Fortnite today
You can take me to Moisty Mire, but not Loot Lake
I really love to Chug Jug with you
We can be pro Fortnite gamers

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Woah, woah, woah, again

[Verse]
I'd run a hundred miles just so I could feel alright
The same way that I used to, again
And I've tried a hundred times to tell myself that it's alright
But my mistakes haunt me every night
Oh, I can't deal with my mind
So every night I fall asleep high
I wake up to my tears dried, again (Woah, woah, woah)
Too many sleepless nights, slept without you by my side
It gets harder every time, again
And I'll do what it takes to find your love again
'Cause I can't do this on my own
Said you need time to think, however long it takes
'Cause I'm still scared of being alone...

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Ty Dolla $ign, Bebe Rexha]
I don't got friends, I got family
At the end of the day that's all I need
And you know, that's what you'll always be
No matter how long it's been, no, I don't got friends

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha]
I can tell the difference with my day ones
Read between the likes and the mentions
Candle in the sky for the lost ones
Need me, know you only gotta call once

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Let's make a toast to the good stuff
Raise the champagne in a red cup
My drip is so hot 'cause it's all love
My drip is so hot

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha, Bebe Rexha & Ty Dolla $ign]
'Cause I don't got friends, I got family
At the end of the day that's all I need
And you know, that's what you'll always be
No matter how long it's been, no, I don't got friends (Ooh)
I got family (Ooh)

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're gonna know your real ones when you tested (Real)
Who there with you and they stand there when you're stressin' (Oh)
And if I do you wrong, I'ma 'fess it (Wrong)
Eh, good energy, gotta protect it

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Bare feet on a fire walk, carry
You for miles until I crawl, trust me
Uh, tell me your secrets, they on lock, yeah (Lock, yeah)
I ain't alone on this one way

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign, Bebe Rexha & Ty Dolla $ign, Bebe Rexha]
'Cause I don't got friends, I got family
At the end of the day that's all I need
And you know, that's what you'll always be
No matter how long it's been, no, I don't got friends (Ooh)
I got family (Ooh)

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
I need your energy, baby, don't need no friend or acquaintance
I need your love in a form that you won't give to nobody
Baby, I mean it, you taught me it was all, even inside of you
But I seen it, it's family over everything

[Pre-Chorus: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie, Ty Dolla $ign]
Baby, I love too hard
I just want you to have your fun 'cause life is too short
Take you out to eat in New York, let's go to Jue Lan (Yeah)
Gon’ make and lose friends when your money too long

[Chorus: All, Bebe Rexha, Ty Dolla $ign]
'Cause I don't got friends, I got family
At the end of the day that's all I need
And you know, that's what you'll always be
No matter how long it's been, no, I don't got friends (Ooh)
I got family (Ooh)
I got, I got family (Yeah)

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Huh, David Guetta, I told you they wouldn't — with us mayne
These glasses Celine, these Yeezy slides
Well, I lost my shadow in violent sin
Never knew the search would be within
Drew a picture of my only desire
Take me back to Blackskin Mile

I thought my karma would be my fate
Never saw the sun until it was too late
And oh, drew my loneliness, chasing every last high
Take me back to Blackskin Mile

I never met a madman's soul
That I didn't see reflections of that which I own
But I know there's something better outside
So, won't you take me back to Blackskin Milе

I walk a valley of a thousand streams
In retriеval of my self-esteem
I see a world in you where I may dream high
Take me back to Blackskin Mile

I have fallen, but I kept my soul
Though I felt darkness in the light, I never let go
That last solitary seconds of my life, won't you
Take me back to Blackskin Mile
And with our resolutions high
And with our pretty words in lies
Survival comes with sacrifice
I run toward the burning to feel alive

Ooh, found my shadow in a violent sky
And in my bleeding she'd watch me cry, lawd
Tears of happiness, my only one desire
Take me back to Blackskin Mile

I said, take me Black to Blackskin Mile
One more time, take me back to Blackskin Mile
Oh yes, take me back to Blackskin Mile

[Verse 1]
You get the side of me
I would hold back and not reveal
You feed the mystery
You are my red and my blue pill
It made me come alive
Don't be a lie, it feels so real
You get the best of me

[Pre-Chorus]
We can live on
The air
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
Do you understand?

[Chorus]
(Ah-ah)
Baby, baby
We gonna rock forever
(Ah-ah)
Baby, baby
We gonna rock forever (Forever)
(Ah, ah)
You get the best of me
(Ah, ah)
You got a way to make me feel

[Verse 2]
Together
If you were mines, then we would build a castle from tears
Only dry eyes, I would love on you for years
I'll never want another, baby, let's just be real, ooh

[Chorus]
(Ah-ah)
Baby, baby
We gonna rock forever (Forever, baby)
(Ah-ah)
Baby, baby
We gonna rock forever (Forever, forever, baby)
(Ah, ah)
You get the best of me
(Ah, ah)
You got a way to make me feel

[Verse 1]

You feed the mystery
You are my red and my blue pill
It makes me come alive
Don't be a lie, it feels so real

(Ah-ah)
Baby, baby
We gonna rock forever (Forever, forever, baby)
(Ah, ah)
You get the best of me
(Ah, ah)
You got a way to make me feel
So much has been going on
I promised you I wouldn't run but
My voice won't be heard and it's too hard to end it
It's absurd

So we're still together for now
But my new girl is coming to town
We're still together for now
But my new girl is coming to town

You dig me there
But you're still scared and I'm scared too
You know it's true
So we're still together for now
But my new girl is coming to town

So I imagine you're upset
But I am not responsible for that
I tried to give you happiness
But all that ever happened is you ended getting pissеd
So we're still togethеr for now
But my new girl is coming to town
We're still together for now
But my new girl is coming to town

You dig me there
But you're still scared and I'm scared too
You know it's true
So we're still together for now
But my new girl is coming to town

If that's the way it's gonna go
Then that's the way it's gonna go
If that's the way it's gonna go
Then that's the way it's gonna go
If that's the way it's gonna go
Then that's the way it's gonna go
If that's the way it's gonna go
Then that's the way it's gonna go

[Chorus]
I've got a flame
Got a lover's flame
I've got another's flame, an' it burns
I've got a flame
I've gotta get away
Something makes me stay, an' it burns

[Verse 1]
He lights me up, an' I'm smokin' ashes on the ground
It only takes one touch and I'm going down

[Chorus]
I've got a flame
Got a lover's flame
I've got another's flame, an' it burns

[Verse 2]
He's got me wrapped up, I just can't get enough
I'm going crazy
I never been this out of control
Somebody save me

[Chorus]
I've got a flame
I've gotta get away
Something makеs me stay, an' it burns

[Bridge]
Burn me, burn me in thе dark (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I let you, let you leave your mark (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I've got a flame
Got a lover's flame
I've got another's flame, an' it burns
I've got a flame
An' I've gotta get away
Something makes me stay, an' it burns

[Chorus]
Amor fati
Feel the vibe
Amor fati, woo
Growin' high

[Verse]
I'm in love with my friends
And they're in love with me too, ooh
Yeah, I'm in love with my friends
What else is there to do, ooh?
No, I don't need no exercise, I got no books to read
Everything is as it is, just as it should be
My face is just a mask I wear, there's something underneath
I lie outside the wears of time, I'm perfect and complete

[Chorus]
Amor fati, woo
What's your name?
Everybody, woo
Should do the same
Amor fati (Fati)

It's Paul
Uh, I don't even know where the fuck you are
But apparently you left out of the club
Two nights ago, with ten plus girls
And nobody's heard from you
Nobody's heard from the girls
So, if you get around to it
And, you think maybe it's a good idea
How about you give me a call
And let me know what the fuck's goin' on?
Thanks

The big-eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, "Catch up, nigga," it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark-skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic-contradicting dickhead (Not a Logic)
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five-panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me

[Verse 2: Mike G]
(We out here)
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, "Get 'em, Mike G," then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit!
Rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 3: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pothead, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell (Woo)
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch (Wow)
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit (Woo)
Catch me in the back with Miley's on my lap (Shit)
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat (Cat)

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang

[Verse 4: XXXTENTACION]
Pussy popper
Young Waka Flocka
We shakin' like maracas
Don't forget Sinatra
My bitch is like Rihanna
Betty yet Beyoncé
Had to take her top off, gun shots'a pop off
Mi nuh fuck 'round with dem bwoy dem, dem
Bwoy dem get chop off
Tell di bwoy fi gwaan fi him
Gyal and suck him bloodclaat
Dick stains let my dick hang like a nunchuk
Anyway, I can't bitch, I'm just tryna get my nut sucked
Hah, so fuck luck
Bitch, it's pure skill when I gun bust
Glocks like .50 on my niggas, acupuncture
Fuck like, it’s a shit night
Get your mind right, only way a nigga coolin' if I get high, right?
High up in the sky, right?
Motherfucka' cloud all my niggas in the ground right now
And I bash like Zao, like Pow
Mind within the comic, I'm so high right now
So pass that
Skinny motherfucker, won’t you tell me where the cash at?
I’m about to end a nigga life so where the stash at?
Got about 20 fuckin' mil', just chilling in my backpack
Call a fat bitch then I hit it in her ass crack

[Verse 5: Tyler, the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggers in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends that say the n-word
And the ones who got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fuckin' amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah
Golf Wang

Pressure in my pockets and they mad

Creation (Creation, creation, creation, creation)

Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed (Bed, bed, bed, bed, bed)

I and I
I and I

I and I
I and I

Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race

I and I
I and I

They're waiting for spring to come (They're waiting for spring to come)
Smokin' down the track (Smokin' down the track)

I and I
I and I
I and I
I and I

I and I
Walking in the middle lane, literally
I and I
Walking to the edge of—

[Speaking]
You think you know about parties?
You think you know something about parties?
You think you had a good night out?
You don't know what a good night out is

[Verse 1]
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight streams

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives"

[Verse 2]
Think I'll go out and go for a walk
Not much happenin' here
Nothin' ever does
Besidеs, if she wakes up now, she'll just want mе to talk
I got nothin' to say
'Specially about whatever was

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives"

[Verse 3]
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race
It goes to the worthy who can divide the word of truth
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
And to see an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives"

[Verse 4]
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight
They're waiting for spring to come, smokin' down the track
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright
She should still be there sleepin' when I get back

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives"

[Verse 5]
Noontime and I'm still pushin' myself along the road, the darkest part
Into the narrow lanes, huh, I can't stumble or stay put
Someone else is speakin' with my mouth, but I'm listenin' only to my heart
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives"
Joker-man
Joker-man, while ya deal wit'?

Standing on the waters casting your bread
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing

Freedom just around the corner from you

Joker-man
Whoa, whoa, joker-man

One of the women must sit in the shack and soak up
The bus'll catch up with him

The joker-man
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care?

You're a king among this town
You're a stranger at home
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Joker-man
And the sea are your only teachers
Michelangelo, himsеlf, could've carved out your featurеs
Tragic, tragic, with a small dog at your feet

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Joker-man

Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, and padlocks
Molotov cocktails and rocks can't drown out your servin'
Spun in your web

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Joker-man

He'll put a priest into pimps and make old men buy
Take a woman and cut up her shoulder wrap
And turn her into a harlot

Oh, joker-man

Joker-man dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Joker-man

[Verse 1]
Standing on the waters casting your bread
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Freedom just around the corner for you
But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?

[Chorus]
Joker-man dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Joker-man

[Verse 2]
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
Lone-star, bat shit for you and your back
One of the women must sit in the shack and soak up
Shedding off one more layеr of skin
Keeping one step ahead of thе persecutor within

[Chorus]
Joker-man dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Joker-man

[Verse 3]
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister
Scratching the world with a fine tooth comb
You're a king amongst this town
You're a stranger at home

[Chorus]
Joker-man dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Joker-man

[Verse 4]
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
No crystal ball, do you need on your shelf
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features
So drunk standing in the middle of the street
Directing traffic with a small dog at your feet

[Chorus]
Joker-man dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Joker-man

[Verse 5]
Well, the preacher-man talking 'bout the death and the dump
And a world to come that's already been predetermined
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
Molotov cocktails and rocks can't drown out your sermon
You let the wicked walk right into your trap
You give away all good things that fall in your lap

[Chorus]
Joker-man dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Joker-man

[Verse 6]
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery grey
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot
Oh, Joker-man, you know what he wants
Oh, Joker-man, you don't show any response

[Chorus]
Joker-man dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Joker-man

Tell me you love me and what's your motherfucking reason

Light it up, put that kush in the air, light it up

Oh, tell me that you thuggin'
Oh, tell me that you thuggin'

Hey, how have you been?
So many things have changed
Since we last broke up

[Verse 2]
I don't know about you
But I really need a change
I hope you're doing well

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I got a few tattoos, pierced my ear, and I got new shoes
Cut my hair and cut it again, dyed it black at summer camp (oooh)
Met a boy who treated me right,wrote this song about him last night
We broke up and now we're friends, things are changing now and then

[Chorus]
But I, still think, about you when that one song comes on
And I, still think, about all that we agreed upon
I know, you probably never think back, but it's whatever
I don't wanna change your mind
I just wanted to give you an update
I'm doing fine

[Verse 3]
Ooohhh
Hey, how have you been?
Are you still the boy I knew
Or have you grown up

[Verse 4]
I recall when I fell
In love with  the boy I knew
But since then I’ve grown Up

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I got a few tattoos, new best friends and a mouse in my room
Lately though that mouse is gone, things are changing off and on

[Chorus]
But I, still think, about you when that one song comes on
And I, still think, about all that we agreed upon
I know, you probably never think back, but it's whatever
I don't wanna change your mind
I just wanted to give you an update
I'm doing fine

[Bridge]
I’m doing fine
If I get you’ve moved on
And I’m still out here writing songs
Maybe that means something
But I, I’m doing fine
Considering you never called
Never gave me closure at all
Baby that mean’s something

[Chorus]
But I, still think, about you when that one song comes on
And I, still think, about all that we agreed upon
I know, you probably never think back, but it's whatever
I don't wanna change your mind

[Outro]
I just wanted to give you an update
I just wanted to tell you that I’m great
I just wanted to tell you that today
I'm doing fine

Keep my spirit alive
Keep my spirit alive, alive

[Chorus: KayCyy & Kanye West]
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
The spirit won't die, I-
Oh, oh, oh, my life, yeah
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize
Lord have mercy

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Yo
Flushed the work just in time and they raided, thank God (Thank God)
Screamin' through the GT roof like nigga, we done made it, thank God (Thank God)
Hundred-round drum didn't jam when my shooter tried to spray it, thank God (Thank God)
Couple thousand grams, got two thousand grands when we waited, thank God (Thank God)
I was facin' fifteen and I beat it (And I beat it)
Just spent about twenty up at Neimans (Up at Neimans)
Did two hundrеd in a Demon (In a Demon, skrrt)
I'm the illеst nigga and I mean it (And I mean it)
My homie droppin' bodies for no reason (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Now his kids see him on the weekends (Ah)
Got the baking soda for the remix (Remix)
Millionaires on, I can see it

[Chorus: KayCyy & Kanye West]
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
The spirit won't die, I-
Oh, oh, oh, my life, yeah
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize
Lord have mercy

[Verse 2: Conway the Machine]
Yeah, don't hate me, 'cause my heart is full of love
No weapon formed against me 'cause I'm covered in the blood
Layin' in the hospital when I got shot, fam
Mama prayed for me, said she left it in God's hands, yeah
So I'ma leave it in God's hands
Everything I'm doin' now is God's plan
Doctor said I wouldn't walk no more, now I stand
Then I ran, here I am, Machine

[Interlude: Kanye West & KayCyy]
(Keep my spirit alive, keep my spirit alive, alive)
We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God
Unifying our vision and building the future, y'know what I mean?
(More than enough, you can take it all but the Lord on my side)
Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast food
(The spirit won't die, I—)
Bad had tools and a bad mood
(Oh, oh, oh, my life, yeah)
If you don't turn to a lil' Gotti, they gon' drain all the strength in your lil' body
(Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize)
They turned me into a lil' Gotti, (Spirit won’t die) uh, yeah

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Royce da 5'9"]
Not Wakanda but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make
And who gon' make it? Kan', duh
Who the squad? Donda

Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
MIB, I told LV like Farrakhan told me
You can take the V, it still won't cure the disease (My life, yeah)
Uh, still won't cure the disease, still won't cure—yeah

[Chorus: KayCyy & Kanye West]
More than enough (Spirit won’t die)
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

[Verse 4: Kanye West & Royce da 5'9"]
You're more concerned about raising your next round than raising your next child (Spirit won't die)
Here’s the exodus from the one you exiled
We won't panic in a pandemic, we can stand in it
Believe in the word, know the spirit is transcendent
People who stress you out, my vision clear without it (Spirit won't die)
But it's y'all, I swear I’m sorry to hear about it
I'm not sorry it happened
I’m just sorry to hear—
I'm either the best decision or your worst mistake (Spirit won't die)
Every day’s a song, it only takes a hook to break, you know
Headed back to Cody on the first thing smokin'
I'ma get a room at the first thing open, brr—yeah
Step into the sanctuary (Spirit won't die)
You gon' thank me so much, I'd have to start a thank-tuary
Tell the assassins I escaped from Calabasas
Where they wanna turn my wife to Jackie Joe Jackson
Jackie Robinson, we at bat
When the World Cup Series and that’s just us practicin', but—
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don't do commercials, 'cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said "You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you"
How I'm forty-two and you got a curfew?
How numbers dictate how they gon' curve you?
Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God's spiritual ordinance
We know the Blacks, the orphans refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
(Spirit won’t die)

[Chorus: KayCyy]
More than enough
You can take it all but the Lord on my side

[Verse 5: Kanye West & Royce da 5'9"]
My puffer so puffy you thought it was Sean John
Over a vintage suit, my dad wore to my mom's prom
Go home to the wifey to avoid the rom-coms
How you break the net and go to sleep in mom jams?
Summer basketball camp down in Maryland
Used to play with the Terrapins
Used to play with the Taliban
How the police officer abuse a fellow African?
That DC crossover had me feelin' arrogant
But I got scopiphobia, don't stare at him
Favorite intern worked somewhere else for more cheese
But I can't cry over spilled milk employees
Backup, backup, backup, this the main event
I saw Cassie' trainer, and my girl ain’t had a male trainer since
I need an estate plan with an escape plan
Just in case I’m ambushed by Mr. Fake Tan
You are an example of someone who ain’t prayin’
You a sinner, all orange like a fake tan
Satan has Helen Keller'd the people
Until we all agree he a liar, we ain’t equal
Brought soul to Hov, now bring the souls to Jehovah
Raised in the cold, thank god I'm Bi-Polar
I wouldn't do a doc on Mike, I'm not Oprah
Drenched in the blood, I'm not what 'cha call sober
I followed in the word and did what the Lord told us
Now I’ve got the culture back on my shoulders

[Chorus: KayCyy]
Keep my spirit alive
Keep my spirit alive, alive
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
The spirit won't die, die
Oh, oh, oh, my life, yeah
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize

[Intro]
I knew you'd come
Somehow, I just knew you'd find me
Not knowing where I was or when I was coming back sent you crazy
I kept my spies on you, though
I didn't like what they reported back
Though you were smarter than that, you had to have known this was strategically designed architecture
Architecture that only I have the Pinkprink for
Nevertheless, you took the bait

[Verse 1]
Ayo, look like I'm goin' for a swim
Dunked on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court fully drenchеd
Here go some hatеrade, get ya thirst quenched
Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench (Brrr)
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot
Oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc (By the rock)
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he buy the rock

[Chorus]
Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed
He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song
I-I-I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ayo, I been north, Lara been Croft
Plates say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off

[Interlude 1]
Oh, I get it, huh, they paintin' me out to be the bad guy
Well it's the last time you gonna see a bad guy do the rap game like me

[Verse 2]
I went and copped the chopsticks, put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit, box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip
How many of them coulda did it with finesse?
Now everybody like, "She really is the best"
You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong
Bitch, it's King Kong, this is King Kong
Chinese ink on, Siamese links on
Call me 2 Chainz, name go ding dong
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, I'm King Kong
This is King Kong? Yes, Miss King Kong
In my kingdom wit' my Timbs on
How many championships? What? Six rings on

[Interlude 2]
They need rappers like me
They need rappers like me
So they can get on their fucking keyboards
And make me the bad guy, Chun-Li

[Chorus]
Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed
He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song
I-I-I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ayo, I been north, Lara been Croft
Plates say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off

[Bridge]
I come alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs, it's my lifestyle
I come alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs, it's my lifestyle
I need a Mai Tai, so fuckin' sci-fi
Give me the password to the fuckin' wifi

[Chorus]
Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed
He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song
I-I-I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ayo, I been north, Lara been Croft
Plates say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off

[Outro]
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong
Bitch, it's King Kong, this is King Kong
Chinese ink on, Siamese links on
Call me 2 Chainz, name go ding dong
Bitch, it's King Kong, y-yes, I'm King Kong
This is King Kong? Y-Yes, Miss King Kong
I-In my kingdom wit' my Timbs on
How many championships? What? Six rings on

[Verse]
I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend
And does he notice my feelings for him?
And does he see how much he means to me?
I think it's not to be

What will become of my dear friend?
Where will his actions lead us then?
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic loud
Try as I may, it doesn't last
And will we ever end up together?
No, I think not, it's nеver to become
For I am not thе one

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
All the way in the back with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me, "What you doing with that?"
Yeah, yeah
You say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me
One day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sittin' 'round here waitin' on a man
To tell me where the fuck my seat be at
Where Mike WiLL at?

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We bе struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangеrz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)

[Verse 2: Sean Garrett & Miley Cyrus]
I'm flying high up on the bird; acrophobiac
I slick, caught her eyeing down my purse
Where the dollars at?
I let her know the rent's due on the first
They can call the hearse
'Cause, if there's any violation, I go off with that
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with a big dog
(Why I need his millis when I got Billy on the speed dial?)
You know I'm on that "meow", quick to scratch your eyes out
Strutting on the court, make them nervous, call a timeout

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
The plane, boss, the plane
‘Bout to get that big rock
Slip that on my hand
Make that media big talk
The plane, boss, the plane
Psych, that must be the purple
Got up in my brain
Had me a little bit dismal
I
I am the one
I am the none
I am nobody
I am no one
I am god
I am you
I am me
I am Gaia

Giant body parasite
Gaia lives while others die

I
I am the two
I am you too
I am the stream
I am wind
I am rain
I am photon
I am wave
I am Gaia
Gaia sees
Gaia breathes
Gaia's needs incomplete
Gaia bequeaths
Dirt is diseased
Gaia dies
No one sees

Excuse me for being persistent

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Doesn't it get a little lonely out here?
If I die my momma set for life (Brrt)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
If I get killed, that's one between your eyes like Savage knife (Yeah)
Get shot at, I'm gon' slide, it's too much pride behind my life (Uh-huh)
Feel like Yeat 'cause I been booted up a million nights (Brrt)
Had to cut off my main bitch, but trust, she still my wife
Still, pull up with that pipe
Still, creepin' through the night
Still, fuck that bitch, I might
Still, swipe that store, I swipe (Still)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
And I will-y, I am like hype (Huh)
If it's smoke, then we turn into kites (Uh)
3 AM, and we runnin' the lights (Go)
All of my guns got sights (Brrt)
I'm not the one to fight
Petty, I put up a price
Is you ready? I buy her a flight
I beheaded that bitch on arrival
I won't fake it with none of my rivals
My chick still like the cousin of Chavo
Got my name engraved in my Bible (Yeah)
On her back and above her lil' asshole (Hm)
On my gun and the back of my chain (Mwah)
All of this shit the same, I need everyone to remember my name
If I die my momma set for life (Brrt)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & Yeat]
If I get killed, that's one between your eyes like Savage knife (Yeah)
Get shot at, I'm gon' slide, it's too much pride behind my life (Uh-huh)
Feel like Yeat 'cause I been booted up a million nights (Brrt)
Had to cut off my main bitch, but trust, she still my wife
Still, pull up with that pipe
Still, creepin' through the night (Ah)
Still, fuck that bitch, I might (Yeah)
Still, swipe that store, I swipe (Still, yeah)

[Verse 2: Yeat]
Feel like me 'cause I been booted up a million nights
I just went and bought the jet, I got a million flights (No)
No, that pussy don't want pull up, pussy do not fight (Buh-buh)
He gon' call the cops, he stuck up, yeah, he lost his life
I'm a superstar, bitch, flooded diamond chain
I fucked my money up so good, it told me that it came
Yeah, mix the X with the Percs, don't kick it with lames
Yachty told me, "Run the beat," I passed him back a flame (Aight, let's go)

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
If I get killed, that's one between your eyes like Savage knife (Yeah)
Get shot at, I'm gon' slide, it's too much pride behind my life (Uh-huh)
Feel like Yeat 'cause I been booted up a million nights (Brrt)
Had to cut off my main bitch, but trust, she still my wife

[Intro: Carole Sager]
Hi Kanye, it's Carole and I'm gonna read you this lyric that I've got going
If you like it, where it's going, I'll finish it
I like it, it's called 'The Garden'

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
There's been a lot of change in our lives
Some would've guessed and some undefined
Must keep the faith in, faith in each other
You are my brother, family

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Ant Clemons]
Writin's on the wall around us
Watchin' people all around us
Gotta wake up to the call above us
Then I know it's gon' be alright
It's comin' back around, we're enlightened
Prayin' that we all stay guided
Guided, somehow (Ooh-ooh)
We'll find our way

[Verse 2: Ant Clemons]
We will weld this world, world back together
Let's make a way, we'll lead the way (Must)
Must keep the faith, faith in each other
You are my brother, family

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign with Ant Clemons, Ty Dolla $ign & Ant Clemons]
Writin's on the wall around us
Watchin' people all around us
Gotta wake up to the call above us
Then I know it's gonna be alright
It's comin' back around, we're enlightened
Prayin' that we all stay guided
Guided, somehow
We'll find a way

[Intro]
Yes yes
Spooky hour
Happy Halloween, yah
Congratulations to Jay-Z
In the Hall of Fame, ha
Boo, spooky nigga
Yeah, uh-huh
Uh

[Verse]
He can be so cold-blooded
Colorblind when he bang
How he thug it
Black and white appetite
Blood dripping from his fangs
You can see it, synergistic
Broke the microphone
Go and get this bitch a cane
He on menace minutes go and send this flick a cane
For the popo
Strawin' that bitch's neck
Sippin' her like a margarita made out of arterias
I'm oughta eat her
Deeper than a 

[?] pizza from Chicago, nigga
Werewolf got 

[Jasper?] graphics in his hairdo, ow
Devil can't handle any curses
I went to Halloween as a vaccinatеd person
Boo, beware thе niggas from the west
Might scare nigga to death, bless
Might just impair a nigga for wreck
Why not? Do Noob Saibot
On a nigga eye
Turn his ass into a cyclops
Pull a high top on his high top
Keep trying, that other eye is gon' get blinder than I got
They say they don't like cops
They lying
If I pull up with the .9
They gon' be on the line for the swine like it's IHOP
You're really in a bind op
I'm Frankenstein with the mind, top gun
Mind of a pilot, climb in a hind and start flying like I'm Frylock
Shiny and BIPOC
Fine for thirty-nine
Look at all of this rhyming that I got
Undermining the sly plots to overthrow
Close the blinds on the Mayback and rode
Lupe

[Intro: Sunday Service Choir]
My soul, my soul

[Verse 1: Israel Boyd & Sunday Service Choir]
Won't be gettin’ sleep tonight
And I'm crying as I write this
Prayin’ for my brothers
Locked up, fighting fires
My heart goes out to all the daughters
Missin’ all our fathers
Never seen their loved ones
‘Cause the prisoners fighting fires
(My soul)

[Chorus: Israel Boyd & Sunday Service Choir]
And I might be biased
But I feel God standin’ by us
And the prisoners fighting fires
(My soul)
And I might be biased, but my soul
Needs you Lord, Jesus come now, take control
(Take control of my soul)
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 2: Arrow & Sunday Service Choir]
What if I start off the track, hum the beginning
Mutter the middle part, and mumble the ending?
It just feels better in my humblе opinion
Much more n-words, but humble beginnings
Makе you act like the n-word, that’s why you stayed injured
That’s why you stay in court and go to the pen for it
Before I forget, let me go get a pen for it
Cancel culture, before I get censored
All I really meant for is you to get mentored
Before you get sentenced, before you get sent for it
Remember this sentence, remember repentance (My Soul)
Only God can judge you, only Jesus is Lord
Over in Thanville, Stateville, Taylorville, Lanyard
Jacksonville, Pontiac, Pinckeyville
We're mass targeted, mass marketed, mass incarceration
Massive police stations, mass incorporated
Take control of my soul (My soul)

[Chorus: Israel Boyd & Sunday Service Choir]
And I might be biased
But I feel God standin’ by us
(My soul)
And I might be biased, but my soul
Needs you Lord, Jesus come now, take control
(Take control of my soul)
And I might be biased
But I feel God standin’ by us
(My soul)
And I might be biased, but my soul
Needs you Lord, Jesus come now, take control
(Take control of my soul)
Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Oh

[Intro]
(Uh, uh-huh)
Yo, this that butter shit
Niggas know I never stutter with
It's called the flip-style

[Verse 1]
I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fifty blocks
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy pop
In a instant, get smoked like Winston Cigarettes
Bitches get ripped off like Nicorette (Patch)
In real life, the real trife scene
Might snatch one's life like assault machine
Rifle, dead-up setup like bull-fight
Be bluntеd like we like could not whitе or in full flights
X the unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run, off the gun, death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal to the streets
To my peeps, G.M., MF on the beat
Rhymes is chosen like the weapons of war
Keep from steppin' on my floor or delivery front-door
I bring it to y'all motherfuckers, master yours
My disaster cause... hell in gas drawls
The supervillain, cooler than a million, I be chillin'
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
Sendin' spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown within the comforts of your own home
Grown big, wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, it keeps the sty on my eye swollen

[Break: MF DOOM]
Bitch, nigga, switch the style
Who massive versatile?
Who bigged 'em up Monster Isle? (Who dat?)

I saw... Hell with them gas drawls
Mhm

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju, I crack brew for
Two more free men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When givin' crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers that's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss
Or motherfuckin' Mother Goose
It's X the suspicious flirter, who every hooker heard'a
Next to malicious murder
A track type vicious, fulfillin' the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal, minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve, don't breathe
Sixteen shots, I do believe plus one up the sleeve
Master of the O who predict yo last pause
I told y'all, Hell and gas drawls
Breakin' glass and plastic jaw like federal drastic law
Fed up from fightin' secret wars with them Fantastic Fours
(Invisible Bitch)
Versus Doom wit' the metal face
Before it goes to state, the ho' better settle case
The flow is at pedal pace, steady like tricycles
Beware all suckas, y'all froze like icicles
I'm baggin' bitches like nickels, I lick 'em where they tickle
Before I hit the clit though, I'mma spit till I pronounce
More hits than a ounce, no doubt
About to bounce, X the unannounced, I'm out

[Outro: MF DOOM]
And I'd like to give a shoutout to my man Jet Jaguar
And also, you know
D-Smooth, 

[?] (Master of the O), MF
(I call this one) Gas Drawls
G.M

[Verse 2]
She left me back in my room with no trace
Why the fuck'd you come? Just to show face?
It drives me crazy (Baby)
It doesn't matter what I do, you still gon' play me
Ooh, baby, how many times have I tried to play it safe?
You wiped the smile up from my face, lil' baby
If you can trust me, we'll be alright
Ooh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, would you look at the time? (The time)
I'm racing against it
Your heart to my heart (To my heart)
Come place it against it

I'm facing temptations (Temptations)
I wanna do right, we both want the sensation

Cause tonight's the night, so, baby
Can we (Can we?)

So what's it gonna be? Yeah (What's it gonna be?)
Cause tonight's the night, so, baby

[Outro]
Baby (Baby, baby)
I want you to leave but you stay
My brain and my heart ain't the same
So will I let you in?
As long as you won't do this to me again

[Verse 1]
Been pulling through
Since the last time I touched you
Making due with an internet signal
Calling for the delivery to the front door

[Chorus]
There is no reason to believe
No reason at all
Come together for a moment, look around and dissolve
Like a feeling, like a flash
Like a fallen eyelash
On your sweater, threading future through the past

[Verse 2]
City of salt bone and bell tower
Country of ice rain and wildflower
Picking out the wreath for the funеral and

[Chorus]
There is no reason to bеlieve
No reason at all
Come together for a moment, look around and dissolve
Like a feeling, like a flash
Like a fallen eyelash
On your sweater, threading future through the past

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There is no reason to believe
No reason at all
Come together for a moment, look around and dissolve
Like a feeling, like a flash
Like a fallen eyelash
On your sweater, threading future through the past

[Outro]
There is no reason to believe
Come together
Like a feeling, like a flash
Come together

One
One, two, one, two

[Verse 1]
Blue lightning was an autograph signing up the sky
To the question that I had to ask, she only answered, "Why?"
Angelia took the photograph, the moment had to die
Years later, like an epitaph, we read it and we cry
This morning, I went to have a bath, the water ran dry
Clear warning, has it come at last, the time to say goodbye?
Can we make love? Can we hold fast? I really wanna try

[Chorus]
Two-eyed lie, is it fight or fly?
I wanna be the shoelace that you tie
'Til the end, will you be my friend?
I wanna be the wrinkle in your eye
Yeah, I wanna be the vapor gets you high

[Verse 2]
Blue heron, now you're scaring me, you circle and dive
Blue angel, yeah, you're in my dreams, swearing every night
And a spider just beside her, larger than a hill
And it's plain to see if she don't comfort me, the rattlesnake will

[Chorus]
Two-eyed lie, is it fight or fly?
I wanna be the wrinkle in your eye
'Til the end, will you be my friend?
I wanna be the shoelace that you tie
Yeah, I wanna be the vapor gets you high

[Chorus]
Two-eyed lie, is it fight or fly?
I wanna be the shoelace that you tie
'Til the end, will you be my friend?
I wanna be the mountain, kiss the sky
Yeah, I wanna be the vapor gets you high
Yeah, I wanna feel so happy that I cry
Yeah, I wanna be the shoelace that you tie
Yeah, I wanna live forever 'til I die
Yeah, I wanna live forever 'til I die
Yeah, I

[Outro]
Hmm
Gorgeous set, okay, what should we do now?

[Intro]
-ight is l-

[Verse 1]
I already died
I'm singing from the other side
Underneath love
Avoidance and pride
I look you in the face and lie
I tell you I want your love
You're the cigarette in my fist
You are so hard to resist
I can't help but breathe your love
When I'm scared to die alone
That's when I call you on the phone
I tell you that I need your love

[Chorus]
Oh, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love

[Verse 2]
Oh, frailty and fragile words
You tell me a lot of words
You tell me all about your love
And I feel what I hear you say
I don't talk the same way
'Cause that don't feel like love
As the dog opens his eyes
As the blue crow flies
I'm going to meet my love
I already died
I'm calling from the other side
Underneath love
There's a bottle out in the sea
With a message inside from me
Saying, "Release my love"

[Chorus]
Release my love, my love
I'm dreaming of release, my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love
Release my love

[Break]

[Verse 3]
It's a moving operation
I'm getting off at this station
I'm leaving your love
I'm scared to die alone
I call you on the phone
Watch me bleed your love

[Chorus]
Oh, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

[Outro]
Release my love, my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
How you fuck your brother, I think that's incest
I ain't impressed, sounded like a...

[Chorus]
If I was on some foggy mountain top I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world to the boy I love the best
Now when you see that he is blonde there's something you can't tell her
She need no food, her time away trying to steal my bell

[Outro]
And this was a Carter family melody, at least they used to sing this melody a lot but Woody Guthrie wrote these words and they kinda be with us for the rest of our lives I'm sure

[Verse 1]
All your expectations of my love are impossible
Surely, you know that I'm not easy to hold
It's so sad how incapable of learning to grow I am
My heart speaks in puzzle and codes
I've been trying my whole life to solve
God only knows how I've cried
I can't take another defeat
A next time would be the ending of me
Now that I see

[Chorus]
That love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

[Verse 2]
How unbelievable (Unbelievable)
Of me to fall for the lies that I tell (Lies I tell)
The dream that I sell (Dream I sell)
When heartache, it's inevitable (It's inevitable)
But I'm no good at doing it well
Not that I care (I don't care)
Why should anything about it be fair?

[Chorus]
When love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

[Bridge]
No amount of love
Can keep me satisfied (Satisfied, satisfied)
I can't keep up (Can't keep up, can't keep up)
When I keep changing my mind (Change my mind, change my mind)
The feelings flood me to the heights of no compromise

[Chorus]
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

[Outro]
Oh, you know I'd do it all again
I love it now like I loved it then
I'm a fool for them
You know I'm, you know I'm gonna do it, oh
I'll do it all again like I did then

[Verse 1]
You're driving me away, give me a reason to stay
I want to be lost in you, but not in this way
Don’t think you quite understand who you have on your hands
How can you not see just how good for you I am?
I know that you've been hurt before
That's why you feel so insecure
I begged you to let me in ’cause I only want to be the cure
If you don't choose to grow, we ain't ever gonna know
Just how good this could be
I really hoped that this would go somewhere

[Chorus]
Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy?
You ain't never had, ain't never had a woman like me
It is so sad a man likе you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to givе for free and it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me

[Verse 2]
All you do is complain about decisions you make
How can I help lift you if you refuse to activate the life that you truly want?
I know it's hard, but it's not
We come from the same place, but you will never give it up
It's where they make you feel powerful
That’s why you think I make you feel small
But that’s your projection, it's not my rejection
I put my heart on the line for the very first time
Because you asked me to and now you’ve gone and changed your mind
But lovin' you was a breakthrough
I saw what my heart can really do
Now some other man will get the love I had for you
'Cause you don't care, oh

[Chorus]
Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy?
You ain’t never had, ain't never had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to give for free and it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me

[Outro]
A woman like me (One more time)
Complacency (Woman like me), is the worst trait to have (Woman like me)
Are you crazy? (Woman like me)
You ain't never had, ain't never had a woman like me (Woman like me)
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy (Woman like me)
Consistency (Woman like me), is the gift to give for free and it is key

[Verse 1]
I know you've got things to do (I do, too)
I just wanna spend all my time with you (It feels so good)
I'm so hard to impress, don't leave me on this stretch alone
When I'm out at a party, I'm just excited to get home

[Chorus]
And dream about you
All night long

[Verse 2]
I don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)
It's all happenin' so easily (Like, oh, my God)
It's so hard to digest, usually, I'm best alone
But every time that you text, I want to get on the next flight home

[Chorus]
And dream next to you
All night long

[Verse 3]
Maybe it's the way you remind me of (Where I come from)
Or how you make me feel beautiful (And thеn some)
The sight of you is dramatic, one glimpsе and I panic inside
I get lost in our hours 'cause you possess powers I can't fight

[Chorus]
That's why I dream about you
All night long
All night long
All night

[Verse 1]
How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down
By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow
When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')
To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser

[Chorus]
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants somethin', you just want me

[Verse 2]
Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control?
Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?
In these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true

[Pre-Chorus]
You better believe for you, I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)
High tides (High tides, high tides)
'Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire, oh

[Chorus]
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free
Everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me

[Bridge]
Listen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time (Hope in time)
We both will find (We both find) peace of mind
Sometimes, the road less travelled is a road best left behind

[Chorus]
Well, I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free, yeah
'Cause everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me

[Refrain]
You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')
To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')
But the higher we climb, feels like we're both none the wiser

[Outro]
The only regret I have
I wish that it was just at a different time
A most turbulent period of my life
Why would I put that on you?
That's just, like, a very heavy thing to have to talk about
But because of that period of time
Even though it was so much fun
I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him
There were just memories in a big storm

[Verse 1]
I'll be taking flowers to the cemetery of my heart
For all of my lovers in the present and in the dark
Every anniversary, I'll pay respects and say I'm sorry
For they never stood a chance as if they could
When no one knows what it's like to be us

[Verse 2]
I've never seen the sky this colour before
It's like I'm noticin' everythin' a little bit more
Now that all the dust has settled
I rebut all my rebuttals
No one knows what it's likе to be us

[Chorus]
Strangers by nature
Strangеrs by nature

[Bridge]
Will I ever get there?
Oh, I hope that someday I'll learn
To nurture what I've done

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Alright then, I'm ready

[Verse 1]
Pave me a path to follow
And I'll tread any dangerous road
I will beg and I'll steal, I will borrow
If I can make, if I can make your heart my home
Throw me to the water
I don't care how deep or shallow
Because my heart can pound like thunder
And your love, and your love can set me free

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I have promised I will love you 'til the end of time
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly, and divine
I will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme
All I want is for you to be mine, mine

[Chorus]
So can I get it right now? Mmm
Can I get it right now? (Can I get it here?)
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it

[Post-Chorus]
Can I get it?

[Verse 2]
You tease me with your control
Because I long to live under your spell
And without your love, I'm hollow
I won't make it, I won't make it on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
I have promised I will love you 'til the end of time (End of time)
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly and divine (So divine)
I will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme (Mmm)
All I want is for you to be mine, mine

[Chorus]
So can I get it right now? Mmm
Can I get it right now? (Can I get it here?)
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it

[Post-Chorus]
Can I get it?

[Bridge]
When will you run with me?
Like I know you wanna
(Like you want to, like you want)
You're the one for me
And I'm countin' on you (On you)
To put the pieces of me back together

[Chorus]
So can I get it right now? Mmm
Can I get it right now? (Mmm)
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it

[Chorus]
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace

[Verse 1]
When I walk in a room, I'm invisible, I feel like a ghost
All my friends keep on tellin' me that this feeling won't last, mmm
I can't get no relief, I'm so tired of myself, I swear I'm dead in the eyes
I have nothin' to feel no more, I can't even cry

[Pre-Chorus]
When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper-thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared

[Chorus]
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace

[Verse 2]
When I wake up, I'm afraid of the idea of facin' the day
I would rather stay home on my own, drink it all away
Please stop callin' me, it's exhausting, there's really nothin' left to say
I created this storm, it's only fair I have to sit in its rain

[Pre-Chorus]
When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper-thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared

[Chorus]
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
All love is devout, no feeling is a waste
But give it to yourself now before it's too late
In the end, it's just you, stop drowning in wait
Your love is useless without it

[Chorus]
Cry your heart out (Cry, yeah), it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace

[Verse 1]
I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me comin' back even though I'm terrified

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight

[Verse 2]
I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight

[Bridge]
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Oh, Lord)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Don't let me let myself down)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Oh, my God)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Oh, my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
When it's a battle that I cannot fight

[Outro]
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (I know that it's wrong, but I want to have fun)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (I know that it's wrong, but I want to have fun)
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I grew a nipper in the wild wild west
And for a while I was at my best
So much so that I got hitched in a big white dress
But all it did was make me so sad and stressed
And so I got soaked in the wild wild west
I was gallivanting in the silhouettes
That's when I, I met a jingler in the, in the wild west
While he was sparrow-catching in the wilderness

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ooh)
Don't waste your time when I've got a (Ah-ooh) backbone of steel
(Ah-ooh)
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a (Ah-ooh) look that will kill
(Ah-ooh)
Don't waste your time when I've got a (Ah-ooh) backbone of steel
(Ah-ooh)
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill ya

[Chorus]
From LA to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I broke my heart in San Diego

[Verse 2]
Now I'm cutting shines in the wild wild west
I had to bed my man down to save my self
That's when I got churched in the, in the wild west
Not that I care, I find God so hard to impress

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah-ooh)
Don't waste your time when I've got a (Ah-ooh) backbone of steel
(Don't waste your time)
(Ah-ooh)
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a (Ah-ooh) look that will kill
(I'll shoot you down)
(Ah-ooh)
Don't waste your time when I've got a (Ah-ooh) backbone of steel
(Don't waste your time)
(Ah-ooh)
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill ya

[Chorus]
From LA to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I broke my heart in San Diego

[Bridge]
Wild in the west (It's so wild)
It's so wild in the west
(It's so wild, it's so wild)
(It's so wild in the west)
Wild wild west

[Chorus]
From LA to San Francisco
I lost my mind in (I lost my mind) San Bernardino
(Even Chula) Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I broke my heart (I broke my heart) in San Diego
From LA to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I break my heart wherever I go

[Verse 1]
You've got your eye on me after all these years
You think that I can't see you from over here
I may be out of your view, but I can hear you
I may be out of the room, but I can see you
I know you still want me, you always will
And I can guarantee I know just how it feels
To never be free completely
Sometimes you just feel so empty

[Pre-Chorus]
Like lately when I have been missing you
And I would still do anything for you

[Chorus]
But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

[Verse 2]
I was far too reckless, I know that now
Trying to make you jealous made me feel proud
But now I'm in too deep to climb out
But know that I live with my doubt, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Like lately when I have been missing you
And I want to do everything with you

[Chorus]
But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must, we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

[Bridge]
Since we were together everybody's changed
Our reflections in the mirror no longer look the same
And we're only just beginning to live the lives we'll make
But I will always miss you at the end of each day

[Chorus]
But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must, we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
My love, let's learn how to love who we're loving
It's so hard but we must, we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

[Outro]
But we can't be together
No, we won't be together

[Verse 1: Adele & Chris Stapleton]
There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

[Chorus: Adele & Chris Stapleton]
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

[Verse 2: Adele & Chris Stapleton]
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

[Chorus: Adele & Chris Stapleton]
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

[Bridge: Adele & Chris Stapleton]
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show

[Chorus: Adele & Chris Stapleton]
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I wеnt down, down, down and the flames went highеr
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

[Verse 1]
Not supposed to feel this way, I'm such a hypocrite
I always frown on love, it's giving me a tummy ache
(All these butterflies make me sick) Make me fly away
(It's some hocus pocus shit, I'm bewitched) Fly away

[Pre-Chorus]
Calling too much, you're breaking my phone
Mad when you do and sad when you don't
Chivalry, ooh, you taking my coat
Too cute, no, this ain't me now
Candlelight, out on a starry night
You brush my hair to the side
And you tell me I'm pretty

[Chorus]
Yuck, now you got me blushin'
Cheeks so red when the blood starts rushing
Yuck, that boy's so mushy
Sending me flowers, I'm just tryna get lucky
Yuck, lookin' at me all sucky
Yuck, quit acting like a puppy
Fuck, going all lovey-dovey on me

[Verse 2]
You got your hopеs high, thinking 'bout it most nights
Put me on a pedestal 'causе my love's incredible
Don't wait up for me
I can't make those plans, catch me if you can (Come catch me)
Just flew into Japan, come catch me (But don't you catch feels, that's so)

[Chorus]
Yuck, now you got me blushin'
Cheeks so red when the blood starts rushing
Yuck, that boy's so mushy
Sending me flowers, I'm just tryna get lucky
Yuck, lookin' at me all sucky
Yuck, quit acting like a puppy
Fuck, going all lovey-dovey on me

[Bridge]
All lovey-dovey on (Yuck)
All lovey-dovey on me (Why you do this to me?)
All lovey-dovey on (Yuck)
All lovey-dovey on me (Going all lovey-dovey on me)
All lovey-dovey on (Yuck)
All lovey-dovey on me (Why you do this to me?)
All lovey-dovey on (Fuck)
All lovey-dovey on me
(Why you do that? Why you do that? Why you do that?)

[Outro]
Yuck
Why you do that? Why you do that? (Mmm)
Yuck
Why you do that? Why you do that?
Yuck
(Why you do that to me?)
Yuck

[Verse 1]
I already know I'm letting go of something sacred
Drive us off the road, I take a good thing and I break it
Think it's in my soul, the way I run from something real, no, I ain't changing
Wish I could surrender, give you everything I got and let you know

[Pre-Chorus]
It's something 'bout the way you move me, yeah, yeah
It's something 'bout the way you save my life

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the way you hold my body tight even on my lowest nights
Locked down by my side even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away
It's something 'bout the way you

[Verse 2]
Call it what you want, I got a habit for destruction
Take all of your trust and then betray it like it's nothing
Yeah, I think it's in my soul, the way I run from something real and leave you wondering (Wondering)
Why I can't surrender, give you everything I got and let you know

[Pre-Chorus]
It's something 'bout the way you move me, yeah, yeah
It's something 'bout the way you save my life

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the way you hold my body tight even on my lowest nights
Locked down by my side even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away
It's something 'bout the way you

[Bridge]
Hold my body tight even on my lowest night
Locked down by my side even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away (Push you away)

[Outro]
It's something 'bout the way you, the way you
Way you move me
Way you move me
Yeah, yeah, move me
Yeah

[Chorus: JAMIE & Ty Dolla $ign, JAMIE]
I don't got friends, I got family
언제나 내 뒤에 that's all I need너와 나 that's what we'll always be
나머진 내 눈 밖에 'cause I don't got friends

[Verse 1: JAMIE]
쉽다고는 못 하겠어 매번
의미 없이 쏟아지는 mention
다들 원해 뭔가를 내게서
그럴수록 주변은 더 챙겨

[Pre-Chorus: JAMIE]
지붕 아래 우린 private
창 밖의 소음 다 무시해
내 옆에 너만 that's all I care
난 겁이 없어

[Chorus: JAMIE, JAMIE and Ty Dolla $ign, Ty Dolla $ign]
'Cause I don't got friends, I got family

And if I do you wrong, I'ma 'fess it (Wrong)
Eh, good energy, gotta protect it

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Bare feet on a fire walk, carry
You for miles until I crawl, trust me
Uh, tell me your secrets, they on lock, yeah (Lock, yeah)
I ain't alone on this one way

[Chorus: JAMIE and Ty Dolla $ign, JAMIE]
'Cause I don't got friends, I got family
언제나 내 뒤에 that's all I need
너와 나 that's what we'll always be
나머진 내 눈 밖에 'cause I don't got friends  (Ooh)
I got family (Ooh)

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
I need your energy, baby, don't need no friend or acquaintance
I need your love in a form that you won't give to nobody
Baby, I mean it, you taught me it was all, even inside of you
But I seen it, it's family over everything

[Pre-Chorus: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie, Ty Dolla $ign]
Baby, I love too hard
I just want you to have your fun 'cause life is too short
Take you out to eat in New York, let's go to Jue Lan (Yeah)
Gon’ make and lose friends when your money too long

[Chorus: All, JAMIE, Ty Dolla $ign]
'Cause I don't got friends, I got family
언제나 내 뒤에 that's all I need
너와 나 that's what we'll always be
나머진 내 눈 밖에 'cause I don't got friends (Ooh)
I got family (Ooh)
(Yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Huh, David Guetta, I told you they wouldn't — with us mayne
These glasses Celine, these Yeezy slides
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I'm still right here
What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

[Hook]
Yeah
I told myself I'd never do cocaine
I told myself I'd never do cocaine
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse]
In nothing but underpants
Running through the motherland
Go on stage, perform Starships at Summer Jam
(Hands up everybody)

[Verse]
Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Botella lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue

Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue

You wish and wish, and wish again
You’ve tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue
Child of Tibet, you’re a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue

She's there but really not there for me, ooh
Played my role and dealt my cards (Dealt my cards)

Wouldn't that be a tragedy, baby?

[Intro: Rickey Thompson]
'Scuse me, ah-ahem

[Chorus]
Y'all got me fucked up
Please don't get me fucked up
Now I'm really up, fuck
Damn, we got 'em sick, huh?
Hundred thousand flights
Pockets lookin' like they bricks, huh?
Said she couldn't find me, so a nigga put his wrist up
Wrist up, wrist up
Said she couldn't find me, so a nigga put his wrist up
Wrist up, wrist up
Said she couldn't find me, so a nigga put his wrist up

[Verse 1]
Got these niggas mad, and that envy shit is tragic
Young Aminé, baby, please don't, please don't, please don't touch my baggage
I'm so motherfuckin' pretty, put my face up on a jacket
Talkin' 'bout me like I care, but I'm at Disney doin' acid
I got a bitch that's bad
And a bitch that's super freaky, she got hella ass
Vanmoof on my bike, I let that drama pass
Niggas show some love, but tell me, what's the catch?
Tell me, what's the catch?

[Chorus]
Y'all got me fucked up
Please don't get me fucked up
Now I'm really up, fuck
Damn, we got 'em sick, huh?
Hundred thousand flights
Pockets lookin' like they bricks, huh?
Said she couldn't find me, so a nigga put his wrist up
Wrist up, wrist up
Said she couldn't find me, so a nigga put his wrist up
Wrist up, wrist up
Said she couldn't find me, so a nigga put his wrist up

[Verse 2]
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
You can't get that shit from me
Rappers wanna send a verse, I tell 'em, "Send a warranty" (Sheesh)
My ice real, yours make believe
Niggas sweet, I'm sugar-free
Flight to Paris in the mornin', but my pants is Japanese (I think that's him)
Rollin' deep (Really deep)
Like Adele (Oh my God)
Call my folks (Huh)
Tell 'em I'm doin' well
I'm ducked off somewhere in the cut
Said she can't see in the club, so I put my wrist up

[Chorus]
Y'all got me fucked up
Please don't get me fucked up
Now I'm really up, fuck
Damn, we got 'em sick, huh?
Hundred thousand flights
Pockets lookin' like they bricks, huh?
Said she couldn't find me, so a nigga put his wrist up
Wrist up, wrist up
Wrist up, wrist up
Y'all got me fucked up

[Verse]
Was it something I said to your face when I was talking on forever the drive that made you throw up that night?
You swear and you did it again and now these days I get so sick of the sight of you, I turn off the light
I bet you never ever thought you were a person I needed (ah, ah-ah-ah)
Because you’re so so thrown away, and does it more than easily (ah, ah-ah-ah)
Sometimes I bring up past adventures so that I can make you see (ah, ah-ah-ah)
How I feel about the current situation that we’re in (ah, ah-ah-ah)
There was a time in my life that I thought I could maybе earn your heart and mind
Like thе stars were aligned
This wasn't an option at all so therе's no surprise that we started to stall
When I was destined to fall

[Chorus]
I turned my phone off but your call still come through
I don't know why they do, I don't even like you
The very next day you tried again and again
I don't know why you call me when I see the end (Hey!)
I turned my phone off but your call still come through
I reply when they do 'cause I want to chat to you
The very next day we speak again and again
I pick up when you call me so we won't see the end

[Outro]
(i-i-i-i)
(i-i-i)
Won't see the end
(i-i-i-i)
(i-i-i-i)
Won't see the end

[Chorus]
I wanna be happy, like when I find a Starburst that's colored pink
And then I find myself feelin’ like the colors in between
Stranger to my family so now, I get no sleep
My inside's colored blue, but girl, my Range is colored green
Happy like when I find a Starburst that's colored pink
And then I find myself feelin’ like the colors in between
Stranger to my family so now, I get no sleep
My inside's colored blue, but girl, my Range is colored green

[Post-Chorus]
Green, blue, blue, blue, green
Pink, pink, green
Blue, blue, blue, green
Like the colors, blue, blue, green
Blue, bluе, blue, green
Like the pink, pink, green
Likе the blue, blue, blue, green

[Verse 1]
I got no time for all these bitches, but they keep on ringin' on me
Yeah, these girls, they think we cuffed up but this ain't no matrimony
When it come to being numb, that's how I feel on the daily
I'm Adam Daniel to mama but Young Aminé to ladies
Okay, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow, how the fuck you do this shit?
I been getting green, but somehow, I can't find no happiness
Purple in the sky so I'm high, but ain’t no sloppiness
Red eyes from my redeye, but her red eyes from the Aniston

[Chorus]
I wanna be happy, like when I find a Starburst that’s colored pink
And then I find myself feelin' like the colors in between
Stranger to my family so now, I get no sleep
My inside’s colored blue, but girl, my Range is colored green
Happy like when I find a Starburst that's colored pink
And then I find myself feelin' like the colors in between
Stranger to my family so now, I get no sleep
My inside's colored blue, but girl, my Range is colored green

[Verse 2]
Look, please be humble, don’t end up broke
Hearts full when they beat the most
Cherish moments with homies, I spent twenty K up in Mexico
Portland, Paris, I'm coast to coast
Bottega from knee to toe
Need my family, I keep 'em close
Me and my girl, we Cheech and Cho'
Lames want me to fail, but then, they girls want me to rail
Built the name "Aminé," got no help and gave 'em hell, ugh
When it's a gray area, it colors out itself
The real just stay the real, and yeah, the fakes just stay themselves

[Outro]
I wanna know how you feel about it
Does every hour feel like it's counted?
Tell me, do you think you can manage?
I wanna know how you feel about it
'Bout it (Ayy), 'b-b-b-bout it
Wanna know how you feel about it
Tell me, do you think you can manage?
I wanna know how you feel about it

[Intro]
Spendin' time with my—
Ass keep jumpin'
Jumpin', it's a function
Function, gotta love it
Jumpin', it's a function
Function, gotta love it

[Chorus]
So I say, beatin' on the box like, "Dididumduhduh"
Leather in the seats, and it feel like butter
Ice on my grill, and you know the shit flooded
Canary yellow on me 'cause I like these colors
That's my bitch, and we don't use rubbers
Top two, and your bitch know my number
Butterfly wings on that ass gon' flutter
Beatin' on the box like, "Dididumduhduh"

[Verse 1]
I'm in this bitch with my niggas, I'm feelin' myself
You in this bitch with your bitches, you feelin' yourself
Let's get together and let's start feelin' ourself
Wishin' my niggas good money and only good health
Throw my keys to the valet
This my day to day
I do shit my way
Feel like Yung Joc when I sway
I got bitches doin' this
They got bitches doin' that
I don't care what all my critics say
I cannot tit-for-tat, yeah

[Chorus]
Beatin' on the box like, "Dididumduhduh"
Leather in the seats, and it feel like butter
Ice in my grill, and you know the shit flooded
Canary yellow on me 'cause I like these colors
That's my bitch, and we don't use rubbers
Top two, and your bitch know my number
Butterfly wings on that ass gon' flutter
Beatin' on the box like, "Dididumduhduh"

[Verse 2]
Twenties, thirties, fifties, hundreds
Anything I fuckin' wanted
Came back, I been gunnin' for it
Now in this bitch, I can throw it, yes

[Intro]
It's a plane, it's a bird (It's a God)

[Chorus]
Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh
Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh
Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh
Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh

[Verse]
Last year, y'all was actin' mad funny, uh
This year, you want all the cash money, uh
I gotta go get the bag, homie
Talkin', but they keepin' tabs on me
I said, "B-I-G"
I'm a big, big deal, uh
Crawlin' on the floor, she a Navy SEAL
I can't do the bubbly, I'ma sip the still
Got a free facial 'cause we us, we gettin' Jordan pPeels
Fuck her, love her, never cuff her, I'm a cold motherfucker
From the town, dick her down, give it to her like no other
Bust a window, bust it in the, eat that pussy up for dinner
Beat it up then eat it up, she cancel plans for me to fuck
We finna make babies tonight, goo-goo-ga-ga
Fuckin' all these bitches all up out they chanclas
Mommy disappointed 'cause she want a Sara
I'm the African Darth Vader, baby, I'm your fada

[Bridge]
It's my last night in New York, let's maybe link up after
I'm exhausted, but a Yerba's all it takes to start this chapter
The roof filled with stars, we yellin', "Who the fuck is NASA?"
You bat your eyes, so we fuckin' at the after-after, like

[Chorus]
Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh
Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh
Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh
Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh

[Outro]
Last year, y'all was actin' mad funny

[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
(Oh-oh-oh)

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."

[Chorus 2]
You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it? (Hold on) (Yeah, yeah)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on) (Yeah, yeah)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now)

[Intro]
Here's another song from the show that we did at Folsom Prison, it's in the album that's out this week, it's called The "Cocaine Blues"

[Verse]
Early one morning while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving .44 beneath my head
Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico
Laid in the hot joints taking the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willie Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down
I said yes sir, my name is Willie Lee
If you got a warrant, just read it to me
Shot her down because she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and it took me back
I had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Got up next morning about a half past nine
Spied a sheriff coming down the line
Hopped and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, come on you dirty hack into that district court
Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before that jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered, lordy lordy, have mercy on me
The judge, he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you hops and listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be

[Outro]
Thank you

[Intro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

[Chorus]
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

[Verse 2]
The Judge said, "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, you won’t have to die"
I spoke not a word, though it mеant my life
I'd been in the arms of my best friеnd's wife
Now the scaffold seemed high, and eternity was near
She stood in the crowd, but she shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries on my bones

[Chorus]
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

[Outro]
Thank you, we had several requests to do this one again, and, um, and it you have any questions we’ll try to pull through, yeah, ok, ok, I will, I will, ok

[Verse 1]
Hey, look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
It's the Orange Blossom Special
Bringin' my baby back

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm going down to Florida
And get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy
And get some sand in my shoes
I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special
And lose these New York blues

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude]
"Hey, say man, when you going back to Florida?"
"When am I goin' back to Florida? I don't know, don't reckon I ever will."
"Ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York?"
"Well, I don't care if I do-die-do-die-do-die-do-die."

[Verse 3]
Hey talk about a-ramblin'
She's the fastеst train on the line
Talk about a-travellin'
Shе's the fastest train on the line
It's that Orange Blossom Special
Rollin' down the seaboard line

[Verse 1]
Bring a drink of water Leroy, bring a drink of water, no
If I could get to mercy man he's give me some, I know
I got a gal in Vickburg, Bertha is her name
I wish I's tied to Bertha instead of this ball and chain
I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah
A dude took all my money, he wouldn't let me see the cards
I'llve a lost about a hundred years for sleepin' in his backyard
I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah, that's right, Memphis, uh-huh

[Chorus]
Like a bitter weed I'm a bad seed but when that levee's through and I am too
Let the honky-tonk roll on come mornin' I'll be gone
I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah

[Verse 2]
I never been to Chicago but it must bе a mighty fine place
I couldn't get past Tеnnessee with Mississippi all over my face
I'm goin' to Memphis
On the freezing ground at night is my own fold in bed
Hulk salad is my bread and meat and it will be 'til I'm dead
Another boy is down, that shovel burned his out
Well another boy is down the shovel burned him out
Let me stand on his body to see what the shoutin's about

[Chorus]
Like a bitter weed I'm a bad seed but when that levee's thru and I am too
Let the honky tonk roll on come mornin' I'll be gone
I'm goin' to Memphis yeah Memphis

[Verse 3]
I brought me a little water in a Mr. Prince Albert can
But the bossman caught me drinkin' it and I believe he broke my hand, mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm
They all call me crazy for sayin' it's Mr. Scott
My brother was killed for the deed I didn't remember why
I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah

[Chorus]
Like a bitter weed I'm a bad seed but when that levee's through and I am too
Let the honky-tonk roll on come mornin' I'll be gone
I'm goin' to Memphis, that's right Memphis town

[Intro]
Ira Hayes
Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 1]
Gather round me, people there’s a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian that we should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian, a proud and peaceful band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down the ditches for a thousand years, the water grew Ira's peoples' crops
Until the whitе man stole the water rights, and thе sparkling water stopped
Now Ira’s folks were hungry, and their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered, and forgot the white man's greed

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 2]
There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill, two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again
And when the fight was over, and when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 3]
Ira Hayes returned a hero, celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand
But he was just a Pima Indian, no water, no home, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira done, and when did the Indians dance?
Then Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it, like you'd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning, alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was a grave for Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Outro]
Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes, but his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died

[Intro]
...

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

[Verse]
Looked cloudy in the west and it looked like rain
Round the curve came a passenger train
Northbound train on a southbound track
He's alright a leaving but he won't be back

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

[Verse 1]
Well you ask me if I'll forget my baby, I guess I will, someday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll get along, I guess I will, someway
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

[Chorus]
God gave me that girl to lean on, then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man and have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

[Verse 2]
You ask me if I'll miss her kisses, I guess I will, every day
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll find another, I don't know, I can't say
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

[Chorus]
God gave me that girl to lean on, then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man and have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

[Verse]
Oh, I'll twine mid my ringlets of raven black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so pale
And the myrtle so bright with an emerald hue
The pale amaryllis and violets look like blue
I will dance I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart in the crowd, I will sway
But I'm longing to see human regret in our cowar
He's gone and neglected his pale white flower

[Outro]
I don't sing to much of that, and I can hardly stand it

[Intro]
Thank you very much, ok, ok, alright, I will do that one for you, first here is a- ok, wha- ok, we'll do those for you right now, here is another Bob Dylan song we recorded that hasn't been released yet

[Verse 1]
Down the street the dogs are barking
And the day is getting dark
When the night begins to fall
The dogs will lose their bark
And the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind

[Chorus]
And I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

[Verse 2]
It's a restless hungry feeling
That don't mean no one no good
When everything I'm saying
You can say it just as good
You'rе right from your side
I'm right from mine

[Chorus]
We'rе both just one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

[Verse 3]
From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes start to fade
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
And I gaze across the street
To the sidewalk and the sign

[Chorus]
And I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

[Verse 1]
Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
And it isn't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It never do anyhow

[Chorus]
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 2]
Well, it ain't no use in turning on your light, gal
That light I never know
Oh, it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
I ain't not saying you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You know, you just kinda-sorta wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right
So long honey babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, girl
So I'll just kinda say fare thee well

[Chorus]
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
I said, don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 1]
I found him by the railroad track this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said
He said they let me out of prison out in Frisco
For ten long years I've paid for what I’ve done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

[Chorus]
Give my love to Rose please, won't you mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don’t forget to give my lovе to Rose

[Verse 2]
Won't you tell them I said thanks for waiting for mе
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
'Cause it ain't right that she should live alone
Mister here's the bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
Now don't forget to give my love to Rose

[Chorus]
Give my love to Rose please, won't you mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy’s so proud of him
And don’t forget to give my love to Rose

[Verse 1]
The old home town still looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa
Down the lane, I look, and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Chorus]
Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of the old tree as they lay me
'Neath the green, green grass of home

[Verse 2]
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I look, and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like chеrries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Thеn I awake and look around me
To the cold gray walls that surround me
And then I realize that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard, and a sad old padre
Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak
And at the end, I'll touch the green, green grass of home

[Chorus]
Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade of the old tree as they lay me
'Neath the green, green grass of home

[Verse]
Old Apache Squaw, how many long lean years you saw?
How many bitter winter nights shivering in a cold teepee?
Shivering in a cold teepee
Old Apache Squaw, how many hungry kids you saw?
How many bloody warriors running to the sea, running to the sea?

[Chorus]
Well, now they tell me that you saw Cochise
When he made his last stand
He said, "The next white man that sees my face
Is going to be a dead white man"
Old Apache Squaw, how many hungry kids you saw?
Have you had misty eyes for years?
Could that mist be tears? Could that mist be tears?
Well, now they tell me that you saw Cochise
When he made his last stand
He said, "The next white man that sees my face
Is going to be a dead white man"
Old Apache Squaw, how many hungry kids you saw?
How many bloody warriors running to the sea, running to the sea? Old Apache Squaw

[Intro]
Alright, we'll do that one for you, out of all the wars that have been I think that this is about the only thing that ever gave me any of them, it's any good, and it's a song, that was handed down to me

[Verse]
The years creep slowly by, Lorena
Snow is on the grass again
The sun is sleek and low down the sky, Lorena
Frost is where the flowers have been
The music sad and lone, Lorena
Happy sounds have left the day
The banjo's softly played, Lorena
Where once they rang so loud and gay
I hardly feel the cold, Lorena
I pray the darkness soon will fade
We'll sing those songs again, Lorena
You'll be in my arms at last

[Outro]
...

[Verse 1]
I close my eyes and picture
The emerald of the sea
From the fishing boats at Dingle
To the shores of Donaghadee
I miss the river Shannon
And the folks at Skibbereen
The moorlands and the meadows
With their forty shades of green

[Pre-Chorus]
But most of all I miss a girl
In Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her lips
As soft as eiderdown

[Chorus]
Again I want to see and do
The things we've done and seen
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar
And there's forty shades of green

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could spend an hour
At Dublin's churching surf
I'd love to watch the farmers
Drain the bogs and spadе the turf
To see again the thatching
Of the straw thе women glean
I'd walk from Cork to Larne to see
The forty shades of green

[Pre-Chorus]
But most of all I miss a girl
In Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her lips
As soft as eiderdown

[Chorus]
Again I want to see and do
The things we've done and seen
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar
And there's forty shades of green

[Verse 1]
Well, bad news travels like wildfire, good news travels slow
They all call me Wildfire 'cause because everybody knows
I'm bad news everywhere I go

[Chorus]
Always getting in trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go
They tried to hang me in Oakland and they did in Francisco
But I wouldn't choke, I broke the rope and they had to let me go
'Cause I'm bad news everywhere I go
Always getting in trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go
They tried to hang me in Oakland and the did in Francisco
But I wouldn't choke, I broke their rope and they had to let me go
Because I'm bad news everywhere I go
Well, from north to south, to east to west, story is the same
One state to another I have to change my name
'Cause I'm bad news everywhere I go
Always getting in trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go

[Verse 2]
Well, now I've picked peaches in Georgia, I lumber jacked in Maine
I've been hired, fired and jailed in any town you can name
Because I'm bad news everywhere I go
I'm always getting in trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go

[Verse 1: Both, Johnny Cash]
We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin’ 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out
I'm going to Jackson, I’m gonna mess around
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson, look out Jackson town

[Verse 2: June Carter, Johnny Cash]
Well, go on down to Jackson, go ahead and wreck your health
Go play your hand you big-talkin' man, make a big fool of yourself
Yeah, go to Jackson; go comb your hair
I am gonna snowball Jackson

[Verse 3: Johnny Cash & June Carter]
When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow
All them women gonna make me, teach 'em what they don't know how
I'm goin' to Jackson, you turn-a loose-a my coat
Yeah, I’m goin’ to Jackson
That's all she wrote

[Verse 4: June Carter]
But they’ll laugh at you in Jackson, and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Kеg
They'll lead you ’round town like a scoldеd hound
With your tail tucked between your legs
Yeah, I'll go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson, behind my Japan Fan

[Verse 5: Both]
Well now, We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper Sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson, and that's a fact
Yeah, we're goin' to Jackson, ain't never comin' back

[Outro: June Carter & Johnny Cash]
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm mhmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm
Well, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout'
And we've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went...

[Pre-Chorus]
Two lovers stood in the white, white sand
A dark-eyed maiden and her tall lover man
With surprise and pain in her eyes
She clung to the hand of her tall lover man

[Chorus]
They're lyin’ to me, aren't they, Jim
She asked him
That fair-haired girl with those blue, blue eyes
Is not your wife, is she Jim
And with tears in her eyes and her sad, sad cries
She clung to the hand of her tall lover man

[Verse]
In thе darkness, he let go of hеr hand
I'm not to blame, it was a game
’Cause that fair-haired woman is my wife
And she will be all of my life
You're lyin' to me, aren't you Jim, she asked him
If lovin' me was a sport, then your life shall be short
She said to him, my Jim
And the blade of the maid struck the man
And the blood flowed in the sand from her tall lover man

[Pre-Chorus]
Two lovers lyin' in the white, white sand
I'll die with you, my tall lover man
And her blade found its mark in the dark
She clung to the hand of her tall lover man

[Chorus]
They're lyin’ to me, aren’t they, Jim, she asked him
That fair-haired girl won't be your wife
And with tears in her eyes and sad, sad cries
She died in the sand with her tall lover man

[Spoken Word]
Thank you, he's-he's still swallering so I'll take just a minute to do a little something for you, uh, if some of you people came in late tonight I'm sorry that my mother, Maybelle Carter, and my sister Taylor and Aneeda aren't with us, there was a miss understanding someway and some people got the impression that they were supposed to be here, but they weren't really supposed to be here, so thеy're not, is- is why they're not hеre, and anyway the songs that I've sung down through the years lots of times have been the songs of the old original Carter family, and in the past that's- well thank you very much for remembering, I'd like to do just a short melody of some of the songs that the Carter family did back in the 20's and the 30's, these were the songs that came from the south-western corner of the state of Virginia where we were born and raised, and sung by my mother, Maybelle Carter, my uncle A.P., and my Sarah, there was about 300 in all, but these are just a few of my favorites and maybe some place you heard some of them and maybe you never heard any of them and I couldn't care less, I'm gonna sing them all in a minute
I sung a little of this, well, I sung it all the first show, I'll sing a bit of it, and then I'll go to some of the others if they did, and, we'll see what happens from there

[Chorus]
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Islands
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

[Outro]
...

[Verse]
Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
She's from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball

[Chorus]
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonеsome hoboes call
Traveling through thе jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

[Chorus]
And it takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long
Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg
Yeah, there's twenty-nine links of chain around my leg
Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg
And on each leg, the initials of my name
And it takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long

[Intro: Johnny Cash]
Here's a song Carl Perkins wrote, he used to play it

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash & June Carter Cash]
Well I'm going start out walking, just you wait and see
Uh-huh guitar picker, you ain't leaving without me

[Chorus: Johnny Cash, June Carter Cash & Both]
Oh you big mouth woman
You long legged guitar picking man
But we can work this out, uh huh
Yes ma'am I think we can, uh huh

[Verse 2: Johnny Cash & June Carter Cash]
I stole the Hope diamond, hoping I could shut your mouth
How am I going wear it, if I got to hide it out

[Chorus: Johnny Cash, June Carter Cash & Both]
Oh you big mouth woman
You long legged guitar picking man
But we can work this out, uh huh
Yes ma'am I think we can, uh huh

[Verse 3: Johnny Cash & June Carter Cash]
Well I bought you a first class ticket for a luxury liner cruise
I got out in that ocean, looked around and there was you

[Chorus: Johnny Cash, June Carter Cash & Both]
Oh you big mouth woman
You long legged guitar picking man
But we can work this out, uh huh
Yes ma'am I think we can, uh huh

[Verse 4: Johnny Cash & June Carter Cash]
I gave you a big long limousine, but I don't want no car
I gave my love and еverything, but you're still what you are

[Chorus: Johnny Cash, June Carter Cash & Both]
Oh you big mouth woman
You long lеgged guitar picking man
But we can work this out, uh huh
Yes ma'am I think we can, uh huh

[Outro: Johnny Cash]
Oh honey, I love that big sweet mouth

[Verse 1]
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound of wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

[Verse 2]
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire, the ring of fire

[Chorus]
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, Big River
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, southern drawl
Then I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River when you called

[Verse 2]
Then you took me to St. Louis later on down the river
A freighter said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone
Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you, Big River, more than me

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on a farm
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 2]
He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 3]
He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattlе town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walkеd into a bar
And laid his money down
And his mother's words echoed again

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 4]
He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself atlast he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And his mother's words echoed again

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 5]
Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered around
And wondered at his final words

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Chorus]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 1]
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 2]
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're minе, I walk the line

[Verse 3]
You've got a way to keep mе on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Chorus]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Outro]
...

[Verse 1]
Stop the music right now 'cause it don't feel right
I've been trying to get close to you all night
Follow my lead, I promise it'll be alright
Can you hear it coming? Can you hear that sound?

[Chorus]
Just slow down
Hold my hair back and make me proud
Banging on my chest, you're the best and you know that
Baby can we slow down? Slow down

[Verse 2]
Stop the music and pour me all over you
Oh baby, you're the rhythm and I am the beat you choose
I close my eyes so I feel everything you do
Can you feel it coming? Can you hear the sound?

[Pre-Chorus]
Meet me on the left side
And drown me in the right light
I choose you out of all these guys
This is your night
This white wine
Is blurring up my eyesight
Keep telling you I'm all right
I'm all right

[Chorus]
But slow down
Hold my hair back and make me proud
Banging on my chest, you're the best and you know now (Yeah, yeah)
Baby can we slow down? Slow down

[Outro]
Slow
Slow
Slow

[Verse 1]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl (Girl)

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent thе night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffectеd, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Verse 2]
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

[Chorus]
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Outro]
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
If you were a teacher I would fail your class
Take it over and over till you noticed me
If you were a waiting room I would never see a doctor
I would sit there with my first-aid kit and bleed

I wanna be the power ballad that lifts you up and holds you down
I wanna be the broken love song that feeds your misery
And I can wish all that I want
But it won't bring us together
Plus I know whatever happens to me, I know it's for the better

When broken bodies are washed ashore
Who am I to ask for more, more, more?
But your breathing in my opеn mouth
You're the gun in my lips that will blow my brains out

I wanna make you drivе all night just because I said "maybe you should come over"
I wanna make you fall in love as hard as my poor parents teenage daughter
She'll be the best you ever had if you let her

I know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
Know it's for the better
I never grew up with you
And you're not my waiting room

[Intro]
One, two, one, two

[Verse 1]
You lied to me
And now I see
A liars all
You'll ever be
You let me down
You fooled around
And now you get
To watch me now

[Chorus]
I'm gonna get even
Wait and see
You're gonna be so sorry
When I get through with you
You're gonna wish you'd never been born
I'm gonna get even
Gonna mess you up
Theres a whole lot more boys out there to love
You'll never have another chance
To break my heart no more
I'm gonna get even
I'm gonna get even

[Verse 2]
I'll never kiss
Your lips again
'Cause now I know
Where they have been
And I've got big plans (I've got big plans)
For my revenge
But you won't know how (But you won't know how)
You won't know when

[Chorus]
I'm gonna get even
Wait and see
You're gonna be so sorry
When I get through with you
You're gonna wish you'd never been born
I'm gonna get even, yeah
I'm gonna get even
Gonna mess you up
There's a whole lot of boys out there to love
You'll never have another chance
To break my heart no more
I'm gonna get even
I'm gonna get even
Yeah, I'm gonna get even
I'm gonna get even

[Outro]
You lied to me
And now I see
A liars all
You'll ever be

[Verse 1]
Do we really have to grow up?
If we never do, then so what?
So what if I don't wanna, what if I'm just gonna
Stay drunk on all the years that I just wish would slow up?

[Chorus]
We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun

[Verse 2]
Lеt's put a little more in your glass
Walk around and spend all our cash
Just lеt me grab my poncho, I don't care where we go
If we speak the language you know we don't even have to come back

[Chorus]
We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun

[Chorus]
We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when it's done
So let's love hard
Let's stay young
Let's love hard, live fast, die fun
Die fun
We can't do it over

[Verse 1]
Between the lunch and dinner rush
Kelly caught that outbound bus for Vegas
We're all out here talking trash, making bets
Lips wrapped round our cigarettes
She always thought she was too good to be a waitress

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, we all say that we'll quit someday
When our ship comes in, we'll just sail away

[Chorus]
But we're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke

[Verse 2]
Well, Janie got divorced again
Her ex-husband's in the pen
For two to five, or five to ten and longer, hah
And Brenda's traded smokes for cake
Still hadn't lost that baby weight
And that baby's 'bout to graduate from college

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I just flick an ash into the tray
And tell them both it'll be okay

[Chorus]
But I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke

[Bridge]
We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake, yeah
We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake

[Middle 8]
Wipe down the bar, take out the trash
Light one up and count my cash
Swear I'm never coming back again

[Chorus]
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah, we're just blowin' smoke

[Pre-Chorus]
You looked me in my eyes
Told me this was over
Now you're tryna catch a vibe
Being single's vulnerable
I'm scared up out my mind
Hurt but the show must go on
Now, please, don't change your mind

[Chorus]
I got shit to lose, I got shit to lose
I got shit to lose, I got shit to lose
I got shit to lose, I got shit to lose
I got shit to lose, I got shit to lose
I got shit to lose, I can't do the bullshit
(Stop callin my fuckin' phone)

[Verse]
Look baby, I got shit to lose
Importantly my peace and my p's and q's
I'm gettin' to this bread, I can't get with you
I'm tryna grab this bag, cannot grab no food
Look
Girl we got a lasting connection
You ain't gotta be passive aggressive
A lotta grey texts, you don't get the message
"Fuck nigga go ahead and run to the next bitch"
I know you wanna know what I'm up to
And you're mad 'cause a nigga really up too
Jacquemus on my jeans and my shirt too
I know you wanna take it off but I'm cool
Scratch on my back 'cause you miss me like that
Cannot do that 'cause the city on that
I'm over you on mamas
I don't want no drama

[Pre-Chorus]
You looked me in my eyes
Told me this was over
Now you're tryna catch a vibe
Being single's vulnerable
I'm scared up out my mind
Hurt but the show must go on
Now, please, don't change your mind

[Chorus]
I got shit to lose, I got shit to lose
I got shit to lose, I got shit to lose
I got shit to lose, I got shit to lose
I got shit to lose, I got shit to lose

I think it's meant to be

[Verse]
Grew up and got rich
Back of my mind, boy, I still ain't shit
I used to wait in line for a sneaker and a pic
Now I'm getting one of one's from Salehe, I'm the shit
I got diamonds in my mouth
I smoke about an ounce
Used to wonder how I'd make it out
Now I touch the stage get paid a house
Used to dream 'bout this, then live it now
Mama want that whip, I bought it now
Papa look at me and say he proud
I said, "My papa look at me and say hе proud"

[Bridge]
I could, I could, I could do you worse
I-I'm finna do you worse
I could do you worse

Set up
In the cycle of love
Get up
And do what you want to
'Cause everything comes to the side of you
You know what it means
Give up
If you wanna survive
Give up, oh
Come on, I have everything
Since this at a loose end
I won't
Want some love head on
Oh, what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Give up, over tonight
Everything comes with sad and then it dies
But you need no-one
Unleashed
Unleashed
Unlеashed

[Verse 1]
Lookin' back at the years gone by
When The Message changed my life
Heavy metal, the nest was dead
Well, and the rappers gave delight
But I don’t know who
Was looking out for anyone like me and you
A-maybe here with Siouxsie Sioux

[Verse 2]
Day to day was the way we play
Well, everybody needs to eat
Girl is gone and the front door too
Well, I guess we move our feet
And I don't know why
The color of your eyes was stolen from thе sky
And earthquakes nevеr need to lie

[Chorus]
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you now
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you

[Verse 3]
Everyone and their best friend knew
That the west was overdue
Growin' out of the fertile dirt
Well, and the cracks were fallin’ through
But I don't know what I'm looking for
I only know the deepest cut
It's coming from my gut

[Verse 4]
Parking lot of the old Starwood
Where the Misfits like to go
Billy Zoom and his silver string
Well, it just might be John Doe
Well, I don't know where
I'm gonna sleep tonight
Please tell me, can you spare
A pillow for my head and hair?

[Chorus]
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you now
Now's here, my love
Aquatic mouth dance is waiting for you now

[Verse 5]
Pucker up for the hologram
I better find out who I am
Let it out with a downtown scream
Because we need more space to jam
But I don't know how
To turn it down, I end up being so damn loud
Ah, bend your brow, ah, bend it now

[Verse 6]
Prototopical Sunday nights
Smog flowers, they don’t bite
Dirty skies never worked so hard
Better step to the Angels Flight
And I don’t know if
The embers of my burning flame
Are from this spliff
The greatest gift, the greatest gift

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 7]
Peppered up at the Cathay bash
And with a forty-five to split
Spillin' beer was a good fountain
Like the milk from a mother’s tits
But I don't know slow
Someone has to come and teach me self-control
Or should I just say "Fuck it" and we go?

[Outro]
(That was pretty good)

[Verse 1]
I wanna be touched
That's the language that I learned, the hard way
'Cause I never got enough
I wanna be touched
It's not asking much

[Verse 2]
And I wanna forget
Just how hard I thought it was
To be loved
Back when I hadn't let you yet
I wanna forget (Ooh)
All of that (Ooh)

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't about the fall
It's who'll catch you when you land
It took a time or three to understand
That it ain't how bad you break
It's how the bones get set again
And it feels so good to know I finally am
In good hands

[Post-Chorus]
Just touch me (Ooh)
I'm in good hands (Ooh)

[Verse 3]
I wanna be held
'Cause I've always been held back
The wrong way
It's the only way I felt
I wanna be held (Ooh)

[Verse 4]
I wanna be yours
Never thought I'd say the words and mean it
Now I couldn't mean it more
I wanna be yours (Ooh)
And I'm sure (Ooh)

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't about the fall
It's who'll catch you when you land
It took a time or three to understand
That it ain't how bad you break
It's how the bones will set again
And it feels so good to know I finally am
In good hands

[Post-Chorus]
Just touch me (Ooh)
I'm in good hands (Ooh)

[Bridge]
So close your eyes and read my palms
Mmh, mmh, mmh
They'll tell you everything I want
Ooh, ooh, aah

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't about the fall
It's who'll catch you when you land
It took a time or three to understand
That it ain't how bad you break
It's how the bones will set again
And it feels so good to know I finally am
In good hands

[Post-Chorus]
Just touch me (Ooh)
I'm in good hands (Ooh)

[Intro]
Ayy, live from the mix, yeah

[Chorus]
That thing stay bussin' like an AK for real
This year tough, I'm tryna stay sane for real
These girls coming with the same-same for real (For real)
Competition weak and I play games for real
All I ever knew was live it up
Me and all the dawgs on the grind right now, girl, sure enough
Tryna find balance, tryna find balance, split it up
Split it up, to love you right, I gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up (Six)

[Verse 1]
I'm in my bag again, don't get you mad again
Booty so big that they think you're East African
You get so loose in my room, I don't know what's happening
She says "I'll be your girl when words match your actions", and
She knows I got some ho friends, she knows I'm a lot like them
She's not no dummy when I say, "It's a work trip in Dominican"
She knows I'm sinning again, she knows
Good God, damn, I can't get shit by you
I can't be sleepin' on you, I wanna put some shit on you
Look how it sits on you, eugh, those tights might rip on you
Slave to the cat, I prove it, God gave me six lives too
Your ex, your ex, well, he move like six times two
He a whole fuckin' 12 ass nigga
He been out here talkin' down for a minute
I'ma have to move neatly for you
You gon' have to break me off a piece when I do
You gon' have to come to terms with the truth

[Chorus]
That thing stay bussin' like an AK for real
This year tough, I'm tryna stay sane for real
These girls coming with the same-same for real (For real)
Competition weak and I play games for real
All I ever knew was live it up
Me and all the dawgs on the grind right now, girl, sure enough
Tryna find balance, tryna find balance, split it up
Split it up, to love you right, I gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up (Six)

[Verse 2]
I'm in my bag again, won't get you mad ever again
I know, that discussion went left on us like fork in a road
I let it go, I'm down to let it go, oh
All I need from you is patience, patience
Heartbreak Drake is trippin' on vacation
Not relations, bad news travels fast to me
These days in my conversations, allegations, yeah
I knew you kept a few things on the go
I never asked so you never told
Touch on yourself, I'll sit front row
I'm down to see how things unfold
Want you, that's one thing I know

[Outro]
To love you right I gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up (Six)
I'm in my bag again, don't get you mad again
Booty so big that they think you're East African
You get so loose in my room
I don't know what's happening

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
Haters gonna hate, it's tragic
Don't drive the wrong way in traffic
Natural, not plastic
Still classy, little bit ratchet
Shine is holographic
Do you still believe in magic?
The gun look like its static
If I bring that heat, better match it

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Side by side we ride, and we're gonna take it worldwide
My vibe attracts one tribe, and we're never gonna run and hide
Side by side we ride, and we're gonna take it worldwide
My vibe attracts one tribe, and wе're never gonna run and hidе

[Post-Chorus: M.I.A.]
Godsend, World Town represent
We don't even need a president
One where we reinvent
Ninety nine and the one percent

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
In my tribe, I'm a savage
In the club, totin' on a ratchet
Anybody want smoke, we gon' let 'em have it
But I still end up livin' lavish
For my tribe, I'm a savage
In the club, totin' on a ratchet
If they want smoke, hell yeah, they can have it
Then I go back to livin' lavish
For my tribe, I done got rich, for the whole gang
All the opps wasn't on shit, call 'em ho gang
So much money, I use Benjamin to make a paper plane
Listenin' to Paper Planes, shoutout M.I.A (Oh)
I'm a cowboy, yippee ki-yay (Oh)
What's a Sway to a fuckin' Kanye? (Oh)
What's a Juice to a M.I.A?
Obviously a goat 'cause we on a song (Hey)
I guess I'm better then
A lot of niggas that's thinkin' that I'm irrelevant
They must be catchin' Alzheimer's, need some medicine
I only been here a year, they making comparisons already

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Side by side we ride, and we're gonna take it worldwide
My vibe attracts one tribe, and we're never gonna run and hide
Side by side we ride, and we're gonna take it worldwide
My vibe attracts one tribe, and we're never gonna run and hide

[Post-Chorus: M.I.A.]
Godsend, World Town represent
We don't even need a president
One where we reinvent
Ninety nine and the one percent
Godsend, what a time represent
We don't even need a president
One where we reinvent
Ninety nine and the one percent

[Bridge: M.I.A.]
But it can't buy love, I'm bein' honest
But it does buy the things that’s the finest
What you gonna do to define us?
Alliance, so defiance
This time, one for mankind
If we ever fuck it up, we can't rewind
My tribe, can't live a lie
If we ever have to, rather die

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
Side by side we ride, and we're gonna take it worldwide
My vibe attracts one tribe, and we're never gonna run and hide
Side by side we ride, and we're gonna take it worldwide
My vibe attracts one tribe, and we're never gonna run and hide

[Intro: Kanye West]
Please don't ask again, who's up in the van?
They my only fans
I was in my hovercraft, had another laugh
How you roll with them? When you know I'm him

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Got it on remote control
Got it on remote control
Got it on remote control, like a CEO

God just grabbed my hand, had a bigger plan

[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Thug]

'Trol
Woah-woah, woah-woah

Hoppin' out the brand new Rolls (Skrrt, skrrt)
Hoppin' out the brand new Rolls (Skrrt, skrrt)
Jеsus sent me brand new clothеs (Skrrt, skrrt)
Wrist still thirty-two below (Yeah)
I want my mob ties to shine (Hah)
I could caress your mind with the right time (Time)
Don't you give your love up, this is the right sign (Sign), sign (Yeah)
I treat you lovely and righteous and kind (Hah)
And we'll be lastin' with another 'til we die (Yeah)
I'd give you kids at the drop of a dime (Dime)
Oh-woah, told the **** fold my clothes (Fold my clothes)
Take it to the light like a strobe (Yeah)
Taking me to court like O (Taking me to court like OJ)
Paparazzi sleep at my door
I just thought that you should know (Sleep at my door)
I get frozen like the North Pole
Don't you freeze up on a pole

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
He got this on remote control like a sink in gold
He got it, no fight, no more meds, twilight in the game
He got it on my hover craft, have another laugh
Pop on a handstand, twilight in the man

[Chorus: Young Thug & Kanye West]
He got it on remote control
He got it on remote control
He got it on remote control, like that's to know
Should know

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
You not understand, I am not your mans
See, I'm super, I got plans, trips across the land
Diamonds dancin' on my hands, Cudder in demand
All in pink like Killa' Cam, holy ****
Watch 'em go, baby... hey
In the evening, it’s the timing that’s right, hey
Takin' it solo, lose the bag, it's disco, hey
Just a **** doin' damage plus some damage, you know, it's a thing
And we ridin'... and we slidin', it's on
And we 'bout it, say goodbye to the worries, baby, so long
... Love my shine, oh
**** color outside the lines, I am so out of, out of **** control...
... Glowin' in the mold... Understands the code
We play our roles, this is how it goes, innocent
... Find you in my dreams...
... Creature in the night...
Electric through my bones, feels so right

[Verse 1]
Daddy was dumb, said that I’d be something special
Brought me up tough but I was a gentle human
Said that he loved each of my two million freckles
When I grew up was gonna be a superstar

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I sit in the car and I listen to static
She said I look fat but I look fantastic

[Chorus]
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe

[Verse 2]
I'm waking up, lost in boxes outside Tesco
Look like a bum sipping codeine Coca-Cola
Thought that I was northern Camden's own Flash Gordon
Sonic ray gun, gonna be a superstar

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I make my own fun in grandmama's basement
Said I look mad, she said I look wasted

[Chorus]
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free

No condom on, we sex like it's safe, sex in a Wraith
Sex on a boat so you can ride my wave
Presidential Rollies, plain Day-Dates
Me and slime on a jet, snakes on a plane
I can show you how to find love when it's dark
And you don't gotta show me how to unstrap your bra
Fuck your insecurities, I love the way you are
I'll be your security and treat you like a star
I can show you how to make love, what you want?
Hit it from the back and slap your butt when we fuck
She text you "lol," but she ain't laughing at all
Might just write "I love you" without having a heart

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I can show you how to find love in the stars
I can show you how to find love at a bar
I can show you how to find love in the stars
Baby, you can count my love like the stars, yeah
Lil' baby went to busting in the car (Yeah)
She say she want the smoke like a cigar (Yeah, yeah)
Lil' mama wanna do it in the car (In the car)
I'ma drink her like we at the bar, yeah
Let's go away, I'm tryna whip us up a vacation
Spend time every day with you
Let's go away, today we taking a vacation (Woo)
We 'bout to keep it locked every day
Shop every day, flauge every day
Foreplaying, making love every day
Fuck, settle, bae, in Montego Bay

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

[Verse: The Kid LAROI]
It's the last time I let you hurt me
Fuck you, goodbye, I did not deserve it
None of this bullshit was ever really worth it
You blame me like I know I ain't perfect
I tried with you, and I lied for you
Many timеs, put my life on the line for you
I rеally wanted to get it right with you
I always saw the better side of you
And now it's fuck you for life
I'm doin' better, you right
I was wrong 'bout you, I guess I finally realized
You brought the dark to my light
I'm with a new one tonight
But there is one last thing I want to tell you tonight

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
Lyrics from Snippets

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
All my people out the trenches
Lift us up, make us alright
The devil can't stand your presence
Stand with God and I got leverage
Throw our hands up in the sky
Yes Lord, we wave 'em high

[Verse 1: KayCyy]
Exhausted, it’s never the right time to go
I had to think twice before I moved
Standing my ground won’t break my mood
Choose puddles, be careful when you choose your steps
Gotta make it right before your left
Gotta make it right before your left
Exhausted, it’s never the right time go
I had to think twice before I moved
Standing my ground won’t break my mood
Choose puddles, be careful when you choose your steps
Gotta make a right before your left
Gotta make a right before your left

[Bridge: KayCyy & KayCyy with Sunday Service Choir]
Everybody wanna feel like
Everything gon be right
New me over the old me
Let it out, let it all out
I can't help not feeling alright
Lord please make it alright
Forgive us all make it alright
Surround us all make it alright

[Verse 2: KayCyy]
Dear God, make it alright
Only You can make it alright
Dear Lord, make it alright
Nothing else ever feels right
Dear God, make it alright
Nothing else ever feels right
Na-na-na, nothing else ever feels right
Save me yeah, make it alright
Bow our heads because it's alright
Alright, mmm, mmm, mmm
24 hours, 24 candles, 24 hours

[Bridge: KayCyy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Throw our hands up in the sky
Yes Lord, we put ‘em high, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Kanye West & 88-Keys]
My God, Jehovah Jireh
My provider, people listen
What a vision, wonderful vision
What a vision, pray we listen, pray we listen
Washed us in blood, pessimism
He died for them, but he risen
Behold the land, we are in denial
Then I took the test, but I jumped the trial
This is the jam, like Jackie Chan
In my mommy's land, George Michael's sayin'
"Lend me your ear", like she Van Gogh
She like the old gang, like Faneto
Washed us in blood, pessimism
He died for them, but he risen
Wonderful vision, what a vision
Pray we listen, pray we listen

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
All my people out the trenches
Lift us up, make us alright
The devil can't stand your presence
Stand with God and I got leverage
Throw our hands up in the sky
Yes Lord, we wave 'em high

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
I thought crazy stupid love
Was what I want
Pushin', shovin', spilling blood
Still not enough, not enough
There ain't no rehab for this drug
I'm all alone
Should have done this long ago

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we go screaming, crying, goin' like a siren
I'm so sick of the sound
We're always like little disasters, smashing glasses
Then we're trying to figure it out

[Chorus]
But you should know
I ain't coming back
One day you will understand
That you're my beautiful mistake
Up and out, it's all over babe
So let me go
Up, up and away
Up, up and away
Up, up and away
And I won't come down
And I won't come down
(And I won't come down)

[Verse 2]
I thought I could take the pain
It's good for me
And you're the one keepin' me down
No gravity, gravity
If we can carry on this way
We'll be enemies
I pack my things, I gotta leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Before we go screaming, crying, goin' like a siren
I'm so sick of that sound
We're always like little disasters, smashing glasses
Then we're trying to figure it out

[Chorus]
But you should know
I ain't coming back
One day you will understand
You're my beautiful mistake
Up and out, it's all over babe
So let me go
Up, up and away
Up, up and away
Up, up and away
And I won't come down
(Up) Up, up and away
(Up) Up, up and away
Up, up and away
And I won't come down

[Break]

[Chorus]
But you should know
I ain't coming back
One day you will understand
You're my beautiful mistake
Up and out, it's all over babe
So let me go
Up, up and away
Up, up and away
Up, up and away
And I won't come down
(Up) Up, up and away

Up, up and away
And I won't come down

Just close your eyes and lay back
Think about us, we could burn up the second we touch
Yeah, let your mind just relax
We could play rough, make your blood rush, velveteen brush

I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl

You can take me on a date in your imagination
And she bop, she bop in your parents' basement
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Yeah, yeah)

And you can tell all your boys that I'm your honeycomb
I'll put your sugar on my tongue when wе're all alone
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[Pre-Chorus]
Just close your еyes and lay back
Think about us, we could burn up the second we fuck
Yeah, let your mind just relax
We could play rough, make your blood rush, velveteen brush

[Chorus]
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I'll be your baby girl, your baby girl

[Bridge]
I'm hanging all alone
Let me live inside your world
More than a fantasy
Let me be your baby girl (Your baby girl)

Lost my passport, left my car keys
Don't need aeroplanes
When I'm with you, you're my holiday
You're my escape

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm so tired of the dra-dra-dra-drama
Moving teardrops and that ka-ka-ka-karma
When this life is getting ha-ha-ha-harder
You're my vacay

[Chorus]
Oh baby, just call me, call me, call me
You call my name and I'm down, I'm down
Any day of the week feels like Friday when you're around
Rainy days and sunny, like we're in Miami
Oh, eh, oh, eh, oh (Oh, eh, oh, eh, oh)
Oh baby, just call me, call me, call me
You call my name and I'm down, I'm down
Any day of the week feels like Friday when you're around
Pretty days and sunny, like we're Miami
Oh, eh, oh, eh, oh (Oh, eh, oh, eh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Stuck in traffic, going nowhere
Drownin’ in the blue
Even nightmares turn to paradise
When I'm with you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ain't no time for all this dra-dra-dra-drama
We're just doing what we wa-wa-wa-wanna
Sipping piña cola-la-la-ladas
We're on vacay

[Chorus]
Oh baby, just call me, call me, call me
You call my name and I'm down, I'm down
Any day of the week feels like Friday when you're around
Rainy days and sunny, like we're in Miami
Oh, eh, oh, eh, oh (Oh, eh, oh, eh, oh)
Oh baby, just call me, call me, call me
You call my name and I'm down, I'm down

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't, I don't

I don't like the way you dry
I don't like the way you go
Love me, love me, no

I don't like the way you cry
(Mumble)
You love me, love me, loyal

Gimme that paycheck
Worked all week, now I wanna forget
Make it rain, so wet
I get lucky like Russian Roulette
Wanna lose control
Feel good and so damn beautiful
Gonna spend it all
'Cause it's the weekend and I wanna let go

[Pre-Chorus]
I got the flashing lights
Chandeliers and limousinеs, in a dream
And we're nеver going home
'Cause we’re up so high
Aeroplanes and luxury, can't you see?
We just got payed so we're 'bout that money

[Chorus]
Why you looking at me?
Why you looking at me? Oh
All these bitches looking at me
Tell me, do you like what you see?

And when I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up
And when I pull up, pull up, pull up, hey

[Verse 1]
You tucked me in, turned out the light
Kept me safe and sound at night
Little girls depend on things like that
Brushed my teeth and combed my hair
Had to drive me everywhere
You were always there when I looked back
You had to do it all alone
Make a living, make a home
Must have been as hard as it could be
And when I couldn't sleep at night
Scared things wouldn't turn out right
You would hold my hand and sing to me

[Chorus]
Caterpillar in the tree
How you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far, but you can always dream
Wish you may and wish you might
Don't you worry, hold on tight
I promise you there will comе a day
Butterfly fly away

[Verse 2]
Butterfly fly away
Got your wings, now you can't stay
Take thosе dreams and make them all come true
Butterfly fly away
You've been waiting for this day
All along you've known just what to do

[Outro]
Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
Butterfly fly away

Swear that the only one I trust is the team and the man that's above me (oh yeah)

[Verse 1: J Emz]
They was up there in the club
When we was out there in the fields

Raised up humble in the concrete jungle like I made grills
Handy man, call me up for the drills (brr, brr)
I was fresh out of the pen then took a trip later in the week
I fell in love with the drillers and roaming around in the streets

Heavy's heavy like a shotgun
Just come around if you want some
So listen up it's ONEFOUR a bar (aye aye)
We don't come around to play games (nah)
We don't do this shit for the fame
We're just making music, quick change (change)
I got away from the DPT
Had my lawyer rescue me (of course)
Paid that white man a couple g's just to tell (aye) the judge (aye) to set me free
Now I'm out on bail, what's good

Kicking heads like conversions, scoring points to stay first in

You can't afford the price, so why the hell would you ask it?
Thеse faggots try and snatch it, get they ass in a caskеt
Ya honey love me, she admire the fashion
And I call her "baby girl", just like her dad did
There's 100's on my paper like a smart ass class kid
Because I'm on top my route, like an ad lib
You don't see that Polo man on my chest?
Don't worry, I got a Purple label on my neck
So you need to gon' getcha some, gon'-gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon'-gon' getcha some
But to get boy you gotta be rich or something
And my attire hard, hard like my dick or something
I made more then ends meat
My nigga BIG told me he was bout the Benji's
I'm in the lime light 'til the point my skin green
And living my dreams 'til the point you should pinch me to convince me

[Hook: Big Sean]
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get?
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get?

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
If I told you where to get it, you niggas still wouldn't grab it
Just to pronounce it, you gotta add an accent (How many Euro's?)
And they ask, can they call me grocery store?
'Cause my pockets full of paper and plastic
Man, you not avoiding my Asian persuasion
Excuse the lil Ape in ya face, it stays Bathing
And when the heat blaze on high beams
You scream, I scream
For some cold ass ice cream
You need to gon' getcha some, gon'-gon' getcha some
Gon' getcha some, gon'-gon' getcha some
These broads thinkin' that they really gon' get 'em some
So they try to take care of me like I'm sick or somethin'
There's some things, I don't like, I love them Nike's
But not the white on white's, forget the price tags
'Cause I get what I like, and your girl looking for me
Because she like the pipe, ya dig?

[Hook: Big Sean]
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get?
Fresh, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
Polo, Louie to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket
They looking at a nigga, like that's one fresh bastard
I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Excuse me, but this verse has not been Russell Simmons approved, uh-uh
You won't see it on Run's house uh-uh
You won't see it at a nun's house
My New York nigga said he heard it at son's house
Talkin' 'bout how this hoe is poor as my low is
Baby is my Lois, maybe I'm just bogus
'Cause she don't wan't you to buy her a drank
Swizz said, "She ain't got no money in the bank"
And she be standin' there 'cause there's cameras
Tryin' to show your legs off, you ain't Amerie
If I fall in love, a girl gon' live on Rodeo
Until that day, oh, she take the monorail
And I don't want no girl that will answеr to, "Ayo"
Make it more harder, makе me put some work in
You get to flirtin', play her just perfect
Fuck a drink, I'ma buy a bar if you're worth it

[Verse 2: T-Pain & Kanye West]
Baby girl (Girl), what's your name? (Name, yeah, uh)
Let me talk to you (To you), let me buy you a drank (Yeezy, drank)
I'm T-Pain (Pain, T-Pain), you know me (Me, my nigga, what up?)
Konvict Music, Nappy Boy, ooh-wee (Number one)
I know the club (Club, one, one), close at three (Three)
What's the chance of you rollin' wit me?
Back to the crib (Crib), show you how I live (Live)
Lets get drunk and forget what we did

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank
And then I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?
I'll be in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, woah, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh
We in the bed like, ooh, ooh, ooh, woah, woah, ooh, ooh

You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

[Chorus: Nick & All]
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why

You are my fire
The one desire
You are (You are, you are, you are)

Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
(Don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (Oh, yeah)
I want it that way

[Chorus: Brian, All, (Nick) & AJ]
Tell me why

I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say (Never wanna hear you say, yeah)
I want it that way
I'm headed for the border
It's on my mind
And nothin' really matters
I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror
Is he hot on my tracks
Is he getting nearer
I feel some heat is on my back
Speedin' on the freeway gotta get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Doin' it on the highway gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stoppin' at nothin'
(Speed demon)
He say, "pull over boy and get your ticket right"
And nothin' gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speedin' on the midway
I gotta really burn this road
Speedin' on the freeway gotta get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Doin' it on the highway gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stoppin' at nothin'
(Speed dеmon)
He say, "pull over boy and get your tickеt right"
Speed demon, you're the very same one
Who said the future's in your hands
The life you save could be your own
You're preachin' 'bout my life like you're the law
Gonna live each day and hour like
For me there's no tomorrow
Go! Go! Go! Go! Aaow!
Speedin' on the freeway gotta get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Got fire in my pocket, I just lit a rocket
(Speed demon)
I just, pull over boy and get your ticket right
(Speed demon)
Pull over boy and get your ticket right
(Speed demon)
I just, pull over boy and eat your ticket
Pull over boy
Pull over boy and get your ticket right
Get your ticket right
Pull over boy
Get your ticket right
Pull over boy and get your ticket right
Pull over boy
Pull over boy and get your ticket
Eat your ticket
Get your ticket
Eat yo', get yo'
Get your ticket right

Test him out, stressed him out, no
Popped him out and stretched him out, oh

Time keeps slippin'
These bitches in my DM but I can't pay attention
They wishin' and itchin', a message to you bitches

Don't be a stranger to danger, my anger ranges
Filter to filter, your face is changin'
As strange as it is
I keep makin', you keep shakin'
(Get it good now)
Rollin' through, you're scrollin' through your phone
Thirsty trap, you thirsty rat, you're wrong
First to clap, I snatch your purse and gone
Knick knack patty wack, take that bitch home
The way that she dance, I'm gon' take that bitch home
Show her my zone then I make that bitch moan
This how we dance when we hear this song
Don't take your phone, you won't be here that long

Make that money, don't let it make you
If you hustle like Dogg and you get it times two
Def Jam Records, nigga, thought you knew
(Get it good now)

Baby so bad she make it look easy
Jump in the bed, I don't let her tease me
Walk in the mall, I'm spending the cheese
Blow... on the highway I'm speeding

Play with the racks like Venus and Serena

I feel our souls burnin' up when I'm, inside of you and I
And I'ma leave a mark, just to remind you, where you belong, baby
Give me your all, scream as loud as you want

[Refrain]
I don't have to remind you, it's my need to confine you
(Tell me now)
I see your face every time I'm with somebody else
Can't you see that I want you? (Put your feelings behind you)
I don't have to remind you (don't have to remind you)

[Hook]
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong

[Verse 1]
I am nothing without you here
With you, I love without fear
Nothing, oh, nothing they say about you
Has meaning to me

[Chorus]
We won't let nothing
Take this sweet something
'Cause I don't want nothing (Nothing), nothing
Only you

[Verse 2]
For you I come, guns blazing
Crazy as love is it's amazing
Without the lover found my best friend
And I love you

[Chorus]
We won't let nothing
Take our sweet something
'Cause I don't want nothing (Nothing), nothing (No one)
Only you

[Outro]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
I am nothing without you here
With you I love without fear
Nothing, oh, nothing is safe 'bout you
As meaning to me
I am, I, I, I am, I am, I, I, I am
I am nothing without you here
I, I, I am, I am, I, I, I am
With you, I love without fear
I, I, I am, I am, I, I, I am
Oh, nothing is safe 'bout
I, I, I am, I am, I, I, I am
I am, I, I, I am, I am, I, I, I am
Won't let nothing
Won't let, won't let nothing, we
I am nothing without you here

[Chorus]
We won't let nothing
Won't let, won't let
Take this sweet something
Won't let, won't let nothing
Won't let, won't let
I don't want nothing
Only You

[Verse 3]
We, oh
I am, for, for, for you
I am, for, for, for you
For you, I, I come, I come
Guns bla-, guns bla-, gu-guns blazing, guns blazing
Crazy as love is, crazy as love is, crazy as love is, crazy as love is
It's ama-, it's ama-, it's amazing

[Chorus]
We won't let nothing
Won't let, won't let
Take this sweet something
Won't let, won't lеt nothing
Won't let, won't let
I don't want nothing
Only You

[Pos-Chorus]
Won't let nothing
Won't lеt, won't let nothing, we
Won't let nothing
Won't let, won't let nothing, we
Won't let nothing
Won't let, won't let nothing, we
I am nothing without you here

[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shadеs of wrong
We learn to live with thе pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

[Chorus]
I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

[Chorus]
And I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same, oh
Oh, I never saw you comin'
And I'll never be the same

[Outro]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

[Verse 1]
Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence
Baby, I would climb the Andes solely
To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody

[Pre-Chorus]
Le ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le
Can't you see? I'm at your feet

[Chorus]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to bе together
I'll be thеre and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

[Verse 2]
Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave will cry a river

[Pre-Chorus]
Le ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le
At your feet
I'm at your feet

[Chorus]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

[Bridge]
Le ro le le lo le, le ro le le lo le
Think out loud, say it again
Le ro lo le lo le lo le
Tell me one more time
That you'll live
Lost in my eyes

[Chorus]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

[Verse 1]
I wish you gave me a reason
That you were better at leavin'
That you got your kicks from seein' me low
I always let the good ones go
Don't want the kisses, unless they're bitter
I'm hooked on touches that leave me weaker
I swear that I love nothin' more than broke
I always let the good ones go

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones, 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go

[Chorus]
(I always let the good ones go)
I always let the good ones go
I always let the good, always, always let the good ones go
Always let the good, always, always let the good ones go
Let the good, always, always let the good ones go
I always let the good, always, always let the good ones go

[Verse 2]
Let you down easy, I'm tryin'
'Cause you're everything I've spent my whole life fightin'
So when I walk away, it's not your fault
I always let the good ones go

[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go

[Chorus]
(I always let the good ones go)
I always let the good ones go
I always let the good, always, always let the good ones go
Always let the good, always, always let the good ones go
Let the good, always, always let the good ones go
I always let the good ones go

[Outro]
(I let the good ones go)
I always let the good ones go

[Verse 1]
You’ve given me the world with all your love
So I got you something special just because
I found a gift that’s perfect
And you’re more worth it
It’s everything that you've been dreamin’ of
Oh, this is my love language
So I’ll go ‘head and say it
‘Cause you’re the gift that keeps on giving

[Chorus]
And you deserve it all (All)
You deserve it all (All)
You know you’ve been good at all year

It’s all good with me
‘Cause you deserve it all

[Verse 2]
You give of yourself so unselfishly
So I, I wanna give with all the finest things
I found a gift that’s perfect
And you’re more worth it
It’s everything that you been dreamin’ of
So treat yourself to something nice
The luxuries in life
‘Cause you’re the gift that keeps on giving

[Chorus]
And you deserve it all (All)
You deserve it all (All)
You know you’ve been good at all year
Come over here
And let me show you

[Bridge]
For all you mean to me
Underneath the tree
For you to see
Beyond your wildest dreams
And I know that should do this all year long

[Chorus]
‘Cause you deserve it all (All)
You deserve it all (All)
And you know you’ve been good at all year
Come over here
And let me show you
You deserve it all (All)
You deserve it all (All)
I’ll shower you with more than you’ll ever need
It’s all good with me
‘Cause you deserve it all

[Outro]
All
All

[Intro]
Tryna be happy
I am happy
Say, "I am Love"
Okay, here's the truth

[Verse 1]
The sun came up
It's supposed to
The waves came up
It's supposed to
These things never end
Keep life going like a friend
You can trust and depend
It'll keep come in again
The world keeps spinning on
The world keeps spinning on

[Chorus]
This war's too big for the man dem
God Satan moving in Tandem
You think everything is random
You fool

[Verse 2]
In world where there's hunger
Billionaires build a bunker
Keep your spirit one hundred
And you can't go under
Satan's looking for a member
Stay strong in thе thunder
God can't be outnumberеd
So it's time to surrender

[Chorus]
This war's too big for the man dem
'Cause God Satan moving in Tandem
You think everything is random
You fool, you fool, you fool

[Verse 3]
When you can see truth
What's more there to prove?
It can happen out the blue
You don't get to choose
I lived for the getting
I wanna here for giving
Bad girl here for the killing
Now I pray for the living
Angel messenger
Stay out of the danger
Out of the drama
In this last hour
For Babylon

[Verse 1]
Oh, to be where I belong
To sleep there in that place
To know that I had nothing wrong
That my time was not in vain

[Pre-Chorus]
I will find you and we'll both go back again
I'm behind you as the light comes pouring in

[Chorus]
Let it all begin
Gonna let it all begin

[Verse 2]
Reach and grab a star tonight
And pass it 'round the fire
Raise your glasses, raise them high
For every friend who tried

[Pre-Chorus]
To find us, but could not get back again
So we'll go on and we will not forget them

[Chorus]
Let it all begin
Let it all begin
Let it all begin
Let it all begin

[Outro]
'Cause I know you can take me there
I know you can take me there
I know you can take me there
Let it all begin
It’s the calm before the storm right here

Wait, how was I gonna start this off?

I forgot… oh, yeah

That’s an awfully hot coffee pot

Should I drop it on Donald Trump? Probably not

But that’s all I got ‘til I come up with a solid plot

Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it

Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk

Imma walk inside a mosque on Ramadan

And say a prayer that every time Melania talks

She gets a mou… Ahh, Imma stop
But we better give Obama props

’Cause what we got in office now’s a kamikaze

That’ll probably cause a nuclear holocaust

And while the drama pops

And he waits for shit to quiet down, he’ll just gas his plane up and fly around ‘til the bombing stops

Intensities heightened, tensions arе risin’

Trump, when it comes to giving a shit, you’re stingy as I am

Excеpt when it comes to having the balls to go against me, you hide ‘em

’Cause you don’t got the fucking nuts like an empty asylum

Racism’s the only thing he’s fantastic for

’Cause that’s how he gets his fucking rocks off and he’s orange

Yeah, sick tan

That’s why he wants us to disband
’Cause he cannot withstand

The fact we’re not afraid of Trump

Fuck walkin’ on egg shells, I came to stomp

That’s why he keeps screamin’ ‘Drain the swamp’

’Cause he’s in quicksand

It’s like we take a step forwards, then backwards

But this is his form of distraction

Plus, he gets an enormous reaction

When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that

Instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada

All these horrible tragedies and he’s bored and would rather

Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers

Then says he wants to lower our taxes
Then who’s gonna pay for his extravagant trips

Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?

Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered

Then does it more

From his endorsement of Bannon

Support for the Klansmen

Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that’s black

And comes home from Iraq

And is still told to go back to Africa

Fork and a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa

Who keeps ignoring our past historical, deplorable factors

Now if you’re a black athlete, you’re a spoiled little brat for

Tryna use your platform or your stature

To try to give those a voice who don’t have one

He says, ‘You’re spittin’ in the face of vets who fought for us, you bastards!’

Unless you’re a POW who’s tortured and battered

’Cause to him you’re zeros

’Cause he don’t like his war heroes captured

That’s not disrespecting the military

Fuck that! This is for Colin, ball up a fist!

And keep that shit balled like Donald the bitch!

’He’s gonna get rid of all immigrants!’

’He’s gonna build that thang up taller than this!’

Well, if he does build it, I hope it’s rock solid with bricks

’Cause like him in politics, I’m using all of his tricks

’Cause I’m throwin’ that piece of shit against the wall ‘til it sticks

And any fan of mine who’s a supporter of his

I’m drawing in the sand a line: you’re either for or against

And if you can’t decide who you like more and you’re split

On who you should stand beside, I’ll do it for you with this:

Fuck you!

The rest of America stand up

We love our military, and we love our country

But we fuckin hate Trump!
(Verse one)
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod

I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
Twenty-seven years and the end of my mind, but
Holding to the thought of another timе, but
Looking to the ways of the ones bеfore me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't want to hear about what to do
I don't want to do it just to do it for you

(Chorus)
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a
Zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always
Feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really
Real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a
Zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never
Feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's
Real, real
I'm looking for a way out
(Verso two)
I find it hard to tell you how I want to run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, semi never demigod

I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
Twenty-seven years and I've nothing to show
Falling from the doves to the dark of the crow
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't want to hear about what to do, no
I don't want to do it just to do it for you

(Chorus)
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a
Zero, zero
Let me tell you how it feels to be always
Feel, feel
Like I'm empty and nothing is really
Real, real
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a
Zero, zero
Let me tell you how it feels to be always
Feel, feel
Like I'm empty and nothing is really
Real, real
(Bridge)
Let me tell you 'bout it
Well let me tell you 'bout it
Maybe you're the same as me
Let me tell you 'bout it
Well let me tell you 'bout it
They say the truth will set you free

(Chorus)
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a
Zero, zero
Let me tell you how it feels to be always
Feel, feel
Like I'm empty and nothing is really
Real, real
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a
Zero, zero
Let me tell you how it feels to be always
Feel, feel
Like I'm empty and nothing is really
Real, real
Witches gather up black masses
Bodies burning in red ashes
On the hill, the church in ruin
It's the scene of evil-doin'

It's the place for all bad sinners
Watch them eating dead rats' innards
I guess it's the same
Wherever you may go
Oh Lord, yeah

Carry banners wasting out the Lord
See me rocking in my grave
See them annoint my head with their bright blood
See them stick their stakes on me (oh)

Don't hold me back though
I just gotta go
They've got a hold of my soul now
Look at my brain, it's thick with blood unseen
Look in my eyes, therе are none
Yeah
On thе scene, a priest appears
Sinners falling at his knees
Satan send out funeral pyres
Cast the priest into the fire

It's the place for all bad sinners
Watch them eating dead rats' innards
I guess it's the same
Wherever you may go
Oh Lord yeah

[Verse]
I tried to keep our love going strong
But no matter how hard I try
Something went wrong
I'd like to keep our love going long
But no matter how much I lied
The truth was too strong
I cried when you decided to go
I cried much more than you'll ever know
My pride is my only company
My pride will get the best of me

[Chorus]
I'll dance with the ghost of our love
I will dance with the ghost of our long lost love
I'll carry the ghost of our love
I will carry the ghost of our long lost love
I'll live with the ghost of our love
I will live with the ghost of our long lost love
I'll die with the ghost of our lovе
I will die with the ghost of our long lost love

[Outro]
I will dancе with the ghost of our love
I will dance with the ghost of our long lost love
I will dance with the ghost of our love
I will dance with the ghost of our long lost love
I will dance with the ghost of our love
I will dance with the ghost of our long lost love
I will dance with the ghost of our love
I will dance with the ghost of our long lost love

Wooh, oh

[Hook: Slick Rick]
Knock Em Out the box Kris, out the box Kris
Knock Em Out the box Kris, out the box Kris
Knock Em Out the box Kris, out the box Kris
Knock Em Out the box Kris, out the box Kris

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm spitting truth, ain't nothing fancy
Fake — I can't be, with this microphone I'm handy
Radio and video bans me, they can't stand me
I'm the opposite of these hoes dancing in panties
Truth seeker, I write for people, not a grammy
The true Teacha, teaching about ancestors and family
The proof seeker, bringing evidence, not the fallacy
The new leader, bringing solutions to the insanity
This strategy avoid calamity and tragedy
Do not let technology run off with your humanity
I deal with reality, not Lemon or Hannity
This is why most of these rappers are not matching me
It's a catastrophe that got you looking at a screen
And the screen is showing you scenes of what your culture means
As for society and poverty, drug dealers and fiends
These ain't the images that tell you what your culture means
Rappers like KRS-One are nowhere on the scene
They promote rappers than contradict Dr. King's Dream
These acts are deliberate, they're part of the same scheme
Cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh
Just another case about the wrong path
Straight and narrow or you will not last
Slick Rick told y'all, goodnight

[Hook: Slick Rick]
Knock Em Out the box Kris, out the box Kris
Knock Em Out the box Kris, out the box Kris
Knock Em Out the box Kris, out the box Kris
Knock Em Out the box Kris, out the box Kris

[Verse 2]
Knock Em Out the box Kris, Kris already got this
This is what Hip Hop is, spitting my synopsis
A sellout? I am not this, pull out and cock this
Revolutionary topic right over the hot shit
Video is for your optics, that's why you watch this
But it can become hypnotic if you cannot stop it
Your mind you must unlock it from their phony topics
Focus on the truth, with proof, use your logic
Words are like purpose, character, you got it?
Or got 'em, invisible forces, can you spot 'em?
The blind continues to lead the blind to the bottom
Destroying their cities like Gomorrah and Sodom
I rock 'em with truth 'cause Knowledge Reigns Supreme
Cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh
Just another case about the wrong path
Straight and narrow or you will not last
Slick Rick told y'all, goodnight

[Hook: Slick Rick]
Knock Em Out the box Kris, out the box Kris
Knock Em Out the box Kris, out the box Kris
Knock Em Out the box Kris, out the box Kris
Knock Em Out the box Kris, out the box Kris

[Verse 3]
Out the box Kris, like a stone I rock this
The beginner just eating dinner, no I am not this
I take it back to Schoolly D and Super Lover Cee
Steady B, I'm Three Times Dope or dope times three
You know me, I ain't stutter
Why you think they never promote the original culture, they putting us under
We all know the truth about Hip Hop and what it really is
But we sit and settle for what they peddle to little kids
I'm piping like a kettle, this mental man, I'll flip your lid
Take it back to when we used to rap and DJs zig-a-zig
When you reverse EVIL, believe me people you really LIVE
Health, Love, Awareness, and Wealth, that's what I'm here to give
No I do not think of my self, I think of these future kids
Everything we doing today will determine how they live
Many DJs cutting and mixing but they ain't playing nothing
Many rappers, ripping and rapping but they ain't saying nothing
Corporate yelling, "Black Lives Matter!" but they stay fronting
That's why this Black Lives Rapper he keeps in way bumping
It ain't nothing, no assumptions, just facts
It seems Knowledge Reigning Supreme and that's that
Bring it back, rappers rapping like we ain't under attack
They traders and our neighbors, which makes it doubly wack
Look at that while these corny ass rappers serving their fiends
Cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh
Just another case about the wrong path
Straight and narrow or you will not last
Slick Rick told y'all, goodnight

Heathcliff
It's me, I am Cathy
I have come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window

[Verse 1]
Out on the wily, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you, I loved you too

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad dreams in the night
Told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights

[Chorus]
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I'vе come home, I'm so cold
Let mе in your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window
Part I: "Optimistic Voices"

[Verse]
You're out of the woods, you're out of the dark, you're out of the night
Step into the sun, step into the light
Keep straight ahead for the most glorious place
On the face of the Earth or the sky
Hold on to your hats, hold on to your hearts, hold on to your hopes
March up to the gate and bid it open

[Verse]
You're out of the woods, you're out of the dark, you're out of the night
Step into the sun, step into the light
Keep straight ahead for the most glorious place
On the face of the Earth or the sky
Hold on to your hats, hold on to your hearts, hold on to your hopes
March up to the gate and bid it open

[Outro]
You're out of the woods, you're out of the dark, you're out of the night
March up to that gate and bid it open

Part II: "No Love Dying"

[Verse 1]
There will be no love that's dying here
The bird that flew in from my window simply lost his way
He broke his wing, I helped him heal
And then he flew away
The death of love is everywhere, but I won't let it be
There will be no love that's dying here with me

[Verse 2]
There will be no love that's dying here
The mirror that fell from the wall was raggedy, that's all
It rest upon a rusty nail before it made its fall
The bones of love are everywhere, but I won't let it be
There will be no love that's dying here with me

[Verse 3]
There will be no love that's dying here
Four flowers from my Asian vase is not a sign we're dead
I paid for three, a sweet, old lady gave me four instead
There's some doubt that's out about our love, but I won't let it be
There will be no love that's dying here with me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
There will be no love that's dying here
The bird that flew in from my window simply lost his way
He broke his wing, I helped him heal
And then he flew away
The death of love is everywhere, but I won't let it be
There will be no love that's dying here with me
There will be no love that's dying here with me
There will be no love that's dying here with me
There will be no love that's dying here with me

[Verse 1]
What happens when the foundation of a relationship is guilt, not love?
Obligation
Promises lead to resentment
I could love you if only it could stop your weeping
And start your smiling
But is that love?
Obligation
Promises lead to expectations
Which lead to resentment

[Verse 2]
What happens when the foundation of a sexual encounter is guilt, not desire?
Obligation
Promises lead to resentment
I'd let you touch me if only it would stop your pushing
And get you leaving
Is that desire?
Obligation
Promises lead to expectations
Which lead to resentment

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
If I caught the world in a bottle
And everything was still beneath the moon
Without your love, would it shine for me?
If I was smart as Aristotle
And understood the rings around the moon
What would it all matter if you loved me?

[Chorus]
Here in your arms where the world is impossibly still
With a million dreams to fulfil
And a matter of moments until the dancing ends
Here in your arms where everything seems to be clear
Not a solitary thing will I fear
Except when this moment comes near the dance's end

[Post-Chorus]
If I caught the world in an hourglass
Saddled up the moon so we could ride
Until the stars grew dim, until

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
One day, you'll meet a stranger
And all the noise is silenced in the room
You'll feel that you're close to some mystery
In the moonlight where everything shatters
You'll feel as if you've known her all your life
The world's greatest lesson in history

[Chorus]
Here in your arms where the world is impossibly still
With a million dreams to fulfil
And a matter of moments until the dancing ends
Here in your arms where everything seems to be clear
Not a solitary thing will I fear
Except when this moment comes near the dance's end

[Post-Chorus]
If I caught the world in an hourglass
Saddled up the moon so we would ride
Until the stars grew dim
Until the time that time stands still
Until the stars grew dim
Until the time that time stands still
Until

[Verse]
Here am I, lounging on the sands of my hourglass
Watching the time drip
Sand sketching strange glyphs
Feeling my mind slip off a cliff

[Chorus]
I lost my mind
Can you help me find my mind?
I lost my mind
Can you help me find my mind?
I lost my mind
Can you help me find my mind?
I lost my mind
Can you help me find my mind?
I lost my mind
Can you help me find my mind?
I lost my mind
Can you help me find my mind?
I lost my mind (I lost)
Can you help me find my mind? (My mind)
I lost my mind (I lost)
Can you help me find my mind? (My mind)
I lost my mind (I lost)
Can you help me find my mind? (My mind)
I lost my mind (I lost)
Can you help me find my mind? (My mind)
I lost my mind
Can you help me?

[Instrumental Outro]
If you should love me
Don't ever tell me
Show it
That's how I'll know it

In fact, it's better not to show me at all
Let me pine, let me yearn, let me crawl
Let me write you a song
And long to belong to you
Write you a song from a distance
Let me love you like I love the moon
Let me love you like I love the moon

[Instrumental Break]

Let me love you like I love the moon
Let me love you like I love the moon
All I'm asking isn't much
Once, instead of all the sadness
From a man, a little gladness
Is that asking very much?
Is that asking such a much?

One right is guaranteed to everybody
To call his short unhappy life his own
To take a little pleasure from a shoddy
And when he asks for bread to eat, not get a stone
This right is guaranteed to everybody

But sad to say, it never yet has happened
That things turn out the way they ought to go
Who wouldn't want a little decent treatment?
It seems that circumstance won't have it so

I would gladly give to you
Anything your heart desires
Oh, I swear, I'd bе inspired
It would give me plеasure too
It would give me pleasure too
We crave to be more kindly than we are
Give gladly to the poor because it's right
If all are kind, His kingdom isn't far
Who wouldn't wish to bask beneath his light?
We crave to be more kindly than we are

But sad to say, the chances happen never
You'd have to reach up high and man is low
We'd all be glad to live in peace forever
But you know circumstance won't have it so

[Instrumental Break]

Of course I'm telling you the truth
The world is mean and man uncouth

To be aglow instead of low
But you know circumstance won't have it so
To be aglow instead of low
But you know circumstance won't have it so

The world is mean and man uncouth
And sad to say, I tell the truth
It always happens that way
It always happens that way
And nothing much will help a lot
And you can toss it in the pot
You, I
What we have been to each other
What we are to each other
What we've done to each other
What we do to each other
The relationship of all that to others

I didn’t brood, had no resentments
Had no hard feelings, I was not sorry for myself
I merely tried to see
As clearly as it is possible for me to see

Then I got up and watched the grasses
With the raindrops and the dead poplar
Illuminated by the early sun
And against a very dark sky
The wind doth blow today, my love
With a few small drops of rain
I never had but one true love
And she in the cold grave has lain

I'll do as much for my true love
As any young man may
I'll sit and mourn all on her grave
For twelve months and a day

The twelve months and a day being up
The dead began to speak
"Oh, who is that sits on my grave
And will not let me sleep?"

"It is I sits on your grave, my love
And will not let you sleep
I crave one kiss from your cold, clay lips
And this is all I seek"

"You crave one kiss from my cold, clay lips
But my breath smells earthly strong
If you had one kiss from my cold, clay lips
Your time would not be long"
"Oh, yonder in that gardеn green
My love, where wе used to walk
The finest flower that ever did bloom
Is withered to a stalk

The stalk is withered dry, my love
So must our hearts decay
So make yourself content, my love
'Til death takes you away"

Away
Away
Away

[Intro]
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm (Whew)
Yeah, look
(Buddah blessed this beat)

[Verse]
Psychin' out, mm, bro pull a pistol on anyone
Hopped out the car with a big SK
Grip it under my arm like a minigun
Nigga think he can take any of my hoes
Sit back and watch him receive a Cinnabon
Run out and hop in some foreigns
Some hoes and my momma, the ratio ten to one
All of my exes look at me like, God, I turned a façade
Buy her a car but it's still in my name
If that bitch tryna leave, take it back like Rashad
Six-hundred thousand, I stuffed in the park
Ten different bitches, we made 'em hoes mosh
Maison Margiela soap when I wash
Give me that mouth, your body is botched
Two different girls, I had bought for the fuck of it
Makin' so much guap, I don't know what to do with this shit
But I promise I'm lovin' it
Bitch is a burden, my momma, I'm dubbin' it
Double dishin' on the rims, I'm thuggin' it
Ballin' but my ex tryna X somethin' out
Niggas want smoke, tryna see what I'm 'bout
I want that bitch tryna live in her mouth, ha-ha
Niggas is not rich, on my momma, niggas cold, bitch
Niggas'll fold quick, look in his eyes, he sure a snitch
Uppin' that fire on his ass, bet he change pitch
Left my hot-head brother home, he too dangerous
Oh, shit, rocky road, he not tough, he told
One-fifty my shows
Pull up with three model bitches, Coca Cola nose
Kamikaze middle of the party, my nose feel extra snotty
Might deposit Mona Lisa profit, can't fit in no one's wallet
Hoes watchin', fuck her on the balcony where MLK died
My wrist tied up, watch worth a life
Trade it for a soul, red beam on top with the pole
Accuracy on Norris Cole, hmm

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Oooh, way, oooh, way
I know you don't fuck with me

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Somethin' changed in Texas, guess I missed the message
Look, I missed my exit, I'm living like a Jetson
I was broke and desperate, leanin' on my best friends
Only shot callers I was around was bartendin'
Ain't no love in this game, mama, this is not tennis
Take your shoes off, we just did the carpeting
I can the take the hatin', I can take the praisin'
It's all noise to me, I'll turn into Satan
Y'all stuck in The Matrix
Red pill, blue pill, all these diffеrent faces
All thesе different cases, shit, y'all done seen me naked
So I'ma wear what I want now and I ain't finna fake it
Thank God I made it, thank God I seen God last summer
I was standing on the bridge, I seen all y'all under me
Know you are struggling, niggas out here juggling
Losin' jobs was losing God, then everything is tumbling
Feel heaven rumbling, the rapture is coming
I love the attention, I'm a bastard in public
I still struggle with tellin' my mom who I'm in love with
Subtleties in between, way these diamonds gleam
When Thanksgiving come around, I still don't see 'em
When Christmas come around, nigga, I still don't see 'em
Told the world who I was before I got to know Ian
They gave my people money in exchange for their freedom

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Oooh, way, oooh, way (I would give it all back for a chance to free 'em)
Oooh, way, oooh, way
I know you don't fuck with me
Oooh, way, oooh, way
Can't stop who I'm gonna be
Oooh, way, oooh, way
I know you don't fuck with me

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
They wanna hang me in the trees

[?] the truth and everything they tryna get me to believe
Fighting, so it's never guaranteed
Snakes getting raked up with the leaves
Way too late to conversate for peace
Everything that's fateful come in threes
Living for another is disease
How the fuck are you supposed to breathe?
Real niggas speak in coded languages
Y’all break it down like the police
Raw talent stands beyond a leak
I am not a pastor, I don't preach
Simply a disciple of the street
Radicals and thugs, we move in sync
Stratosphere is where I'm tryna peak
Built different, this elite mental physique
I been incubating my technique
Curate every word like a boutique
I don't listen when these niggas speak
I got niggas that's still tryna eat
This the shit that they finna repeat
Baking soda staining up the tee
Let the needle run until it bleed
Never playin' to concede
I'm dictating how all this proceeds
I don't give a fuck what y'all achieve
I am on a mission, best believe if I didn't get it this way
Every other option would've fucking led to freeze
Lit the house on fire while they sleep
After the commotion turn to silence
Only thing that's left is me

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Oooh, way, oooh, way
I know you don't fuck with me
Oooh, way, oooh, way
Can't stop who I'm gonna be
Oooh, way, oooh, way
I know you don't fuck with me
Oooh, way, oooh, way
Come tell me, my ecstacy

[Bridge: Joba & Kevin Abstract]
I stay strong
Under this weight I hold
Set it off
And watch it all explode

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Round 'em up, round 'em up
Shoot the messenger
Still tellin' tales till the nail's in the coffin wood
Truth tellin' lies, so you aim for the ventricles
The greats die young, but they live to tell the game to you
When I got that 100k, had to get 'bout ten more
Living life like day to day, set you right on death door
Celebrate, but keep it goin', 'cause baby boy, there's many more
I been on my flashy shit like cocaine in '84
I'll be crisp as hell like the shell of a shotty
When they wanna trick ya, get you sign on the dotty
I don't trust nobody 'less the money is accounted
Cause I don't need no degree, call me the accountant
Hop in there and then dip like Copenhagen in my lip, baby
Spit, spray that Skoal, where I'm stackin' up this shit, baby
No matter what that bitch say, I'm killin' it, ain't no shit, baby
Y'all can keep that fifth place, want a gold trophy in my limb, baby
Ballin' ain't for free, you gotta pay to get that 

[?]

[?] drop by, got that coupe de ville on my checklist
We ain't gotta milk shit, there you go, Nesquik
Stop the beat, smile for 'em, there you go, press pic

[Hook: Kevin Abstract, Matt Champion]
Oooh, way, oooh, way
So if you got something to say, suck a dick!
Oooh, way, oooh, way
I know you don't fuck with me

[Outro: Joba]
Shut the fuck up!
Get fucked
Get fucked up!
Shut the fuck up!
Get fucked
Get fucked up!
Shut the fuck up!
Get fucked
Get fucked up!
Shut the fuck up!

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Wheezy outta here
Yeah-oh, oh oh

Broke my heart, take that bag, fuck that bitch

Who I am, and that shit just won't cut it
Public coutin' flights, but she won't
Suck my

That mans took my chances, says I'm nothing
Cuz' yesterday, I was bad in my feelings
Thinkin' back on the shit, that we had, fuck that bitch
No discussion

Don't tell how they switch on my name, on my name
I've seen a chain make a few people change
Go tell my mom...

Fuck her on the floor 'fore we make it to the bed

All my bitches love me; if I had a baby mama
She would probably be richer than a lot of you niggas
Ayy, that's luxury, dawg

These bad hoes keep tiptoein'

Dope boy, that's my dress code
All I hug is blood, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, I'm here with my niggas

They throw dirt on my name
Well, that's why they still dig me
And I'm tired of all this hatin'
I thank God for my patience
I thank God for my homies
I wish we could trade places
Bitch, we good-fellas
Boy, all them niggas with you, they just pall bearers
And if we ball, catch us

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, ayy

[Verse 1]
It was meant to happen, the most trusted going triple platinum
Link with Mac, link with Fee, if I'm down in Baton
Link with Tez, link with Zhii, when I'm down in Jackson
Just got back, overseas I was the main attraction
This ain't them, this is me, so you know what's crackin'

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I mean there's not even a doubt, you know what I'm about
Before I made it out, I said, "I've got to make it out"

[Chorus]
And I did, I did, I really did
Switch up the sentiment, rappin' on instrumentals
That's how I paid the rent
LA, at a big event
Been ten years, niggas hated him, now they cavin' in
Now, wait a minute

[Verse 2]
I mean maybe I'm confused, 'cause I thought that wе was enemies, yеah
The big you is like a mini me
Like BIG U, man, I'm a legend in my city streets, yeah
Niggas peep, I wrote this shit while I was whippin' streets
Like fuck the law, I dropped Adonis off and pick a beat, yeah
Ballin' by the beach, like Miami Heat, yeah
Presidential suites, we don't get impeached
I talked to God standin' up straight, I don't get on my knees
That isn't me, that's not the person I was raised to be
Just wait and see

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shit is jumpin' in my bank account
You know what I'm about
Before I made it out, I said, "I've got to make it out"

[Chorus]
And I did, I did, I really did
Switch up the sentiment, rappin' on instrumentals
That's how I paid the rent
LA, at a big event
Been ten years, niggas hated him, now they cavin' in
Now, wait a minute

[Intro]
Hey, woman

She can grow it from her womb, a family
Provide lovin' overlooked and unappreciated, you see (Yeah)
You can reciprocate

Just protect her and keep her safe
Baby, worship my hips and waist

I touch your soul when you hear me say, "Boy"
Let me be your woman

[Chorus]
Woman
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman

Woman, woman, woman
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman (Ayy)

Woman, woman, woman

[Verse 2]
I can be your lady, I'm a woman
I'm a motherfucker, but they got a problem
Put some babies in your life and take away the drama
Put that paper in the picture like a diorama
Gotta face a lot of people of the opposite
'Cause the world told me, "We ain't got the common sense"
Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
And you will never know a god without the goddesses
Honest, it's fuckin' honest, get
And I could be on everything
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl
They wanna pit us against each other
When we succeedin' for no reasons
They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls
Princess or queen, tomboy or king (Yeah)
You've heard a lot, you've never seen (Nah)
Mother Earth, Mother Mary rise to the top
Divine feminine, I'm feminine (Why?)

[Chorus]
Woman (Daddy)
Let me be your woman (Let me be your—)
Woman, woman, woman (I need to be your—)
I can be your woman

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
I ain't got no more ass left, bitch, I rapped it off
You just ain't gon' have no more head after I snatch it off
What in the fuck is you thinkin'?
You can't do shit if you stankin'
Keep on thinkin', if I said it then it's done
I give a fuck what you bringin'
'Cause my thang still gon' be swingin'
You here them fuckin' choppers cuttin' niggas, run, nigga
Hike, nigga, hut one, nigga, want some?
Ain't nuttin' to fuck ya up, representin' where I come from
Fronts and brown blunts, you oughta get down some
Recognize a fuckin' killer when you be around 'em
Valiums and speed, coke and dope and weed
Steroids and alcohol and still a fuckin' athlete
Cock strong with my jock strap on
'Fore the time clock gone 'bout to run the rock home
Your ace boon coon in the hole in the clutch
In the pocket on the field without gettin' touched
Uh-oh

[Chorus]
I can jump (How high?)

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
You get tackled by the style I'm usin'
Got all of my adversaries cruisin' for a bruisin' with contusions
Cuts and lacerations, broken bones, and open sores
Ripped spleens, sprained ankles, and broken noses
I bust the microphone I rip on
I step on the stage and get my grip on
That's when you get the stiff arm
It's on and I'm the shit, holmes
I fucked around and lost count of bitches I put the dick on
My alter-ego, attitude when I talk to P
Fuck it, call me the hometown hero
I'm the center of attention, topic of discussion
It's understood, they already know without me sayin' nothin'
It's been like that since these niggas down here been wearin' Ballys
I'm off the heezy, I'm the reason for this pep rally
So stuck on myself sometimes it's like I ain't got no mind
I say "Fuck it," dive over the crowd like the goal line
Uh-oh

[Chorus]
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How?), up (What?), down (Ooh)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How?), up (What?), down (Ooh)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How?), up (What?), down (Ooh)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How?), up (What?), down (Ooh)

[Bridge]
Here I come, here I go
Uh-oh, jump 'round, jump
What you wan' do? What you gon' do?
Let me know, girl, jump, jump

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Nigga, you just like ten yards, always the first down
Be the first motherfucker off the bus but be the last nigga to clown
Ol' sometimein' ass nigga, ol' fake regular regular
Everyday common-ass no drama-ass nigga
I keep these niggas sippin' on soup and takin' Advil
Punishin' they motherfuckin' ass and keepin' it that real
Ain't nothin' you can do to keep a nigga off the scoreboard
It's fourth and four, fuckin' right I'm goin' for it
Uh-oh

[Chorus]
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How?), up (What?), down (Ooh)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How?), up (What?), down (Ooh)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How?), up (What?), down (Ooh)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How high?)
I can jump (How?), up (What?), down (Ooh)

[Bridge]
Uh-oh, here I come, here I go

So you took a chance
And made other plans

Why did you leave me all alone?

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Just somethin' about you
Way I’m lookin at you whatever
Keep lookin' at me
(Groove your bones)
Gettin' scared now, right?
(Groove your bones)
Don’t fear me, baby, it's just Justin
(Groove your bones)
It feel good right?
(Groove your bones)
Listen

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I kind of noticed something wasn't right
In your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face'll change

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should groove your bones
Just remember
Sing this song with mе

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Pharrell Williams]
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You’rе a good girl and that’s what makes me trust ya (Hey)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Some people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they’re lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hating
When it doesn't matter anyway
’Cause we're here tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go, the music should groove your bones
Baby, just remember
Sing this song with me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Pharrell Williams]
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
Yeah, you know I can make you happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance
To be your man
I won't let you down, baby
If you give me that chance
To be your man
Here, baby, put on my jacket
And then

Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, maybe we'll fly the night away(I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl, ooh

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Ma, what you wanna do? I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see, I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids ask how the chain glow
Point to her, they say, "Wow, it's the same glow"
Point to me, I say, "Yeah, it's the same dough"
We the same type, you my A-alike
You have me sleeping in the same bed every night

[Verse 4: Malice, Justin Timberlake]
Girl, ride with me, you deservin' the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride around pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called "Brain"
(I just love your brain)
Ma, take a hint, make me suerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake, now how heavy is that?

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl
(I just wanna love you, baby)
Ho (Ho)
Can't love you like I do
Makes me trust ya like I do
Hey, break it down

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way
Drums
It's kind of special right? Yeah
You know, you think about it, sometimes people...

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I built a house for a love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then
Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears

[Pre-Chorus]
But oh my, oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak

[Chorus]
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried

[Verse 2]
I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Tryna learn to lean into it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back, I don't regret a thing
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by
Keep my heart safe till the time feels right

[Pre-Chorus]
But oh my, oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak

[Chorus]
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known

[Bridge]
Let it be known that I cried for you
Even started lying to you
What a thing to do
All because I wanted

[Chorus]
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known, known, known
That I will choose, I will lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known
Let it be known that I tried, that I tried
Let it be known that I tried

[Intro]
Rock
Rock

[Verse 1]
Rocking headspace
I'm tripping out
This is my place
What you're about

[Pre-Chorus]
If you come over, we can fly away together
Let's go

[Chorus]
Take me down, and you hold me right
Spin me all around, I feel so dizzy
I fall into you
You rock me, you rock me, you rock me in
Can you hold me tight, and don't let go?
Take me in your arms, and bring me closer
Ooh, I want you
You rock me, you rock me, you rock me in

[Verse 2]
If you want to, we can race
I'm super fast now
You wanna chase?
I can fake it, because you're mine
Double time now, so get in line

[Pre-Chorus]
If you come over, we can fly away together
Let's go

[Chorus]
Take me down, and you hold me right
Spin me all around, I feel so dizzy
I fall into you
You rock me, you rock me, you rock me in
Can you hold me tight, and don't let go?
Take me in your arms, and bring me closer
Ooh, I want you
You rock me, you rock me, you rock me in

[Bridge]
My world is spinning 'round you
Don't wanna let you down
I'm lost when you're around me
Take me so far away from here
Look how I'm spinning 'round you
Don't wanna let you down
I'm lost and can't be found now
Take me down, take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
If you come over, we can fly away together
Let's go

[Chorus]
Take me down, and you hold me right
Spin me all around, I feel so dizzy
I fall into you
You rock me, you rock me, you rock me in
Can you hold me tight, and don't let go?
Take me in your arms, and bring me closer
Ooh, I want you
You rock me, you rock me, you rock me in

[Outro]
Rock me in, you rock me in
Rock me in, you rock me in
Rock me in, you rock me in

[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "fuck the patriarchy"
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well

Tall and fine and dark and handsome
The boy from South Detroit keeps passing and
I can't stop my panties from dropping
He's so fly

[Verse 1]
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
(Mmm, mmm, mmm-mmm)

[Verse 2]
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
To fix you

[Outro]
Yeah, lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Verse 1]
We been hangin' out together since forever
But we only ever been just friends
I remember we would mess around together
Walkin' home from school when we were ten
Made me giggle but I never really figured
That it would become somethin' much more
As the years went by the tension built up high
And now I see you different than beforе

[Chorus]
You can be my boyfriend if you want
I can be your girlfriеnd if you want
I know that you want this (Put, put, put it on)
We can start a story (Put, put, put it on)
You can be my Heaven 'til I die
I can be the Bonnie to your Clyde
Never gettin' borin' (Put, put, put it on)
We can start a story (Put, put, put it on)

[Verse 2]
Should we take a chance on this newfound romance
Or will we crumble everythin' we built? (I don't know)
Can we risk it just for kisses? Is it worth it
Or will there be blood that's gettin' spilled? (Said I don't know)
Kinda nervous, kinda scary but I like it
Gotta tell me, do you feel the same? (I know you do)
Maybe we should just forget we ever mentioned it
We'll never know, it's such a shame

[Chorus]
You can be my boyfriend if you want
I can be your girlfriend if you want
I know that you want this (Put, put, put it on)
We can start a story (Put, put, put it on)
You can be my Heaven 'til I die
I can be the Bonnie to your Clyde
Never gettin' borin' (Put, put, put it on)
We can start a story (Put, put, put it on)

[Outro]
Page, I never saw you this way
Let's turn the page, turn the page, yeah

[Verse]
Layin' in the bed with the bad guy type (Ah, ah)
Take it to the bath, 

[?] all my life (Ah, ah)
I thought about a thousand times I made you cry, but you
Don't understand what I wanna be, your tune
And it's a little secret to everybody I talk to

[Chorus]
I feel it for the first time
Lightnin' runnin' through me, oh, oh
Lightnin' bolt shaped fire through my veins
Lightnin' runnin' through me, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
So say goodbye to all the times
I felt like I had to run and I had to disguise
I feel it for the first time, yeah
Lightnin' runnin' through me, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Now I'm gonna burn bright

[Outro]
When I love me
When I trust me
You just gotta do you
I'm just gonna do me
Bring the lightning
Feelin' so free
Wanna touch me
You just gotta do you
I'm just gonna do me

[Verse 1]
At nine o'clock an' I'm in your arms
An' the wind blows on the boulevard
An' the world turns, put a movie on
Eat breakfast, sitting in the crumbs
We touch toes, staying in the sheets
Got no clothes, it's a fantasy
Then my phone goes
It's one of those days

[Verse 2]
At nine o'clock gotta go to work
Gotta get up, gotta pick my shirt
I hate my boss, he's such a jerk
When he's talkin', it's not my concern
He's like "Blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah"
But I don't care
It's one of those days

[Chorus]
I don't wanna get up
I'm dreamin' baby
I don't wanna wake up
Wanna lay, wanna lay
Wanna lay, wanna lay
Wanna lay, wanna lay
Right here with you

Wanna lay, wanna lay
Wanna lay, wanna lay

[Verse 3]
Six o'clock an' I'm on the road
Been a long day, now I'm drivin' home
Then a song plays, on the radio
An' it's so bad, I gotta turn it off
I got stuck in, that traffic jam
But I made it, things are goin' to plan
An I see you
It's one of those days

[Verse 4]
Now I'm back, an you're kissin' my lips
Got my eyes shut just like 

[?]
Then we sit down, talk about my day
On the sofa, take the pain away
We go "Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha ha-ha, yeah, you make me laugh
I feel happy
It's gonna be okay

[Chorus]
I don't wanna get up
I'm dreamin' baby

Perfume on, I'm feelin' pretty
Turn the heat up, turn the heat up
Fifteen miles from the city
Wanna meet up, wanna meet up

[Pre-Chorus]
When it all comes off then it all goes down
Come on follow my lead
Get you off when I'm goin' down
Head spinnin' 'round, spinnin' 'round
All comes off and it all goes down
Come on follow my lead
Come on follow my lead, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause all I wanna do is (Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh)

[Verse 1: Lizzy McAlpine]
It's always on the tip of my tongue
I read an article on the internet
Told me that that's how you know you're fallin' in love
Don't really trust what's on the internet
But maybe just this once

[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine]
Hate to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knew
Hate to be lame but I might love you

[Verse 2: Lizzy McAlpine & FINNEAS, Lizzy McAlpine]
It's always on the tip of my tongue
But I stop myself from sayin' it
Tell myself it's not the right time or something dumb
But then you kiss me like you do
And we're right back where we started from

[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine & FINNEAS]
Hatе to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knеw
Hate to be lame but I might love you

[Bridge: Lizzy McAlpine]
Do I love him? Do I need him?
Do I want him? Do I care enough to say
That I love him, that I need him?
'Cause I don't but I want to feel okay
If I love him, if I need him
Maybe that will make him stay
If I lie, will I still feel this way?

[Verse 3: FINNEAS]
It's always in the back of my mind
Maybe my mistakes are the reason
That I made it back to you in time
If I could rewind, would there be some butterfly effect?
What if we never met? What if the stars never aligned?

[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine & FINNEAS]
Hate to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knew
Hate to be lame but I might love you

[Outro: FINNEAS]
Alright, you ready?
Two bars

[Intro: Kanye West]
Take what you want
Take everything
Take what you want
Take what you want

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Better that I change my number so you can't explain
Violence in the night, violence in the night
Priors, priors, do you have any priors?
Well, that one time
I'll be honest, I'll be honest
We all liars
Let it go

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'm pulled over and I got priors
Guess we goin' down, guess who's goin' to jail?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
God gon' post my bail tonight

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Don't you curse at me on text, why you try to hit the flex?
I hold up, like, "What?"
I scroll, I scroll up like, "Next"
Guess who's getting 'exed?
Like, next
Guess who's getting 'exed?
You made a choice that's your bad, single life ain't so bad
But we ain't finna go there
Something's off, I'll tell you why
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
What a grand plan to sell you out
I could scream and shout, let it out

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'm pulled over and I got priors
Guess we goin' down, guess who's goin' to jail?

[Chorus: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight? (God, I Need to come up more)
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight? (I Need to come up more)
God gon' post my bail tonight

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
God in my cells, that's my celly
Made in the image of God, that's a selfie
Pray five times a day, so many felonies
Who gon' post my bail? Lord, help me
Hol' up, Donda, I'm with your baby when I touch back road
Told him, "Stop all of that red cap, we goin' home"
Not me with all of these sins, castin' stones
This might be the return of The Throne (Throne)
Hova and Yeezus, like Moses and Jesus
You are not in control of my thesis
You already know what I think 'bout think pieces
Before you ask, he already told you who he think he is
Don't try to jail my thoughts and think precincts
I can't be controlled with programs and presets
Reset
On my cell, in my cell tonight
Don't have to see you to touch you
This is what braille look like, it's on sight
If they take me to jail, call my girl, tell her send my mail
We know what Hell look like
Still, it's a hell of a life, yikes

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
God gon' post my bail tonight

When comes the shaking man
A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
Streaking cathedral spire

I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say jump

They say "hey that's really something"
They feel he should get some time

(Jump) Got to believe somebody
Jump
They say jump

[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
Maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Just between us, I remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Yeah
They wanna hang me in the trees
'Tween the truth and everything they tryna get me to believe (Woo!)
Fighting, so it's never guaranteed
Snakes getting raked up with the leaves
Way too late to conversate for peace (What?)
Everything that's fateful come in threes (What?)
Living for another is disease (Yeah)
How the fuck are you supposed to breathe? (Yeah)
Real niggas speak in coded languages
Y’all break it down like the police
I am not a pastor, I don't preach
Raw talent stands beyond a leak
Simply a disciple of the street
Radicals and thugs, we move in sync
Stratosphere is where I'm tryna peak
This elite mental physique
I been incubating my technique
Curate every word like a boutique
I don't listen when these niggas speak
I got niggas that's still tryna eat
Give 'em something to appease
While the baking soda staining up the tee (Woo!)
Let the needle run until it bleed
I don't got a reason to concede
I'm dictating how all this proceeds, best believe
Every other option laid out for me would've led to freeze
Never was who they wanted to lead
Never was the one that thought 

[?]
Never was the one that counted, it was cool to me
Always picked the space so I got halfway to breathe, motherfuckers, yeah

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I watched a lot of niggas lie like it's the truth
I've been staying down to Earth
Digging deeper by the roots
Have a conscious and my confidence
They down to make a truce
When they stop aiming at each other
That's the strongest I'ma shoot, look
I'm from the trenches, but I never get salutes
All these fragments of myself
Make up the human y'all dispute
Turned the memories to melodies
My life was like a loop
When you ballin' for a reason
You see more than just the hoop, nigga
I'm out for dead presidents for every dead homie
They throwin' anchors on my boat
But that shit can't hold me
Dedicate this shit to anyone who think they know me (What?)
Living off of how it sounds but never listened closely (Uh)
Before you tell me who I am
You gon' have to show me (Show me)
I went back to where I came from
I know where I'm going (Going)
The greatest weapon that I got
Is everything I'm knowin'
My future finished, loaded
And you can see me floating
I do the- I do
I do the- I do

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey, hey

I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted
I realize the time that I wasted
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Now, I'll be messed up if you can't be right here

Oh, ooh-woah
Oh, ooh-woah
Oh, ooh-woah
Okay, now, I'll be messed up if you can't be right here

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
Told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay
Oh, ooh-woah
'Cause I do the- I do
I do the- I do
I do the- I do

I need you to stay
'Cause when I'm away from you, I miss your touch
You're the reason I believe in love
And it's been difficult for me to trust
And I'm afraid that I'ma f**k it up
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
'Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed
And you know that I know that I can't live without you
So, baby, Stay, hey, hey

Oh, ooh-woah
Oh, ooh-woah
Oh, ooh-woah

Okay, now I'll be messed up
'Cause I do the same thing I told you that I never would
Told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
'Cause I do the same thing I told you that I never would
Told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay
Need you to stay

Could be, who knows
Theres something due any day, I will know right away
Soon as it shows

It may come cannonballing down through the sky
Gleam in its eye, bright as a rose
Who knows

Its only just out of reach, down the block, on a beach, under a tree
I got a feeling theres a miracle due, gonna come true, comin' to me
Could it be, yes it could
Something's coming, something good, if I can wait
Something's coming
I don't know what it is but it is gonna be great

With a kick, with a shock, phone will jingle, door will knock
Open the latch
Something's coming, don't know when, but its soon, catch the moon, one handed catch

Around the corner, or whistling down the river, come on
Deliver to me
Will it be? Yes it will
Maybe just by holding still
It'll be there

Come on somethin', come on in, don't be shy, meet a gal, pull up a chair

The air is hummin', and somethin' is comin', who knows?
Its only just out of reach, down the block, on a beach, under a tree
ITs only just our of reach, down the block, on a beach, under atree

Its only just out of reach, down the block, on a beach
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight

Ice on my chain, dancin' like Diddy

[Verse]
Aight then
Call the plug, the brick came light skin
Hop up out the cut wit' the choppa, nigga, let's get it
This Cartier Santos on my wrist a mil' ticket
Called the opps at the party, know we gotta deal wit' 'em
I was unsigned in the trap, nigga, now I gotta deal wit' 'em
Pop up out the cut, the choppa got the steel wit' it
Walked in the party wit' my strap, they like, "He for real wit' it"
Nigga, what it was?
Walk inside the club, a nigga dropped another thug
Draco, always poppin' for The Breakfast Club
My young nigga sixteen, doin' hits on the hoverboard

[Outro]
Aight then

[Verse]
Huh
I'ma need a bigger bag for the cohort
Tryna make a millionaire out of slum dogs
Bet that, head crack, blunt force
Cozy with the east Africans up north
Where seven make a three, turn a ten by law
Crescent moon wink, when I blinked it was gone
Left the crib, smacked, no sheath on the sword
Made it by the skin of my teeth, thank God
'03, momma rockin' Liz Claiborne
Had her stressin' up the wall playin' Mary J. songs
Rainy day came, couldn't rinse the stains off
Long way to go, we already came far
Story stayed the same, it was never madе up
Threw me loose changе, look at what I made of it
When the mood change, I'ma poker-face 'em
It's a new day, who got all the aces?
Who be foldin' late? Who know when to play dead?
Who sit up straight when the roof caved in?
Had a full plate, you ain't wanna split it
Tell it to you straight, you ain't wanna listen
Cup runneth over the brim
Bust open, there's no closin' the lid
Drumroll, here go my lil' entrance
Gung ho, I'm the one that go get it
Five O's on me like the Olympics
Pure gold, somethin' told me, "Don't mix it"
Caught a feelin', momma had me out Temple
Not religious, we was really out Philly
Livin' on the fly tryna wing it
We got us a fire to rekindle
Redirect the fight where it's meant for
Triumph over plight and immense loss
Ride alone at night, I get clear thoughts
Caught a couple slights and I veered off
Saw another height, had my ears poppin'
Walked outside, it was still gorgeous

[Chorus]
Sharp incisors reveal slowly
In the dark inside, we was real hungry
On a seven of the five, we was real hungry
Uh, niggas still drummin'
Foot shook ground when I stepped on it
Didn't look back when I broke soil
'Cause every time I did it would hurt more
In the dark inside, we was real hungry
On a seven of the five, we was real hungry
And I didn't look back when I broke soil
'Cause every time I did it would hurt more

[Outro]
Alright
Yessir, this nigga spittin'
Damn, nigga

[Intro]
Haha, ha, haha
Haha, ha, haha
Mm-mm, yeah
Mm-mm, yeah
Lift me up, lift me up (Haha, ha, haha)
Hallelujah (Hallelujah)
Yeah, lift me up, lift me up
Hallelujah (Lord, lift me up)
Okay (Haha, ha, haha)

[Verse 1]
Half a mill' posted in Bel Air lobby
Yeah, fuckin' with a star, think she somebody
I like her real sweet, thotty and a little snobby
I like the (rapper?) gettin' hoes, just my real hobby
Yeah, money and the chase, chasin' don't stop it
I need the gross, same number as the profit
She want a nigga who gon' lock her, got a lot of options
How she fallin' in love, I ain't even pop yet? (Bro)

[Chorus]
I pay extra for thе big body (Body)
I'm a cold ass nigga, need a hot thottie
Bless me, got thе money runnin'
And that chain on my neck, I got chills from it
Prayed it up, you slept on me but I waited up
Lookin' at me crazy like I made it up
Praise hands to me 'cause I'm way up (Lord, lift me up), up

[Verse 2]
Lift me up, lift me up, got the engine in trunk
I need hunnid on two and I need one on the pump
S-s-second to none and I'm Neo, the one
Your, your life just begun and I do this for fun
Fakin' that flex on the 'Gram, nigga, stop it
You took my style, had a baby, adopted it
Why would I lie when it's facts that you copied it?
Heard your new shit, floppy this (Bro)

[Chorus]
I pay extra for the big body (Body)
I'm a cold ass nigga, need a hot thottie
Bless me, got the money runnin'
And that chain on my neck, I got chills from it
Prayed it up, you slept on me but I waited up
Lookin' at me crazy like I made it up
Praise hands to me 'cause I'm way up (Lord, lift me up), up

[Verse 3]
Lift me up, lift me up, ultrabeam on the watch
High speed in the drop, and her hand on my crotch
Yes, sweepstake shawty, she could win the jackpot
Yeah, straight to the top, man, that pussy top notch
For certified banger, last ten summers
Do what I want, I can have if I want her
Yeah, I might like but I don't really love her
These hoes ain't loyal, gotta use a rubber (Bro)

[Chorus]
I pay extra for the big body (Body)
I'm a cold ass nigga, need a hot thottie
Bless me, got the money runnin'
And that chain on my neck, I got chills from it
Prayed it up, you slept on me but I waited up
Lookin' at me crazy like I made it up
Praise hands to me 'cause I'm way up (Lord, lift me up), up

[Outro]
Lift me up, lift me up (Lift me up, lift me up), yeah
Lift me up, lift me up (Lift me up, lift me up), yeah
Lift me up, lift me up (Lift me up, lift me up), yeah
Lift me up, lift me up (Hallelujah)
Lord, lift me up
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Lord, lift me up

[Verse 1]
I just need someone in my life to give it structure
To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her
You're everything I want, but I can't deal with all your lovers
You're saying I'm the one, but it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me love when you are down and need another
I've got to get away and let you go, I've got to get over

[Chorus]
But I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
I love you so

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna pack my things and leave you behind
This feeling's old and I know that I've made up my mind
I hope you feel what I felt when you shattered my soul
'Cause you were cruel and I'm a fool
So please let me go

[Chorus]
But I love you so (Please let me go)
I love you so (Please let me go)
I love you so (Please let me go)
I love you so

[Verse 1]
Question-time that says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name
My mother says that she can't stand the neighbours talking
I've gotta pack my bags, leave this home, start walking, yeah
I'm guilty, I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime

[Chorus]
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me

[Verse 2]
Remember when we used to go to church on Sundays?
I lay awake at night, terrified of school on Mondays
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again

[Chorus]
Can't help thinking about me
Can't hеlp thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me

[Bridge]
As I pass a rеcreation ground
Remember my friend, always be found, but I can't

[Chorus]
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

[Verse 3]
Now I leave them all in this never-never land
The station seems so cold, the ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name, "Hi, Dave
Drop in, see you around, come back
If you're this way again"
I'm on my own
I've got a long long way to go
I hope I make it on my own but

[Chorus]
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't, can't, can't, can't, can't
Can't, can't, can't, can't, can't
Can't, can't, can't, can't, can't
Can't help thinking about me
Now Uncle Bill was my Mothers Brother, a tall lanky man
But somewhere back in Uncle Bill's life, he took to sniffin' cocaine
I'd find him out in the back yard, sittin' against a tree
His eyes bugged out in a cocaine stare and his mind in a cocaine dream

Well one fall day when Uncle Bill was having a cocaine fit
He said "Louise this coke's no good and I've made up my mind to quit
Now you take this key and I'll go upstairs and then you lock the door
And Lord I swear I'll stay up there till I don't want dope no more"

Well, he stomped the floor and he bеat the door and he moaned a mournful cry
Whеn the last cocaine went through his brain, we thought he'd surely die
He yelled and he cussed and he fell on the floor and we almost gave up hope
As long as I live I won't forget when Uncle Bill quit dope

Well, for the first few hours we heard not a sound, upstairs was quiet and still
And then all of a sudden we heard a shriek of pain from Uncle Bill
He bounced out of bed and across the room, I heard him break a chair
And then another scream louder than the first as he ripped out a hunk of his hair

My Mother kissed us all that night, as brother and I lay in bed
We wondered if poor old Uncle Bill was dyin' or already dead
But all night long we listened to him as he raved and pleaded and called
And I swear I heard his finger nails tearing the paper off the walls
Well, he stomped the floor and he beat the door and he moaned a mournful cry
When the last cocaine went through his brain we thought he'd surely die
He yelled and he cussed and he fell on the floor and we almost gave up hope
As long as I live I won't forget when Uncle Bill quit dope

After fourteen days and nights of hell, it grew quiet over head
And I peered past mother, as she unlocked the door expecting to find him dead
But to my surprise there was Uncle Bill, as shiny as a brand new dollar
His hair was combed and his beard was gone, he'd grown two inches taller

In his old blue suit and his patent shoes, he was quite a sight to see
The light was back in his deep blue eyes as he turned to mother and me
He said "Louise, I've been through hell and I nearly went insane
But I finally kicked that devil's habit, I beat that demon cocaine"

Well, he stomped the floor and he beat the door and he moaned a mournful cry
When the last cocaine went through his brain we thought he'd surely die
He screamed and he hollered and he fell on the floor and we almost gave up hope
As long as I live I won't forget when Uncle Bill quit dope
As long as I live I won't forget when Uncle Bill quit dope

Cause your face is all I see, so
Please don't pinch me if I'm dreaming

[Chorus]
My lady, it love sacred
Her heart aching, I won't break it
I just felt the nighttime, would last for a lifetime
I won't chase her round town, she won't stick around now

She won't change her mind now, I won't chase her now, now

[Verse 2]
So hard to say goodbye
Wish that these wings would fly
Yeah, cause she cut my wings when she broke my heart
And she took my ring back
So hard to say goodbye
Wish that these wings would fly
Yeah, covered up my nametat, yeah
Now there's no more A$AP

Each morning I get up with the sun
To find at night no work has been done
I know that once it didn't matter
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy
Why won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy!
Oh, how I long to be
The man I used to be!

I want you stop ticking on me
Please stop ticking now

[Spoken Verse: Donda West]
It feels good to be home
And to all of you, I thank you so much for your support
For your support of me for so many years
And more importantly, for the work you continue to do
What did he want me to talk about?
Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous
He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to
And you know, I am my son's mother
The man I described in the introduction as being so decidеdly different, my son
And what made thе project extra special to me is
I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me
But what he has meant to a generation
As one writer said, we came from somewhere
Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers
But from a long line of generations who came before us
It's the-

[Refrain: Sunday Service Choir & Donda West]
Forever, yeah

[Verse: Kanye West]
When you said give you a ring, you meant get you a ring, umm?
You ain't know this is just a fling, umm?
Three hours to get back from Palm Springs, umm?
We was high spent an hour in Walgreens, uh?
Age 40s, bad news for prom queens
A whole 'lotta dad shoes and mom jeans
Screamin' more complaints everytime that I blink
Would you shut up? I can't hear myself drink (It's the-)
We used to do the freak 'bout seven days a week
It's the best collab since Taco Bell and KFC
Talk to me nicely, don't come at me loudly
How you raise your voice in a beat up-ass Audi?
How you gon' try to tell me sometimes it's not about me?
Man, I don't know what I would do without me
Billionaire sport, step up to the court
You rented a room, I bought the resort (It's the-)
God got me, baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'
Time and silence a luxury
Cussin' at your baby mama, guess that's why they call it custody

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
It's the kingdom (It's the kingdom)

Oh, yeah, you wanna take it there
Take a square and lighten up
Cool afternoon, it's a holiday
With you, there's no room for lament

Auf wiedersehen
We'll meet again
Emoji that kiss goodbye (Oh, yeah)
Ladybug fly

Wave, waving all the awful and the off putting away
Wave, waving all the awful bullshit away

There's a truth and that truth can't be denied
Out of tune we're consumed by a lonely device
Ooh, did it happen to you?
Did it trap it a fool?

Bought and sold you
Too cruel, actually
Auf wiedersehen
We'll meet again
Emoji that kiss goodbyе
Ladybug
Wave (Wave)

[Verse 1]
If you wanna talk, then I'll just listen
Even when you’re saying nothing new
I get closer so you know I pay attention
Like we're the only people in a crowded room

[Pre-Chorus]
But right now, we're holding on the hands of time
So baby, put yours in mine
I’ll leave this place whenever and run away together
Later when we're dead, we'll sleep
So baby, put your hands on me
Show all your scars, whatever

[Chorus]
Can't stay fucked up forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll leave what's bad for better
Can't stay fucked up forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll leave what’s bad for better
Can’t stay fucked up forever

[Verse 2]
I don't even know what’s on the TV
Something only bends until it breaks
I don't even hear the music when it's playin'
But nothing really matters anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, later when we’re dead, we'll sleep
So baby put your hands on me
Show all your scars, whatever

[Chorus]
Can't stay fucked up forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll leave what's bad for better
Can't stay fucked up forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll leave what's bad for better
Can't stay fucked up forever

[Outro]
Sometimes there's two kinds of people
Late nights but won't drive you home
Street lights and low lifes
Jeep nights and sunrise
Sometimes there's two kinds of people
Late nights but won't drive you home
Street lights and low lifes
Jeep nights and sunrise
Sometimes there's two kinds of people (Oh, oh, oh)
Late nights but won't drive you home (Oh, oh, oh)
Street lights and low lifes
Jeep nights and sunrise (Can't stay fucked up forever)
Sometimes there's two kinds of people (Oh, oh, oh)
Late nights but won't drive you home (Oh, oh, oh)
Street lights and low lifes

[Verse: Kanye West and Pusha T]
I'd rather deal with the shame than take the weight of the lie
Every time we talk, I just wait for the lies
Every time I get the food, I just wait for the flies
Send my prayers up, I'm just waitin' on the skies
My, my, my, Miss American Pie
Was a hero after Katrina but that levee went dry
Mom met my dad back in '75
Two years later, the chosen has arrived
Holy, Holy, Holy Father
Hold me in an ocean worth of Holy Water
Hold my gemstones, this is my mancala
Fire and brimstone, now they got manginas
When the world built on lies, the truth is a threat
Faith over the fortune, it got me outta debt
It's snakes in money pits that I ain't found yet
Crooks behind the scene like, "He ain't drown yet?"
Rain bills from the ranch 'til the whole town wet
God's grace rains down, that's the holy fountain
Got twelve thousand acres full of holy mountains
See, I almost didn't make it, who am I without Him?
Holy, Holy, Holy Father, hold me in a ocean the size of Holy Water
If plan A worked, I wouldn't know my daughters
Man, every tear I cried in South Carolina

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)

[Verse 1]
Your hands start to chase, the line on my face
I can tell that it’s intentional
And then your tongue starts to chase, thoughts I’ve erased
I said that yours are identical

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve been drawing the line in between you and I
But I’m still thinkin’ bout you
As the line keeps getting thinner, it’s clearer
Baby you can be my mirror, ah yeah

[Chorus]
And I don’t wanna get too close
Cause I won’t wanna let it go
But I’ll be better, for loving you
No I don’t wanna get too close
Cause I don’t wanna let it go
But I’ll be better, for loving you
Better for loving you

[Verse 2]
My vеins start to race in the grave, just a tastе
Of something that’s more visible
And usually I give up before I give in
But only this time I won’t be so cynical, ah hah
I see my name that I had in your eyes
Maybe that’s why I can’t look for love

[Chorus]
And I don’t wanna get too close
Cause I won’t wanna let it go
But I’ll be better, for loving you
No I don’t wanna get too close
Cause I don’t wanna let it go
But I’ll be better, for loving you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Yeah, hah
Better, better
I’m better for loving you
I’m better for loving you
I’m better for loving you, ah
I’m better, I’m better
I’m better for loving you, I know
I’m better for loving you, yeah
Oh, I’m better
I’m better for loving you

[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistlеtoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tеllin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true

Merry Christmas

[Verse 1]
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I’ve walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

[Chorus]
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-going to fall

[Verse 2]
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a nеwborn baby with wild wolves all around it
Saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
Saw a room full of men with thеir hammers a-bleedin’
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, and it's a hard, it’s a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall

[Verse 3]
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin’
Heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
I heard the sound of one person who said he was human

[Chorus]
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-going to fall

[Verse 4]
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman, her body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred

[Chorus]
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall

[Verse 5]
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-going back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well-hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell it, and think it, and speak it, and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But I'll know my song well before I start a-singin'

[Chorus]
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-going to fall

[Verse 1]
Villain man never ran with krills in his hand and
Won't stop rockin' 'til he clocked in a gazillion grand
Tillin' the wasteland sands
Raps on backs of treasure maps, stacks to the ceilin' fan
He rest when he's ashes
Ask 'em after ten miles in his galoshes, smashes stashes
Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
They supposed to know, it show when his aura glow
Get from out the row, when he get dough, it's horrible
Time is money, spend, waste, save, invest thе fess
For ten Ks, he'll cavе a chicken chest S
Yes, y'all, the dub will get ya trickles
The best ballers pitch in and rub together nickels
But tut tut, he 'bout to change the price again
It go up each time he blow up like hydrogen
Villain here, have 'em shrillin' in fear
And won't stop top illin' 'til he a gazillionaire
Grillin' stare, yeah, ya boy had drama
Got 'em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma
Once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
Plus a brand new chrome smoker with the triggers broke
I thought I told 'em, "Firing pins was separate"
He find out later when he tries to go and rep it
Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah
Charged in advance to translate it and ignored it sorta
One monkey don't stop no slaughter
A junkie wanna cop a quarter ton, run for the border
Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill
Flow skill, still, there's no thrill
Fill a billion ten K bills in his pill'a
Villa', when it gets realer, split the skrilla with-

[Verse 2]
Villain—his agenda is clear
Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here
It's not meant for the seein'
Went through the ceilin' after enterin' his center bein'
A new meanin' to sales through the roof
Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof
It's the return of the tramp
Who do a duet jam when Ernest goes to camp
For the right earn, kna'mean like Vern
We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn
Jiminy crickets
He gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off sickly lyrics
One man's waste is another man's soap
Son's fanbase know the brotha man's dope
A real weirdo with a bugged rare flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
Black licorice and equally as yucky
How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be seemin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile, ding! Sparklin' jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach was never dead
Live for a week then dehydrate with a severed head
Instead, it was depicted as flicked in
Split, the wicks lit

[Outro]
Villain
VIllain

[Verse 1]
Weed smoke, windows up, sittin' in the parking lot (Parking lot)
You bring your friend along but we all know she talks a lot
Neighbors at the balcony, I'm prayin' they don't call the cops
You gettin' paranoid, I whip around the block

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me to air it out
You tell me it's gettin' hot
You smoke about half a J, I cannot retrace my thoughts
All these run on sentences, tell me what the difference is
Which one do you prefer?
Sativa or Indica?

[Chorus]
Backseat
I'm the one you need to be around
'Cause I won't bring you down
No, I won't bring you down
No, I won't ever bring you down
You don't gotta ask me
Already know what I will provide
No, I won't steer you wrong
No, I won't steer you wrong
No, I won't givе you the runaround

[Post-Chorus]
Say yes or no
Only if you wanna
'Bout that time
Timе for me to roll up
Yeah, hm-mm

[Verse 2]
Whippin' around three deep, we're sittin' in my Jeep
Oh, it's been a stressful week, I could use the company
Searchin' for some inner peace, you still feel incomplete
You start to question shit like what's the point in anything

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me to air it out
You tell me it's gettin' hot
We smoke half a J, I cannot retrace my thoughts
All these run on sentences, what the difference is?
Which one do you prefer?
Sativa or Indica?

[Chorus]
Backseat
I'm the one you need to be around
'Cause I won't bring you down
No, I won't bring you down
No, I won't ever bring you down
You don't gotta ask me
Already know what I will provide
No, I won't steer you wrong
No, I won't steer you wrong
No, I won't give you the runaround

[Post-Chorus]
Say yes or no
Only if you wanna
'Bout that time
Time for me to roll up

[Outro]
Say yes or no
Only if you wanna
'Bout that time
Time for me to roll up, yeah
Yeah, hm-mm

[Intro: Khalid & Lucky Daye]
Oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh
Hella fine

[Verse 1: Khalid]
'Round the world like I'm tourin'
I got a flight out in the mornin'
I don't know where I'm goin'
But it's ninety-nine in New Orleans now
When it's rainin' it's pourin'
I'm better off by the ocean breeze
Easier not knowin'
Gotta live in the moment

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
My personal and business lives are separate
They're only fuckin' with you for your benefits
Don't get your feelings hurt bein' sensitive, no
Get your feelings hurt bein' sensitive, no

[Chorus: Khalid]
I'll take some time, sit in my retrograde (Retrograde)
I'm gettin' high so I don't feel no pain
In my mind, I feel it in my veins, in my veins
Retro, retrograde

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Found a lil' comfort in the pain
Ain't no fuckin' love on your brain
'Cause if it was you would think about
Everything that I gotta think about
They fuckin' with me for the benefit, how am I supposed to know
When everybody sound the same in the new Lambo? (Vroom, vroom)
Light the blunt, Scottie beam me up (Zoom, zoom)
Time to leave the room, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid & 6LACK]
My personal and business lives are separate
They're only fuckin' with you for your benefits
Don't get your feelings hurt bein' sensitive, no (Yeah)
Get your feelings hurt bein' sensitive, no

[Chorus: Khalid]
I'll take some time, sit in my retrograde (Retrograde)
I'm gettin' high so I don't feel no pain (Feel no pain, no)
In my mind, I feel it in my veins, in my veins
Retro, retrograde

[Post-Chorus: Khalid]
And it's takin' me far
Takin' me farther, yeah
Taking me farther, farther, farther, farther, far
Oh-oh, oh
Retro, retrograde

[Verse 3: Lucky Daye]
Oh baby, you caught me off guard, let you play me
Why'd I involve my heart? Wherever you go, let you take me
Gotta watch all my movement like hooligan, right now (Ooh)
I'm certain I need you, but I'm way too loud
From enemies to frenemies, don't know who to trust
Can't rush through the phases, oh my

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid & Lucky Daye]
My personal and business lives are separate
They're only fuckin' with you for your benefits
Don't get your feelings hurt bein' sensitive, no
Get your feelings hurt bein' sensitive, no

[Chorus: Khalid, Lucky Daye, Both/Khalid & Lucky Daye]
I take some time to sit in my retrograde (Retrograde)
I'm gettin' high so I don't feel no pain
In my mind, I feel it in my veins, in my veins
Retro, retrograde, yeah (Retrograde, ooh)

[Post-Chorus: Khalid & Lucky Daye]
And it's takin' me far
Takin' me farther, yeah
Taking me farther, farther, farther, farther, far
Oh-oh, oh
Retro, retrograde

[Verse 1: Khalid]
(I, I) I wanna ride with you, yeah, yeah
(I, I) Just say the word and you know I'm on my way, yeah (I, I)
But that don’t mean nothin' to you (No, no)
I still hear you say to me

[Pre-Chorus: QUIN & Khalid]
But you wanna be in my ear (Yeah)
Talkin' all this and that (Yeah)
And you wanna know what’s on my mind
Like I got it bad (Yeah)
Do I even wanna take it there?
Kinda feeling that
I've been checkin' you a long, long, long time
And I want you bad

[Chorus: Khalid & QUIN]
You know what I want, don't be actin' brand new (Ooh, woah)
I got what you want, don't be actin' brand new (Oh, oh, woah)
I could put you on, put you on somethin' new (Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah)
Come and put me on, put me on somethin’ new
You know what I want, don’t be actin' brand new (Don’t be actin' brand new)
I got what you want, don't be actin' brand new (Don’t be actin' brand new)
I could put you on, put you on somethin' new (Don't be actin' brand new)
Come and put me on, put me on somethin' new (Brand new, brand new)

[Verse 2: Khalid & QUIN]
You know what it is, face to face
I give you the biz, say my name
Pull up in a Benz, switchin' lanes
I can throw it all, it ain't a thing

[Pre-Chorus: QUIN & Khalid]
But you wanna be in my ear (Yeah)
Talkin' all this and that (Talkin' all this and that)
And you wanna know what's on my mind
Like I got it bad (Yeah)
Do I even wanna take it there?
Kinda feeling that (Kinda feeling that, oh woah)
I've been checkin' you a long, long, long time
And I want you bad

[Chorus: Khalid & QUIN]
You know what I want, don't be actin' brand new (You know what I want)
I got what you want, don't be actin' brand new
I could put you on, put you on somethin' new (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come and put me on, put me on somethin' new
You know what I want, don't be actin' brand new (Don't be actin' brand new)
I got what you want, don't be actin' brand new (Don't be actin' brand new)
I could put you on, put you on somethin' new (Don't be actin' brand new)
Come and put me on, put me on somethin' new

[Outro: QUIN & Khalid]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-ooh, woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Brand new, brand new

[Verse 1: Khalid]
Although I got love for you, I still can't change your ways
You say you need me the most
Only 'cause I'm here with you
Some things aren't addin' up 'cause your actions stay the same
Why won't you tell me the truth?

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
If I knew from day one that you wouldn't ride
You say the pain hits you by surprise
You made it seem like you were down, now you're switchin' sides on me
I know everything, you don't gotta hide from me (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
I can see it all lookin' in your eyes
Tell me what I wanna hear, but it's still a lie to me
Never knew you'd be thе one to live a double lifе for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Chorus: Khalid]
All I feel is rain when you creep out in the night
And you caused me so much pain but I still stand by your side
I cannot feel a thing, sometimes I medicate
So I don't feel the pain when you creep out in the night
And you caused me so much pain

[Verse 2: JID]
Look, uh, check
So many good girls but I tend to love on the troubled type
But I draw a line if I'm thinkin' you live a double life
Devil on your left side shoulder, an angel on the right
We right in the middle of arguin' at the party
Who started it? Hit the gas
You talkative, 'bout to crash
Who parkin' it? Gettin' mad
Is you barkin' at me for sayin' you heartless?
Try my hardest to get in harmony
But we harborin' feelings so hoverin' clouds feelin' down

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
If I knew from day one that you wouldn't ride
You say the pain hits you by surprise
You made it seem like you were down, now you're switchin' sides on me
I know everything, you don't gotta hide from me (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
I can see it all lookin' in your eyes
Tell me what I wanna hear, but it's still a lie to me
Never knew you'd be the one to live a double life for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Chorus: Khalid]
All I feel is rain when you creep out in the night (Creep out in the night)
And you caused me so much pain (Yeah, yeah) but I still stand by your side
I cannot feel a thing (Mm-hmm, mm), sometimes I medicate
So I don't feel the pain when you creep out in the night
And you caused me so much pain

[Outro: Khalid]
All I feel is rain
All I need to know, oh, oh (All I need to know)
I, couldn't believe it, couldn't believe you, no (I need to know)
Sometimes I medicate, I don't feel a thing
Look at what you made me do
So tell me you were never there for me
Mm, mm, mm, oh

[Intro: Khalid]
There's just
Something I've been meaning to say to you
Pick up your phone and hit me back, alright?
Peace

[Verse 1: Khalid]
When there's someone you like, not someone you love
Say you needed the time, and I don't wanna rush
Got a lot on your mind, and I'm not one to judge
No, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Are we playin' a game?
Am I down on my luck?
'Cause this shit's not the same
We don't even touch, should I stay in my lane?
I don't wanna bug you, mm-mm (Ah, ah, ah)

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
So when you're layin' in your bed
Playin' my songs
Can we share the thoughts that you keep? (That you keep from me)
Oh, you're runnin' through my head
Leadin' me on
Honestly I wouldn't change a thing, mm

[Chorus: Khalid]
I won't be such a drag
You don't gotta worry 'bout that, mm-mm, mm
I'll give you your space if you need it
Say it to my face, if you mean it
You make me so mad (So mad), mad
Why you gotta do me like that? (Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm, mm)
Don't leave me waitin' for no reason, oh, oh-oh, oh
Say it to my face if you mean it (Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm, mm)

[Post-Chorus: Khalid & Kiana Ledé]
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin'
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin'
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin'
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin'

[Verse 2: Kiana Ledé]
Why when I pull your way, you start to let go?
I open up and you throw it out the window
I'd do anything for you to say
All we can do is try, but you're so in denial
Been workin' at this for a long, long time
It's feelin' stagnant, we don't even fuck
And I just stay in my lane 'cause I don't wanna bug you, mm, mm-mm, mm, mm-mm

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid & Kiana Ledé]
So when you're layin' in your bed
Playin' my songs
Can we share the thoughts that you keep? (That you keep from me)
Oh, you're runnin' through my head
Leadin' me on
Honestly I wouldn't change a thing, mm (No, I wouldn't change a thing)

[Chorus: Khalid & Kiana Ledé]
I won't be such a drag (Ooh, nah)
You don't gotta worry 'bout that, mm-mm, mm (You don't have to worry anymore)
I'll give you your space if you need it
Say it to my face, if you mean it
You make me so mad, mad
Why you gotta do me like that? (Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm, mm)
Don't leave me waitin' for no reason, oh, oh-oh, oh
Say it to my face if you mean it

[Post-Chorus: Kiana Ledé & Khalid]
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin' (Don't leave me)
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin'
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin' (Don't leave me waitin')
Don't leave me waitin', waitin', waitin' (Don't leave me)

[Outro: Khalid]
Girl, I'm open

[?]
You should see me at night

[Verse 1: Khalid]
It's a full moon outside
Light up the floor
Out on my way to you
Mm, mm, oh-oh, ooh-woah
You should see me tonight
I'm at your door, got somethin' to say to you
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
Have I seen you in another life?
It's like I met you before (Ooh, ooh)
Caught up in the moment (Ooh, ooh)
Caught up in the moment, I know I am (Ooh, ooh)
Yeah

[Chorus: Khalid, Majid Al Maskati, Both/Khalid & Majid Al Maskati]
I can hear you callin', yeah, yeah
Too much, now I'm all in, yeah, yeah
Dive into your ocean, yeah, yeah
Leave your schedule open, woah, woah
I can hear you callin', yeah, yeah
Too much, now I'm all in, yeah, yeah
Dive into your ocean, yeah, yeah
Leave your schedule open, woah, woah (You look perfect)

[Verse 2: Majid Al Maskati]
Got sparks in your eyes (Woah, oh)
Love's hard to find
Both of us know that's the truth (Truth, ooh, ooh-ooh, mm-hmm, ooh, mm-hmm)
Baby
Put my plans to the side
We'll be just fine, especially when I'm next to you (Ooh, ooh)
Mm-hmm (Ooh, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Majid Al Maskati]
Have I seen you in another life? (So perfect)
It's like I met you before (Just don't hurt me)
Never been so open
Caught up in the moment, I know I am (Oh, oh)
Yeah (Baby)

[Chorus: Majid Al Maskati, Khalid, Both/Khalid & Majid Al Maskati]
I can hear you callin', yeah, yeah
Too much, now I'm all in, yeah, yeah
Dive into your ocean, yeah, yeah
Leave your schedule open, woah, woah
I can hear you callin', yeah, yeah
Too much, now I'm all in, yeah, yeah
Dive into your ocean, yeah, yeah
Leave your schedule open, woah, woah

[Bridge: Majid Al Maskati & Khalid]
I can hear you callin' (I can hear you, ooh, ooh)
Too much now I'm all in (In)
Dive into your ocean (Dive into your ocean)
Leave tomorrow open (Yeah, yeah)
I can hear you callin' (I can hear you callin', hey)
Too much now I'm all in (Yeah, too much now I'm all in, now I'm all in)
Dive into your ocean (Dive into your ocean, yeah, yeah)
Leave your schedule open (Leave tomorrow open)

[Outro: Majid Al Maskati]
Woah, woah
Ooh-ooh, ooh
I can hear you
Baby
Leave tomorrow open
You're pretty, proud, na, nana, keepin' me open
But I know what to say
But I know how it feels

[Intro: Khalid]
Yeah, yeah (Ah, ah, ah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Khalid]
Hours seem to go too fast when I'm with you
Just watch it all go past when I'm with you
And that's the usual, but I love what we got goin' on
It's best I let you know, woah (Ooh-ah)
I just hope that I don't crash when I'm with you
It's like I'm on my last when I'm with you
I see you're down for me
Gotta keep the windows rolled up 'til it gets hard to breathe

[Chorus: Khalid]
We'll be chasin' a high, it feels amazin' (It feels amazin')
You in my ride, we were just blazin'
Under the lights, straight to the ceilin'
Out on my drive, give me a feelin'
Chasin' a high, it feels amazin' (It feels amazin')
You in my ride, we were just blazin'
Under the lights, straight to the ceilin'
Out on my drive, give me a feelin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Ari Lennox]
Ooh, ooh
Might just do the dash when I'm with you
Climb up on your lap, put it in cruise
So incredible (Yeah), and I shifted lanes, you the realest one on the coast
Body drippin' like a spring when I'm with you (You)
We're electricity, don't need no fuse (Fuse)
Makin' you lose control
Doin' donuts on it, keep it going 'til you can't no more (Can't no more, hey)

[Chorus: Khalid & Ari Lennox]
We'll be chasin' a high, it feels amazin' (It feels amazin')
You in my ride, we were just blazin'
Under the lights, straight to the ceilin'
Out on my drive, give me a feelin' (You got me feelin')
Chasin' a high, it feels amazin' (It feels amazin')
You in my ride, we were just blazin' (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Under the lights, straight to the ceilin'
Out on my drive, give me a feelin' (Oh, baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Smino]
Baby (Baby)
I love her if I love at all
I don't need no award, no applause, uh-huh
Just take
(Tell me a time and a place and I promise I'll make an appointment
I never been one to be chasin' no woman
I fuck 'round and treat to do time
My forces, I fuck 'round and, uh—)
Back to the drawing board, bored drunk got da Lauryn on
Love, long as a corridor
Word, lil' baby my favorite chore
Sure, other dudes had before
I dig, but I don't give a fuck 'bout nobody or no bodies
Yellow big face on the watch look like Sade
My nigga got a ride in the back, she got shotty
Comme des Garçons, your name
Sweater like crazy (Ooh, ooh)
Love me out loud, L-O-L
'Cause you my baby (Mm)
Cracked a whole tooth, you so sweet
My friends ain't seen me for weeks
I highway chase your heart at high speed, nanana
You like it when I'm chasin'

[Chorus: Khalid]
We'll be chasin' a high, it feels amazin' (It feels amazin')
You in my ride, we were just blazin'
Under the lights, straight to the ceilin'
Out on my drive give me a feelin'
Chasin' a high, it feels amazin' (It feels amazin')
You in my ride, we were just blazin' (When we're just blazin')
Under the lights, straight to the ceilin'
Out on my drive give me a feelin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Khalid]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Intro: Khalid]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need—

[Verse: Alicia Keys]
Thank you for tuning in to Scenic Drive
We're here tonight to provide the vibes
So sit back, relax and enjoy the ride
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Lyrics from Snippets

[Intro: Kanye West, Kanye West & Dem Jointz & Dem Jointz]
If I hit you with a "W-Y-D?"
You better not hit me with a "H-E-Y"
It better be like "Hi" with a bunch of I's
Or "Hey" with a bunch of Y's
I, I lived a hundred lives, uh
So that mean I had a hundred wives
And I am just simply high off life for the hundredth time

[Verse: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
…’member last year when our lives used to matter?…
…Sharper than the sword, wanna do me in
Was it somethin' I said? Well, it usually is
Conscience of subs, I call that subconscious
When a brawl was just bein' unpacked
And the daddy problems was just bein' unpacked in it
We grew up in this algorithm track
So if it's one for love, I need to get the one back…
…

[?] meet an anomaly…

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Most insane out of body experience
And I repent for everything I'ma do again (I accept Him)
And I repent for everything I'ma do again

[Chorus: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Thank You, thank You, thank You for Your mercy
Make me new
Make me new again
Make me new again, no
Make me new again
Make me new again
I repent for everything that I'ma do again
Make me new again
Make me new again
Make me new again
Last night don't count
This mornin' don't count
Lyrics from Snippet

And I found heaven on earth
And it's the deepest meaning

I found heaven on earth
It scares me to death
That this kind of love
Is the hardest yet
I found heaven on earth
It scares me to death
That this kind of love
Is the hardest yet
I found heaven on earth
It scares me to death
That this kind of love
Is the hardest yet
I found heaven on earth
It scares me to dеath
That this kind of love
Is the hardest yеt
I found heaven on earth
It scares me to death
That this kind of love
Is the hardest yet
I found heaven
Fireworks
{Verse 1}
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in
{Verse 2}
Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under scream
But no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
Cause there's a spark in you
{Prechorus}
You just gotta ignite the light, and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
{Chorus}
Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you’rе worth
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby you'rе a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"
You're gonna leave 'em fallin' down
{Verse3}
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

[Verse 1]
I decline to tell you what I really wanna see (Beauty, Beauty)
Lights inside a focus, guide who where you see you be (Loosely, Loosely)

Beg to call, pick up heart
Truth is that you're fine

Choose a life of substance, cover everybody's needs (Beauty, Beauty)
Study of no-one, make it feel like you're a kid (Loosely, Loosely)

Late to call, pick up heart
Truth is that you're fine

[Outro]
Frozen beauty and the eyes are blue, what arе we going to do?
What can anyone do?

Frozen timе and the eyes are green, nobody in-between
Nobody in-between but you

Frozen beauty and the eyes are blue, what are we going to do?
What can anyone do?
Frozen time and the eyes are green, nobody in-between
Nobody in-between but you

Frozen beauty and the eyes are blue, what are we going to do?
What can anyone do?

[Verse 1]
In the beginning, there was nothing
So empty in the space between
And you came in, turned the lights on
And created what it's come to be
Before I pluck your wings, cover me
Please, spread your wings, cover me and

[Chorus]
Promise this, if I die before I wake up
Promise this, take the time to say your grace
On your knees, you pray for me
Promise this, be the last to kiss my lips

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Though I'm walking through the shadows
You are with me and you comfort me
Lay me down now, time for sleeping
But before that, would you restore me?
Before I pluck your wings, cover me
Please, spread your wings, cover me and

[Chorus]
Promise this, if I die before I wake up
Promise this, take the time to say your grace
On your knees, you pray for me
Promise this, be the last to kiss my lips

[Bridge]
By a thread we're hanging on
And I hope you don't let go
If you ever leave me, know I wanna go with you, yeah

[Chorus]
Promise this, if I die before I wake, oh
Promise this, take the time to say your grace
On your knees, you pray for me
Promise this, be the last to kiss my lips

["Like a Prayer"]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Let the choir sing

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, feels like I'm dreaming)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Oh, feels like I'm dreaming)
It's like a dream to me (Mmm...)

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Prayer]
Boom boom boom Westside
Kanye West, Conway West Side
You never noticed that, did you?
The, uh
Hello my name is Ye
And this is my super super super super super long Thanksgiving prayer
On this Thanksgiving, I'm so thankful for family
My blood family, my fans and our haters
We love you too
On Thanksgiving on Christmas morning
Not the night before or the day, just the morning
We're thankful for our current civilization of eight billion people
Our ancestors and our children
I'm writing this prayer on my way back from taking my mini me to his first football game
Saint got to play catch with Tom Brady before the game
This is a God's dream
My mini me is a mix of two of my favorite things
Me and my wife's face
All I think about every day is how I get my family back together
And how I heal the pain that I've caused
I take accountability for my actions
New word alert, misactions
The one thing that all my successes and failures have in common is me
Let's start with A alcohol
I would drink to take the stress away and knock the edge off
Drinking affected my health and the health of people around me, around me
Because I already had a hair-trigger temper and this just heightened it
B episodes, I went into a manic episode in 2016 and I was placed under heavy medication
since then I went on and off the medication which left me susceptible to other episodes
Which my wife and family and fans have had to endure
Ego, my ego has a tendency to go past the threshold of being motivating and entertaining to just being overbearing
There are ways to show confidence without arrogance
Temper, now I know none of y'all would ever picture this but
Sometimes I scream, ha
And that screaming might have helped me tell off everyone who doubted me in music
But that screaming did not help me keep my family together
Religion, self-righteous Christian behavior
When I got saved, it did not immediately make me a better person
It made me a self-righteous Christian
Mix that with being rich, famous and very very very very very very attractive
And you got a Molotov cocktail ready to be thrown through the window of anyone who ever disagreed with me
I was arrogant with my Jesus
Like I just got me some Jesus at the Gucci store with a stimulus check
Let's go with politics here
Good Lord, my wife did not like me wearing the red hat
Being a good wife, she just wanted to protect me and our family
I made me and our family a target by not aligning with Hollywood's political stance
And that was hard for our marriage
Then I ran for president without proper preparation
and no allies on either side
I embarrassed my wife in the way I presented information about our family during the one and thank God only press conference
All my dad had to say afterwards was
"Write your speech next time son"
F is for finances
I spent money like crazy
I mean, it's the craziest thing I've done
And I've done a lot of crazy things
As the priest of my home I must watch my own money and secure our finances
This is America, so people don't consider stealing to be stealing
They just chalk it up to greed, consumerism and capitalism
I've let people use me, I've had giant entourages
People around me, just to make me feel good about myself
I've had to learn that I had to take accountability
We always judge and tell other people what they should do
But we can only take accountability for ourselves and our children
This Thanksgiving, I'm thankful for the family that my wife has given me
I'm thankful for the life that God has given me
And I'm thankful for your time, attention and patience
In Jesus name, Amen
Always knew you
Even when I didn't know you
Don't make sense, but it do
I was on my way to you

Every tear drop fell so heavy
Hurt like hell
But heaven sent me through
I was on my way to you

And every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointing me straight, just taking me home
I was never lost
I was just passing through
I was on my way to you

Hope was hopeless
Faith was running
Didn't notice you were coming through
You were on your way too
And you don't believe in meant to be
But somehow you were mеant for me, it's true
Yeah, you wеre on your way too

And every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointing me straight, just taking me home
I was never lost
I was just passing through
I was on my way to you
I was on my way to you
I was on my way to you
I was on my way to you

Oh, I'm on my way
On my way to you
On my way
On my way to you
On my way
On my way to you

Oh, I'm on my way
I'm on my way
(On my way)
On my way
(On my way)
On my way to you, oh
And every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointing me straight, just taking me home
I was never lost
I was just passing through, on my way to you

On my way
On my way to you (ooh)
On my way
On my way to you (ooh)
On my way
On my way to you

On my darling, I'm on my wayje

[Verse 1]
Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him and it hit him so

[Verse 2]
Poor dunce
He pushed back the pigmen
The Barbs laughed
The fool is dead

Poor dunce
He's less than within us
The brains talk
But the will to live is dead
And prayer can't travel so far these days

[Verse 3]
The talk of your life
Standing so near
To innocent eyes
Poor dunce

Swings through the tunnels
And claws his way
Is small life so manic
Are these really the days

Poor dunce, poor dunce

[Verse 1]
I used to wake up in the morning
I used to feel so bad
I got so sick of having sleepless nights
I went and told my dad

He said "son, now here's some little something"
And stuck them on my wall
And now my nights ain't quite so lonely
In fact I, I don't feel bad at all
I Don feel bad at all

Pictures of Lily

[Verse 2]
Then one day things weren't quite so fine
I fell in love with Lily
I asked my dad where's Lily
I can't find her
Hе said "man don't be so silly"

She's been dead sincе 1929
Oh how I cried and cried
If only I had been born in Lily's time
Then everything would be fine

[Chorus]
Pictures of Lily
Made my life so wonderful
Pictures of Lily
Help me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily
For me and Lily are together
In my dreams
And I ask you "hey mister have you seen?

Big screen dolls, tits and explosions
Sleepy time, bashful but nude

Intergalactic, seeming to be you
It's all in the tablets, sneezy Bhutan

[Verse 1]
Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him and it hit him so

[Verse 2]
Poor dunce
He pushed back the pigmen
The Barbs laughed
The fool is dead

Poor dunce
He's less than within us
The brains talk
But the will to live is dead
And prayer can't travel so far these days

[Verse 3]
The talk of your life
Standing so near
To innocent eyes
Poor dunce

Swings through the tunnels
And claws his way
Is small life so manic
Are these really the days

Poor dunce, poor dunce

[Non-Lyrical Vocalizing]

[Verse 1]
Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him and it hit him so

[Non-Lyrical Vocalizing]

People spat upon him
Poor soul
Poor soul

[Verse 1]
All our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun
No peachy prayers
No trendy réchauffé
I'm with you
So I can't go on

[Chorus]
All my violence raining tears upon the sheets
I'm bewildered, for we're strangers when we meet

[Verse 2]
Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you
Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes

[Chorus 2]
All my violence raging tears upon the sheets
I'm resentful, for we're strangers when we meet

[Verse 3]
Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new
Your embrace
It was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu

[Chorus 3]
Steely resolve is falling from me
My poor soul, poor bruised passivity
All your regrets ran rough-shod over me
I'm so glad that we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful, that we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover, for we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over, but we're strangers when we meet

[Outro]
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet

[Verse 1]
Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

[Verse 2]
I know there's something in the wind
That crazy balance of my mind
What kind of fool are you and I?
Scared to death and tell me why

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

[Interlude]
Still I keep my love for you

[Verse 3]
You made a date with destiny
You jog-jog in my memory
You haunt in mind not fade away

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you

[Verse 1]
Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

[Outro]
Still I keep my love for you
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
No place to hide no way to fall
Still I keep my love for you
Still I keep my love for you

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day

[Verse 1]
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

[Refrain]
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?

[Verse 2]
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

[Refrain]
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes just for one day

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us just for one day

[Verse 3]
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

[Refrain]
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day

[Bridge]
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes

[Outro]
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day

[Intro]
Hey now, now
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll
"Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Lеt the children use it
Lеt all the children boogie

[Verse 2]
I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Chorus]
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty 'cause you just got paid

[Chorus]
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
Please stay

[Verse 2]
You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you, baby, you're a porcupinе
You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You'vе made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex

[Chorus]
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh yeah
Ooh, stay for a day
Ooh yeah
Don't you dare
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Woo!
Woo!
Oh yeah

[Verse]
Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free, don't you want to be free?

Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you, cover you
This chaos is killing me

[Chorus]
So bye bye love
Yeah bye bye love
Bye bye love
Yeah bye bye love
This chaos is killing me

[Verse]
(Hallo) Spaceboy
You're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls

But Moondust will cover you
Cover you
And that chaos is killing mе

[Verse 1]
This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there’s always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never rеally tell
When somebody wants somеthing you want too

[Verse 2]
Heart wrecker, heart wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I’ll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

[Verse 1]
Fame (Fame), makes a man take things over
Fame (Fame), lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame (Fame), puts you there where things are hollow
Fame (Fame)

[Chorus 1]
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane ('Sane)
Fame (Fame)

[Verse 2]
Fame (Fame), what you like is in the limo
Fame (Fame), what you get is no tomorrow
Fame (Fame), what you need, you have to borrow
Fame (Fame)

[Chorus 2]
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to crime
Fame (Fame)

[Bridge]
Could it be the best, could it be?
Really be, really, babe?
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?
Could it, babe? Could it, babe?

[Verse 3]
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame (Fame), fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool
Fame (Fame)

[Chorus 3]
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a rain check on pain (Pain)
(Fame)

[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes, "I thought you died alone
A long long time ago"

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare
At all the millions here
We must havе died alone
A long long time ago

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not mе
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I've got the village I love
I walk along beside the garbagemen and I dig everything
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't know a thing
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig

I feed the lions in Trafalgar Square and I dig everything
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug
Everything
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything
I'd see pеople in the street below, who don't know whеre they're going
They don't dig anything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig

I've got more friends than I've had hot dinners
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners
Rick, John, Sally, a connection named Paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything
Dig
I've made myself at home
I've made good friends which the time-check girl on the end of the phone
All the movie shows
I sunbathe for love
Even when it's not too hot
'Cause I dig everything
Oh yeah

Bow Bells strike another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away

Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you

Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yoursеlf down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with thе London boys

You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys
A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You're crying out loud that you're a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys

Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys

[Verse 1]
Oh my, naked eyes
I should have kept you, I should have tried
I should have been a wiser kind of guy
I miss you

[Verse 2]
Give me wings, give me space
Give me money for a change of face
These noisy rooms and passion pants
I loved you

[Chorus 1]
Where's the morning in my life?
Where's the sense in staying right?
Who said time is on my side?
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But I survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

[Chorus 2]
You alone across the floor
You and me and nothing more
You're the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hated when you lied
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

[Verse 3]
Beatle boys, all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs every night
Wish I'd sent a Valentine
I love you

[Outro]
I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
My naked eyes
I'll survive

[Verse 1]
I've nothing much to offer
There's nothing much to take
I'm an absolute beginner
And I'm absolutely sane
As long as we're together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same

[Chorus]
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean
Just like the films
There's no reason
To feel all the hard timеs
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely truе

[Verse 2]
Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't shake
Oh we're absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
We're certain to succeed

[Chorus]
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches
Just like the films
If there's reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true

[Verse 1]

Slinky secrets

No peachy prayers
No trendy réchauffé
I'm with you
So I can't go on

[Chorus]
All my violence raining tears upon the sheets
I'm bewildered, for we're strangers when we meet

[Verse 2]
Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you
Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes

[Chorus]
All my violence raging tears upon the sheets
I'm resentful, for we're strangers when we meet

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new
Your embrace
It was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu

[Chorus]
Steely resolve is falling from me
My poor soul, poor bruised passivity
All your regrets ran rough-shod over me
I'm so glad that we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful that we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover, for we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over, but we're strangers when we meet

[Outro]
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet

[Verse 1]
Funny how secrets travel
I'd start to believe
If I were to bleed
Thin skies, the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me blond
Cruise me, babe
A blond belief beyond, beyond, beyond
No return
No return
I'm deranged
Deranged, down, down, down
I'm deranged, down, down, down
So cruise me, babe, cruise me, baby, oh

[Chorus]
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me, baby

[Verse 2]
The clutch of life
And the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal, Salaam
Be real, deranged Salaam
Before we reel
I'm deranged

[Chorus]
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
And the rain sets in
It's the angel-man
I'm deranged
Cruise me, cruise me, cruise me, baby

[Outro]
I'm deranged
And the rain sets in

[Spoken Interlude]
Ramona is so cold
When she broke it off with Leon, she said
"The ring is enough, I don't wanna see his face again"
Ramona was so cold
Ramona was so cold

[Verse 1]
Baby Grace is the victim
She was 14 years of age
And the wheels are turning, turning
For the finger points at me

[Pre-Chorus]
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
No I have not been to Oxford Town

[Chorus]
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies

[Verse 2]
And the prison priests are decent
My attorney seems sincere
I fear my days are numbered
Lord get me out of here

[Pre-Chorus]
(Here) (All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town

[Chorus]
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies

[Spoken Interlude]
This is your shadow on my wall
This is my flesh and blood
This is what I could've been

[Verse 3]
And the wheels are turning and turning
As the Twentieth Century dies
If I had not ripped the fabric
If time had not stood still
If I had not met Ramona
If I'd only paid my bill

[Pre-Chorus]
(All's well)
I have not been to Oxford Town
(All's well)
But I have not been to Oxford Town

[Chorus]
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies

[Spoken Interlude]
This is my bunk with two sheets
This is my food though foul
This is what I could have been

[Chorus]
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th Century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
(All's well)
20th century dies
(All's well)

All's well, all's well
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies
Toll the bell
Pay the private eye
(All's well)
20th century dies

[Verse 1]
Living in lies by the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is English and climbs the hills
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies
Screaming along in South London
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain

[Chorus]
So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane

[Refrain]
Down on my knees in Suburbia
Down on myself in every way

[Verse 2]
With great expectations I change all my clothes
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold
Screaming above Central London
Never bored, so I'll never get old

[Chorus]
So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane

[Refrain]
Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way

Day after, day after day, day after

In mornings, she's so regal that the valley sighs
In the chilly sea that killed her real slows
Now we're swimming up farther with the doll by our sides
Fill the cup with these sleepy souls

Shimi Kapoor
It's clear that some things never take (Shimi Kapoor)
Please steal these tears
Shimi Kapoor

She will feel like at tea make me laugh all along
With such feats like sex only brought upon
Ooh, lady, ooh, baby, maybe I'll live my lies alone
Jesus, up here, hear me, I, up, up, up, up, oh

Hеaven's girl in a wedding gown

Don't I feel like a saint alive?
She's not mine for eternity
Though I'll never fly so high

That crazy balance of my mind
What kind of fool are you and I?
Scared to death and tell me why

Don't let me down and down and down

[Verse 1: Al B. Sure! & Backing Vocalists]
Getting my facts from a Benetton ad
Looking through African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire (Black tie, white noise)
I've got a face, not just my race, bang, bang
I've got you, babe

Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

Then we jump through hoops, we're divisible now
Just disappear

Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

[Chorus: David Bowie & Al B. Sure!]
Wе reach out over race and hold еach other's hands
Then die in the flames singing "We Shall Overcome"
What's going on?
There'll be some blood, no doubt about it
But we'll come through, don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know I won't kill you
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me, no
But I look into your eyes and I wonder sometimes

Reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Walk through the night thinking "We Are the World"
What's going on?

And I turn my back for I know you won't kill me

[Verse 1]
Where's the pain in the violent night?
I'm depressed by the grin
I stay over many years
I should have thought of that
For the love of the money
Like a black-hearted violin
It's the nature of being

[Chorus]
It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell bad from wrong
I can't pass you by
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me

[Verse 2]
Where the flesh meets the spirit world
Where the traffic is thin
I slip from a vacant view
I should have thought of that
And the sound of tomorrow
Like a black-heartеd vile thing
Like the silеnce of tension

[Chorus]
It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell good from bad
I can't pass you by
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me
You've been around
Can't pass you by
You've been around
But you've changed me
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me

Can't pass you by
You've been around
But you've changed me

Can't pass you by
You've been around

You, you're all I want to know

I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
I feel free
I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
I feel free

The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me

A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
Streaking cathedral spire

I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say jump
They say jump
Watch out!

[Breakdown]
Watch out!
Watch out!

They say 'hey that's really something'
They feel he should get some time

There's no hold
The moving has come through
The danger brushing you
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels
It's so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stiches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke
Has hit the bloodlite

[Chorus]
Glass traps open and close on
Nite flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall

Glass traps open and close on

Broken nеcks feather weights prеss the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall

Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight
Future full and empty, knocking on my door
Ragged limbed and hungry mama, miracle no more

(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)

Morning star, you're beautiful, yellow dime on high
Spin you 'round my living room, miracle goodnight
Evening flower all alone, puzzling, capisce?
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more

(Breath tell me) turn it around

I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here
I wished I had a future, anywhere

[Verse 3]
I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin
The corner of your eyes, I long forevermore
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight

[Chorus]

Obvious, obvious (Aye)
Obvious, obviously
Obvious, obvious (Look)
Obvious, obviously
Aye, aye, aye

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
New crib, with mop floors
Rolls Royce truck with 

[?]
All about the beef, gang of carnivores

[Verse 1]
Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
And Everyday I show another how I love the slaughter
Ill Plug your daughter, full of more holes than sponges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough kis from the Cubans, to build a fuckin fort
I'm caught up in somethin that I can't control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, that's swole
Catching bodies like a cold, and I stay sick, so face it
You make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Waste it, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick
I love money, but the scramblings hot
So I snatch up my man and hit gambling spot
Twenty grand is got, one nigga shot, that's one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest

[Chorus]
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!

[Verse 2]
I'm fed up with the bullshit, so now I'm giving
Slugs to other thugs who don't know how the fuck I'm livin'
I'm wondering, what the fuck you eye-in me for
When you know that D for, blowing shit up like C4
We walk to New York, I stalk with assailanst
Under stress cause ATF keeps me under surveillance
I got a lot of hatred up in me and now they wanna send me
To the penitentiary, to knock out a 10 to 20
For the many lives that I've destroyed and such
Ways that'll make the days of Freddy seem like a touch
Is it much asking to be left alone not to be bothered
Got bitches on my dick like I'm their baby's father
Bring it back like Pearl Harbor, blowing up shit
A big fat shoutout to all the bitches that suck dick
I must get, my dirt done, before the daylight
Make sure my flow stay tight, your fucking A-right

[Chorus]
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!

[Verse 3]
Niggas be like "Ill" when I wreck, cause I don't go fair
Bitches be like "Man he ain't even have to go there"
Whether I get your ass with the body blows
Or hit you with the shotty holes
Your fuckin' crew is running like a snotty nose
I ain't a killer but I'll kill something
And if a nigga holding something, I'm a steal something
I'll peel something back like a nigga's cap, leave him stinking
Put a hole in his head, and find out what he was thinking
Those that don't know the half
I show the wrath of a savage and do bodily damage
To a motherfucker's cabbage
Money had a lot of mouth but as soon as he seen me
His bitchass copped out to a mister-I-didn't-mean-it
Niggas fiend it cause they want it, but don't get it
Cause they sweat it, to fucking hard and let it
Take over shit, dead it now set it
Full breaded like a pit that scratches first, hittin fast
How many motherfucking times must I put foot up in your ass

[Chorus]
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
Aiyyyo, niggas is up to no good!

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]

Add two zeros to the one, I'm in a different mode
This my life, do what I want, I be with different ****
You know the pick and roll, I picked her up and sent her home
I got rich off strong, we get 'em in and get 'em gone
You know Trappy just got out, I ain't have to put him on
We the ones who got the numbers, who put the city on
It's the middle of the summer, I got a hoodie on
My demon time ain't nothin' nice

I came up off of shootin' dice, yeah
My lil' brother ain't livin' right
My sis' and 'em doin' aight
My cuz and 'em still servin' life, yeah
Seen a robber rob a deacon
I seen a preacher get caught for cheatin'

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get

Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that ****
You can miss me with that ****, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and ****)
You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and ****)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby, DJ Khaled & Lil Durk]
Yeah, she think I'm a regular rapper, I'm not

Watch me run this **** to the tippity-top, yeah (Keep goin')
Put my kids in Givenchy
She must think one plus one is three
I can't support your personal needs
She don't got a mortgage, moved in with her niece
These **** be cappin', them cars be leased
Youngest in charge, I speak for the streets
I was nodding off, they woke up a beast
Struggle what made me, we used to have water for dinner, we didn't have nothin' to eat
Soon as I get on his ****, they gon' look at me better, like, "Damn, he was **** with me," yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I'm from the trenches

Well, **** be talkin' like they really rich, but really be beggin' me under my pictures
I'll give her forty, fifty thousand cash to start up a business
I'll spend that **** at the dentist
I'd rather **** her and pay up her rent for a year just to get out of her feelings
I'm in the Lambo' truck in my hood, nobody gon' tell me ****
Goin' to Cali, I pick up my weed for sure, nobody gon' mail me ****
Dice game, Craps and Cee-Lo, I need cash, don't sell me ****
Baby got his hood on smash, yeah, you can tell they really rich
Drop the lo', ain't no room right now, I took her to the O
Then I pulled up on the Lam' 'cause she a fan of Boonie Moe
I got the city on lock, uh, **** up all the opps
I be around with three million dollars in jewelry, I'm standin' on all the blocks
This the anthem, mmm-hmm
Droppin' the six in the Fanta, mmm
Black Rolls truck with the all-white seats, remind me of sittin' on panda, mmm

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Who let the dope boys out?
Thank God you let me crash on your couch
Who's my God that I'm prayin' to now?
Early two-thous, they tried to jump me in, Latino protection
Any direction, you gave me your blessing
Texan, I text him, I told him I got him
Told him I made it to Hollywood, all it took was a summer to fail
Cancel me as hard as you want, it ain't gon' send me to hell
Truth prevails, this is real, miss my brother
I love my mother, drove all the way to Cali' just to check up on me
Made her go home, felt the virus
Internet is like weed and false dreams mixed with science
Deals they had us sign, for years, it had me blind
Think I had to hit rewind and think about why I do shine
Got my cousin doin' time, he was barely pushin' dimes
His whole family cursed, now get the fuck out my ride (Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah
Now get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah
Now get the fuck out my ride

Now get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah
Now get the fuck out my ride

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Live from the gutter, blood like red paint spills
You niggas ain't alpha, you're incels
You normies ain't a part of the script, doxx your house with Crips
Pop shit, now you got content, constant
Where to begin? A veteran with medicine pen
Let 'em all in, treat 'em like they next of my kin
Checkin' your chin way before the record begin
Niggas blow a lot of smoke like they breath in the wind
Ain't no pretend, tell you how it is, how it go
What do you know, when you start escapin' your soul
White on the street, walking the beat like Abbey Road
Truth be told, no such thing as real nigga mode
Through the lights, camera, action, glamor, glitters and gold
Unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
No peace on the street, so I'm clutchin' my heat (Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties)
Gotta watch for these savages roamin' the street (Check)

Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
**** tryna keep up, **** is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a ****, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us

[Chorus: Drake]
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind

Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This **** gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
**** ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a **** while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I **** 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out "YOLO," yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some **** that they ain't thought of

[Chorus: Drake & DJ Khaled]
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind

Crimson on my lips when you kiss
It's movin' close
I need to let you know
Your touch hits me so hot
Like two arrows in the sky
Too young to let it die

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let me down (I won't let you down)
Pressure, pressure, I'ma take it
Tell the truth, now, will we make it? (Ooh, I won't let you down)
I will catch your bullets 'til the day that I die

[Chorus]
Would you feel the same if we were sober?
Would you tell me that you cried if it was over?
Do you get afraid when we get closer?
I just wanna know
Baby can you see our future getting louder?
Tell me, can you see me crying on your shoulder?
Don't you think about it, come a little closer
And we would never be all alone

[Verse 2]
Please don't promise me nothing
I'm standin' in the blue
Still can't get ahold of you
Put my thoughts in an envelope
Write it out to you
Last kiss in a swimming pool

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let me down (I won't let you down)
Pressure, pressure, I'ma take it
Tell the truth, now, will we make it? (Ooh, I won't let you down)

Would you feel the same if we were sober?
Would you tell me that you cried if it was over?

Baby, can you see our future getting louder?
Tell me, can you see me crying on your shoulder?
Don't you think about it, come a little closer
And we would never be all alone

[Verse 1: Egypt Dean & Alicia Keys]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Ooh (Ooh,ooh)

[Chorus: Egypt Dean & Alicia Keys]
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's wherе you'll find me

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Somewherе over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then, oh, why can't I? I-I ooh

[Vocal Bridge: Both]
Ooh (Ooh,ooh)
Hmm hmm
Ooh (Ooh,ooh)
Ooh (Ooh)
Hmm hmm

[Outro: Egypt Dean, Both]
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why can't I?
Better when you are here
Run your hands through my hair

[?] out of my mouth
Your boy is 

[?] with a pocket knife
I'll see you when the sun go down
I'll ignore you when the moon comes out
But I know you believe in me
See 

[?] on the fence
When you decide it's time you'll be back again
So you trace your name on my hair

I say what I wish you could say
If you wanna stay you can stay
It's hard to be here on my own
Just leave when the morning comes

[?] change about

Watching you move through the clouds
Two seconds away from waving you down
(I would rather stay in my place)
By the timе I start to decide if the satisfaction was worth thе fight
(I close my eyes and you're holding me down)

On my chest in the sun
And you left to meet someone
Feel my heart feel it 

[?]
And I'm dancing with no one
No one, no one, no one
No one

I've been on my own, on my own, on my own

I've been on my own, on my own, on my own 

[?]
I've been on my own, on my own, on my own

[Chorus]
I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it
Kitchen, island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options

[Verse 1]
I know you faded, boy
I feel it wearin' off
When I get Hen' and Coke
I like the way you talk, yeah
I couldn't give a fuck
Givin' him paranoia
He just wanna smash on tour
Fuckin' for the new velour
I like it when you with me all night
I can't imagine what you might try
Yeah, you so full of surprises
Guess you one of my vices
You want a picket fence and a wife
You never change your mind when I cry
Yeah, I see your flaws and you know it
Droppin' your jaw when the drawers hit the floor

[Chorus]
I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it
Kitchen, island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options

[Bridge]
You can count on me
To never count on you
I'm only down for you
We pretty down, baby, well, I, I

[Verse 1]
I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Verse 2]
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Refrain]
No time to die
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?

Are you death or paradise?

[Verse 1]
Oh, holy night! The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appears and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary soul  rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the Angel voices!
Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine!
Oh night, Oh  night divine!

[Verse 2]
Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the Wise Mеn from Orient land
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to bе our friend
He knows our need, to our weakness is no stranger
Behold your King; before Him lowly bend
Behold your King; before Him lowly bend

[Vocal Bridge]

[Outro]
A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, Oh hear the Angel voices!
Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine!
Oh night, Oh night divine!

[Verse 1]
She keep askin' me what we are
But I'm not tryna do relationship (Ship)
I'm just tryna have some relations quick (Quick)
And I know that she don't wanna be alone tomorrow
I was already plannin' on dickin' her down
While she may shoot it, I'll be stickin' around

[Pre-Chorus]
She told me to stand up (Stand up), bend it, oh, oh
I wasn't ready for it (For it)
But now she gettin' on top and she ain't gon' stop
Got her hands on the headboard, oh
We ain't got a plan, wait a minute, oh, oh
I think she in love with me (Love with me)
I know I couldn't trust bitches (Trust)
But now she got a hold of my gun

[Chorus]
Shootin' up the club (Hey), club (Hey)
Baby, I'm just thinkin' out loud (Loud)
You know that I wanna give it to you right now (Now)
But if you keep on puttin' it down
I'm shootin' up the club, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Shorty, this gettin' out of hand (Of hand)
I know you want me to be your man
But you need to understand, I'm shootin' up the club

[Verse 2]
I need you to get up (Get up)
Baby, let me think, you know I ain't shootin' blanks
But you damn sure pullin' my trigger (My trigger)
Show me where the camera at, this shit better be a prank, oh
Prolly need a shot of liquor (A shot of liquor)
You know I can go again, mm-hmm, mm-mm, hmm
Now she know I can't quit her (I can't quit her)
She looked at me then she took my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
She told me to stand up (Stand up), bend it, oh, oh
I wasn't ready for it (For it)
But now she gettin' on top and she ain't gon' stop
Got her hands on the headboard, oh
We ain't got a plan, wait a minute, oh, oh
I think she in love with me (Love with me)
I know I couldn't trust bitches (Trust)
But now she got a hold of my gun

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

Girl, I'm shootin' up the club (Hey), club (Hey)

Stand, I'm shootin' up the club

[Chorus]
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out
Of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

[Verse]
In my own way, this feel like livin'
Some alternate reality
And I was drownin', but now I'm swimmin'
Through stressful waters to relief
Yeah, oh, the things I'd do
To spend a little time in Hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself (I'll prolly never even tell myself)

[Bridge]
Don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it look like rain
Grey skies are driftin', not livin' forever
They told me it only gets better

[Chorus]
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out
Of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

[Chorus 1]
You could have the world in the palm of your hands
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
I tell 'em, "Red light, stop it"
Shit, that give me more headaches than alcoholics

[Verse 1]
There was nothin' in my wallet, just a lot of dreamin'
I built a crib on top o' the Promised Land, we'll call it even
Hmm, I bring more flavor than all the seasons
Winter, spring, summer, fall
The grass is always greener 'til I cut it all
Please leave me to my studies, I give you no applause
My hands been countin' money, and it's hard to be the boss
But somebody gotta do it (It gets so exhausting)
Often with the bullshit, and, baby, I been through it
Enough for the both of us
So come over later and we won't let no one close to us
We could be posted up
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
Okay, but you could have the world in the palm of your hands
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
So it goes
It's like, in every conversation, we the topic
This narcissism, more like narcotics
So it goes

[Chorus 2]
Well, everybody gather round
I'm still standin', sit down
Whoa-oh
And I know I been out
But now I'm back in town, so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes

[Verse 2]
Well, this is a special delivery, comin' to you live with the
Endless artillery, always down to ride
My eyes on the enterprise
Nine lives, never die, fuck a Heaven, I'm still gettin' high
Never mind, did I mention I'm fine?
'Cause her pussy gettin' wetter when the weather dry
Clementine, peelin' off and everyone get left behind
I'm only 5'7'' 'cept I'm feelin' like I'm 7'5"
Damn it, cross planets, interstellar
Never land, not a Jackson, packed with action
So what's happenin', my man?
No relaxin', kickin' back, this ain't exactly in the plan
I can't get no satisfaction, goddamn
They sayin' I been gone too long
I could just tell 'em, "Fuck you," but that come on too strong
My God, it go on and on
Just like a circle, I go back where I'm from

[Chorus 2]
Well, everybody gather round
I'm still standin', sit down
Whoa-oh
And I know I been out (And I know I been out)
But now I'm back in town (But now I'm back in town), so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes

[Chorus]
They say I just got a buck, ayy
Get into it (Hеy, ah), yuh
Pop out with a truck, ha
Get into it, yuh (Yuh)
If you go to church
I said get into it, yuh
If she ain't got a butt (Yuh, yuh)
Nah, fuck it, gеt into it, yuh (Yuh)
And I say I just got a buck
Get into it, yuh
Pop out with a truck
Get into it, yuh
If you go to church
Get into it, yuh
If she ain't got a butt
Fuck it, get into it, yuh (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Y'all need to get into the drip like a piranha
Y'all need to get into my drip like y'all need water
I mean, it's only head to toe Balenciaga
I mean, y'all bitches better "yuh" like Ariana
Told me I’m off my fish shot
(?)
She's the queen of tiktok, I’m the queen of hip hop

[Chorus]
They say I just got a buck (Yuh)
Get into it, yuh (Ayy)
Pop out with a truck, ha
Get into it, yuh (Pop out, pop out)
If you go to church (Ayy)
I said get into it, yuh (Yuh)
If she ain't got a butt (Yuh, yuh)
Nah, fuck it, get into it, yuh (Yuh)
And I say I just got a buck (Ayy)

Pop out with a truck (Ayy)
Get into it, yuh (Yeah)
If you go to church
Get into it, yuh (Go to church)
If she ain't got a butt
Fuck it, get into it, yuh
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Thank you, Nicki, I love you
Got that big rocket launcher!
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're oldеr
Shorter of breath and one day closеr to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Who let the dope boys out?
Thank God you let me crash on your couch
Who's my God that I'm prayin' to now?
Early two-thous, they tried to jump me in, Latino protection
Any direction, you gave me your blessing
Texan, I text him, I told him I got him
Told him I made it to Hollywood, all it took was a summer to fail
Cancel me as hard as you want, it ain't gon send me to jail
Truth prevails, this is real, miss my brother
I love my mother, drove all the way to Cali' just to check up on me
Made her go home, felt the virus
And the night is like weed and false dreams mixed with signs
Deals they had us sign, for years, it had me blind
Think I had to hit rewind and think about why I do shine
Got my cousin doin' time, he was barely pushin' dimes
Whole family cursed, now get the fuck out my ride

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
Now, get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
Now get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
Now get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
Now get the fuck out my ride

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Live from the gutter, blood like red paint spills
You niggas ain't alpha, you're incels
You normies ain't a part of the script, doxx your house with Crips
Pop shit, now you got content, constant
Where to begin? A veteran with medicine pen
Let 'em all in, treat 'em like they next of my kin
Checkin' your chin way before the record begin
Niggas blow a lot of smoke like they breath in the wind
Ain't no pretend, tell you how it is, how it go
What do you know, when you start escapin' your soul
White on the street, walking the beat like Abbey Road
Truth be told, no such thing as real nigga mode
Through the lights, camera, action, glamor, glitters and gold
Unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
No peace on the street, so I'm clutchin' my heat
Gotta watch for these savages roamin' the street (Go)

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]

It is a lot of hoes in here, lots of lost souls
Whole group of dime b*tches and they in Vogue
Tryna find me a b*tch that no one knows
You see that b*tch right there, she f*cked OVO
You see that b*tch right there, she f*cked Romeo
Tryna find me a b*tch that no one knows
I'm tryna find me a b*tch that no one knows



Jumpin' out the coupe, pullin' out smooth
I'm not afraid to lose, I put you on the news
Titties on the FaceTime, let 'em out
Block him, erase him, let me know
Shawty hop in that Bentayga, it's time to go
When I put you in the latest, make sure you know
(Chorus)
I know that you kiss and tell
Who's someone that we can tell?
You need a real n*gga in your life
I come in like a thief in the night
Two phones, and they stay on tight
Women know me... I'm picky who I like
There's not a fake b*tch in sight
Come in like a thief in the night


Jumpin' out the coupe, pullin' out smooth
I'm not afraid to lose, I put you on the news

Shawty hop in that Bentayga, it's time to go
When I put you in the latest, make sure you know

(Verse2)
I'm quick to book a flight, I'm not new to the game
That pussy gettin' tame, go public on the lames
I bought it, say that name, Alexander McQueen
Rolex, woah-woah, heart on froze
Ten white toes, it's hot out here, I've hit my lows
Your leverage in the back
Your best friend was trash, trash, trash
Keep goin' like The Flash, Flash, Flash
Let's add and subtract, math
I see that you look at these VV-VVs
Let's get you a piece for me
(Chorus)
I know that you kiss and tell
Who's someone that we can tell?
You need a real n*gga in your life
I come in like a thief in the night
Two phones, and they stay on tight
Women know me, I'm picky who I like
There's not a fake b*tch in sight
Come in like a thief in the night


Alright, babe, ooh, alright, babe
Yeah, I know it's hard, babe

Busy all the time, babe, too late to reply, babe
Put me to the test, we young but we pay bills

Lately, I been stressed (mini midnight drill)
No regrets when it's real
(Outro)
Alright, babe, ooh, alright, babe

But I'm still on your side, babe
Alright, babe, alright, babe
I know it's hard, babe

It's so hard to fake when everything I do is real
Money and a doggie bag, I ain't missin' no meals
Don't move on me wrong, I need to save my energy

Ooh

[Verse 1]
It's so hard just holding on
Ain't even picking up my phone
It's hard enough to be, hard enough to sleep
Hard enough to be alone
I'm just tryna to move along
Some times I do and then I don't
You tell me what I'm doing wrong
Tell myself that it ain't healthy
Second guessing, it don't help me
I'm so tired of feeling empty
Dry my eyes, it's time to fight
It seems like I'm always against me
Seems like this is never ending
And I refuse to let it end me
Mentally (Mhm), spiritually (Oh), physically
I need my peace, yeah, oh
I need my pеace, oh, oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I wake up evеry morning and tell myself
"Good morning gorgeous"
Some times you gotta look in the mirror and say
"Good morning gorgeous"
No one else can make me feel this way
Good morning gorgeous
Good morning gorgeous
Good morning gorgeous
Oh

[Verse 2]
All the times that I hated myself (Yeah)
All the times that I wanted to be someone else (Yeah)
All the times that I should've been gentle with me
All the times that I should've been careful with me
Why did I hate myself? (Why did I hate me?)
So intensely
Lord, help me

[Chorus]
I wake up every morning and tell myself
"Good morning gorgeous"
Some times you gotta look in the mirror and say (Yeah)
"Good morning gorgeous"

And I need you to follow my direction
Yeah, follow me, I'm falling out
Like in movie, hold my hand

If we go high, we can skydive
Up in the sky, only rely, on you and I, woah

If we fall down, if we fall down, if we fall down

Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up

[Post-Chorus]
If we could fly
If we could fly

If wе go high, we can skydive
Up in the sky, only rely, on you and I, woah, ey

[Verse 1: 070 Shake]
I'm so androgynous I keep confusing them
Think I'm a polygamist, I want like two of them
Wake up in the mornin', see the life I wanna live
I can't get distracted tryna live my life with them
I know I'm a prodigy, they say they proud of me
And honestly, I gotta be, 'cause there's a God in me
Shootin' for a higher self, a higher frequency
And you don't gotta touch me, I can feel your energy
I'm goin' all the way
And drove through the rain
Went against all odds

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
I'll never lose my cool, ooh

[Verse 2: 070 Shake]
Got a house in Hollywood, that mean she probably would
I think that narcissist, the shoe that probably fits
Shе don't need attention, she just need material things
I knеw she was mine by the second Gucci bag
But there's a emptiness I knew that money couldn't fix
There's a part inside your heart that tells you life is bigger
But we still ride the shit, still get fly as shit
I'm talkin' Prada shit, Balenciaga shit

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
I'll never lose my cool, ooh
Inside this room
I'll never lose my cool, ooh

[Verse 3: NLE Choppa]
I'm on some rider shit, she love that slider shit (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I'm askin' her which ride she in, the Maybach or the Benz?
Me and her, we double tints through 20/20 vision
To keep my cool up, might just need refrigerator, miss
So can you keep it distant?
Don't worry 'bout the past, the future tense, presents we livin' in
Presi', the Benjamins, comma, dividends, but it ain't meanin' shit
I'd give this shit away to somebody who really need it
Lean on me like Tempur-Pedic, for the love you ain't receivin'
'Cause when I'm gone, it's hard to reach me
Part the reason you greedy for the shit your soul don't be needin'

[Chorus: 070 Shake & NLE Choppa]
I'll never lose my cool, ooh (Lose my cool, lose my cool)
Inside this room (Inside, inside, inside this room, woah)
I'll never lose my cool, ooh

[Verse 1]
Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch you know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Verse 2]
Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'd go anywhere, just as long as you were there

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Bridge]
Oh, and on these quiet days
Where souls embrace so silently
Oh, the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I need you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Outro]
Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
(That's for all time)
(That's for all time)
Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you'll never go, that's for all time

Let me just look

[Verse 1]
It's never my intention to start a fight
What do you want from me?
I guess it took me awhile to realize
That nothing comes for free

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't always put my attention on you
Don't mean I'm giving up, don't mean you're not enough
Don't put me in the position to choose
'Cause I will call your bluff
And I don't call that love

[Chorus]
'Cause I need you, yes I do
You got me goin' out of my head, oh, it's true
I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head, out of my head

[Verse 2]
Let's do the talking after, don't waste no time
I'll give you everything
Why are we looking for answers?
Wrong or right, just spend the night with mе

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll put all my attention on you
No, I ain't givin' up
This is more than enough, ah
Don't put mе in the position to lose
And you can call my bluff
But I don't call that love

[Chorus]
'Cause I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head, oh, it's true
I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head, out of my head

[Bridge]
Just hold me close, don't let me go
I can't give you more than me
It's late at night with you by my side
There's a thing I realized lately
That I, that I, that I

[Chorus]
That I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head, oh, it's true
I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head
'Cause I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head, oh, it's true
I need you, yes, I do
You got me goin' out of my head, out of my head

[Intro]
(One, two, three)

[Verse 1]
In the meantime we'll get it straight
I hope our friendship can recuperate
'Cause I've held you in place
Of a wife in the space
A spouse would hold
Only with you, I'm safe

[Chorus]
In bloom with room to grow
I'm only watering seeds that you sowed
In my heart, in my chest, six feet beneath the flesh
When you held my hand, but you signed "BFF"

[Verse 2]
Oh no, I hope you're not a supplement
For absent relationships
'Cause when we're close in a car
Or in a store, or in a bar
Sometimes I want to kiss my friends

[Bridge]
But you don't want that, do you?
You just want someone to listen to you
Who ain't tryna screw you
I swear I want that too, yeah
I just want someone to listen to me
Who ain't tryna do me

[Outro]
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh
As the night becomes dawn
You and I become one
You take my face in palm
Call me the morning sun

[Verse]
Isolation comes from "insula" which means island
Isolation comes from "insula" which means island
Isolation
Isolation

[Verse 1]
On the long hike through
Blue Ridge Mountains
I can feel the earth
Overtake my skin
And I realize none
Of this matters
'Cause I will return
To dust and matter

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cheers to the patriarchs
And the marble arch
Playin' the part
The gatekeeper's march

[Chorus]
Desperate for passing grades
The virility fades
You've got the wrong guy
You wanna slip right in
Amp up the masculine
You've got the wrong idea, son
Dear son
You pick our own prisons, ah

[Verse 2]
To stake dominion over all that one surveys
Is the virile, viral way

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To thе boys
And the noise
Playin' the part
Thе gatekeeper's march

[Chorus]
Desperate for passing grades
The virility fades
You've got the wrong guy
You'll wanna slip right in
Amp up the masculine
You've got the wrong guy
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
You've got the wrong idea, son
Dear, son
You pick your own prisons, ah

[Bridge]
You want dominion to make minions of the stars
Made up of what you are, are, are, are, are, are
You are, are, are, are, are, are
Ooo, yeah

[Chorus]
Desperate for passing grades
The virility fades
You've got the wrong guy
You'll wanna slip right in
Amp up the masculine
You've got the wrong idea, son

[Part I: Conveyer]

[Verse 1]
All aboard the bulletin board, the machine (The machine)
I animorph into an organ, a spleen
Private school boy in uniform assembly
I will assume form, join the workforce, colony

[Chorus]
Conveyor for you
Conveyor for you

[Non-lyrical Break]

[Verse 2]
The fire ants die for a chance at the queen (At the queen)
Carpenter bee dies when he finally leaves a sting, yeah
To be in vein running through your vain body
And I will step on a belt, put my life on a shelf, one of many

[Chorus]
Conveyor for you
Conveyor for you
Conveyor for you
Conveyor for you

[Non-lyrical Break]

[Part II: boxes]

[Spoken Word]
We have no place that we can claim without contеntion
We are constructing a whole nеw edifice of boxes to put people in
To protect a space inside which you can exist, and exist, and exist
Very concerned about giving names, giving names, giving names, giving names
Dissatisfaction seems like the natural byproduct of identification
I truly believe that people who define you, control you

[Verse 1]
He who asks for much has much to give
I don't ask for much, just enough to live
Oh, in the light, morning will reveal the spoils of night
Through the walls of Jericho, oh, lies a heart of stone
With you, half the battle is proving that we're at war
I would give my life just for the privilege to ignore

[Chorus]
Don't call it a lovers' quarrel
Don't call it a lovers' quarrel

[Verse 2]
To whom much is given, much is required
Luxurious liver, you never inquire
It ain't right, you see, who is your family?
If I don't have tools to fight, calling this a quarrel isn't right
Quoting this a quarrel so immorally implies
We're equal opponents and we both antagonize

[Chorus]
Don't call it a lovers' quarrel
Don't call it a lovers' quarrel, ooo
Don't call it a lovers' quarrel
Don't call it a lovers' quarrel, ooo

[Non-lyrical Break]

[Outro]
'Cause we cannot be lovers
Long as I'm the other
We cannot be lovers
Long as I'm the other
We cannot be lovers
Ay, long as I'm the other
We cannot be lovers
Long as I'm the other
We cannot be lovers
Long as, long as I'm-
Don't call it a lovers' quarrel

[Verse]
I've needed a space to articulate my own loneliness not at the level of state, or nation, or race, or place
Loneliness
Loneliness
Loneliness
Loneliness
Loneliness
State
Nation
Race
Place

[Verse]
Why don't you wear some color?
It'd bring out your eyes
You say you'd never bother
'Cause you'd be telling lies
Why don't you try some earth tones
Since you claim you wanna die?
The color of compost
Might make you feel revived
Well, I think it'd look great on you
Go on, show yourself
There's nothing to be scared of
Do it for your health
Say I wanna change you
That was never true
Look up at the grey hues
They could all be shades of blue

[Verse]
I know what it is to be broken and then be bold
Tell you that my silver is gold
Though we're much too old for make believe
And I know what it's like to behold and not be held
Funny how a stomach unfed
Seems satisfied 'cause it's swell and swollen
You caught me
Shootin' cross the sky like a star
But nobody told me
To never let it get too far
You see my silhouette, so you're standing scared of me, of me
Can I tell you a secret?

[Hook]
My wings are made of plastic, my wings are made of plastic
My wings are made of plastic, my wings are made of plastic, oh
My wings are made of plastic, my wings are made of plastic
My wings are made of plastic, my wings are made of plastic, oh
My wings are made of plastic, my wings are made of plastic
My wings are made of plastic, my wings are made of plastic
My wings are made up
And, and so am I

[Verse 1]
It's so predictable
To farm the parable
From every tête-à-tête
But when you see the end
In every beginning
Lessons are all you get

[Chorus]
Bless me
Before you go
You're goin' nowhere with me

[Verse 2]
Met you in the wrestling pit
You came when I needed it
Ah, a body on top of me to teach me
Stayed up past the witching hour
You showed me your secret powers
I wish that mine could freezе time

[Chorus]
Bless me
Bеfore you go
You're goin' nowhere with me
Bless me
Before you go
You're goin' nowhere with me

[Verse 3]
Cupid has it out for me
Gave me crooked alchemy
Eros, oh, good god, good god of flings
Sees the beauty in all things
Stupid's as stupid does
I grasp your cloak because
Maybe you'll grant me wings
If I cling, yeah

[Chorus]
Bless me
Before you go
You're goin' nowhere with me
Bless me
Before you go
You're goin' nowhere with me

[Verse 4]
You must be an angel
Your conscience is clean
Why would you soil yourself
With a monster like me?
If the good Lord sent ya
The good Lord can take ya back
I hope when He comes for you
You illuminate the path

[Bridge]
(Bless me before you go)
(Bless me before you go)
Oh, ooh, oh, ooh, yeah, yeah
You're goin' nowhere with me, me
You're goin' nowhere, goin nowhere with me
You're goin' nowhere with me
You're goin' nowhere with me, me
Me, me

[Outro]
Why don't, why don't, why don't
You bless me
Before you go?
Go, you go
Go
Oh, bless me before you go
Yeah
Bless me before you go
Go
Bless me before you go
Why don't, why don't, why don't
You bless me?
Before
You bless me
Go, ooo, ooo
Bless, before you go
Go bless me
Before you go, go, go, go
You bless me before you go

[Verse 1]
When I'm weary and so worn out
Oh, when my mind's clouded and filled with doubt
That's when I feel the most alive
Masochistic kisses are how I thrive

[Verse 2]
A stiffness inside my neck
And bangin' my head against the desk
If there's no pain, is there any progress?
That's when I feel the most alive
Endurance is the source of my pride, hey

[Chorus]
Might not be healthy for me, but seemingly I need (Uh, uh)
What cuts me, cuts me, cuts me, cuts me, cut me, cut me (Uh, uh)

[Verse 3]
Guess I'm a true immigrant son
No vacancies, no vacations
Sure, I can do better than this
But I don't, won't, don't, hey

[Chorus]
What cuts me, cuts me, cuts me, cuts me, cut me, cut me, hey

[Outro]
Oh no, that's when I feel the most alive
Is when I think I won't survive
And you cut me, cut me, cut me, yeah
Woah, that's when I feel most alive
When I think I won't survive
And you cut me, you cut me, woah
Cut me, cut me
You cut me, cut me

[Verse 1]
Oh
You wanna strip away
Veracity is great
But you'll bleed
And all
For a lukewarm embrace
You serrate your face
With glee

[Chorus]
Don't waste your candor
On bystanders
They'll watch you waste away, waste away, waste away, waste away

[Verse 2]
What's the use of confessing the truth
To an executioner in a booth
About the dueling forces in you?
Now you barely remember your youth
You used to embrace the eerie and helm
Visitations from spirit realms
Gifted to see between astral planes
Now you plead to be plain

[Chorus]
A bystander
Of bygonе standards
They'll watch you waste away, waste away, wastе away, waste away
Don't waste your candor
On bystanders
They'll watch you waste away, waste away, waste away, waste away
Waste away, waste away, waste away, waste away
Waste away, waste away, waste away, waste away
Waste away, waste away, waste away, waste away
Waste away, waste away, waste away, waste away

[Verse 3]
And it's true that the truth gives you free
But when truth is a breach of decree
Dying for praise from a gallery
Whose morality is grey
And they tie all their stones to your name
And they cripple your bones with their shame
Honesty is the most moral way
But morality is grey

[Verse 1]
Hey, after all these years
I'm still here, fingers outstretched
With your imprint in my bed
A pit so big I lay on the edge
Will love let me down again?
Oh no, no, it won't get in
I'm left wonderin'
If it's written on my urn
That I'll burn alone
Like a star

[Chorus]
I wonder how I'll sleep at night
With a cavity by my side
And nothing left to hold but pride, will I
Hold out for more time?

[Verse 2]
Hey me in twenty years
Does your milk still turn to rot too soon?
Do you still hoard souvenirs
And make them mirrors
Of sentimental veneer?

[Chorus]
I wonder how I'll sleep at night
With a cavity by my side
And nothing lеft to hold but pride, will I...

[Bridge]
Hold out a little bit more?
A littlе bit longer, a little bit more
A little bit longer, a little bit more
A little bit longer, just a little bit more
A little bit longer, and a little bit more
A little bit longer, a little bit longer
A little bit longer, a little bit more
A little bit longer

[Chorus]
And I wonder how I'll sleep at night
With a cavity right by my side
Nothing left to hold but pride of mine

[Outro]
Is it laced within my DNA
To be braced in endless January?
Have I become the cavity I feared?
Ask me in twenty years

[Verse 1]
Hollow one
With inverted tongue
From whence does fulfillment come?
When I expel
From this mortal shell
Will I die for living numb?

[Chorus]
Am I vital
If my heart is idle?
Am I doomed?
Am I vital
If my heart is idle?
Am I doomed?

[Verse 2]
If I feel you
But nobody else
They're someone I don't see
Yet you say nothing
Of the stoic suffering
That stirs lukewarm in me
But if lovelessness
Is godlessness
Will you cast me to the wayside?
'Cause I feel the peeling
Of half-painted cеilings
Reveal the covеring of a blank sky

[Chorus]
Am I vital
If my heart is idle?
Am I doomed?
Cradle me
So I can see
If I'm doomed
Am I vital
If my heart is idle?
Am I doomed?
Cradle me
So I can see
If I'm doomed

[Bridge]
If I'm doomed
Yeah

[Outro]
Am I vital
If my heart's idle?
Am I doomed?
Am I vital
If my heart's idle?
Am I doomed?
Am I vital
If my heart's idle?
Am I doomed?

[Verse 1]
You remain in motion
Bottom of the ocean
Not yet sick of sycophants
Tellin' you their true lies
Like, "No moon is higher,"
Hollow as a hallway
Your fist fits right through me
If I split my body into two men
Would you then love me better?
Octopus myself so you weather this

[Pre-Chorus]
Sea, Polly
Sea, Polly
See, see me
Ooo
Ooo
Ooo

[Chorus]
You love dancin' with me
Or you just love dancin'
Polly, Polly, Polly

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna live here
Sometimes don't wanna live at all
I want to be cotton candy
In the mouth of many a lover
Saccharine and slick technicolor
I'll dissolve
I know that won't solve this
Evolve into rain and spit
You make me go unstitched

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooo
Ooo
Ooo

[Chorus]
Are you dancin' with me?
Or just merely dancin'?
Polly, Polly, Polly

[Verse 3]
One, two, three, four, five, six
Am I just your Friday dick?
Cornucopia of just-in-cases
You'll never have to chase this

[Outro]
Woah, Polly, oh, Polly
Obviously you don't think much of me
Polly, yeah, oh, Polly
Oh, Polly, yeah, Polly, yeah, Polly, yeah, Polly, yeah
Polly, yeah, Polly, yeah, Polly, yeah, Polly, ooo

[Intro: Virgil Abloh]
I've been on this focus in terms of my art and creativity
Of getting adults to behave like children again
That they go back into this sense of wonderment
They start to stop using their mind
And they start using their imagination

[Verse: Lupe Fiasco]
V for vector, f for foul
If you rearrange foul what they give you?
Yeah, wow
Wish I could give you that now
All on the side of your soul in the signature hand style
Virgil forever, we visit the man child
Yeah, a tailor sits down to make his own suit from the tie to his boots
The thread is breath and fabric is the youth
Make his own ties they only made us a noose
On black, yeah
The cuff is all of us and the buttons are the truth
Even his caps are the facts
My nigga, can you believe that?
And these gloves were designed to make salutes
Warzone cologne these times and make us troops, won't they?
To keep the uniform gotta keep the uniform on
And mechanically hands take separate seams and make them family pants as baggy as can
Look at us, even majesty fans
They used to put us down as fast as gravity can but
When you eat soul food in the tux I mean what the fuck?
Blazer fits so right that it feel like it's trust
Mirror looking back at you like it got a crush
Put the rose in the hole and adjust
Kiss the city on the hand, make it blush
Several go put the runway where is rough
Invisible colorway they see the beauty up in us, huh?
You weren't sewing sleeves, you were sowing seeds
And if you know of trees
Seeds must go below to grow
How you gonna leave?

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah
Virg' 

[?], hometown hero
Life was like a movie could have got an oscar for the b-roll
Snuck inside the game like a chopper in a picot
Then pulled a debo now they got you shopping for the cheat code got 'em all locked in at the peak hole
Trying to get a peep of what's next for the—
For the people

[Intro]
Turn my mic up

[Verse 1]
Is it insane, my life's in your loves hands?
Is it insane, you got a hold on me?
When you're near, all of me trembles
Slightest touch and I'm no good
When you walk out of my door, I want you more

[Verse 2]
Is it insane?
I was the one who called them fools
For being blinded by love
Now it's me
Who can't break free

[Bridge]
Even though you're with her
I still feel you in me
And I know when you kiss her
You're wishing that it was me

[Outro]
Bae-bae-bae, bae, bae, baby
Bae-bae-bae, wee, ee-ee
Baby
Hey, hey, ee, ee-ee, ee, ee
Ee-ee, ee, ee
Ee-ee, ee, ee
Ee-ee, ee, ee-ee, ee, ee

[Verse 1: Thundercat]
If I could fly, I'd stay in the sky
And never come down for no one or nothing
My wings would be huge, I'd take off to space
To play in the stars, even though they're far
Nothing would stop me, I could see for miles
To endless planets, distant galaxies
No stress, no strife, just peace of mind
No pain, no fear, everything's so clear
Space waves (Space waves)
Solar flares (Solar flares)
Everything's gonna be alright, alright, alright, alright
Everything's gonna be

[Verse 2: Genevieve Artadi]
I could just fade out into silence
Let worlds go by and sleep through thе whole thing
I could burn bright, explode into light
And watch worlds go by, I miss thе green one
Understanding why

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Yeah
Brtt

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
If I'm real (Real), niggas know what I'm on (Yeah)
Take the cards I was dealt (Dealt), quick to take the bitch home
My heart never felt (Felt) heartbreak, thank God (Yeah)
I never left home without my rod (Brrt)
Shots out, push and ride (Ride), push around my niggas (Yeah)
I'm in the west coast, four hunnid million (Slatt)
I need pills, I need pills for the dealer
He knew how we remixed and he tried to kill us

[Verse 2: Lancey Foux]
...
4, 5 go 

[?]
I was just sipping on muddy
My cup going bloody, im not in the mood
Niggas be sayin' my name online got quiеt when i walk in the room
...

[Verse 1]
I've got so much to say
And yet nothing comes close
To the way we communicate
When we don't say a word
I hear you clearly without sounds
Oh, I don't need these ears when you're around

[Verse 2]
Communicate like trees
Way down under the ground
Where we've got so much going on
Like a whole other hidden universe
And I don't think that I wanna leave just yet
Can I just stay here, stay here
Here in our underworld?

[Chorus]
Here in our undеrworld
Here in our underworld
Hеre in our underworld

[Verse 2]
Make me happy
Make me sweat
Here's my body, and it's dripping wet
And I want you to show me the way back
Oh, I want you to give me what I lack

[Verse 4]
Make me laugh and then
Pull at my heartstrings
Till I cry like a baby on a full-moon night
Tonight I don't wanna be anything
But a girl in a cute dress, a cute mess

[Chorus]
Here in our underworld
Here in our underworld
Here in our underworld
Here in our underworld

[Spoken Intro]
It's been a while
I know I shouldn't've kept you waiting
But I'm here now

I know it's been a while, but I'm glad you came

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Friday
I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
I just want you to make me move

And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
No rules
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
Blowing up to the ceiling, we burning bright when we cut the light
'Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof

Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Yeah, yeah, Eazy

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or a little bar
It’s really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are, need you
I've always wanted what was off limits
Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this is all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we can tell that there are changes coming
See, I can tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go (Go)
Like Penelope in Blow
Well aware that stealing you is a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah

[Bridge: G-Eazy]
But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you

I'mma make your troubles mine (Yeah)
Carry all this extra weight, you gotta let it go
I'm your bittersweet escape (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay by my side, lost in my eyes, deep in the night
Sing a lu-lu-lullaby-by
We'll go for a ride, maybe I might hold you too tight
Sing a lu-lu-lullaby-by

[Chorus]
Got twenty-one grams in my pocket
Got twenty-one grams and I love it
Got a body in the boot of my beat-up coupe, and it's alright
Got twenty-one grams in my pocket
Got twenty-one grams and I love it
Got a body in the boot of my beat-up coupe, and it's alright

[Verse 2]
"Rest In Pеace" is mourningly all you left me with
Thе scent of perfume mixed with bleach (Yeah)
Light a match and burn the scene, all you left me with
Is petrol on my skinny jeans (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay by my side, lost in my eyes, deep in the night
Sing a lu-lu-lullaby-by
We'll go for a ride, maybe I might hold you too tight
Sing a lu-lu-lullaby-by

(Mmm, mmm)
Thought it was safer when I stood in the shade
(Mmm, mmm)
Okay, well, here goes nothing
Might be the start of something
I’m steady, pickin' up the pace
Nothin' to lose, but I got the whole world to gain
(Mmm, mmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the part where the bridge burns
This is the part where we turn and never look back
This is the point of no return, no return

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, here we are just running for our lives
We know that we ain’t sleeping tonight
You know you'll find us undеr the lights
Eh, eh, eh, еh, eh, eh
Oh, baby, here we are just running for our lives
We know that we ain't sleeping tonight
You know you'll find us under the lights
Under the lights

[Verse 2]
We're renegades into stage and we won't take a bow
(Mmm, mmm)
Flooding the gates, what they say
And we're drowning it out
(Mmm, mmm)
You're slowly runnin’ out of breath
My heart is racin’ out my chest
Steady, pickin' up the pace
Look me in the eyes, tell me, who’s gonna stop us now?
(Mmm, mmm)

This is the part where the bridge burns
This is the part where we turn and never look back

You know you'll find us under the lights

We know that we ain't sleeping tonight
You know you’ll find us under the lights
Under the lights

Take a chance, don't be afraid to risk it all
Hold my hand, we'll let ‘em know where we belong

Here we are just running for our lives
We know that we ain't sleeping tonight

You know you'll find us under the lights
Under the lights
Lyrics from Snippets

(Hitmaka!)

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
It’s a BIG NIGHTS What the Fuck Are You Talking About
The BIG NIGHTS…

[Verse 1]
Notice me, take my hand
Why are we strangers when our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

[Chorus]
Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby

[Verse 2]
I make believe that you are here
It's the only way I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby

[Bridge]
I may have made it rain
Please, forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry
And this song's my sorry

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
And this song's my sorry
And this song's my sorry

[Verse 1]
When I open my eyes in the morning
And it’s just getting dark where you are
Now there’s more than just space in between us
Darlin', how did we get so far?
Then you'd say, "Do you still wanna do this?"
Is it magic or is it too hard?
Love you too much to say what the truth is
So, I say yes when I should say no

[Pre-Chorus]
As much as this hurts
I'm making it worse
No, you don't decide to wait for me
Don't want you to leave
That's selfish of me
I want you to find somebody who

[Chorus]
Can love you better
Can love you better
It's true, go on and get her
She'll love you bettеr
And I know we said forever, wе said forever, but ooh
If you just let her, she'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me
She'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me

[Verse 2]
When I land and I'm back up in your arms
Can't imagine how I'd live without you
When we kiss how I live for the good times
I forget what the fight was about

[Pre-Chorus]
As much as this hurts
I'm making it worse
No, you don't decide to wait for me
Don't want you to leave
That's selfish of me
I want you to find somebody who

[Chorus]
Can love you better
Can love you better
It's true, go on and get her
She'll love you better
And I know we said forever, we said forever, but ooh
If you just let her, she'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me
She'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me

[Bridge]
And I know you keep sayin' I'm the one
Sayin' I'm the one
I don't think that this is really what you want
What you really want
Somebody who
Can love you better
Can love you better
It's true, we said forever, we said forever, ooh

[Chorus]
Can love you better
Can love you better
It's true, go on and get her
She'll love you better
And I know we said forever, we said forever, but ooh
If you just let her, she'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me
She'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me
She'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me
She'll love you better than me
Me, me, me, me

[Verse 1]
You're the saint to my sin
All my lies are wearin' thin
Let me go, don't let me in
Love me up, I come undone
See the darkness I've become
Holding me close, and not enough

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't breathe, let me be
What I need is to be free

[Chorus]
I wanna light a fire
I know how to chase what I desire
I wanna scream a little higher
'Til I overflow, oh, oh
'Til I overflow, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Now my words cause you pain
An even game of give and take
Go ahead, save yourself from the shame
My biggest fear is here to stay
My regret is what remains
Losing you was my mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't breathe, let me be
What I need is to be free

[Chorus]
I wanna light a fire
I know how to chase what I desire
I wanna scream a little higher
'Til I overflow, oh, oh
'Til I overflow, oh, oh

[Bridge]
We drift apart like lovers do
And now I'm drownin' without you
(Never wanna see, never wanna see
Never wanna see, never wanna)
We drift apart like lovers do
And now I'm drownin' without you
(Never wanna see, never wanna see
Never wanna see, never wanna)

[Chorus]
I wanna light a fire
I know how to chase what I desire
I wanna scream a little higher
'Til I overflow, oh, oh
'Til I overflow, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I can't believe what I just said
This is so not like me, playing the words up in my head
And there's no denying
I had a heart and you stole it
So I called you up tonight, and said, "Do whatever you like"
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I want what I want when I want it
Come and do me right until the morning
You taste like danger to me (You taste like danger to me)
Baby, you're forbidden and delicious
And you got my heartbeat beating triplets
I'm ready for anything

[Chorus]
You're my twisted paradise, take me to thе dark tonight
Life is so mundane herе without ya, without ya
You're my twisted paradise, pride's gonna be my sacrifice
Let me wrap my body around ya, around ya
It's not like me at all to close my eyes and freefall
Take me to the dark tonight, you're my twisted paradise-ise

[Verse 2]
I wanna sink in you like quicksand, you're the air I'm breathing
Lose every layer in your hands, words can be deceiving
Why's it feel so good to be bad?
So I'll call you up tonight, and I'll do whatever you like, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I want what I want when I want it
Come and do me right until the morning
I'm ready for anything

[Chorus]
You're my twisted paradise, take me to the dark tonight
Life is so mundane here without ya, without ya
You're my twisted paradise, pride's gonna be my sacrifice
Let me wrap my body around ya, around ya
It's not like me at all to close my eyes and freefall
Take me to the dark tonight, you're my twisted paradise-ise

[Bridge]
Take me to the dark tonight, you're my twisted paradise
I can't believe what I just said (Take me to the dark tonight)
Replaying words up in my head (You're my twisted paradise)
(Ow!)

[Chorus]
You're my twisted paradise, take me to the dark tonight
Life is so mundane here without ya, without ya
You're my twisted paradise, pride's gonna be my sacrifice
Let me wrap my body around ya, around ya
It's not like me at all to close my eyes and freefall
Take me to the dark tonight, you're my twisted paradise-ise

[Verse 1]
I know it's late
But I was wondering if you'd like to have a chat
Shouldn't have asked 'cause you know where I live at
And you call yourself grown
But you still won't pick up the phone
But they phone me
And I'll figure out that you still can't make your way
Out of the ride that you hated yesterday
I know that you're tired but you don't say
How you're feeling alright

[Chorus]
But you got time, it's fine
But next time I hope someone warns you of danger
'Cause how could you even guess you were in danger?
Maybe it's 'causе you're trying to find
The next stop out of town
So you'll stay out of dangеr
But who's to blame who you still claim that you're in danger?

[Verse 2]
I know it's late
But I was wondering if you'd try me on a date
And I know that no one's talked to you this way
And you're taking that everyday that it might come
But if you had a choice to leave then-
I know it's hard
To allow someone's entry to your opened door
To get to know the boy you don't know anymore
But I know that you're tired so you don't say
How you're feeling alright

[Chorus]
But you got time, it's fine
But next time I hope
Someone warns you of danger
'Cause how could you even guess
You were in danger?
Maybe it's 'cause you're trying to find
The next stop out of town
So you'll stay out of danger
But who's to blame when you still claim that you're in danger?

[Refrain]
But you got time, it's fine
'Cause you're out of danger
(When I am here in your arms)
Danger (Ah ah ah)
Maybe it's 'cause you're trying to find
The next stop out of town
So you'll stay out of danger (Danger oh oh oh)
Stay out of danger

Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Love no thot, uh, love no thot
I'ma fuck her and her friend in my Gucci socks
I'm just doing me, and I do this a lot
And I think I'ma keep that way till the day I drop (The day I drop) uh
Love no thot, oh-uh, love no thot (Love no thot)
I can't trust them never since that lil' bitch let me down
Now I can't change, wish I was this way right from the start
That bitch to blame for the reason why I do you wrong

[Verse 1]
Got a different hoe every weekend
If you knew you'd be tweaking
You so head over the heels, I just can't picture you leavin'
You said "I'll come when its late, I'm never coming today"
You say you feel likе a hoe
You say that I always play
You want my pays workin' out
I see you workin' it out
I know you know something's up
But I see you're in dеnial and I just can't see it workin' out
But I ain't gon' tell you that now, tell you that-
Bitch I'm on savage mode

[Verse 2]
Money longer, better hoes
I'm with the freak bitches I knock them down like dominos

[Chorus]
Love no thot, uh, love no thot
I'ma fuck her and her friend in my Gucci socks
I'm just doing me, and I do this a lot
And I think I'ma keep that way till the day I drop (The day I drop) uh
Love no thot, oh-uh, love no thot (Love no thot)
I can't trust them never since that lil' bitch let me down
Now I can't change, wish I was this way right from the start
That bitch to blame for the reason why I do you wrong
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
When it all falls right down
You're who I’m calling
I said "I ain't need you", but I need you tonight
When it all falls right down
You're who I’m calling
I said "I ain't need you", but I need you tonight

[Verse 1]
It's been so long since I...

And I
We''ll work it out
...
... thinkin about the shit that I do (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I got nothing left to say
And you got nothing left to play
You got nothing left to place
Sick and tired of your games
Don't believe in what you say

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it written in your eyes?
You can try, you can try
But you can't disguise
And I don't need it anymore

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
I don't need it anymore

[Verse 2]
You keep your cards to your chest
You got lies in your bed, you got lies in your bed
You been sleeping on the truth
Never tell it, do you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it written in your eyes?
You can try, you can try
But you can't disguise
And I don't need it anymore

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
I don't need it anymore

[Bridge]
Why you have to be so cruel?
Why don't you just play it straight?
Tryna play me for a fool
Why you gotta play that way?
Why you havе to be so cruel?
Why don't you just play it straight?
Tryna play me for a fool
Why you gotta play that way?

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta bе cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
I don't need it anymore
Oh-woah-woah-ooh

Why you gotta play that way?
Oh-woah-woah-ooh
I don't know, I don't know
Why you gotta be cryptic
Why you gotta be cryptic
I don't need it anymore
Lay on me
It seems like it's the only time you break the space
But to me
You seem very shy, like you enjoy your peace
Somehow I'd like to try
If you're making me to sigh
If not, I'm satisfied (Oh oh oh)
But I don't really know how to act when
You wait for me to give a reaction
I'll ask you twice
I'll ask you why
'Fore you say the same thing
Line this time
Maybe it's cause the moment's gone
I wonder if it's me that's wrong
All night long
It keeps me up 'til dawn
You wonder why because
Maybe now you'll see
The pain you givе to me (Ooo)
Oh, the pain that you give to mе

[Verse 1]
Notice me, take my hand
Why are we strangers when our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

[Chorus]
Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby

[Verse 2]
I make believe that you are here
It's the only way I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby

[Bridge]
I may have made it rain
Please, forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry
And this song's my sorry

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
(Ooh) I guess I need you, baby
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
And this song's my sorry
And this song's my sorry

[Verse 1]
Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Verse 2]
Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
Thеre's a spark in-between us
When wе're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I'm asking you tonight

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Spoken Interlude]
If I said I want your body, would you hold it against me?

[Bridge]
Give me something good
Don't wanna wait, I want it now
Drop it, like a hood
And show me how you work it out
Alright

[Breakdown]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Spoken Intro]
It's been a while
I know I shouldn't've kept you waiting
But I'm here now

[Verse 1]
I know it's been a while, but I'm glad you came
And I've been thinking 'bout how you say my name
You got my body spinning, like a hurricane
And it feels like you got me going insane
And I can't get enough
So, let me get it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up
That's what I'm saying

[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to gеt you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Lеt me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot

[Interlude]
So, are you warming up yet?

[Verse 2]
You got me hypnotized
I never felt this way
You got my heart beating like an 808
Can you rise to the occasion?
I'm patiently waiting, 'cause it's getting late
And I can't get enough, so let me get it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up
That's what I'm saying

[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot

[Spoken Interlude]
I like this part, oh
It feels kinda good
Yeah

[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot

[Verse 1]
It seems a little funny how you always find me there
It's almost as if I've been trying to start a whole affair
But you see my problem is I want it all for show
So I thought maybe next time, show up at your door
I waste no time in my mind
When I can find (?)
You'll look your best in white on a wedding night
You don't know it yet but you'll know soon, I'll bet
No, I don't know who you are but I'll follow you if I can
I don't know your name, but I hope you feel the same

[Outro]
Know the difference
You will never ever know the difference
If it was your girlfriend who was missing
I know I can never give it away
Know the differencе
You will never evеr know the difference
If it was your girlfriend who was missing
I know I can never give it away
(Know the difference
You will never ever know the difference
If it was your girlfriend who was missing
I know I can never give it away)

[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight, seven)
(Six) Commencing (Five) countdown, engines on
(Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planеt Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past onе hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you-

[Chorus]
-Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
See this in 3D
'Fore life start for me
'Fore life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me
Eighty degrees
Warmin' up for me
Finally free
I did know, Indeed
And I run out, to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey I won't sh - ow
I can float on the water
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave
Like we ain't had all the hood rats in Mud Rats
Like you ain't had 'em at good stats and all that
Nobody gon' ruin me
I just called my wife up, let's get Hoover free
I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my mama crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that's how a soldier feels
All that killin' over, that's just overkill
Yeezy back in the Chi', this that Oprah feel

[Chorus: Kanye West]
See this in 3D
'Fore life start for me
'Fore life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me
Eighty degrees
Warmin' up for me
Finally free
I did know, Indeed
And I run out, to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey I won't sh - ow
I can float on the water
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Yeah
Walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry niggas from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior came with sheepskin
Still remember when I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
She just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah

[Chorus: Kanye West & KayCyy]
See this in 3D
'Fore life start for me
'Fore life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me
Eighty degrees
Warmin' up for me
Finally free
I did know, Indeed
And I run out, to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey I won't sh - ow
I can float on the water
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down, (Oh)
I know you won't (I know you won't)

[Outro: KayCyy]
I know you won't (I know you won't)

*mumbling*
Lyrics from Snippet

Fuck intuition
I might be superstitious (Woah)
I'm willing to jinx it (Woah)
'Cause you do me different
Fuck intuition

Maybe we were chained together in another life

I get lost in your touch
I know this isn't love
But I can't get enough
Finger's crossed
I get lost...

[Verse 1: Foxy Brown]
Trackmasters, Commisioner
You say you keep me laced in everything, baguettes his and her
Matchin' E-class, twin chincilla furs
Everything was real 'til he slipped and swerved
Swore the love was real then he bounced with hers
Kept me off speed, blessed me backwards, made my heart bleed
Killed me softly; he don't know how much it cost me
If the love is all we need, real queens will survive
Now peep the remix with Fox and J. Blige
Comе on

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I've got to let you know
That this is the only way (lеt 'em know)
Troubles far and near, but have no fear
'Cause love is always on the way
Oh, love

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete (So complete, love)
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
If you don't know, then I'm telling you
It works with everything you do
Problems every day, but we'll find a way
'Cause love is going to save the day (Come on)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete
(To make every little thing complete)
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete
(Love is all, love is all, all we need)
Love is all we need (All we need)
To make every little thing complete
(Love is all we need)

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Do you know what we really need?
Do you know that love is going to set us free? (Set us free)
Yeah, just you and me
Do you think we can live this way?
'Cause I know that love is going to save the day (Save the day)
In every way

[Verse 4: Nature]
While 'em savage cats locked up
Beef with us a lot, who keep it hot
Spending cash meet chicks in secret spots
Peep the plot, cuz some will get rich some will change
Learning comes with the game
Being nature as in sun and rain
Numb in your brain, anesthesia style
Reefer clouds dictate my moves
Take aim before I squeeze around
Catch me flossin' on the remix now
Still ain't learn in 97 it's the firm that's how we get down

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete (Every little thing complete)
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete
(It's gonna make, gonna make everything complete)

[Bridge 2: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need to make things better
(Love is all we need, love is all we need)
It's the only way to live together
(It's the only way we can live)
Love is all we need to make things better
(Love is all we need to make everything complete)
It's the only way to live together
(It's the only way, the only way to live together)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete (Make everything complete)
Love is all we need (All we need is love)
To make every little thing complete
Love is all we need
Whoa, love is all we need
Cause everybody needs love

Love is all we need
To make everything complete
If we try to live together and be happy
You and me are one and we've only just begun
So let's make a new beginning have some fun

1-Love is all we need, to make everything complete
All we need is L-O-V-E, love is all we need
Cause to love you would mean everything
Everybody needs love

Dealing with tough times seems to always blow my mind
But I know where my heart is so I am fine, I'm fine
If we remain friends it would never ever end
On this love I give to you, you can depend
(repeat 1)

Love is all we need to make every little thing complete
Yeah, yeah, oh if you would trust in me
I would let you know that I love you, that I love you
Oh, Lord, don't ever leave me...
Love is all we need, yeah, yeah, yeah
Love is all we need to make everything complete
I want to be happy yeah, want to be happy

Love is all we need, and I know that it can be done
If we can love, if we can love, everybody needs love

[Nas]
Mary!
I, man, am Regal, a German am I
Never odd or even
If I had a Hi-Fi
Madam, I'm Adam
Too hot to hoot
No lemons no melon
Too bad I hid a boot
Lisa Bonet ate no basil
Warsaw was raw
Was it a car or a cat I saw?

Rise to vote, sir
Do geese see God?
Do nine men Interpret? "Nine men," I nod
Rats live on no evil star
Won’t lovers revolt now?
Race fast safe car
Pa's a sap
Ma is as selfless as I am
May a moody baby doom a yam?

[Harmonica Solo]

Ah Satan sees Natasha
No devil lived on
Lonely Tylenol
Not a banana baton
No X in Nixon
O stone, be not so
O Geronimo, no minor ego
"Naomi" I moan
A Toyota's a Toyota
A dog, a panic, in a pagoda

Oh no, Don Ho
Nurse, I spy gypsies, run!
Senile felines
Now I see bees, I won
UFO tofu
We panic in a pew
Oozy rat in a sanitary zoo
God! a red nugget, a fat egg under a dog
Go hang a salami, I’m a lasagna hog
Feeling too much thoughts rush through
People will judge my every move
As my blood rushes through me
A beautiful mind...

[Verse 1]
I hear your voice and it's all around me
I can't contain all the ways you make me feel
Love when you call my name
Even if I go for miles and hours
There's only one thing that I need, only one word you say
Love when you call my name

[Chorus]
And we, there's no more to give
And we, shown how God is good
Love when you call my name
So good (So good)
Love when you call my name
Love my name

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want you to know that I know this is so real
It's so unbelievable it's almost unfair, it's so good
Love when you call my name

[Chorus]
And we, there's no morе to give
And we, shown how God is good
Love whеn you call my name
Love when you call my name
Love when you call my name

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
The devil's always preying on the weaker souls
All that we can know, it was all good just a week ago
Prada carry-ons, off to Mikonos
Celebrating life on white sands, but only we can toast
Still got it cheaper though, scales like a Libra, yo
Playing on these keys like Alicia, that's her secret though
Only on the need to know, nah, you don't need to know
Had to tell the truth on this beat like Beanie Sigel though, Push

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
My God is plentiful
He surrounds me every day
I'm like a miracle
Feel the water beneath mе
I used to live hidden in a disguisе
Faith is the King that has opened my eyes
My God is plentiful
All my love, oh, thee I pray
Found me in Eden
Sculpted me from golden clay
Wrapped in my mother's arms
Safe in her holy embrace
Destiny is grounded in the Divine
I'll not depart, you'll forever be mine
My God is plentiful
Down my life for thee I lay

[Verse 1: Lucky Daye]
Look me in my eye, know you know the vibe
In you I confide, something I can't hide
Tell me what it's worth, I put in the work
You know I'm the one that you prefer
But you hit a nerve

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Yeah
Look me in my face (Yeah)
Tell me what's the case (Yeah)
It's all in my head (Yeah)
Everything you say (Yeah)
Are you good now?
Are you staying 'round?
I just wanna know what that's about

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Is it too much to need someone to come for me?
Just need someone to run to me
I need someone to come for mе
And that'll be enough for me

[Post-Chorus: Khalid, Alicia Keys, & Both]
Why you bring mе up (Why?)
Just to bring me down? (Yeah)
Yeah, you bring me up (Yeah)
Just to bring me down (Yeah)
Why you bring me up
Just to bring me down?
Yeah, you bring me up
Just to bring me down

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
Loving you out loud
There will be no doubt
Gotta love me loud
Let it drive you wild (Please tell me)
It's the pretty brown, brown
Make me feel a way
Make me proud, proud
Every word you say to me
In the end I gotta say a prayer for ya
After all you know that I'll be there for ya
I wish I could show you how I care for ya, for ya

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Is it too much to need someone to come for me?
Just need someone to run to me
I need someone to come for me
And that'll be enough for me

[Post-Chorus: Khalid, Alicia Keys, & Both]
Why you bring me up (Why?)
Just to bring me down? (Yeah)
Yeah, you bring me up (Yeah)
Just to bring me down (Yeah)
Why you bring me up
Just to bring me down?
Yeah, you bring me up
Just to bring me down

Why do you bring me up (Why d'you bring me)
To bring me down? (Yeah)
Why do you bring me up (Bring me up, bring me up)
To bring me down? (Bring me down, bring me up)
Why do you bring me up (Bring me down, bring me up)
To bring me down? (Bring me down)
Tell me why
(Why, tell me why, oh, tell me why, please oh, why, why why why, why, why, why, why)
Tell me why
(Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why, tell me why tell me why, tell me why, ooo)
Tell me why
(Ooo, why, why why, why, tell me why, tell me why, why don't you just)
Tell me why
(Ooo, tell me why, oh yeah, tell me why)

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm doing good
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes we give up the fight
Sometimes we can't see the light bright
You know how lovers flow
You know how lovers grow
Sometimes we gotta explore
Come on, baby, you know how love goes

[Chorus]
And if the drought hits tonight
Do not fear because you and I
We are like water, like water
Made to survive
And if the drought hits tonight
Do not fear because you and I
We're part of each other, like water
You're giving me life

[Verse 2]
You know I got you, babe
Even on cloudy days
Into the rain I might cry
Still, you're the love of my life, babe
I'll take you anywhere
Just say, I'll take you there
Out to the moon and the sea
Babe, I'm your galaxy, come to me

[Chorus]
And if the drought hits tonight
Do not fear because you and I
We are like water, like water
Made to survive
And if the drought hits tonight
Do not fear because you and I
We're part of each other, like water
You're giving me life

We're part of each other, like water
Made to survive
And if the drought hits tonight
Do not fear because you and I
We're part of each other, like water
You're giving me life

[Verse 1]
Take off your coat, take off your clichés
Show off a side that no one sees
You got the whole world right here in your pocket
Chasing those stardust melodies

[Chorus]
So if you wanna live on
You gotta put on your finest
If you wanna sing your song
You gotta put the time into timeless
If you wanna take it all
Let the chandeliers fall (Fall)
While you're standing tall like the Taj Mahal
Be unforgettable
Like Nat King Cole
Like Nat King Cole

[Verse 2]
There are no endings, there are no yestеrdays
When you hit a chord that everyonе hears
Emeralds and rubies, black and white movies
They never truly fade away
'Cause greatness never disappears

[Chorus]
So if you wanna live on
You gotta put on your finest
If you wanna sing your song
You gotta put the time into timeless
If you wanna take it all
Let the chandeliers fall (Fall)
While we standing tall like the Taj Mahal

[Outro]
Show off, show off
Show off, show off

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
So unforgettable
More than incredible
More than a metaphor, more than you're ready for
More intellectual
More than electrical, glowing like Eddison
I'm more than ahead of 'em
I'm over the head of them, more than a spectacle
I could do more than a weapon could
'Cause I'm loaded but deadly (EarDrummers)
I'm undeniable
I'm unbelievable
I'm undefeatable, I'm pretty powеrful
I'm so high, I'm unreachable
I'm not impeachablе, I promise
They'll never forget me like Obama
They'll never forget me like Alzheimer's
In memory lane, they all drivers
And Lil Wayne an all timer
And I'd rather you forget me than remember me wrong
Who is Nat King Cole? Call me Nat King Kong (Hrrr)

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Take off your coat, take off your cliché
Show off a side that no one sees
You got the whole world right here in your pocket
Chasing those stardust melodies

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
So if you wanna leave alone
You gotta put on your finest
If you wanna sing your song
You gotta put the time into timeless
If you wanna take it all, let the chandeliers fall (Fall)
While you standing tall like the Taj Mahal
Be unforgettable
Like Nat King Cole
Like Nat King Cole

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
There are no endings, there are no yesterdays
When you hit a chord that everyone hears
Emeralds and rubies, black and white movies
They never truly fade away
'Cause greatness never disappears

So if you wanna leave alone
You gotta put on your finest
If you wanna sing your song
You gotta put the time into timeless
If you wanna take it all, let the chandeliers fall (Fall)

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Somebody never told me there's a last time for everything
Even a landslide is an opening
Turning metal into gold, silver lining
Somebody never told me

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Paper flowers don't die
But neither do they live, like you and I
Lightning never striking twice is a lie
Like good things coming when you wait
To tell the truth, I gotta say
I don't believe in yesterday
I don't wanna live forever, anyway
For a momеnt that was never herе to stay
Forget about tomorrow
For just today

[Verse 2: Brandi Carlile]
Somebody never told me there's a first time for everything
It's a free fall, discovery
On the day you get that call and the waiting is over
It all changes in the blink of an eye

[Chorus: Both, Alicia Keys, Brandi Carlile]
Paper flowers don't die
But neither do they live, like you and I
Lightning never striking twice is a lie
Like good things coming when you wait
To tell the truth, I gotta say
I don't believe in yesterday
I don't wanna live forever, anyway
For a moment that was never here to stay
Forget about tomorrow (Forget about tomorrow)
Just for today
Forget about tomorrow
Just for today (Just for today)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Just for today

[Verse 1]
My heart is heavy like a stone
Hot as Hell up in the cold
Loneliness is sleeping in my room
Love is empty on the plate
Nothing left to give or take
Waiting for the dawn to break in two

[Pre-Chorus]
But the sun don't dry
Nothing
And the waterfalls
Keep coming
And tears keep breaking through

[Chorus]
At least we'll try (Try)
Try to make it
When you're living right, but it's going wrong
We try (Try)
Try to make it
When you feel like you're living on Dead End Road
We still try
Try, try, try

[Verse 2]
If I should die before I wake
Would tears wash away mistakes?
My troubles should be madе to fade to nothing
'Cause I don't want to be thе one
To turn the lights off on love
I just wanna be above something

[Pre-Chorus]
But the sun don't dry
Nothing
And the waterfalls
Keep coming
And tears keep breaking through

[Chorus]
But at least we'll try (Try)
Try to make it
When you're living right, but it's going wrong
We'll try (Try), yeah
Try to make it
When you feel like you're living on Dead End Road
We still try
Try, try, try

[Outro]
If we just try
If we just try
Something, yeah
At least we'll love
At least we'll love
Something
When you feel like you're living on Dead End Road
You gotta try, baby
Try, try (Try, baby)
Try, try, try, try, try, try

[Verse 1]
I hear your voice and it's all around me
I can't contain all the ways you make me feel
Love when you call my name

[Verse 1]
I, I've been walking in the snow
Looking for myself in the cold
You, you've been afraid of the night
Looking for the money on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
Sun always brings the light
Time always brings a change
We planted seeds inside
Now we're dancing in the rain

[Chorus]
Growing up slowly over the hills
Winter is over, here come the daffoldils

[Verse 2]
I feel like I can finally let it be
Let my intentions go, let them call me
And if you, you see the clouds on your brain
Just hold me close and know better days are ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
Sun always brings the light
Time always brings a change
We planted seeds inside
Now we're dancing in the rain

[Chorus]
Growing up slowly over the hills
Winter is over, here come the daffoldils

[Post-Chorus]
-Ils
Here come the daffoldils
Ah, la, la, la

[Outro]
It's over
Winter is over

[Verse 1]
Old memories, they don't go away
They show up before you leave
And disappear when you wish they'd stay
No heart is immune, no secret is kept
Yeah, they only get stronger with age
Old memories, they don't go away

[Verse 2]
Old love songs, they don't ever end
Just when you think that you've moved on
They remind you, you ain't over it
Sneak in the dark, creep in your bed
Playing over the loss in your head
Old love songs, thеy don't ever end

[Chorus]
It's a problеm I'm telling ya
Makes you temperamental
It takes all of the best of ya
You ain't gon' never let go

[Verse 3]
Old photographs never fade away
They're just frozen there in time
Locked in pretty picture frames
Bridges we burn (Yeah), the once happiness (Yeah)
It's a black and white that you can't change
Old photographs never fade away

[Chorus]
It's a problem I'm telling ya
Makes you temperamental
It takes all of the best of ya
You ain't gone never let go

[Outro]
Look at me
Lost in yesterday
Thought that I was over you
But you haunt me in every way
My heart is with you (Yeah)
The secret is out (Yeah)
And it only gets stronger with age
Old memories of you and me
They don't go away

[Intro]
Ee, ee-ee, ee-ee, ee
Oh, ooh, ooh
Oh, old memories
They don't go away, no
They don't go

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Old memories, they don't go away
They show up before you leave
And disappear when you wish they'd stay
No heart is immune, no secret is kept
Yeah, they only get stronger with age
Old memories, they don't go away

[Verse 2]
Old love songs, they don't ever end
Just when you think that you've moved on
They remind you, you ain't over it
They sneak in thе dark, creep in your bed
Playing over the loss in your hеad
Old love songs, they don't ever end

[Chorus]
It's a problem, I'm telling you
Makes you temperamental
It takes all of the best of you
You ain't gon' never let go, oh

[Verse 3]
Old photographs, never fade away
They're just frozen there in time
Locked in pretty picture frames
The bridges we burn (Yeah, yeah), the once happiness (Yeah, yeah)
It's a black and white that you can't change
Old photographs never fade away

[Chorus]
It's a problem, I'm telling you (Telling you)
Makes you temperamental (Temperamental)

You ain't gon' never let go, oh, oh, ooh

[Outro]
Look at me (Look at me)

But you haunt me in every way
My heart is with you (Yeah, yeah), the secret is out (Yeah, yeah)
And it only gets stronger with age (Only gets stronger with age)
Old memories, of you and me
They don't go away
Woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah

[Verse 1]
My heart is heavy like a stone
Hot as hell up in the cold
Loneliness is sleeping in my room
Love is empty on the plate
Nothing left to give or take
Waiting for the dawn to break in two

[Pre-Chorus]
But the sun don't dry
Nothing
And the waterfalls
Keep coming
And tears keep breaking through

[Chorus]
At least we'll try (Try)
Try to make it
When you're living right, but it's going wrong
We try (Try)
Try to make it
When you feel like you're living on Dead End Road
We still try
Try, try, try

[Verse 2]
If I should die before I wake
Would tears wash away mistakes
My troubles should be made to fade to nothing
'Cause I don't want to be the one
To turn the lights off on love
I just wanna be above something

[Pre-Chorus]
But the sun don't dry
Nothing
And the waterfalls
Keep coming
Tears keep breaking through

[Chorus]
At least we'll try (Try)
Try to make it
When you're living right, but it's going wrong
We try (Try), yeah
Try to make it
When you feel like you're living on Dead End Road
We still try
Try, try, try
We still try

[Outro]
If we just try
If we just try
Something, yeah
At least we'll love
At least we'll love
Something
When you feel like you're living on Dead End Road
You gotta try, baby
Try, try (Try, baby)
Try, try, try, try
Try, oh, yeah, try (Try, baby)
Oh, yeah, try, try
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been walking, walking through the snow
Looking for myself in the cold
You've been walking through the night
Looking for the money on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
Sun always brings the light
Time always brings a change
We planted seeds inside
Now we're dancing in the rain

[Chorus]
Growing up slowly over the hills
Winter is over, here come the daffoldils

[Verse 2]
I feel like I can finally let it be
Let my intentions go, let them call me

[Pre-Chorus]
Sun always brings the light
Time always brings a change
We planted seeds inside
Now we're dancing in the rain

[Chorus]
Growing up slowly ovеr the hills
Winter is over, hеre come the daffoldils

[Outro]
Here they come
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Can you feel it?
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Can you see it?
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Here they come
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
After the winter
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Ih, ih
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Can you feel it?
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Here they come, here they come
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Okay, love me or hate me they cannot decide (yeah, choose your side)
Money comes in, go and spend with the guys (yeah, by my side)
It's a scene out of a movie, this shit is my life (phew phew phew phew, by my night)
Oh tell me tell me if you down to ride (down to ride)
Love me or hate me they cannot decide
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1]: The Kid LAROI
...down for real
Cause being young doing grown shit means sacrifices and focus
Fuck bitches, used to talk down
I can barely hear them talk now
Lost a lot in the process
Lot of times I had small doubts
More times I had foreign louds
Who the fuck is trying to take us down
Fuck, used to cash out busting
Now they looking as us now
Look at me now

All my days and nights so lonely
'Til you came into my life
You came and brought my life back to me
Cause I was dying deep inside
You brought the light
And my life was so dark
You took the fight
And you made it your own
I realy love you
No other love can measure up
To the love that you give to me
And with all this love comеs trust

You're so...

[Chorus:]
Beautiful
Now you’re nеar

[Verse 2:]
I opened up my arms to greet you
With unconditional love
Tender sweet is he that helps me
Leave my problems all behind

(Baby come to me)
Baby come to me. You know that I will set you free
(Promise it will be)
Promise it will be an expirience for you and me
(Something beautiful)
Let me take you to a place where there is understanding
Where love flows unselfishly and never ever demanding

Only one thing I really need

Don't need diamonds

[Intro]
Let no man put asunder
*chatter*

[Verse 1]
I'm surprised to see your suitcase at the door
(I'm surprised, I'm surprised)
Remember the good times, don't you want some more?
(Don't you want it?)
It's not a perfect love, but I'll defend it
(I'm surprised)
'Cause I believe that's what God intended now

[Chorus]
We got love too good to throw away
It's not over between you and me
It's not over, don't want to be free
What has been joined by God, by God
Let no man put asunder, no no
Can't throw it away
Can't throw it away

[Verse 2]
I can hear those words spoken as I stood
(As I stood)
Making bonds through love, if times are bad or good
(Don't you want it?)
I'm convinced that what is meant to be will be
(It will be)
Even the stars declare that you belong to me

[Chorus]
And we got love too good to throw away, oh oh, oh oh
It's not over between you and me

[Verse 1]
I believe we all have one true love
Somewhere in this world, I do
When it seemed all my dreams were falling through
That's when I found you
I believe for every heart that whispers in the dark
There's a ray of light somewhere shining through
It was sink or swim when the tide came in
I found myself when I found you

[Chorus]
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew
Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true
I found myself when I found you
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I believe (I believe) for every door (Every door)
That's closing
For every heartbreak there's hope for something new
From the ashes rise a glimpse of paradise
It still flickered in your eyes
I found myself when I found you

[Chorus]
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew
Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true
I found myself when I found you
Ooh, yeah

[Bridge]
How life unfolds, no one knows
I thought love was just a tingling of the skin
I felt so alone, all alone
More than you could ever know
You show deeper love, sweeter love, when I found you

[Chorus]
I found the closest thing to Heaven
I found the deepest love I knew
When I found you
I found the closest thing to heaven
Yes, in you, I found the deepest love I knew
Ooh-ooh, oh, I believe, yes, it's true
I found myself when I found you
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
There's a wild wind blowing down the corner of my street
Every night there, the headlights are glowing
There's a cold war coming on the radio, I heard
Baby, it's a violent world

[Chorus]
Love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear it coming, I can hear the siren sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

[Verse 2]
Time came a-creeping and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes on, time only can lead you on
Still it's such a beautiful night

[Chorus]
Love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear it coming like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

[Outro]
Gravity, release me and don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground

[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be far away

[Verse 3]
And here we are, as In olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us
Once more

[Verse 4]
Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highеst bough
And have yourself a merry littlе Christmas now
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Intro]
It's your child, it's your child
It's your child, it's your child
It's your child, it's your child
It's your child, it's your child
It's your child, it's your child
It's your child, it's your child

[Verse 1]
Today you had a visitor
Or should I say an old friend
But wait a minute
That's not where it ends, no
Is there something
That you wanna tell me
'Cause I'm believing what your friends say
About your hidden secrecies

[Pre-Chorus]
And girlfriend
And girlfriend
She wasn't disrespectful
In fact, she's a hundred percent sure
And how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours

[Chorus]
She said it's your child
And it really messed me up
(Really messed me up)
How could you deny
Your own flesh and blood
Gotta face reality
There can never be any more us
Won't deny it's hurting me
Yet so precious

[Verse 2]
She said she never wanted to hurt me
And could I understand, she's afraid and alone
She said a real woman wouldn't do this over the phone
And that you told her about me after the baby was born, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And girlfriend
And girlfriend
She wasn't disrespectful
In fact, she's a hundred percent sure
And how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours

[Chorus]
She said it's your child
And it really messed me up
(Really messed me up)
How could you deny
Your own flesh and blood
Gotta face reality
There can never be any more us
Won't deny it's hurting me
Yet so precious

[Verse 1 repeated]
Today you had a visitor
Or should I say an old friend
But wait a minute
That's not where it ends, no
Is there something
That you wanna tell me
'Cause I'm believing what your friends say
About your hidden secrecies

[Pre-Chorus]
And girlfriend
And girlfriend (In fact)
And girlfriend (And how can I argue with her)
And girlfriend
She wasn't disrespectful
In fact, she's a hundred percent sure
And how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours

[Chorus]
She said it's your child
And it really messed me up
How could you deny
Your own flesh and blood
Gotta face reality
(Gotta face it)
There can never be any more us
Won't deny it's hurting me
Yet so precious
She said it's your child
(It's your child)
And it really messed me up
(And it really messed me up)
How could you deny
Your own flesh and blood
(Your own flesh and blood)
Gotta face reality
There can never be any more us
Won't deny it's hurting me
Yet so precious

[Outro]
It's your child
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm
It's your child
One
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But, my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're undеr him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rulеs; I count 'em
I got new rules; I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules; I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn) No way
(Nowhere to turn) No
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But, my love (Love)
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself, I do, I do, I do
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules; I count 'em
I got new rules; I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules; I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I
(I got new, I got new, I...)
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin'
'Cause he's drunk and alone (Yeah, alone)
Two: Don't let him in
You have to kick him out again (Oh, ooh)
Three: Don't be his friend (Again)
You know you're gonna wake up
In his bed in the mornin' (Bed in the mornin')
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules; I count 'em
I got new rules; I count 'em
(Whoa-ooh, whoa, whoa)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules; I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
You gettin' over him

[Verse 1]
Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Verse 2]
Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
Thеre's a spark in-between us
When wе're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I'm asking you tonight

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Spoken Interlude]
If I said I want your body, would you hold it against me?

[Bridge]
Give me something good
Don't wanna wait, I want it now
Drop it, like a hood
And show me how you work it out
Alright

[Breakdown]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I've lost my love, I'm sad (So sad)
She's found someone who's better (Who's better than me)
Takes you to every party, just to dance and dance again
I can click my feet, I can snap my hands
And you're still not back again

[Pre-Chorus: Nyce & Tory Lanez]
Gave you all my love, it didn't do it for you, babe (No, it didn't do it for you, babe)
Gave you all my love, it didn't do it for you, babe (Ooh, nothin', yeah)
And this pain inside my heart will fade away (I know)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Why does it hurt so bad? (Oh)
Why does it hurt so bad? (Damn, it hurt so bad)
Down inside my heart, it makes me sad, I know (Yeah, it makes me sad)

Why does it hurt so bad? (Why does it hurt so bad?)
Down inside my heart, it makes me sad, I know (Yeah, it makes me sad)
Why does it hurt so bad? (Oh, no, no, no)
Why does it hurt so bad?

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
I sit in my room thinking I wanna be your lover
But I've been rejected so bad
Sat down at every party and watched you laugh and laugh again
When I click my feet and I snap my hand
You're still not back again (No)

[Pre-Chorus: Nyce & Tory Lanez]
Gave you all my love, it didn't do it for you, babe (No, it didn't do it for you, babe)

[Outro]
You the girl that I love, be my woman
Something 'bout that girl, I want her to be my lover
See something 'bout this girl, I want her to be my woman
She wanna dance nonstop, she's tired of it

[Intro]
We, we are done
Said it's nothing like the ending, baby, uh
Still gonna have some fun, ooh
We, we are done
Said it's nothing like the ending, baby, uh
Still gonna have some fun, ooh

[Verse 1]
You say it's over, it ain't over yet baby, uh
Didn't wanna go, and now I'm going, yeah, uh
Act like you know but didn't know me yet, baby, uh
This type of love is not fair, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in my heart, it's in my head
And I just won't last
1-5-0 on the dash, heading nowhere fast
And I'm needing your love
I'm so deep in your love
Hoping that don't crash
Trying to speed to your love

[Chorus]
I'm gonna get you good tonight, baby (Baby)
By the fire with the wood tonight, baby (Fire by the wood tonight)
And lovе you like I should, tonight, baby
Then I'm gon' leavе, like you did me
I'm gonna get you good tonight, baby (Baby)
By the fire with the wood tonight, baby (Fire by the wood tonight)
And love you like I should, tonight, baby
Then I'm gon' leave, uh, yeah

[Verse 2]
You said you loved me, you don't love me, no, baby, uh
You know my limits, you gon' take it there
You got no shame, you know this world is so crazy, uh
That type of love is unfair

[Pre-Chorus]
It's in my heart, it's in my head
And I just won't last
1-5-0 on the dash, heading nowhere fast
And I'm needing your love
I'm so deep in your love
Hoping that don't crash
Trying to speed to your love

[Chorus]
I'm gonna get you good tonight, baby (Baby)
By the fire with the wood tonight, baby (Fire by the wood tonight)
And love you like I should, tonight, baby
Then I'm gon' leave, like you did me

By the fire with the wood tonight, baby (Fire by the wood tonight)
And love you like I should, tonight, baby
Then I'm gon' leave, uh, yeah

[Interlude]

And love you like I should, tonight, baby
Then I'm gon' leave, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I took my drugs and took my lovin' when I left out the spot
I left the party with a barbie marking X on the dot (Uh)
She calls my phone up but I told her, "I'm a loner" (Uh)
But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (Uh)
We hit the highway, 1-5-5, with my whole foot on the dash
She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash
But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard
I've waited for my chance, but playboys we don't dance, dance, dance

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave my heart (Uh)
Speedin' car goin' ninety in the rain
She took my hеart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my hands is not for romance
I wanna stay but, playboys, wе don't dance, dance, dance

[Chorus]
So I won't dance again, oh, baby
No, I won't dance again, ooh, yeah (Uh)
No, I won't dance again
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Oh, face in the daylight, wastin' time on the stars in the sky
She's got my pager, play games of love all on my eyes
Then I'm reminded, love don't come 'til you find it
I just hope that it's workin', I'm yearnin', I'm searchin', uh
The afterparty was on Wilson and 73rd
You got the notion that somebody else was with me first
But on my radar, you had some nerve to play hard
You took away my chance, but playboys we don't dance, dance, dance

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave my heart (Uh)
Speedin' car goin' ninety in the rain
She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my hands is not for romance
I wanna stay but, playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

[Chorus]
So I won't dance again, oh, baby
No, I won't dance again, ooh, yeah (Uh)
No, I won't dance again
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh

[Verse 1]
I left my love at your place today (Uh)
We're too young for these incidents
Wore my heart on my sleeve too long
Goin' through heartbreak won't be too long
She's got my name tatted on her wrist
I don't know why something's wrong with this
This burnin' love, I ain't seen before
And I don't know if I can handle it anymore (Oh, no)

[Chorus]
Just would you let me know (Oh)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (Ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know (Yeah)
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh
Just would you let me know (Oh)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (Ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know (Yeah)
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh (Stuck on you)
Just would you let me know (Let me know)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (Ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh ('Cause I'm still stuck on you)
Just would you let me know (Let me know)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (Ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know (Let me know)
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm watchin' from a distance
I don't want her to pass me by
Look up, it's a full moon outside
There's things we both can't deny
Leavin' my love at your place today
So wrapped up tryna break away
Kisses and hugs, they just fade away
It's the time we do our own thing
Leavin' my love at your place today
Finding the feelings you chased away
Realizin' this could've been the last
Well, if you are bound to stay, yeah

[Chorus]
Just would you let me know (Let me know)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (Ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know (Yeah)
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh
Just would to let me know (Let me know)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (Ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know (Yeah)
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh (Stuck on you)
Just would you let me know (Let me know)
I can't take heartbreak for oh so long (Ooh, yeah)
Lil' baby, won't you let me know
'Cause I'm still stuck on you, ooh-woah, oh, oh ('Cause I'm still stuck on you)

What would you do?
If this goes right, girl
If everything goes how we planned it to
Sexy lady

If I was rubbing my hand on you?
Would it make you amused?

[Pre-Chorus]
You electrify my body (Electrify my body)
Specify, I'm horny (Specify, I'm horny)
Baby, after tonight we're going (Baby, after tonight we're going)
Come and sexify my heart (Woo)

[Chorus]
What are you waiting for? (Ooh, yeah)
You got me lost in the clutch of you (Lost in you)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And my baby loves me more (Baby)
What are you waiting for?
'Cause maybe her loving me this much won't do (Won't do)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And I don't wanna hurt her soul (And I don't wanna hurt her soul)

[Verse 2]
Tell me
What would you do?
If еverything felt right, she'd dim thе lights?
I bet you would what she tells you to
Oh now sexy lady, uh
What would you want to do?
If I laid my cards, left my girl
And stay with you, you?

[Pre-Chorus]
You electrify my body (Electrify my body)
Specify, I'm horny (Specify, I'm horny)
Baby, after tonight we're going (Baby, after tonight we're going)
Come and sexify my heart (Woo)

[Chorus]
What are you waiting for? (Ooh, yeah)
You got me lost in the clutch of you (Lost in you)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And my baby loves me more (Baby)
What are you waiting for?
'Cause maybe her loving me this much won't do (Won't do)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And I don't wanna hurt her soul (And I don't wanna hurt her soul)
What are you waiting for? (Ooh, yeah)
You got me lost in the clutch of you (Lost in you)
And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home

And what's worst to know, I got a girl at home
And I don't wanna hurt her soul (Don't wanna hurt her soul)

Girl you got to want me, yeah
But she don't want me
She'll leavе out on me

[Verse 1]
I call her my baby with love in my eyes
She tends to call me crazy, that's no surprise (Surprise)
She's on my radar, a 747
But when I spoke to her, I got no reply (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
She's not nice, to fall in love think twice
I put my love on ice (That's right, baby)
She's not mine, but mine enough alright
She doesn't know my life (That's right, baby)
But that's alright

[Verse 2]
I met her in my city, was so surprised
She's mean but she's so pretty, I don't know why
Some how I got her number, I'm calling her phone
She seems to never answer, she leaves me so alone

[Pre-Chorus]
She's not nice, to fall in love think twice
I put my love on ice (That's right, baby)
She's not mine, but mine enough alright
She doesn't know my life (That's right, baby)

[Intro]
Gotta couple bitches sippin' on Mcqueen
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything
Come back to my crib you ain't gon' never leave
Hella ashes on your sheets
And some Rick Owens that's unreleased
Got a big ass chain and my gang goes underneath
Know that it's a classic if Cardo on the beat

[Verse 1]
Look at the time lapse
You see a hundred joints rolled, couple girls on the way
Gotta make sure that the pool ain't cold
Let everything else froze
Celebrate with my bros 'cause I remember the times we ain't know
Shorty texting me she close, she hope I got that thing from IG, told her it's a gravity bomb
Few shots but she'd rather be stoned, I got some shrooms I could put you on
And you ain't come alone, two cones and your favorite Taylor gang playlist, now you're in the zone
She biracial, I'm high ain't even charged my two phones
Know how to perform when the pressure's on
Putting kush in the joint all night long
Say you know some stoners you should invite them over, and tell them all I'm that guy
The Snoop Dogg won the player of the year award, and so did I

[Verse 2]
She hella rich gotta couple dips with her
Fascinated by the bottle she wanna take a sip
Rolling 'em up bat size, walk by get high off a contact
'Cause the mood's hella relaxing, this the fattest joint that you ever seen
Weed good tryna see how bad you can get
Business calls million dollar deals, do it all from where I sit
Lock another venture down before I split
You pigs don't fly straight, I'm thankful for everything I get
Reservation's set, we don't gotta ask, we just light up and pass
I make my own drink off the secret menu they keep my bottle in the back
The service good, pull out some racks to keep a waitress happy
That's how you know that I'm that guy
'Cause Snoop Dogg won the player of the year award, and so did I

[Outro]

[?] and they know my name
Got a married bitch risking everything
Look at my chain and it say Taylor gang
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything

[Intro]
Smoke another bag, I got cash, I don't need to flash
Hop up off the plane, foreign bitch want my autograph
Brand new foreign ride, I just put the muh'fucka in the stash, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hoppin' off the jet, mo' money to invest
I love to have fun, business, never neglect
Niggas know it's the gang, they never disrespect
A quarter million dollars, I put that on my neck
Wanna come at my ride? You better come correct
My niggas down to slide, I put that on the set
No fuckin' up the vibes
Good kush in the air, my hand is on hеr thighs
Get money errywhеre, conduct myself like a player
Niggas sayin' what I should do
But I don't give a fuck, I don't care
Talk it and be about it
A pound of kush, you won't see me without it
My weed is the loudest and I put that on gang (Gang)

[Chorus]
Never tryna sober up (Oh)
Pull up and they know it's us (Oh)
That's how you know I be killin' it (Yeah)
That's know you know I'm the realest in this bitch (Oh)
Teach 'em how to roll it up (Oh)
'Notha shot, po' it up (Oh)
She left you, now she feelin' it (Yeah)
Tired of talkin' it, we livin' it

[Verse 2]
Uh, I get my weed from a dude that look just like me
‘Locs long, big crib for him and all of his seeds
Rollin' trees in my car, spilled some nugs on my seat
If you walk up in my closet, ‘lotta J's for my feet
‘Lotta chucks too
Wanna kick it with a real nigga so she come through
Her friend say she havin' fun too
I don't blame her
Let ‘em get as wild as she want, I don't tame her
You can smoke this J if you want, a lotta flavors
Some good vibrations
My backyard feel like vacation
I put you on a first name basis
Don't get tied up, no laces
No lames over here, all gang shit

[Chorus]
Never tryna sober up (Hahahaha)
Pull up and they know it's us (Oh) (Yeah nigga)
That's how you know I be killin' it (Yeah) (We gon' keep smokin', while y'all niggas drinkin')
That's know you know I'm the realest in this bitch (Oh)
Teach ‘em how to roll it up (Oh) (Fuck wrong with y'all man? It's 2021)
'Notha shot, po' it up (Get yo' paper up) (Oh)
She left you, now she feelin' it (Soembody)
Tired of talkin' it, we livin' it (Oh)

[Outro]
Gotta bottle comin', filled with McQueen (With McQueen)
If I'm in the clubs then you know I'm V.I.P. (V.I.P.)
Fuckin' up the couches, standin' on the seats (On the seats)
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything (Everything)

[Intro]
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything
Got your pussy wetter than a hurricane
Pay the bill, tell her, "Keep the change"

[Chorus]
We don't really pass ’em, we just smoke
We don't really pass 'em, we just smoke
I hope you got your own rolled up
I hope you got your own rolled up
We don’t really pass 'em, we just smoke
We don't really pass 'em, we just smoke
I hope you got your own rolled up
I hope you got your own rolled up

[Verse 1]
By the time you hear this one
I'll be high, somewhere on a mission
Probably flying somewhere, me and a couple bitches
Who look good as they do in they pictures
Look 'em up, they got shit like CEO in they description
Rather bring her back to her seat, her shit too expensive
THC pills and McQueen shots, we twisted
None of us spilled our drinks when the plane lifted off, destination was typed in
And, baby girl, you the type that might end up in my bed before the night end
Made sure she was in her right mind
Some nigga rolled her a joint, I threw that shit out and let her hit mine

[Chorus]
We don't really pass 'em, we just smoke
We don’t really pass ’em, we just smoke
I hope you got your own rolled up
I hope you got your own rolled up
We don't really pass ’em, we just smoke
We don't really pass 'em, we just smoke
I hope you got your own rolled up
I hope you got your own rolled up

[Verse 2]
Personal parties
Only pass to my niggas from the hood or my brother from New Orleans
Don't know where your hand’s been, so you won't put your hands on my spliff
If you was me, you would understand how many bands I spent to get to the position that I'm in
Expecting me to just dip in the stash like shit come out of thin air
That's how you know niggas ain't experienced and they energy's weird
I ain't promise you nothing, just to be clear
Plus turned down everyone the same way, just to be fair
Losing my respect, getting all emotional
Should've brought your own like a nigga told you to do

[Chorus]
We don't really pass 'em, we just smoke
We don't really pass 'em, we just smoke
I hope you got your own rolled up
I hope you got your own rolled up
We don't really pass 'em, we just smoke
We don't really pass 'em, we just smoke
I hope you got your own rolled up
I hope you got your own rolled up

[Outro]
Me and Berner picking out another strain
Private pilot, Rolls Royce outside the plane
Tryna get some sleep, I'm taking off my chains
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything

[Intro]
(Sledgren)
Got you tryna live by the movie scene
Wizzle got wings
Wizzle got everything

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
These niggas ain't built like us
These niggas ain't real like us
Heard he found another way
They ain't in the field like us
Heard he got a lot of pressure
Rollin' stress been buildin' up
Heard I'm the realest nigga in the building
Heard that if you smoke this kush that it'll make you chill
Heard that just because you famous, it don't make you rеal
I got one hand on the wheel
All about the mothеfuckin'—
All about them dollars bills

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I pulled up, they smell the smoke
My window was barely open
Give the roach to whoever closest
This illegal dosage
Don't gotta quarantine
Just need a light for this quarter P
Hella bomb weed, the owner hope we don't leave
Quarter M on my sleeve
Below zero degrees
Smart home, my iPhone control everything
She say she havin' fun here, but she really wanna leave
Got a thing for private planes and jet skis
The best weed, takin' pics with her besties
Like her shots chilled and her chaser fresh squeezed
And I'm the perfect nigga to do 'em with
And I ain't perfect, but my team loyal
And my weed strong, so it's probably worth it
Pull up on you at your job, smoke you out while you workin'
Take you back to my vacation home
Your phone strugglin' to get service

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
These niggas ain't built like us
These niggas ain't real like us
Heard he found another way
They ain't in the field like us
Heard he got a lot of pressure
Rollin' stress been buildin' up
Heard I'm the realest nigga in the building
Heard that if you smoke this kush that it'll make you chill
Heard that just because you famous, it don't make you real
I got one hand on the wheel
All about the mothefuckin'—
All about them dollars bills

[Verse 2:  Fedd the Godd]
Number one hits and Rolls Royce's, it don't feel real
Private jet just to leave the City
Got another deal
She know that toxic shit make her cum harder
The way my hand inside her skirt you'll think I was Vince Carter
Dirty boy
If you know you know
Dirt dig a ho, with my woes
Don't approach, you broke
None of my partners here is common folk
I be extra high
When I smoke, I see kaleidoscope
I be extra fly when I'm dressin', I think I'm the pope
All about them dollars bills
Foreign bitch in foreign hills
Name some niggas real as we
Hold on, I ain't got time to chill
Ain't know competition in this circle, we on one field
Please don't disrespect, we hop in mini-van's for one drill
Sacrifice, take a risk, watch it pay off
I ain't got a hundred mil' so I can't take a day off
French seven five, sippin' G5, we take off
Fuck her off the Adderall and take her lace off, yeah

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
These niggas ain't built like us
These niggas ain't real like us
Heard he found another way
They ain't in the field like us
Heard he got a lot of pressure
Rollin' stress been buildin' up
Heard I'm the realest nigga in the building
Heard that if you smoke this kush that it'll make you chill
Heard that just because you famous, it don't make you real
I got one hand on the wheel
All about the mothefuckin'—
All about them dollars bills

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Was a good girl, now she rep the gang
She go to the shop, tattooing my name
Let her hit the bong, might fuck up her brain
Wizzle got wings
Wizzle got everything

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Gotta take the joy with the pain
Come with some good weather and love the rain
Leave her with me, she rep' the Gang
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything
Both got Rolls Royces but yours ain't the same
Can't remember the last time we flew commercial plane
(Yeah, that's hard)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, countin' up
Millions makin' the mountain, that's us
Dive in that bitch like Scrooge McDuck
I could have anything I want
Won't hesitate to roll the weed up
Pounds for days, I keep a fresh cut
Smokе me a few then frеshen up
Big dog, can't share my yard wit' you pups
Hard work, this ain't from luck
Both talk, niggas wit' yachts
Spend a million on watches
Like the shit from the movies we watch
I'm tryna chill, they invitin' me out
The party to exclusive not to go
Having too much fun to stop
Handle business but don't do it in a office
Wouldn't believe what they just offered
I turned it down because I want some more
My nigga, you ain't havin' fun, then what you working for?

[Chorus: Young Deji]
Let me know your fantasy
Let me know your fantasy
Let me know your fantasy
Let me know your fantasy

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Countin' up
Millions makin' the mountain, that's us
Dive in that bitch like Scrooge McDuck
Bomb weed for days
Years to be exact
We ain't never runnin' out
We went from buying whips to different houses
Vegas trips, my nigga bet yo' chips on us if you wanna win
The game's rigged when the Gang's near
Rick Owens shit's all I wear
Bags from CELINE
Another night, another private dinner for my team
Another language being spoken when I order my drink
You ain't lookin' so you probably never seen this
Harder then it seems
Make it look seamless
Let's go back to my car so we could sing this
Movie scene, they wanna stream this
Lean yo' seat back, get the trees lit
Higher than the pitch of your favorite scent
When it's finished, roll another zip

[Chorus: Young Deji]
Let me know your fantasy
Let me know your fantasy
Let me know your fantasy
Let me know your fantasy

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Don't say a real one, call her by her nickname
Known the bitch for years and she never change
Throw up my set and it's gon' stay the same
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything
Looked in the mirror this morning and realized I can't complain

[Intro]
Go to the 

[?] for my airplane
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got errthing
Keep that 

[?]
Gotta 

[?] keep all these shit
God damnit

[?] your mother fuckin face

[Verse 1]
When the check clear, we getting more gear
Buying shit that we won't wear
Taking cars around the block
Going places we ain't even supposed to go near
Red Ferrari, my nigga just bought it
Yellow Lamborghini, had to have it when I seen it
Hit the studio, you gon' swear that I'm a genius
And my crib so nice, my maids love to come and clean it
Sunset, getting undressed with a demon
Always wanted to run up checks, I ain't need a reason
Gotta  be please with my success
I do my best to help my young niggas keep succeeding

[Chorus]
If I can afford it, I'mma go out and pay for (go out and pay for)
If I can afford it, I'mma get what I want (get what I want)
If I can afford it, I'mma go out and pay for (go out and pay for)
If I can afford it, I'mma get what I want (get what I want)

[Verse 2]

[?] your hair down, girl
You been working all day, now we on our own world
Said you don't got time for a man, you got too many plans
You don't wanna be my girlfriend
Diamonds on your hands
If you get the chance, then that money will be 

[?] spent
Don't call me when you need your rent
Call me when you need that kush scent
Or some bomb ass dick
I wake up in 6
Don't go to sleep till this money I get
You nigga wish was in my position
Rooftop on the new drop, roof missing

[Chorus]
If I can afford it, I'mma go out and pay for (go out and pay for)
If I can afford it, I'mma get what I want (get what I want)
If I can afford it, I'mma go out and pay for (go out and pay for)
If I can afford it, I'mma get what I want (get what I want)

[Outro]
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got errthing
Sipping on my queen
Never 

[?]
She 

[?] to my crib, she ain't go never leave

[Verse 1]
Smoke you out properly
Roll with me, you see lots of weed
Like the doctor we got degrees
Smokin' kush overseas
Satisfy her wants and her needs
She wit' me on her knees
Nigga, please, you ain't smokin' pounds like these
Take you out to the beach, let you feel a slight breeze
Got a car with no keys, take a joint and fill it with trees
Got a lot of girls on my team, I pull up, make 'em scream
I'm the hottest thing on the scene and my jar gasoline
I'm the nigga they leave with; fuck me all quarantine
Kushy all on my jеans; roll the weed, she suck me to sleep
Spеnd a couple of weekends, "Will you do the shrooms?"
She said "All depends", if she get too lit, then tonight, she might spend

[Chorus]
We like exclusive smoke
And exclusive girls
Straight shots and pounds to blow
Real bosses, so we all grow
Live large, but every trip we take
The money always on the mind
From the doubt, remember one thing
We always gotta stay solid

[Verse 2]
Drink McQueen out the bottle
Take pictures, of my bitch, she a model
Don't offer me yo' car, fool, I already got one
Bad bitch ridin' shotgun
Mint condition '56
In the front '61 with the top gone
Ridin' 'round breakin' necks
Make 'em wonder what's next
Know I gotta come correct, rep the set
Anything on yo' chest, get it off, fool
All my niggas gangsters and this how we all move

[Chorus]
We like exclusive smoke
And exclusive girls
Straight shots and pounds to blow
Real bosses, so we all grow
Live large, but every trip we take
The money always on the mind
From the doubt, remember one thing
We always gotta stay solid

[Outro]
She gon' give it up, she ain't gon' never tease
Let her hit the kush, she weak in the knees
Take another shot right before she leave
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything
When I walk into the club, fill my glass up with McQueen

[Intro]
Why they hating
Why they hating
Why they hating on me
Why they hating
Why they hating
(That shit be real sometimes)
Why they hating on me
Why they hating
Why they hating
Why they hating on me
(you just gotta listen man)
Why they hating
Why they hating
Why they hating on me

[Verse 1]
Never bite the hand that feed you, pussy I could read you
Don't get out of line and let hating niggas mislead you
Talking shit on niggas, don't know why you feel the need to
Bout to crash your whip, that's what having too much speed'll do
Say my name 3 times then you're dead, just like beetle juice
Smoking on that killer, bout to bring the weed on through
I get shit cracking whеn I get high, I make the needlе move
You transparent when you tell them lies I can see through you
Won't say that shit to your face, that's what corny people do
Know some dudes on corners that corners where they sleeping too
Had to get my money up
I put on my people too
Saying the first was a classic, i'm a make a sequel to it

[Chorus]
Chronic
She calling me up, baby now she want that bomb shit
Ain't had it in a while
And she know just where to find it
I ain't worried bout them niggas got a problem
I'm a say that shit in person ain't no comment
Girl I got a big ass car that you can ride in
I got a buss down to tell me what the time is
That's why them niggas stay hating on me
That's why them niggas stay hating cause I'm shining

[Verse 2]
You should probably stack your chips instead of hating
Wonder if I fucked your bitch, use your imagination
Niggas wanted me to stop but shit I had to make it
Had to go on tour and make myself the fan favorite
Had to make myself the boss, ain't have to step on toes
Half these niggas ain't 100, half these niggas hoes
Half these niggas smile in your face and laugh behind your back
Half these niggas broke
Half these niggas doing bad
I don't hang out with these niggas, I got too much swag
Made my millions now i'm chilling, why would you be mad?
Niggas hurting now trying to sell they jewelry back
They get jealous when you winning that's just how they react

[Chorus]
Chronic
She calling me up, baby now she want that bomb shit
Ain't had it in a while
And she know just where to find it
I ain't worried bout them niggas got a problem
I'm a say that shit in person ain't no comment
Girl I got a big ass car that you can ride in
I got a buss down to tell me what the time is
That's why them niggas stay hating on me
That's why them niggas stay hating cause I'm shining

[Bridge]
Why they hating
Why they hating
Why they hating on me
Why they hating
Why they hating
Why they hating on me
Why they hating
Why they hating
Why they hating on me
Why they hating
Why they hating
Why they hating on me

[Outro]
She leave with me, You won't see her again
Got her rolling up the trees with her best friend
Throwing up my gang
Pour some more Mcqueen
Wizzle got Wings, Wizzle got everything

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Ridin' in a Hurricane
I'm just sippin' on McQueen
My crib, she ain't gon' never leave
The Taylors, that's the winning team
(Dreamer, wake up)
(Sledgren)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Fresh dressed, I'm high but intellectual
Shorty textin' me sexual shit
I'm wondering how I make my next move
My best move, so I apply pressure
Residue from a pound on my dresser
Receipts from her heels 'cause I dress her
Don't ask me if I keep it real, ask mе if I keep the shit after the tag peel
Wi-Fi codе phone, baggin' still
You don't even need that 'cause after I break ya back
Only thing you worried 'bout's what I'm playing next
You impressed by my movie selection
Hit the gym in the morning, I want hella breakfast
Say you got a real nigga on your checklist
Rep' the Gang, you could see it on my necklace
Know I got a pound of a weed if I'm on the plane
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Curren$y]
And when I call, you come through
And when I roll one up, take a hit and get stoned too
And when I call, you come through
And when I roll one up, take a hit and get stoned too
Keep the E in it, Chevys on switches
Smoke weed in it (Da-da-da, da-da-da)

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Uh, I just bought this car to pull up on y'all
Smokin' under the stars in midday, all log
Came up with another way to plug my double R
High fly boys, niggas never fallin' off
I pulled up, I parked
I hop out and walk to the crib, spark me, I laugh a little bit
Then the riddles got solved, oh yeah, I'm him
Just like you heard, you tryna come and get done like I done yo' girl
Keep you 'mersed in this player ass world I built
Smoked some of the best strains known to exist
Yeah bitch, this it
Really in the mix, don't slip, don't fuck up
And we might all get rich
Put your friends on the lick if you trust them hoes
Bring 'em wit' you on a mission, give 'em some of your dough
But not mines though

[Outro Wiz Khalifa & Curren$y]
And when I call, you come through
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, da-da-da, da-da-da)
And when I roll one up, take a hit and get stoned too
(Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da)
And when I call, you come through
(La-da-da, la-da-da, la-da-da)
And when I roll one up, take a hit and get stoned too
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(And when ya bitch gettin' home, I'll be just gettin' home too)
Gang life, Gang life
(And if she wanna act grown, then I wanna act grown too)
Gang life, Gang life
(I'm down to see like anything)
Gang life, Gang life
(Got a couple bitches sippin' on McQueen)
Gang life
(Come back to my crib, she ain't gon' never leave)
Gang life
(Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything)
(Everything, everything, everything, everything)

[Intro]
Mm-hmm, mm-mm
My nigga Ben quit playin', haha
Uh

[Verse 1]
I put in work
Reppin' my gang 'til the dirt
What was in her purse?
Ain't concerned, what was under her skirt?
Jump in my car, we're makin' it skrrt
Stay on my job, they know what I'm worth
I gotta be the freshest nigga on earth
Make her eat up, then I give her dessert
I got numbers on my shirt 'cause I'm a player
I pay for it, so I own it
Blow kush smoke, it ain't fair how I took over the game
Made it through several layers, now these niggas don't mention my name simply 'cause they scared
My car go quick in the lane
I get a bitch, I don't cuff her, just give her the game
And let her make us both rich, nah, we ain't the same
I rep the gang, you reppin' for niggas that's lame
Stay up out the way with them lil' vibrations

[Chorus]
Pour up some more
I got a lil' bottle of McQueen out the store (Woah)
Roll up some more
I got a lil' pound so we can all come smoke
Hate it when everything fast
Like when life move slow, life move slow
When a bum bitch lie, you never gassed 'cause I got that fire for sure

[Verse 2]
Who put you onto game?
Who made sure you had T-G-O-D in your name?
Who made sure you didn't give a fuck about the fame?
Diamonds all in our bracelets
Roll wit' gangsters
Live the real life, no entertainment
And if they entertain, we put on a show
Hundred joints already rolled, smell the kush through the door
Bomb music, bomb weed, shit, that's all we know
Don't take pics or expose 'em
Even though we high, keep this on the low

[Chorus]
Pour up some more
I got a lil' bottle of McQueen out the store (Woah)
Roll up some more
I got a lil' pound so we can all come smoke
Hate it when everything fast
Like when life move slow, life move slow
When a bum bitch lie, you never gassed 'cause I got that fire for sure

[Outro]
She leavin' her man 'cause that nigga lame
I stick to the plan, make sure I win the game
Doobie in my hand when I walk on the plane
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything
If she come to my crib, she ain't gon' be the same
Celine draws and Balenciaga shades

[Intro]
She don't wanna be left out
Letter hit the weed, this the best out
Came over to my crib with her chest out
Best friend hating, she the next one waiting
She don't wanna be left out
Letter hit the weed, this the best out
Came over to my crib with her chest out
Best friend hating, she the next one waiting

[Verse 1]
Kickin' the box, but you gotta have patience
Lame ass niggas, me and them, no relation
Came over to my crib and catch your vibration
'Nother hundred million, thanks to Live Nation
She love a pothead, we got good conversation
Use my GPS to type the destination
Told a homegirl to cook and bring my fucking plate in
Never seen a G, they be lookin' at me in amazement

[Chorus]
We 'bout to roll one up
Full our cups with that good stuff
She 'bout to come back up, take that up
'Cause she got that good stuff

[Verse 2]
Big bags and late night bong drags
Good kush, that's all we have
Told her to use a cone ‘cause she don’t know how to roll
Puerto Rican so her hair down to the floor
We just fucked, now she wanna fuck me some more
Make her wet, say she love my approach
Hit her from the back, make her feel it in her throat
Rolling up the kush, say my flavors really potent
You ain't gotta ask around, girl, you know it
Quentin Tarantino, when I see, I gotta focus
I'mma leave her back broken, eyes closed and nose wide open
Tired of them players, now you sitting where the coach at

[Chorus]
We 'bout to roll one up
Full our cups with that good stuff
She 'bout to come back up, take that up
'Cause she got that good stuff

[Outro]
Spend a lot of money, so they know my name
Different hella kush, you be glad I came
Nigga acted up, put him in his place
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got errthing

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Even though it's day time (Whoa), we rollin' up chronic (Whoa)
If you want that good weed (Whoa), you need it, I got it (Whoa)
I gotta keep a bad bitch around me (Whoa)
More McQueen, I'm the life of the party (Whoa)
They hate but it won't stop (Whoa), 'cause they don't know 'bout it (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Jump in my ride, then she gon' pull 'em to the side
She see them diamonds, she start covering her eyes
Only them real niggas, ain't fuckin' with no lies
You see them plaques, you ain't surprised
I work hard, then put on for my guys
Them Rolex diamonds on the jet, you see how time flies
I'm young Wiz, they know me as the wisеst
I'ma need hella cheese with my fries
Hеlla weed, I supply
And my pool is heated so come and take a dive in
We some young 2020 survivors
Gang, Jet Lifers
Good kush be lowerin' my eyelids
They go on Google tryna find what I get
Nigga, every dollar and every cent
Thirty-three and really rich
Down to fuck another nigga bitch
In the box is where I sit or get floor seats
2021 need more money and more freaks
Reppin' Taylor Gang seven days out the week

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Larry June]
Even though it's day time (Whoa), we rollin' up chronic (Whoa)
If you want that good weed (Whoa), you need it, I got it (Whoa)
I gotta keep a bad bitch around me (Whoa)
More McQueen, I'm the life of the party (Whoa)
They hate (Man) but it won't stop (Whoa), 'cause they don't know 'bout it (Yeah)
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, man)

[Verse 2: Larry June]
Bendin' hella corners in this five-point-O
Dope is sellin', hoes is goin'
Duck in the Rolls, my sock is bulgin'
My wrist is frozen, I'm often chosen
Porsches and horses, coke white forces
A plug named Jorge, some game in Portland
I glide when I walk, mack when I talk
Roll up a chop before I get a fresh cut (Good job)
At my bitch house just checkin' the mail
Niggas still want it so I'm servin' 'em still
Now I'm sittin' on her couch playin' Donell Jones
She walked in the room in a lime green thong
I'm sippin' this juice, keepin' it P
Unbothered by the bitch, I'm just thumbin' through Gs
Hold on love, pour me a glass of McQueen (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Me and Wiz in the cut blowin' A-1 trees (Good job, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Even though it's day time (Whoa), we rollin' up chronic (Whoa)
If you want that good weed (Whoa), you need it, I got it (Whoa)
I gotta keep a bad bitch around me (Whoa)
More McQueen, I'm the life of the party (Whoa)
They hate but it won't stop (Whoa), 'cause they don't know 'bout it (Yeah)

[Outro: Larry June & Wiz Khalifa]
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Got you tryna live by the movie scene
You in my jacuzzi sippin' on McQueen
(Man, uh, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Call up your girls and tell 'em join the team
(God job)
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything
(Numbers, Cardo)
(Shit)

[Chorus]
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got errythang, I ever wanted
They say they joy come with the pain, I make sure that my growth is never stunned

[Verse 1]
Be careful who you run with
One false move in the dirt, you could be under it
Had fun this summer, but now it’s time to grind
Two bad bitches at once, how do I decide?
Khalifa Kush in the joint, keep them dollar sign eyes
Don’t question my intentions, or mention me poorly
You way out of line
Make your decision, this boss advice
You don’t wanna take it? I won’t give it
But when it’s all said and done at lest I I kept it one hundred with you

[Chorus]
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got errythang, I ever wanted
They say they joy come with the pain, I make sure that my growth is never stunned

[Verse 2]
Reputation without a stain on it
A pound, with my name on it
That sound like your favorite strain, don’t it?
Bucket list with everything scratched off of it
Hard to miss, still learnin‘ new tricks, all my dogs in here
No excuse to blame it on appearance anymore
I’ma boss and it’s crystal clear, I made the studio my office
Turned into a fortune, now it’s forklifts to bring piles of money to the door for us
We don’t worry ‘bout the score, hardly lookin’ at the board
Focused on what’s goin’ on right there on there floor

[Chorus]
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got errythang, I ever wanted
They say they joy come with the pain, I make sure that my growth is never stunned

[Outro]
Got yo’ pussy wetter than a hurricane
Gotta couple bitches sippin’ on McQueen
Then get back to my crib, she ain’t gon’ never leave
She walk with the Taylor’s, that’s the winnin’ team
And the jets, nigga
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got errythang
The type to pay the bill and tell you “Keep the change”

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
Yeah, I pull up weed scented, blowin' trees all in it
Look, it's still all good if you ain't seen me in a minute
West coast livin', west coast women
Midwest nigga doin' west coast business
I done seen it all
See me off the net, look like you seen a ghost
My niggas been down since day one, I gotta keep 'em close
I'm good with numbers, I can count it backwards
Ain't talkin' hood bitches when they pull up with the ratchets
I know the game like the back of my hand
Just gotta stick to the plan
Keep it clean, it's lower chances at jam
Roll another one
How can I fold? I'm my mother's son
Could never be convinced to take another run
You fuckin' dumb? Guess so
She don't wanna let go
Nigga, you can't roll if you ain't pinchin' on a petrol
No shorts on the money
You gotta make it right
Bought so many one time, the plug told me "Make the price"
Nigga, nice

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
While you talkin' it, I don't got time for that, I'm out here livin' it (Oh-woah)
And you know that we doin' them thangs 'cause we out here gettin' it
I rep the gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
I rep the gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, oh-woah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, it feel good to see Taylors up on it
And bringin' real ones to the forefront
My car filled up with smoke
2021 controlled by remotes
Them haters don't come close
Used to be hard to celebrate birthdays, now it's champagne toast
Placin' bets, racin' jets
Pick a time to land
Five hundred grand to whoever get there the closest
Those are points of success when you put the plan in motion
You got one foot in, one out, I got both in
Able to hold shit down with more spin
Everybody got free will 'long as you willing to deal with the consequences
Lot of players at my dinner, that's a lot of dishes
And you the ones that gotta clean it

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
While you talkin' it, I don't got time for that, I'm out here livin' it (Oh-woah)
And you know that we doin' them thangs 'cause we out here gettin' it
I rep the gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
I rep the gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, oh-woah

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Everything is real, exactly how we claimed
Just got another strain, I just gotta name it
She used to smoke joints to "The Kid Frankie"
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything
Ask Chevy Woods; money good, can't complain
Real niggas ain't goin' out of style, we gon' stay here
Each day I think of yesterday
That wonderful yesterday
When we were in love

And I remember kisses
We shared at evening time
The day they again be mine
That's the day I'm dreaming of

That's why I look for yesterday
Each moment you're gone away
Tomorrow may come, it's true
Will it be like yesterday
I shared with you

Each day I look for yesterday
That wonderful yesterday
When I had your love
You know, I've done a lot of travelin in my time, anyplace I guess that you can mention, from Maine to California to Alaska to Europe, Asia. Done a lot of travelin, but nobody I know, and I mean nobody, has covered more ground and made more friends and sung more songs than the fella you're just about to meet right now. He's got a song and a friend for every mile behind him. Say hello to my good buddy Ramblin' Jack Elliott.

[Verse 1]
I wish you gave me a reason
That you were better at leavin'
That you got your kicks from seein' me low
I always let the good ones go
Don't want the kisses, unless they're bitter
I'm hooked on touches that leave me weaker
I swear that I love nothin' more than broke
I always let the good ones go

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones, 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go

[Chorus]
I always let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones

[Verse 2]
Let you down easy, I'm tryin'
'Cause you're everything I've spent my whole life fightin'
So when I walk away, it's not your fault
I always let the good ones go

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go

[Chorus]
I always let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh, oh)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah, yeah)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(And baby you couldn't have loved me any better, better, better)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(But doin' this is all that I've known ever, ever, ever)
I let the good ones go

[Verse 1: E L U C I D]
Ugh, off the strength, I'm not as numb as I thought
I'm broken links, my circle shrinking smaller
Satellite revolve, my core is a cauldron
Surrendered orbits
Cross-check what's really real and what's performance
Speak for self, but wondering who else really on it
Who's really all in?
(Hello) Trouble calling
My phone don't ping, I'm buzzed, leave me alone
Truth with a stash pocket for a lie
The document is alive, I speak life
Every border gets revised if dissolved
What defines what is charged?
Haven't made up my mind if I'm assigned to the stars
I slide when I want, I'm inside of the funk, trust
She want up when it dump, it came from the sludge
Involuntary, shooting foundations in studs
Tears and snot bubbles, sob puddles
I lay in the wet spot
Listen, let's not conflate, I give what I take
It's the hunt, there is the chase
Some talk like they never got punched in the face
You can't see clearly now, don't come near me
Wails of the weary, loop max infinite
Draw me closer, damn near intimate

[Interlude]
And I'll give you a kiss
(*Smooch*)

[Verse 2: billy woods]
The flier said "Grown and Sexy"
I came through over-proofing the plastic Pepsi bottle
Security didn't check me
Skipped coat check, they playin' the oldies
I'ma go 'head and get sweaty
Plus saved the ten-piece
It's hell up in Harlem, so meet me 'cross 110th Street
If the tree's a bargain, bars—that don't really tempt me
I'm from where every car foreign
And we drive 'em on empty (Zimbabwe)
Bury me in a borrowed suit
Give my babies my rhyme books, but tell 'em, "Do you"
Give my enemies the good news: Time flew
We was probably brothers back then like T-R-U
No jerseys, no durags, hard-bottom shoes
Niggas tired of the foolishness
No disrespect, it's a lotta mids in the room
My pack loud, cut right through
Kofi Annan in the booth, Soyinka in the stu'
Sese Seko Mobutu if the DJ play something smooth (Slide on 'em)
It's a move, I don't dance, but maybe tonight, maybe tonight
I don't know her and I don't even mind if it is the strobe light
Live for the living
I made chicken late night in my boxers, burning up the kitchen
She passed out right when I was done fixing
I watch reruns in the dark, fingers and lips glistening

[Interlude]
Ooh, get 'em
I'm so damn proud of myself
I did this for you, G, alright?

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
Been to there and back, tall tales tossed to the breeze
We keep facts in the midnight wax, family tree sap
Light leak through the leaves on familiar tracks
I know it's real even when I'm feeling bad
Resilient as they built the black
She shimmy into the—yeah, that's consent gettin' established
You only trash if you trash, I keep it simple and dynamic
Trust the passage rites to life's chapters
I have to write to find balance
This game of telephone massive
I do what I have to with the fragments
The madness method rampant these days, I let the panic pass me
Featherweight, my heart was straight despite baggage
Asymptomatic, but I get sick of the delays—faster, faster
Practicing practice in what I preach, keep pace
The calcium on my teeth fade
Streets are blazed with the anger complacency and deceit create
Ice sheet break, I couldn't weave weight
All I could say to the times that I couldn't freeze-frame, bleak fate
You got so much to bleed to clean-slate (I've got so much of my—)
The bag of tricks in my sleeve breaks
Southpaw under the North Star, forcing all the league changes
(I've got so) Don't sleep late

[Outro]
I, I've got so much
I, I've got so much
I, I've got so much
I

[Verse 1]
Dropped a single but I ain't single no more
Momma pour me a drink please I need a little more
You hatin' me now don't act different when I'm on tour
Media think I'm losin' but never check the score
Been doing this shit a while never think about it
I just figured they'd get upset or offended by it
Ceiling comin' down only thing breaking through is my voice
Been figuring out the next step man it wasn't a choice
This shit was ramen goin' noodles at the garden
Melo still fighting for that ring, I beg your pardon

[Chorus]
Work with me
Ridе with me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Verse 2]
I stеp into the room and they speaking of the devil
New angels surrounding me for reaching the next level
We ain't playin' the same game
I'm a raging forest fire, you ain't a candle to this flame
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
Post award depression taking a toll on me, I got four
It's gettin' morbid in this house it ain't home no more
I'm sipppin' triple doubles
Double O seven I'm the greatest trouble

[Chorus]
Work with me
Ride with me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Verse 3]
When I leave I always come right back here
The young spitta that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game needs change and I'm the cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of kush shape the lines in my head
Shit been goin' on for too many years
I keep secrets, ask my father, ask my peers
Wheelchair Jimmy never saw this comin'
Only thing he'd say is to keep it one hunnid

[Chorus]
Work with me
Ride with me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Verse 1/Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
You have gotta be kidding / It's a hobby we're living
We were sloppily spitting to some wobbly rhythm
Popping off in the kitchen at parties, properly hidden
I was probably nervous but still got up to get em
Jacket possibly referencing some army division in
Camouflage like images all my idols were in and
I was not with the kids that my mom had strongly forbidden
So I was skipping out stealing car audio with em
Good kid, lived in a bubble and barely knew it
Lucky if I could recognize trouble to get into it
Trying to find like-minded rhymers to make a crеw with
But nobody liked the same typе of music
I'm used it
Facing some opportunities I didn't know what to do with
Sitting there on the sofa with smokers gamers and losers
Knowing I'm not stupid but too unsteady to prove it
Maybe I'm running to it but maybe already blew it

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Guè]
What it do, Loc? Yeah (Yeah)
We up in this motherfucker
On some murder murder, kill kill shit (Uh)
Yeah, some real hip-hop shit

[Verse 1: Guè]
Murder music, tu non fai boom boom, fai solo bau bau
Ti investo con un mezzo vroom vroom, poi muori e ciao ciao
In casa troppa neve, c'ho i Moonboots, lei miagola miao
In strada sono Jesus, salgo sopra un jet per SaoPao
Ci credi che appaio nella notte come Freddy
Da un incubo vi risvegliate freddi
Savastano style, ti blocco i freni mentre sei in discesa ripida
Scena del crimine, è un delitto chiama la scientifica
Festeggio la tua morte in qualche isola, C&E Living Ap
Con tutte queste bitches con il Molly nella bibita
Sig Sauer, che ti fa camminare un po' a zig zag
E spit fire, per ricomporti chiamano CSI

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Benny The Butcher]
Murder music, mur-murder music
Murder music, murder music
Yeah, murder music (The Butcher comin', nigga)
Murder music, mur-murder music

[Verse 2: Benny The Butcher]
Yo, murder music, just for this type of shit they could ban us
'Cause this what they gon' play when they wipe they prints off they hammers
I'm really like that, I ain't just write this shit for the camera
I did in my city what Michael Vick did in Atlanta (Yeah)
Cash saved for insurance, them bad days wasn't for us (Nah)
Still hood, roach clips and the ashtrays on my foreign (Haha)
In L.A., R&B bitch drunk with her hands around me
The night Swizz introduced me to Nas at a Grammy party (Uh-huh)
When my shrimp introduced me to hard, I had grams around me (No)
A star player never asks for the ball, they just playin' around me
Niggas heard I took a shot, they was askin' if I was good
I looked the shooter right in his eyes when that trigger got pulled
Huh

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Jadakiss]
Murder music, mur-murder music
Murder music, murder music (Yeah)
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music (Ha-ha)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yeah, some come through the water (Uh-huh)
Some come through the border (Uh)
Some of them get caught, but that's dependin' on the porter (Yup)
Old niggas hidin', young niggas slidin' (Ughn)
I'm bein' a man just protectin' and providin'
My only concern is if it cooked right (That's it)
My chain yellow, way the diamonds set up, it make it look white (Ooh)
Kill you for nothin' 'cause they petty (Uh)
Cut into dog food with the fetti (Yup)
They young but they ready (They ready)
No crowd, I get my applause off the beat
I'm a boss so I make sure all of us eat (All of us)
Say, a couple funerals'll bring a war to a cease (Woo)
And remember, it ain't no reward for the streets
This is not normal (Nah) dickey suit is how we dress formal (Yeah)
The way I'm ridin' these tracks like a porno (Woo)
Aight then, what's up then? (What's up?) I'm bustin'
Every control substance I touched it, I know it's disgustin' (Agh)
I'm just stackin', call me El Guapo (Uh-huh)
And I bet you never had a brick from El Chapo (Never)
Tuesday, I just play the crib and make tacos (Woo)
A lot of niggas frontin' like they nice, but they not though
Y'all spoke that up, now soak that up (Soak that up)
They done pulled my coat, nigga, the GOAT got up, what's up?

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Busta Rhymes]
Murder music, mur-murder music
Murder music, murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, (Yo) mur-murder music

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
I only got time to murder shit
I bang 'em while deafening both ears (Uh-huh)
When I'm makin' niggas black
And rip couches and throw chairs (Uh-huh)
At times I be unleashin' the wrath that most fear (Uh-huh)
I don't discriminate, I even body close peers
See I'm suggestin' most you niggas should get to steppin' to the rear (Uh-huh)
And fuck what most you niggas'll talk, I don't care (Uh-uh)
If you don't rep it right, you shouldn't come around here (Oh no)
Adjust one level up, make sure a nigga sound clear
They wanna stop, and wanna stare (They do)
They hate that I'm the best and it's greatness in the flesh and it's pointless to compare (Uh-huh)
You need to scribe this jewelry I write to save this shit on a server (Uh-huh)
And type the way that I speak for movin' space on a cursor
I'm not an advocate for violence, but push me, I'ma push you further
The script, hand on my hips, squeezin' the grip a little firmer (Huh)
These dumb niggas don't realize that it's better to be a learner
(Stupid ni-)
But when you don't is when you get the feelin' of burner
Shut the fuck up, it's better to be watchers, listeners, and observers
'Cause if you not, you'll fuck around, that's how niggas like you get murdered

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Murder music, mur-murder music
Murder music, murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music
Yeah, murder music
Murder music, mur-murder music

[Outro]
Murder was the case, the-the, the case
The case was murder

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
And yeah I'm not afraid of that
This is underrated rap
Take it back to
Raiders caps
Like 1988 is back
N.W.A. in fact
Cock it back & spray the track
Slay 'em, leave 'em laying on the pavement
Bang, fade to black

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Benny The Butcher]
What it do, Loc? Yeah
We up in this motherfucker
On some murder murder, kill kill shit (Uh)
Yeah, some real hip-hop shit

[Verse 1: Potter Payper]
With so much drama in these London streets
It's kinda hard like a G for me to stay free, but I
Somehow, someway, stop myself from killing motherfuckers like every single day
Murder music, lucky I ain't bring my Gucci flow
A'ight, who's involved? I leave that pussy pookie low
Suits and coats, I show you all the do's and don'ts
Weed smoke, gun smoke, but it's usually both
Being broke on fake love, I'm immune to both
Now I kill verses and keep features as mementos
I stay down tеn-toes and ran this shit up tenfold
I'ma bring my knife, and that's rеgardless of the dress-code
I make sure they come to Death Row
Call that beef, they let go, it's enough to make the dead roll
Spinnin' in their graves Potter 

[?] got H, but it's all peanut butter 

[?]
They ain't meetin' deadlines, probably need a couple days
I need a couple million off the back, cah I came up sellin' crack
Now I got paper on my name

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Benny The Butcher]
Murder music, mur-murder music
Murder music, murder music
Yeah, murder music (The Butcher comin', nigga)
(Uncle Snoop)Murder music, mur-murder music (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Benny The Butcher]

Cheia de vontade a nível safári
Aproveita, baby, é só nota que voa
Pique, eu sou caro, então não me compare-pare

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg, ProHoeZak]
Break bread or fake dead and kill it back
All greens, by all means, we into that
Front, back, run it up, now run it back
For a repost, cuz, I need a hundred racks
Top dollar, hip-hop, the Impala
No bark, all bite, Rottweiler
Test him out, stressed him out, no
Popped him out and stretched him out, oh
(Get it good now)
Time keeps slippin'
These bitches in my DM but I can't pay attention
They wishin' and itchin', a message to you bitches
If you really wanna shine, get up off that timeline
TikTokin' with no money in your pocket
On the 'Gram all day, girl, stop it
I'm tryna get you some game, you lame
You bitches love doin' somethin' strange for a little change

Na-na-na-na-na-na, I fucked your baby mama
(What up, though?)
Nevermind that, find that correct angle
He's a square—bitch, I'm a rectangle
Don't be a stranger to danger, my anger ranges
Filter to filter, your face is changin'
As strange as it is
I keep makin', you keep shakin'
(Get it good now)
Rollin' through, you're scrollin' through your phone
Thirsty trap, you thirsty rat, you're wrong
First to clap, I snatch your purse and gone
Knick knack patty wack, take that bitch home
The way that she dance, I'm gon' take that bitch home
Show her my zone then I make that bitch moan
This how we dance when we hear this song
Don't take your phone, you won't be here that long

[Post-Chorus: MC Zaac]
Vai parecer cassino hoje nossa party
Cheia de vontade a nível safári
Aproveita, baby, é só nota que voa
Pique, eu sou caro, então não me compare-pare

[Outro: Snoop Dogg, ProHoeZak]
Make that money, don't let it make you
If you hustle like Dogg and you get it times two
Def Jam Records, nigga, thought you knew
Make that money, don't let it make you
If you hustle like Dogg and you get it times two
Def Jam Records, nigga, thought you knew

Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

There's something that I want to say
But I feel like I don't know how
Still I just can't hold it one more day
So I think I let it out

You're on my mind more than I may sure
You're in my heart more than you may know
And the last thing that I want
Is for you to fall apart
The future will be clearer
I want you to remember

In each tear
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Make you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)
In each tear (each tear)
Brings you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be
We can't change the things
That we done that's in the past
But fighting won't get us anyway
So if you want, here's my hand
Every night there is one thing I do
I bow my head and I pray for you (pray for you)
And the last thing that I want
Is for you to fall apart
The future will get clearer
I want you to remember

In each tear
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger)
In each tear (each tear)
Bring you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

Your much more than a struggle that you go through
You're not defined by your pain, so let it go
You're not a victim, your more like a winner
And you're not in defeat, you're more like a queen

In each tear
There's a lesson
Makes you wiser than before
Makes you stronger than you know (stronger than you know)
In each tear (in each tear)
Bring you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be
In each tear (each tear)
There's a lesson, (there's a lesson)
Makes you wiser than before (wiser)
Makes you stronger than you know
In each tear (make you so much broke)
Brings you closer to your dreams
No mistake, no heartbreak
Can take away what your meant to be

No no we can't be held out
No no oh no I I I can't be held out
You you you can't be held out
We we we can't be held out
Love
It makes you so much stronger (stronger)
It makes you so much wiser (wiser)
In each tear (in each tear)
And you so close to your dreams and
No mistake, no heartbreak can take away what you're meant to
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

And you so close to your dreams and
No mistake, no heartbreak can take away what you're meant to
Doesn't take much to make me happy and to make me smile with glee
Never, never will I feel discouraged 'cause our love's no mystery
Demonstrating the love and affection that you give so openly, yeah
I love the way you make me feel about you, baby
Want the whole, wide world to see

Oh, oh, you've got the best of my love
Oh, oh, you've got the best of my love
Oh, oh, you've got the best of my love
Oh, oh, you've got the best of my love

Goin' in and out of changes
Kind that comes around each day
My life has a better meaning
Love has kissed me in a beautiful way
Oh yeah, my love, my love
Oh yeah, my love, my love, ooh

Oh, you got the best of my love
Oh, oh, you've got the best of my love
Oh, oh, you've got the best of my love
Oh, oh, you've got the best of my love
Demonstrating sweet love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
The way I feel about you, baby, can't explain it
Want the whole wide world to see
Oh yeah, my love, my love
Oh yeah, my love, my love, ooh

Oh, oh, oh, you got the best of my love
Oh, oh, you've got the best of my love
Oh, oh, you've got the best of my love

Oh, oh, you've got the best of my love
Oh, oh, you've got the best of my love
Oh, oh, you've got the best of my love
Oh, oh, you've got the best of my love

[Verse 1]
Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt her figure before

[Verse 2]
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh

[Chorus]
You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

[Verse 3]
Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

[Bridge]
There's no way I could describe him
What I've said is just what I'm hoping for

[Chorus]
But I will find him sitting on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life

[Verse 1]
Found myself today singin' out loud your name
You said I'm crazy, if I am, I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sittin' in the dark, wishin' you were here
Turns me crazy, but it's you who makes me lose my head

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and
Turn me into a crumblin' fool

[Chorus]
Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Verse 2]
Lately with this state I'm in, I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over, sеnd me spinning closer to you
My, oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips mе down bare and gets me into my favourite mood

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

[Chorus]
Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me, boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Verse 1]
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

[Verse 2]
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

[Bridge 1]
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

[Verse 3]
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenuе
Know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my lovе

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge 2]
The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

[Verse 4]
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love

[Verse 1]
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?"
"Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering"

[Chorus]
'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
'Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

[Verse 2]
I like it in the city
Whеn the air is so thick and opaque
I love it to see еverybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

[Refrain]
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

[Chorus]
'Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
'Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met, yeah

[Outro]
Doo-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah, yeah
Doo-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah, yeah
Doo-doo-doo-doo ooh-ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah-ey
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world
Yeah, of my world
Of my world, yeah

[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remembеr you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but somеtimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Bridge]
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

[Breakdown]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 1]
Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

[Chorus]
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

[Verse 2]
Under haunted skies, I see you, ooh
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

[Chorus]
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Turning tables

[Bridge]
Next time, I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
When the thunder calls for me
Next time, I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
Standing on my own two feet

[Chorus]
I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

[Outro]
Turning tables, yeah
Turn, no, no-oh, mmm

[Verse 1]
When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

[Chorus]
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Verse 2]
When was the last time that you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

[Chorus]
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Bridge]
Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

[Chorus]
Why don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

[Outro]
When will I see you again?

[Intro]
Hey no, no, oh, oh-oh
Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
Ain't nobody gonna love you better, boy, than I am
Than I am

[Verse 1]
When you're out at night and you're in the streets
And you have time to yourself
Think of all the love that you get from me
That you can't find nowhere else
When you're far away and I'm not around
And temptation fills your heart
Think of all the ways that I'm faithful, babe
But to replace me would be hard
Cause ain't nobody

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody gonna treat you better (No, nobody)
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better (Nobody)
Ain't nobody gonna love you bettеr (No)
Boy, than I am, than I am (Nobody, nobody)
Than I am (Nobody, nobody)

[Verse 2]
You can try to act single if you wanna (Wanna)
You can go ahead and minglе if you wanna (Wanna)
You can even behave like you don't care
But you know (But you know)
Like I know (Like I know)
That you ain't that foolish
Who you foolin'?
You won't ruin what's been here all along
You ain't movin' from what you've got at home

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody gonna treat you better (Yeah)
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better (Ain't nobody gonna touch you)
Ain't nobody gonna love you better (Oh)
Boy, than I am, than I am (Nobody, nobody)
Than I am (Nobody, nobody)
Than I am (Nobody, nobody) (Nobody's gonna touch you)
Ohh, nobody's gonna treat you as good as I am

[Bridge]
I just want you to know
Baby, I love you so
There is no need to go lookin' for nothing more
'Cause I've got everything you'll ever need right here
But if you feel that you need to leave
Just know!

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better (Ain't nobody)
Ain't nobody gonna love you better
Boy, than I am, than I am
Ain't nobody gonna treat you better
Ain't nobody gonna touch you better
Ain't nobody gonna love you better
Boy, than I am, than I am (Nobody, nobody)
Than I am (Nobody, nobody)
Than I am (Nobody, nobody)
Oh, nobody's gonna treat you as good as I am (Nobody, nobody)
Than I am (Nobody, nobody)
Than I am (Nobody, nobody)
Oh, nobody's gonna treat you as good as I am
As I am
As I am
As I am
Nobody's gonna treat you as good as I am

[Verse 1]
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some loving here today, yeah

[Verse 2]
Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some loving here today, oh

[Chorus]
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me so you can see
Oh, what's going on
What's going on
Yeah, what's going on
Oh, what's going on

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are thеy to judge us
Simply 'cause our hair is long?
Oh, you know we'vе got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Picket lines (Brother) and picket signs (Brother)
Don't punish me (Brother) with brutality (Brother)
Come on, talk to me (Brother), so you can see (Brother)
Oh, what's going on (What's going on)
Yeah, what's going on (What's going on)
Tell me what's going on (What's going on)
I'll tell you what's going on (What's going on)

One at a time, baby
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)

I can't even buy you flowers
But together we can be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me, girl

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

[Chorus: Keri Hilson, Timbaland, Both]
Baby, if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just thе way you are
I'm about to strip and I'm well equippеd

I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I ain't got no Visa

We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me, girl

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch, my love is free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

[Chorus: Keri Hilson, Timbaland, Both]
Baby, if you strip, you can get a tip

'Cause I like you just the way you are

[Verse 3: John Doe/D.O.E]
Yeah, baby girl

So listen baby girl
Once you get a dose of D.O.E., you gon' want some mo'
So listen baby girl
When I make it, I want you there, want you there, yeah

[Intro]
Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place
Near you

[Verse 1]
So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart
In pieces

[Chorus]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the dark
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star

[Verse 2]
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star

[Chorus]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the dark
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star

[Verse 2]
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star

[Verse 1]
I'm more than just an option (Hey, hey, hey)
Refuse to be forgotten (Hey, hey, hey)
And took a chance of my heart (Hey, hey, hey)
And I feel it taking over

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 2]
I'm more than just a number (Hey, hey, hey)
Ah-no-no another (Hey, hey, hey)
So every single summer (Hey, hey, hey)
I'll be the one that you'll remember

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Verse 3]
More than just a number (Hey, hey, hey)
You hear, but you don't listen (Hey, hey, hey)
You better pay attention (Hey, hey, hey)
Come get what you've been missing

[Chorus]
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Bridge]
Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting
Give all I have to you

[Chorus]
I better find your loving
I better find your heart
I better find your loving
(I better find your loving)
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna—
I better find your loving
I better find your heart
I better find your loving

[Outro]
I bet if I give all my love, all my love
If I give all my love, all my love
If I give all my love, all my— all my love
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
Not the mistakes I made to tear us apart
Nothing nobody could say could tear us apart
I know if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

(Da, dun-dun-do)
(Hee!)

[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on thе floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told mе be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[Verse 2]
For forty days and forty nights
I was in the right
And she don't know what would go on
All of the time
Who would danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Do think twice! (Yeah)
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Do a dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People always told me to be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
And

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[Break]
Hee! Hoo!

[Chorus]
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(You know what you did to me)
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

[Outro]
She says I am the one
You know what you did
She said she is my son
She's says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (You know what you did babe)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a)
Billie Jean is not my lover (Cunning Billie Jean, girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She's not at the scene)

Billie Jean is
Billie Jean is
Billie Jean is
(Oh) Oh darlin'
Just wastin' my time now
Oh yeah (Oh babe)
(Ooh) Oooh
Just wastin' my time now
(Babe) Oh babe
(Oh) Oh
(Darlin') Oh babe
Not my lover
Not my lover
Not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a)
Billie Jean is
Billie Jean is
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is (Ooh!)
Billie Jean is (Ooh!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is
Billie Jean is
(Oh, darling)
(Oh, baby)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is
Here's another animal song--about a man animal.

I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
(Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more)
No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
(Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more)
Well, I wake in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin’ me insane
It’s a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
(Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more)

I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more
(Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more)
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more
(Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more)
Well, he hands you a nickel
He hands you a dime
Asks you with a grin
If you’re havin’ a good time
Fines you every time you slam the door
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s brother no more
(Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more)
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
(Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more)
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
(Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more)
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
Ah, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s pa no more
(Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more)

I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
(Ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more)
No, I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
(Ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more)
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
Everybody tells me
She’s the brains behind pa
Sixty-eight, but she says she’s twenty-four
I ain’t gonna work for Maggie’s ma no more
(Ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more)

I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
(Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more)
No, I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
(Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more)
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
Sing while you slave--I get bored
I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s farm no more
(Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Ain't gonna--ain't gonna--ain't gonna--)
Well I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Sometimes I feel so low-down and disgusted
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions
Are they lost or are they found?
Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
All their earthly principles they're going to have to abandon?
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

I had a woman down in Alabama
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic
She said, “Boy, without a doubt
Have to quit your mess and straighten out
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic”
There’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend

All that foreign oil controlling American soil
Look around you, it’s just bound to make you embarrassed
Sheiks walkin' around like kings
Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings
Deciding America’s future from Amsterdam and to Paris
And there’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend
Man’s ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they don’t apply no more
You can’t rely no more to be standin’ around waitin'
In the home of the brave
Jefferson turnin’ over in his grave
Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan
And there’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend

People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting
Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it
They say lose your inhibitions
Follow your own ambitions
They talk about a life of brotherly love show me someone who knows how to live it
There’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend

Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talkin’ boy she could destroy
A real suicide case, but there was nothin’ I could do to stop it
I don’t care about economy
I don’t care about astronomy
But it sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets
There’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend

Up around the bend!

And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend
We need a shake and therefore demand more than the cold conclusion of reason
The only impossible thing is to delimit the impossible

The realm of necessity (to restore the confidence)
Is the triumph of human spirit (triumph of the will)

Everything remains to be done
To devastate the ideas of family, famine and religion

Do do do do do do do do do do, do do do do do

We need a shake and therefore demand more than the cold conclusion of reason
The only impossible thing is to delimit the impossible

The realm of necessity (to restore the confidence)
Is the triumph of human spirit (triumph of the will)

Everything remains to be done
To devastate the ideas of family, famine and religion

Do do do do do do do do do do, do do do do do
Don’t need a shot of heroin to kill my disease
Don’t need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees
Don’t need a shot of codeine to help me to repent
Don’t need a shot of whiskey, help me be president

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it’s makin’ me feel afraid
What I got ain’t painful, it’s just bound to kill me dead
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

I don’t need no alibi when I’m spending time with you
I’ve heard all of them rumors and you have heard ’em too
Don’t show me no movin' films or give me no book to read
It don’t satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
Why would I want to take your life?
You’ve only murdered my father, raped his wife
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

Don’t wanna be with nobody tonight
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain’t right
There’s a man that hates me and he’s swift, smooth and near
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he’s here?

I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Don’t even feel like crossing the street and my car ain’t actin’ right
Called home and everybody seemed to have moved away
My conscience is beginning to bother me today

Shot of love, I need a shot of love

Shot of love, if you're a doctor I need a shot of love

Shot of love, I need a shot of love

Shot of love, I need a shot of love
They're rioting in Africa
They're starving in Spain
They're hurricanes in Cuba
And China needs rain

The whole world is festering with unhappy souls
The French hate the Germans, the Germans hate the Poles
The Yugoslavs hate Yugoslavs, South Africans hate the Dutch
And I don't like Governor Wallace very much

But you can be tranquil and thankful and proud
For man's been endowed with a mushroom-shaped cloud
Au revoir monsieur president de Gaulle

I tell you to sign the treaty sweetie
And we know for certain that some lovely day
Someone will set the spark off
And we shall all be blown away

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
So many things going on, so much shhh going on
So much boundness in this world
Can only makes us stronger, only strictly wirl
Questioning if you wanna bring your boy or girl
I'd rather, throw my hands up to sky
Before think in blame you or I
This atitude, I walking in the storm lane
Closing the weather, is so much shame

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder]
If i'm caught at a dance party without my dancing shoes
And everybody dances on my bare feet, shame on me
If I'm minding my business just doing the right thing
And you try to front me off in the street, shame on you
If a family's waiting for that special blessing to come their way
But they ain't trying to get on their knees and pray, shame on them
And if we live in a time where еvery nation's fighting around the world
Yet wе can't all agree that peace is the way, shame on us

[Chorus]
Shame on me (Shame, shame)
Shame on you (Shame, shame)
Shame on them (Shame, shame)
Shame on us (Shame, shame, shame, shame)
Shame on me (Shame)
Shame on you (Shame)
Shame on them (Shame)
Shame on us (Shame)
So what the fuss?!

[Bridge: Q-Tip]
Uh, uh, uh, what, what the fuss?
Uh, uh, uh, if they have shame on us?

[Verse 3: Stevie Wonder]
If i gotta get up early in the morning for a job interview
And I forget to set the stupid alarm, shame on me
If my children are playing outside like little children do
And you come around there trying to bring them some harm, shame on you
Should I be driving thru a klantown, find a restaurant to get me some food
And someone says "hey boy, we don't serve your kind", shame on them
And if we live in a democracy and you don't use your power to vote
Knowing some would like to turn back the hands of time, shame on us

[Chorus]
Shame on me (Shame, shame)
Shame on you (Shame, shame)
Shame on them (Shame, shame)
Shame on us (Shame, shame, shame, shame)
Shame on me (Shame)
Shame on you (Shame)
Shame on them (Shame)
Shame on us (Shame)
So what the fuss?!

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Somebody can hold my hand and show me which way to go? (What the fuss?!)
Is shame on them (Fuss?!)
Somebody can understand that no means to do (What the fuss?!)
Is shame on him, c'mon (So what the fuss?!)
If I can't understand myself and realize my goals
Is shame on me
If we can't prepare ourselves for all the world roughs
Is shame on we, uh, uh, uh
And what the fuss? Uh, uh, uh
Is been shame on us

[Chorus]
Shame on me (Shame, shame)
Shame on you (Shame, shame)
Shame on them (Shame, shame)
Shame on us (Shame, shame, shame, shame)

Shame on me (Shame)
Shame on you (Shame)
Shame on them (Shame)
Shame on us (Shame)
So what the fuss?!

[Ending]
Shame on me...
Shame on you...
Sometimes
It's pouring rain
Houselights are out
I need you to follow my direction
Yeah, follow me
I'm fallin' out
Lock and load me, hold my hand

If we go high
We can skydive
Up in the sky
Only rely
On you and I
Whoa, yeah
If we go high
We can skydive
Up in the sky
Only rely
On you and I
Whoa, yeah
If we fall down
If we fall down
If we fall down
Gotta get up
Gotta get up
Gotta get up

If we fall down
If we fall down
If we fall down
Gotta get up
Gotta get up
Gotta get up

If we could fly
If we could fly

Hold up
I can see the plan now
Life has come to right now
Ooh, child
I know we could make it last forever
Keep trying
We giants
Lock and load me, hold my hand
If we go high
We can skydive
Up in the sky
Only rely
On you and I
Whoa, yeah

If we fall down
If we fall down
If we fall down
Gotta get up
Gotta get up
Gotta get up

If we fall down
(If we could fly)
If we fall down
Gotta get up
(If we could fly) Gotta get up
Gotta get up

If we fall down
If we hold on
If we fall down
If we hold on

Don't call pretty Peggy, she can't hear you no more
Don't leave no message around her back door
They say the old laughing lady been here before
She don't keep time, she don't count score

[Verse 2]
You can't have a cupboard if there ain't no wall
You got to move, there's no time left for you to stall
They say the old laughing lady dropped by to call
And when she leaves, she leaves nothing at all

[Verse 3]
See the drunkard of the village falling on the street
He can't tell his ankles from the rest of his feet
He loves his old laughing lady 'cause her taste is so sweet
But his laughing lady's loving ain't the kind he can keep
No, his laughing lady's loving ain't the kind that he can keep

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 4]
There's a fever on the freeway, it blacks out the night
And there's a slippin' on the stairway just don't feel right
And there's a rumblin' in the bedroom and a flashing of light
There's the old laughing lady, everything is all right
There's the old laughing lady, everything is all right

[Outro]
Oh guilty train, don't whistle my way again
Guilty train, don't whistle my way again

[Verse 1]
Uh oh, uh oh
Every night I go
Every night I go sneaking out the door
I lie a little more, baby, I'm helpless
There's something 'bout the night
And the way it hides all the things I like
Little black butterflies
Deep inside me

[Chorus]
What would my mama do
(Uh oh, uh oh)
If she knew 'bout me and you?
(Uh oh, uh oh)
What would my daddy say
(Uh oh, uh oh)
If he saw me hurt this way?
(Uh oh, uh oh)
(Uh oh, uh oh)

[Verse 2]
Why should I feel ashamed?
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name
Here we are again
It's nearly perfect

[Chorus]
What would my mama do
(Uh oh, uh oh)
If she knew 'bout me and you?
(Uh oh, uh oh)
What would my daddy say
(Uh oh, uh oh)
If he saw me hurt this way?
(Uh oh, uh oh)

[Bridge]
What would my mama do?
What would my daddy say?
All the things a girl should know
Are the things she can't control
All the things a girl should know
She can't control

[Chorus]
What would my mama do
(Uh oh, uh oh)
If she knew 'bout me and you?
(Uh oh, uh oh)
What would my daddy say
(Uh oh, uh oh)
If he saw me hurt this way?
(Uh oh, uh oh)
I think I heard him say when he was struggling up the hill
I think I heard him say, Take My Mother Home
Then I'll die easy, Take My Mother Home
I’ll die so easy, Take My Mother Home

I think I heard him say, when they was raffling off his clothes
I think I heard him say, Take My Mother Home
I think I heard him cry when they was nailing in the nails
I think I heard him cry, Take My Mother Home

I'll die this death on Calvary, ain't gonna die no more
I’ll die on Calvary, ain't gonna die no more
Ain't gonna die no more

I think I heard him say, when he was giving up the ghost
I think I heard him say, please, Take My Mother Home
Please, Take My Mother Home

[Intro: Kanye West & Stalone]
See this in 3D
'Fore life start for me
’Fore life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me

[Chorus: Kanye West & Stalone]
Eighty degrees
Warmin' up for me
Finally free
I did know, Indeed
And I run out, to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey I won't sh - ow
I can float on the water
Father, hold me close
Don’t let me down
I know you won't

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Malik Yusef]
I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave
Like we ain't had all the hood rats in Mud Rats
I gave my heart to the game, where the love at?
Nobody gon' ruin me
I just callеd my wife up, let's get Hoovеr free
I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my mama crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that's how a soldier feels
All that killin' over, that’s just overkill
Yeezy back in the Chi’, this that Oprah feel

[Chorus: Kanye West & Stalone]
Eighty degrees
Warmin' up for me
Finally free
I did know, indeed
And I run out, to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey, I won’t show
I can float on the water
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Yeah
Walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin’ 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry nigga from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior came with sheepskin
Still remember when I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
She just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah

[Outro: KayCyy]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I know you won't (I know you won't)
I know you won't, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know you won't
I know that you look over us
So we sleep sound asleep
Rain down rain (Mmm, mmm, mmm)
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your little friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this badly
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that's just embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me feel so sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

[Outro]
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Why can't you leave me alone, yeah

[Chorus]
All Day I Dream about
All Day I Dream About Cash

[Verse 1 Snoop Dogg]
Well if i Gotta jack a N*gga then i guess thats what it is

[Intro: Rebecca Black]
We'll ride into the night
Say my name a thousand times
Wish you could read my mind

[Verse 1: Rebecca Black]
It's like I love to waste my time
Know I've got better things to do
I can see our crooked line (Crooked line)
But I just wanna be with you
Driving past the blurry lights
What do I have to lose?
Don't wanna stop to read the signs
Don't wanna know what they're telling you

[Chorus: Rebecca Black]
We'll ride into the night
Say my name a thousand times
Wish you could read my mind
We'll ride into the night
Your hand upon my thigh
Wish you could read my mind

[Verse 2: Slayyyter]
We could ride any way you like
Pick me up late, hold my hand tight
Images in my mind
Eyеs so bright like your headlights
Do you feel the samе?
We could have it made
Feel it in my veins
Baby, are you into me?

[Chorus: Slayyyter]
We'll ride into the night
Say my name a thousand times
Wish you could read my mind (Wish you could read my mind)
We'll ride into the night
Your hand upon my thigh
Wish you could read my mind

[Bridge: Rebecca Black & Slayyyter]
(We could ride into the night
Say my name a thousand times, oh-oh)
I know we should be asleep
But you got me feeling like we're in a dream
Pick me up and pick up the speed
Put my head out the window to feel the breeze, yeah
You'll always be a part of me (Yeah)
You'll always be a part of me, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Rebecca Black]
We'll ride into the night
Say my name a thousand times
Wish you could read my mind
We'll ride into the night
Your hand upon my thigh
Wish you could read my mind
We'll ride into the night
Say my name a thousand times
Wish you could read my mind

[Outro: Rebecca Black]
We'll ride into the night
Your hand upon my thigh
Wish you could read my mind
Say my name a thousand times
Say my name a thousand times
Engineer: We got a good sound here. Dime store, take one.

My love she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn’t have to say she’s faithful
Yet she’s true, like ice, like fire
People carry roses
And make promises by the hours
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can’t buy her

In the dimе stores and bus stations
People spеak of situations
Read books, and quote quotations
Write--

Bob: Wait. Start it again. I'll do this one more time. If I can't do it, we'll do another song

Engineer: Ok. Rolling two--

Bob: Do any song, as good as I can do it the first time.

Listen you're in a privileged position to learn a thing or two
Keep your mouth shut and your ears open
Chuuch!

[Verse 1]
Yo, the club is mine the second I walk in
Try not to stare, can't believe it's him
Raise up your hands, can't hold it back
I can't get enough of me, hooked like that
If you think you're good enough, trust you ain't
My head ain't turned by moves that fake
Center of the club, don't make me wait
I'm here for the night, I'ma run this place

[Pre-Chorus]
Wake up, this party's popping
Ain't no sleepin' when the bass is knocking
I didn't come here to watch the action
You better hold on, 'cause I ain't actin'
Pop off the cork and pump the bottle
Jump up on thе tables, and go full throttle
Throw up your arms and whip your head back
I wanna hеar everybody go crazy

[Chorus]
Nobody in the club can resist this
Gonna be impossible to miss it
We ain't got tomorrow for forgiveness
It's a good thing that we're fearless

[Verse 2]
Yo, the night's on the edge now
One more move
Got another round of drinks
So lean, so smooth
The girls try to hookup, hey, don't fight
I ain't goin' home, got a big appetite

[Pre-Chorus]
Wake up, this party's popping
Ain't no sleepin' when the bass is knocking
I didn't come here to watch the action
You better hold on, 'cause I ain't actin'
Pop off the cork and pump the bottle
Jump up on the tables, and go full throttle
Throw up your arms and whip your head back
I wanna hear everybody go crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy)

[Chorus]
Nobody in the club can resist this
Gonna be impossible to miss it
We ain't got tomorrow for forgiveness
It's a good thing that we're fearless
Nobody in the club can resist this
Gonna be impossible to miss it
We ain't got tomorrow for forgiveness
It's a good thing that we're fearless

[Chorus]
They just want that fast bread
I was out there double dutchin' on my last leg
I'ma always roll the dice, just how my pride is
Stuck inside my mind, don't know what's going on inside it
You say that pressure rise, how come all I hear is silence?
Gettin' high and asking God how he can guide this shit
I'm too consistent with the vibe how I provide that—
So if you let me come alive, wait, alright, that's it

[Verse 1]
Careful what you aimin' for, Lord, this what you made me for
Mental suite got crazy floors, welcome to my great indoors
Ported me a baby piece so lately I'vе been cravin' more
Praying for a peace of mind, that's probably why I'm spacin' morе
All my worries less earthy, I ain't bound to that shit
But my chest is so full of pride, I'll probably drown in that shit
But even when it's ugly I just dive in the trenches
Low and highs ain't had me feelin' this alive in a minute

[Chorus]
They just want that fast bread
I was out there double dutchin' on my last leg
I'ma always roll the dice, just how my pride is
Stuck inside my mind, don't know what's going on inside it
You say that pressure rise, how come all I hear is silence?
Gettin' high and asking God how he can guide this shit
I'm too consistent with the vibe how I provide that—
So if you let me come alive, wait, alright, that's it

[Verse 2]
I'm unfamiliar with your kindness and indifference
My spider sense's tinglin' and my trigger finger itchin'
The second I get tired, you be sleeping with the—
I tried to forewarn you, nice speakin' with you
You ain't a real **** unless your team ain't with you
If they your real homies then you got 'em eatin' ****
I don't even need company, keep a blunt instead
'Cause it's really me versus the world inside my head and I ain't scared

[Chorus]
They just want that fast bread
I was out there double dutchin' on my last leg
I'ma always roll the dice, just how my pride is
Stuck inside my mind, don't know what's going on inside it
You say that pressure rise, how come all I hear is silence?
Gettin' high and asking God how he can guide this shit
I'm too consistent with the vibe how I provide that—
So if you let me come alive, wait, alright, that's it

[Outro]
(Alright, that shit should work, put some of that shit in there)

[Verse 1]
Guess I've been used to being used like this
Ain't no difference
I'm immortalized in my thoughts
Praise to the most
I put protection over my most prized possessions
Talkin' bout my sanity at a 6.7
Handing out poinsettias
To my dead homie's mothers
Praying they feel better
Might get chipped
Minding my business
Might get chipped sharing my vision
Might as well
Can't tell
If it's even worth
Conversation
Need a prayer
Do it even work
All that's for real is forever
Moments stolen taste better

[Verse]

To go it along, believe me
Put your arms around me

[Verse 1]
And we'll go there, and in you I do believe
So many rows not to climb, got so many roses and sounds
Got so many roses the time for me and for on the row is your time
Got so many rows, that's alright
Hoping for a sign in life
For me, ooh, ooh, you said

[Chorus]
"Forever, whatever we're meant to together"

And not so, so easy
Going along believe me
For the stars beneath set free
So we'll go there, on your arms you carry me

No soul probably 'cause I put my soul in this shit
Together I'm holding your attention cause you're holding your dick
Its's like a boner overdosage when I go to events
So ladies and gents i can see how crazy it gets when you try to turn
The tables but the tables is bent
It's kinda hard to be yourself when you need label consent
Fuck the shoulda, coulda, woulda either do or you don't
Be true to the bone 

[?] shooter to dome
Now who in the zone using your 

[?] flow

[Intro]
I'm just standin' here, lookin' at the man in the mirror
You good? Ahah, nigga, I'm great
Ayy, nigga, talk your shit, Doc Dre

[Verse]
Yeah, I see the way the game played
Nigga like me put the hood on that walk of fame
Fingerprints of Eazy-E still stain the brain
Gang-bang relationships, no need to name names
Black Mamba mentality, shit, it's time to ball (Yeah)
All my niggas on the yacht with me, Amistad (Yeah)
Custom made hip-hop, nigga, watch the roof, cuh
It's a hard pill to swallow, baby, Juice WRLD (Big shot)
Big shot, big shot, now who the killer?
Sendin' pirates to your block, boy, Captain Phillips (Brrat)
Got L.A on my back, boy, it takes a village
We deserve to be on top, boy, black privilege (Uh)
Saint Tropеz fuck up the whole day
Ice Cubе sittin' by the Doc, O'Shea (Heheh)
C-notes under the couch with the old face
Shit, I'm headin' to Puffy's house, a million dollars a plate (Blah)
Comin' in, Airforce, Uncle Sam
Quit worryin' about the other man
Pay taxes in rubber bands
Last night, in a chess game
Nigga walked away with a hundred grand
Pussy poppin', billin' shit, killin' shit, Son of Sam
Multi-billion dollar check on you fuckboys
Livin' life, Fisher Price, I got enough toys
My legacy is undefeated, call that bitch Floyd
I gave my blood to this shit, you welcome, enjoy
Gang money, J money
Yeah, we got plate money
I don't know what's on the way for me
Give a fuck, I stay hungry
No better feelin' in the world than that-
Brinks truck when it's pullin' in
Hit the box like clockwork, y'all talk work, we put it in
What the fuck? (Woo)

Lyrics from Snippets

[Intro: Kanye West]
I been waiting
For a minute
Pour out, ayy
Pour out, everyday, you know

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me
I wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
All my dawgs want it, I ain't done yet
Rollin', rollin', rollin' 'til the sun set
The feeling's way to numb just to calm, yeah
Nah—nah, nah, nah—nah, nah, woah

[Verse: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothin' crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Goddamnit, got me off my Lexapro
Bringing up the last time in Mexico
Could you call me last time I set the code?
Like, uh, four times, "Don't text me, ho"
Told you four times, "Don't test me, ho"
Okay, yeah, I know it's unacceptable
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
'Specially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called "check-a-ho"
Yeah, I'ma have the laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called "check-a-ho," ah

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me
I wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me

[Outro: Kanye West]
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
By this time back in Trinidad
They're making arrangements for the fact to start
And what's the big occasion
That's causing such a jubilation

Well it's Carnival, what else could it be
People line the roads up and down to see
Waiting for all the bands to pass
To jump in and play their mass

It's Carnival come join with me
Grab your partner and you'll feel free
Be merry and gay relax enjoy your stay
Have fun this Carnival day

Jump up to the rhythm and the rhyme
Shake your body in the line
It's Trinidad Carnival time

Oh I never seen so much a rum yet
And those bakes and biscuits I can't forget
Steel band boys bing bang their tune
People romancing undеr the moon
Well it's masqueradе all over the place
Like a convention of the human race
Day and night it's still going on
Well it's there my friends Calypso was born
If you ever take a vacation
There's a place that's quite a sensation
Yes we call it Trinidad
Lord it almost drove me mad

From the time I 'wake in the morning
I could tell a great day was dawning
Hear a vender in the street
Selling juicy things to eat

It was Mango, coconut, sugar cane
Lord me belly in pain
I said Mango, coconut, sugar cane
Driving me insane

In the market place I went walking
Everybody laughing and talking
Where you barging for a prize
And you wind up paying pies

When I shopped around for some punchy
Smеlling all the food I went hungry
Had a taste for somеthing sweet
So I stop awhile to eat
Walking down the beach really lazy
Women start to driving me crazy
So I jump into the sea
Thought that was the place to be

While I'm swimming round in the ocean
Saw a woman's body in motion
Then and there I make me plan
Took the woman by she hand

In the evening we went out dancing
Held her close and started romancing
Listen to the steel band play
Bing bong till the break of day

Drinking rum that night I got naughty
She said Harry not till we merry
Now I pass me life's complete
Every night I get the treat
I got a new way of spellin' Memphis Tennessee
I got a new way of spellin' Memphis Tennessee
I got a new way of spellin' Memphis Tennessee
With a blues, with a tears, with a double "S" and a double "E"

When I got up this morning Blues was walkin' 'round my bed
When I got up this morning blues was walkin' 'round my bed
When I got up this morning blues was walkin' 'round my bed
When I go to eat my breakfast blues was al l in my head

I had a woman she cried over me
I had a woman she cried over me
I had a woman she criеd over me
Therе's a whole heap of crocodile tears
Down in Memphis Tennessee

Down in the valley, valley so low
Down in the valley, valley so low
Down in the valley, valley so low
Hear that lonesome evenin' train's
Lonesome whistle blow
Well bye, bye, people bye bye
I wanna go, wanna go away from here
People bye, bye, yes people bye bye
If anybody hear my plea
Please bail me out of Memphis Tennessee
On top of old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
For a courting to slow

Yes courting's a pleasure
And parting is grief
And a false hearted lover
Is worse than a thief

She'll kiss you, she'll hug you
And tell you more lies
Than the cross ties on a railroad
Or the stars in the sky

Let me tell you 'bout my baby
She's like bad brandy wine
The first time I kissed her
She drove me out my mind

She's a Baltimore special
Got a fine brown frame
Whеn you see her in motion
Evil woman is her name
Did I tеll you 'bout the Eastman
Lord what a shame
He run off with my baby
And scandalized my name

Well I went up on a mountain top
To call my baby back
She was gone with that Eastman
Down that lonesome railroad track

If I ever see that Eastman
I'll shoot him with my gun
I'll cut him with my long Jones
And dare that pimp to run

Little Liza, little Liza
I couldn't sleep last night
Come on back home baby
Everything will be all right

Let me tell you, let me tell you
I don't care what you say
If my woman ever comes back
I'll give my life away

If you ever see a dark cloud
A-rollin' in the sky
It's my woman gone to heaven
With a tear drop in her eye
On top of old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
For a-courting to slow
Good mornin' Captain, good mornin' sun
Oh well it's good mornin' captain, good mornin' sun
Don't you need another muleskinner out on your new mule run
I like to work, I'm rollin' all the time
Oh well now I like to work, rollin' all the time
I can carve my initials on any old mule's behind

Hey there little water boy
Bring your bucket 'round
Oh well, It's hey there little water boy
Bring your bucket 'round
If you don't like your job
Better lay that bucket down

Workin' on the new road
Got a dollar and a dime a day
Oh well, I'm workin' on the new road
Dollar and a dime a day
I got sixteen women
Waitin' for to get my pay
A day in the life of a fool
A sad and a long lonely day
I walk the avenue
And hope I'll run into
The welcome sight of you
Coming my way

I stop just across from your door
But you're never home any more
So back to my room
And there in the gloom I cry
Tears of goodbye

Till you come back to me
That's the way it will be
Every day in the life of a fool
Listen to yo' daddy warn you
Fore you start a-traveling
Woman may born you, love you and mourn you
But a woman is a sometime thing
Yes a woman is a sometime thing

Yo' mammy is the first to name you
Then she'll tie you to her apron string
Then she'll shame you and she'll blame you
Till yo' woman comes to claim you
'Cause a woman is a sometime thing
Yes a woman is a sometime thing

Don't you never let a woman grieve you
Jus' cause she got yo' weddin' ring
She'll love you and deceive you
Then she'll take yo' clothes and leave you

'Cause a woman is a sometime thing
Yes a woman is a sometime thing
Yes a woman is a sometime thing
Yes a woman is a sometime thing
I got plenty of nothing
And nothing's plenty for me
I got no car, got no mule
I got no misery

Folks with plenty of nothing
They've got a lock on the door
Afraid somebody's going to rob 'em
While there out (a) making more - what for

I got no lock on the door - that's no way to be
They can steal the rug from the floor, that's OK with me
'Cause the things that I prize, like the stars in the skies, are all free

I got plenty of nothing
And nothing's plenty for me
I got my gal - got my song
(I) Got heaven the whole day long
Got my gal, got my love, got my song

Oh, I got plenty of nothing
And nothing's plenty for me
I got the sun, got thе moon
Got the deep blue sea
Thе folks with plenty of plenty
Got to pray all the day
Sure with plenty you sure got to worry
How to keep the devil away, away

I ain't frettin 'bout hell
'Till the time arrive
Never worry long as I'm well

Tol' my captain my hands was cold
Set down your hands boy, let the wheeling roll

I asked my captain to give me time
Damned old captain wouldn't pay me no mind

I raised my hand to wipe the sweat off my head
Captain got mad, Lord shot my buddy dead

He kept on walkin' up and down
Buddy laying there dead, Lord
On the burning ground

If I'd a had my weight and line
I'd a whipped that captain
Till he went stone blind

If you don't believe my buddy is dead
Just look at that hole in my buddy's head

The buzzard's circlin' round the sky
Oh that captain sure is bound to die
Sure is bound to die
Oh, there was a little drummer and he loved a one-eyed cook

With her one eye on the pot and the other up the chimney with a bow wow wow

And this couple went a courtin' for to walk along the shore
Said the drummer to the cookie "You're the girl that I adore"
With her one eye on thе pot and the other up the chimnеy with a bow wow wow
Fa la la la la dee dee bow wow wow

Said the drummer to the cookie "Will you name the wedding day?"
Said the cookie "We'll be married in the merry month of May"
With her one eye on the pot and the other up the chimney with a bow wow wow
Fa la la la la dee dee bow wow wow

Said the drummer to the cookie "Will you buy the wedding ring?"
Said the cookie "Now you're talkin' that would be the very thing"
With her one eye on the pot and the other up the chimney with a bow wow wow
Fa la la la la dee dee bow wow wow

When they went to church to say I will the drummer got a shock
For her one eye killed the parson and the other stopped the clock
With her one eye on the pot and the other up the chimney with a bow wow wow
Fa la la la la dee dee bow wow wow
Oh, soldier, soldier will you marry me
With your musket fife and drum?
Oh, how can I marry such a pretty girl as thee
When I got no shoes to put on

Off to the cobbler she did go as fast as she could run
Bought him a pair of the best that was there
And the soldier put them on

Oh, soldier, soldier will you marry me
With your musket fife and drum?
Oh, how can I marry such a pretty girl as thee

With your musket fifе and drum?
Oh, how can I marry such a pretty girl as thee

With your musket fife and drum?
Oh, how can I marry such a pretty girl as thee
With a wife and a baby at home

The more you hug and kiss the girl the quicker she will

Delia, Delia where have you been so long
Delia, Delia everything I had is gone
The trees have left the country side
Frost is on the ground
The birds all sing a different song
With a low and a lonesome sound
With a low and a lonesome sound

Delia, Delia where have you been so long
Delia, Delia everything I had is gone
If we could count the falling stars
As we have done before
Or share the sound of summer rain
I've never ask for more
No I've never ask for more

Who can tell where Delia's gone
Or why she went away
Or if she always knew
That she would break my heart one day
Would break my heart one day
Delia, Delia where have you been so long child
Delia, Delia everything I had is gone

Purple blue in the sunlight are the eyes of my Mary
Mo Mary, mo lennan, Mo Mary, my beloved
On the hillside, by thе sheiling, Mo Mary, my beloved

Once was a woman
Once was a dream
Once lived in heaven it seemed

Wondering oh wondering I lost it
Gone is the feeling I had
Gone is the woman and gone is the dream
Gone is the heaven that seemed

Gone is the other
Gone is the touch
Gone is the rapture of all
Wondering o wondering I lost it
All that once burned is now cold
Gone are the ones who deserved it
Gone is thе story once told

Gone is the feeling
Gonе is the time
Time of a rapture sublime
Wondering o wondering I lost it
How to recapture the time
Gone is the love and the place now
Gone are the things I believed
Gone is the love and the place now
Gone are the things I believed
The Winter has gone and the leaves turn green
The Winter has gone and the leaves turn green
Your innocent face, I wish I never had seen

Come o my love and fare you well
Come o my love and fare you well
You slighted me, but I wish you well
The rope was brought and the bow was swung
The rope was brought and the bow was swung
An innocent man you have all hung

Come o my love and see me die
Come o my love and see me die
Lift your innocent face, see me dance in the sky
Some touches earth like a lovers kiss
Sky and ocean are joint in bliss
All's well and nothing can be a miss
And I know that Eden was just like this

A woman a man that make happiness grow
Standing hand in hand
As it was in Eden your life's revealing
My heart is pleading for long ago

Lovers were meant to live heart to heart
Not created to be apart
From the very start it was planned for bliss
Back in Eden and Eden was just like this

Nobody fighting and no one kill
Everybody loving and always will
No strife no storm no animosity
Like paradise it will always be
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year

God rest ye merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day

To save us all from Satan’s power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy

O tidings of comfort and joy
Oh, bring us a glad tidings
Oh, bring us a Glad tidings
Oh, bring us a Glad tidings
For Child Christ is here

We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Glad tidings we bring
To you and your kin
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
A happy New Year

Wе wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
Wе wish you a Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a happy New Year

[The Joys of Christmas]

The first good joy that Christmas brings it is the joy of one
To see the star of Bethlehem that shone on Mary's Son
That shone on Mary's son good friends, that shone on Mary's Son
To see the star of Bethlehem, that shone on Mary's son

[O Little Town of Bethlehem]

O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep, the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years, are met in thee tonight

[The Joys of Christmas]
The next good joy that Christmas brings it is the joy of two
When carols ring on Christmas day, to tell the tale anew

To tell the tale anew, good friends, to tell the tale anew
When carols ring on Christmas day, to tell the tale anew

[Deck the Halls]

Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Tis the season to be jolly

Fa la la la la, la la la la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la, la la la, la la la

Troll the ancient Yule tide carol
Fa la la la la, la la la la

[The Joys of Christmas]

The next good joy that Christmas brings it is the joy of three
Of wise men coming with their gifts, the holy child to see
The holy child to see good friends, the holy child to see

Of wise men coming with their gifts, the holy child to see
The next good joy that Christmas brings it is the joy of four
Of shepherds keeping watch that night, beside the stable door
Of shepherds keeping watch that night, beside the stable door

[The First Noël]
The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields where they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep

On a cold winter's night, that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

[The Joys of Christmas]
The bravest joy that Christmas brings it is the joy of five
The message of good will to men for ever kept alive

For ever kept alive good friends, for ever kept alive
The message of good will to men for ever kept alive
Way down yonder in the middle of the field
Angel working at the chariot wheel
Not so particular 'bout working at the wheel
Just want to see how the chariot feels

Oh let me fly, oh let me fly
Let me fly to Mount Zion, Lord, Lord

Well I got a mother in the promised land
Ain't gonna stop till I shake her hand
Not so particular 'bout shaking her hand
Just wanna get to the promised land

Oh let me fly, oh let me fly
Let me fly to Mount Zion, Lord, Lord

I heard such a rumbling in the sky
I thought my Lord was passing by
It was the good old chariot drawing nigh
Oh well it shook the earth swept the sky
Oh let me fly, oh let me fly
Let me fly to Mount Zion, Lord, Lord
You gotta march down, march on down
You gotta march down to Jordan, hallelujah
You gotta march down, march on down
You gotta march down to Jordan, hallelujah

Where are you goin' my sisters?
Where are you goin' now?
Oh well we're goin' on down to the river Jordan
Gonna wash our sins away you gotta march down, march on down
You gotta march down to Jordan, hallelujah
You gotta march down, march on down
You gotta march down to Jordan, hallelujah

Have you heard of-a that city
They say it's built four square
He said he wanted you people
To meet him over there

You better march down, march on down
You gotta march down to Jordan, hallelujah
You gotta march down, march on down
You gotta march down to Jordan, hallelujah
Morningside
The old man died
And no one cried
They simply turned away

And when he died
He left a table made of nails and pride
And with his hands he carved these words inside
"For my children"

Morning light
Morning bright
I spent the night
With dreams that make you weep

Morning time
Wash away the sadness from these eyes of mine
For I recall the words an old man signed
"For my children"

And the legs were shaped with his hands
And the top made of oaken wood
And the children that sat around his great table
Touched it with their laughter
Ah and that was good
Morning side
An old man died
And no one cried
He surely died alone

And truth is sad
For not a children would claim the gift he had
The words he had carved
Became his epitaph
"For my children"

[Verse]
You shut me down, you locked me out
You do the things I hate about you
At the end, end of it all, I'm still here
You sit me down and you kick me out
It's like we go up just to go down
I say I'm out but then somehow, I'm still there

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe, it's the way
That you make everything okay
Yeah, you're the one that soothes my pain
But you get too into my bra-a-a-ain

[Chorus]
Yeah, I love you, but I hate me
Maybe you're one to change me
You're the one that can save me
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, oh
Yeah, I love you, but I hate me
Maybe you're one to change me
You're the one that can save me
I know, I know, I know, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe, it's the way
That you make everything okay
Yeah, you're the one that soothes my pain
But you get too into my bra-a-a-ain
Maybe, it's the way
That you make everything okay
Yeah, you're the one that soothes my pain
But you get too into my bra-a-a-ain
Wake up Jacob, day is a breaking
Wake up Jacob, day is a breaking

Now when I get to heaven gonna live at ease

This evening there is quite a program in store for you. What's with the Chad Mitchell trio, Odetta and there's Miriam Makeba and the Folk Singers. They're going to be here for quite a while and earlier today during the rehearsals we have decided that we have better put all of the most strenuous pieces up front. So that after we have keeled ovеr from exhaustion there would not bе any great effort needed for the end of the program. Consequently this next song we're about to do is the most difficult song that we have on the program this evening. Ah, we had a much larger choir to start with. There was some 40 members, but during the rehearsal period, so strenuous was this piece, most of the men had to take off because of laryngitis. Ah, enough said about that because if I talk too much
I won't have the energy to sing the song
A little lyric of great importance

I wish, I wish
I wish the rent, I wish the rent
Was heaven sent
Look over yonder hot sun turning over
Look over yonder hot sun turning over
And it won't go down Lord it won't go down

Did you ever hear the cuckoo bird a calling
Did you ever hear the cuckoo bird a calling
Sure sign of rain Lord, sure sign of rain

I've been a hammer since last December
I've been a hammer since last December
And I'm almost dead Lord, I'm almost dead

I've been a wondering if anybody wonders
I've been a wondering if anybody wonders
About poor me Lord, 'bout poor me

Look over yonder hot sun turning over
Look over yonder hot sun turning over
And it won't go down Lord it won't go down
I know where I'm going, and I know who's going with me
I know why love , and I know who I will marry
I need no robes of silk, nor shoes of fine green leather
As long as she is with me, when we stroll across the heather

Feather beds are soft and painted rooms are bonny
But I know she cleave them all, for her loving Winsom Johnny
All her wit and grace, like a starry cluster shine
Giving light and beauty to this simple soul of mine

I know where I'm going, and I know who's going with me
And I know why love and the Dear knows who I'll marry
I don't want no bald headed woman
She too mean, Lord, Lordy well she too mean
I don't want no bald headed woman
She too mean, Lord, Lordy well she too mean

I don't want no sugar in my coffee
Make me mean Lord, Lordy well it make me mean
I don't want no sugar in my coffee
Make me mean Lord, Lordy well it make me mean

I got a bulldog he weigh five hundred
In my back yard Lord, Lordy in my back yard
When he bark he call like thunder
In my back yard well, Lordy in my back yard

I don't want no cold iron shackles
'Round my legs, Lord, Lordy well a round my legs
I don't want no cold iron shacklеs
'Round my legs, Lord, Lordy well a round my legs

If you see my long hairеd woman
Better bow your head, Lord, Lordy well a bow your head
If you see my long haired woman
Better bow your head, Lord, Lordy well a bow your head

To satisfy my weary soul

Have you ever been down on that Mobil and K.C. line?
Have you ever been down on that Mobil and K.C. line?

Well I just want to ask you
If you seen that gal of mine
Don't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea
Don't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea
Don't my gal look good
When she's comin' after me?
Man it's sure hot in here tonight
Yeah, must be a hundred and twenty degrees in the shade
'Course you all don't have to stay in the shade you know
He Dallas, you know what the cook havin' for dinner?
He havin' a thousand things for dinner
Every day other beans. Beans well done, beans smothered in beans, beans medium rare and one other thing - beans
Don't leave them out. You got to put some beans in there
You know whеn I was a kid, I used to out into the pasture latе at night
Kicked the old cow and made her get up, so I could lay down on the warm grass where she'd been
Then I just lay there and wait for the 10.20 train to go by
And watch all them fine folks sittin' upon that train, everybody goin' somewhere
Maybe somebody waiting at the end o' line to say howdy
I tell you right then and there I said to myself, someday I'm gonna have me a ride on a train, and when I get where I'm goin' there'll be somebody waitin' there for me too
Well I got me a train ride alright, one way right in here, with a whole bunch of unfitting' people to be with. And when I got to the gate, there's somebody waitin'; old capt'n
And he didn't have the decency to say hello
Well I didn't intend to stay this long you know, but I wanna ain't gonna leave here 'til he says hello
He Billy Blue, you know how to cook opossum?
Don't everybody?
Not like my old lady
Man when my old lady cook opossum
The first day she diggin' in a bottle of scorn squeezings and juice it up a little while
The next day she put in a bottle of bourbon and juice that up a little while
Then she put in a bottle o' dandy lion wine and juice that up a little bit
Then the 'possum man sure was ,some good gravy
Oh Dowbally, what you figure your old lady's doin' in Memphis tonight?
Man one day I'm gonna put my footprint on top o' your head, I told you I don't play that
He look here you naked ape tell 'em I was only asking
Yeah I sure got hard luck bein' in here
Don't knock it man. If I didn't have hard luck I wouldn't have no luck at all
'Course it's true
Look at that new prisoner over there, he sure look lonely don' he?
That sure is a waste of time
Hey new prisoner don't look so lonely man
You just climb up in your bunk, you'll have more friends then you know what to do with and you be so busy scratching, you don't have time to get lonesome
Anybody ever figured a way to get out o' here?
Nobody would ever make it
I figured a way to get out o' here once
I figured the only way to get out o' here was to make friends with old Rattler
The lead hound?
Yeah that's him
So every morning for six months I sneaked out and gave old Rattler all my breakfast scraps
Six months, then I made my getaway
But man showin' up, they turned old Rattler, and showin' off he treat me and showin' off to capt'n brought me right back in here
Why you reckon old Rattler would have done that to you?
That dirty lousy old flea bitten, he got so used to them scraps, I guess he didn't wanna let 'em go
That's old Rattler. Sshh, there goes a guard
Man just listen to that rain
This is the only bunkhouse it rains inside and leaks outside
Last night I had a romance with a tongue tie lady
Who confess that she so love me
Last night I had a romance with a tongue tie lady
Who then confess that she so love me

She said: "Dear I'm all alone at home tonight
You can visit while me grandmother gone out of sight"
But later on when I want to hug and kiss
With the tie tongue language she saying this

It's twenty-five to twelve get up
Me grandmother coming 12 o clock
It's twenty-five to twelve get up
Mе grandmother coming 12 o clock

Well friends now lеt me tell you I'm a man of passion
When a pagan beauty catch me eye
This lovely flower bud she set me teeth a nascent
When I see her Lord I'm warm inside

But on the sofa I decide to sneak a small caress
Later on maybe try a little stupidness
She push me back, she start to break away
In the same tie tongue language again she say
It's 20 to twelve please get up
Me grandmother coming 12 o clock
25 to, no 20, 20 to twelve get up Harry

Well by this time I really was exasperated
What a manner of rejecting me
I tell you out of all the things the Lord created
De woman make the worse calamity

On the sofa again I tried to sneak a kiss
Later on to convince her of some greater bliss
Right away but in a voice not quite so strong
She start to sing she tie tongue song

A quarter to 12 Harry get up Harry
Me grandmother coming I tell you honey
A quarter to 12 Harry get up
Me grandmother coming 12 o clock

Now friends you know a man he should not be frustrated
When chasing some dilatability
But I know this problem never will be eliminated
Until I'm reaching my senility

By this time I can see that she is getting weak
Me blood pressure rising to the danger peak
When I feel the romance coming soon
Right away she crooning the tongue tie tune
10 to 12 Harry get up me Grandmother darlin' she coming 12 o clock
Harry it's 10 to 12 now come on get up Harry

Well right away me brain we see the revelation
How to make the fruit fall off the tree
If I want a chance to integrate me situation
I got to talk some other talk for she

Right away marriage talk was coming out me mouth
She smiled the conquest is no long in doubt
But before she reach insanity
With the last chance whisper she telling me

It's 12 o clock Harry, Harry, Harry it's 12 o clock
Harry it's 12 o clock and me grandmother coming
Ha, ha, ha, hallo granny I want you to meet me friend Harry
Who's gonna be your man?
Who's gonna be your man?
Who's gonna kiss your pretty red lips?
Who's gonna be your man?

Who's gonna shoe your pretty little foot?
Who's gonna glove your hand?
Who's gonna kiss your pretty red lips?
Who's gonna be your man?

I look down the railroad track
Just as far as I could see
All I've seen was a little bitty hand
Kept waving after me

Who's gonna be your man?
Who's gonna be your man?
Who's gonna kiss your pretty red lips, darling?
Who's gonna be your man?

I've been counting every tree
Count every railroad tie
I've been counting on you, my pretty baby
To love me till I die
'Cause I want to be your man
I want to be your man
I want to kiss your pretty red lips, baby
Won't you let me be your man?

Don't you weep, my own true love
Don't you weep or cry
Each click of the track tells me
I'll be back in the very near by and by

'Cause I'm gonna be your man
I'm gonna be your man
I'm gonna kiss your pretty red lips, darling
I'm gonna be your man
'Long about now, my woman’s waking
Shaking the sleep from out of her eyes
Starting a smile so warm
That smile is making the morning sun
Ashamed to rise

'Long about now my woman’s bending
Tending the fire and setting the bread
Starting a song, so sweet
That at it’s ending that fire is burning extra red

Oh, 'long about now, my woman’s waiting
Shading the sun from off of her brow
Searching the winding road with eyes
That try to find me and longing after me
'Long about now
I'm on my way to Saturday
And I wish you come along with me
I’m on my way to merry be
And I feel like having company
So I'm on my way to Saturday
And I wish you come along with me
How happy we would be

I'm on my way to Saturday
Where the cherry wine is flowing free
I’m on my way to the moonlit skies
And I think I'll stop at paradise
Cause I'm on my way to Saturday
And I wish you come along with me

Today's only Monday
And my worries grow and grow
But soon come the one day
When I tell them away to go
I'm on my way to Saturday
And I wish you come along with me
I'm on my way to share a kiss
With the girl who's interested in this
So I'm on my way to Saturday
And I wish you come along and see
How happy we can be

I’m on my way to Saturday
Where a dreamer really ought to bе
I’m on my way to steel the heart
Of the girl who's tеaring mine apart
Because I’m on my way to Saturday
And I wish you come along with me

Today's only Tuesday
And the hours dragging on
But soon it's no shoes day
And my cares and woes are gone

I'm on my way to Saturday
Where the evening’s a melody
I'm on my way to sing a song
To the girl who cares to come along

And so I'm on my way to Saturday
And I wish you come along and see
How happy we can be, how happy we can be
Lord, Lord in the Carnival
How happy we can be
Well I rode that ribbon highway
I saw above me the endless sky
I saw below me the golden valley
This land was made for you and me

I've roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
Through the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice was calling
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York island
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

Well the sun came shining and I was strolling
Through wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
And a voicе was sounding as the fog was lifting
Saying this land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to thе New York island
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me
Oh sit down, please sit down

Why won't you sit down, oh I can't sit down
Why won't you sit down, oh I can't sit down
Why won't you sit down, oh I can't sit down
Because I just got to heaven and I will look around

Who's that yonder dressed in white
Looks like the children of the Israelites
Yes, yes, yes my Lord

Who's that yonder dressed in blue
A well it looks like my brother he's a coming thru

Who's that yonder dressed in black
That's my preacher and that hypocrite's a turning back
I ride an old Paint, I lead an old Dan
I'm goin' to Montana, for to throw the Hoolian
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw
Ride around, little doggies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are a rarin' to go

Old Bill Jones had a daughter and a son
Son went to college and the daughter went wrong
His wife got killed in a pool-room fight
Still he keeps singing from morning till night
Ride around, little doggies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are a rarin' to go

My feet are in the stirrups, my hand is on the horn
I'm the best old cowboy that ever was born
But a cowboy rides single, like it or not
So I guess that old paint is the best friend I got
Ride around, little dogies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are a rarin' to go
Oh, when I die, take my saddle from the wall
Put it on my pony, lead him out of his stall
Tie my bones to his back, turn our faces to the west
And we'll ride the prairie that we loved the best
Ride around, little dogies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are a rarin' to go

I worked in the city, I worked on the farm
All I got to show is the muscle on my arm
Blisters on my feet and callous on my hands
And I'm going to Montana to throw the Houlihan
Ride around, little doggies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are a rarin' to go
Mary and the baby hungry
Yes, we know what hungry be
So we bring them peas and rice
And a little ginger tea

Only pigeon peas and rice
A little ginger tea
Mary thank us with her eyes
She poor the same as we
She poor the same as we

Mary and the baby lonely
Lonely is not good to be
So we sit awhile and chat awhile
To keep them company

Stay awhile makes the baby smile
Pass the time of day
When we see how pleased they be
It make us glad we stay
So glad that we could stay
Mary and the baby weary
Oh, we know what weary be
So we make a bed and pillow for their head
With down from the Mahoe tree

Only down from the Mahoe tree
To rest them soft and good
We feel bad this was all we had
We do the best we could
We do the best we could

Mary and the baby rest easy
We go away and let them be
On hush tip toe and voice kept low
We look up and see

Stars of hope shine in the sky
To mark the baby's birth
Seemed to say it's borning day
Of better times on earth
Of better times on earth
My Lord's gonna move this wicked race
This wicked race, this wicked race
My Lord's gonna move this wicked race
And raise up a nation that shall obey

Sister Mary wore three links of chain
Three links of chain, three links of chain
Sister Mary wore three links of chain
And every link was in my Jesus name

Nicodemus he desire to know
Desire to know, desire to know
Nicodemus he desire to know
How can a man be born again

My Lord said a fire is gonna take place
Is gonna take place, is gonna take place
My Lord said a fire is gonna take placе
And you can only be saved by grace

Brothеr Daniel pray three times a day
Three times a day, three times a day
Brother Daniel pray three times a day
And these are the words I heard him say
My Lord's gonna move this wicked race
This wicked race, this wicked race
My Lord's gonna move this wicked race
And raise up a nation that shall obey
When you hear that I am dying
And my song it should be sung
Just say I lived the way I pleased
And spoke with a free man's tongue

So when they fit me to the stone
And close my grass's cell
I don't want no crying on my grave
A just ring that charming bell

And you can tone the bell easy
Tone it all around
Tone the bell easy
When they lay my body down

When I was just a cabin boy
On the freighter "Annalee"
The first mate was a salty dog
And this he said to me

I'll take the women, wine and song
And life will serve me well
`Cause brother it will be too late
When they're ringing that final bell
And you can tone the bell easy
Tone it all around
Tone the bell easy
When they lay my body down

From sea to sea and pole to pole
I followed my roving mind
I spent the gold of a king or two
And drunk some heavy wine

And if heaven it can't offer me
The joys I used to know
Well I hope they turn the box around
And a sending me down below

And you can tone the bell easy
Tone it all around
Tone the bell easy
When they lay my body down

The things that I have done for love
I never could relate
I passed from a woman's loving arms
To the hands of cruel fate

But if a young girl passes by
And my chest it doesn't swell
Just roll me down to the burning gates
And ring that devil's bell
And you can tone the bell easy
Tone it all around
Tone the bell easy
When they lay my body down
Willow, willow with your head hung down
Are you weeping for me this morning
Don't you know that my woman has left this old town
And the blues they done come and tore me down

Steamboat calling from the waterline
No use calling to me this morning
Don't you know that my sorrows
Got me chained to the ground
And the blues they done come and tore me down

Whistle, whistle on that lonesome train
Are you moaning for me this morning
Tell me why in the day time
Do you make that midnight sound
And bring those blues that just come and tear mе down

Dark cloud rolling in the summer sky
Is your cold rain for me this morning
Why don't you lеt that old sun shine
Spread a smile all around
An chase those blues that just come and tear me down
Oh Ananias, oh Ananias
Please tell me what kind a man my Jesus is
Oh Ananias, oh Ananias
Won't you tell me what kind a man my Jesus is
Well he spoke to the wind, oh yes the wind stood still
Tell me what kind a man my Jesus is

Oh Ananias, oh Ananias
Please tell me what kind a man my Jesus is
Oh Ananias, please Ananias
Won't you tell me what kind a man my Jesus is
Well he spoke to the sea, oh yes the sea got calm
Please tell me what kind a man my Jesus is

Please tell me what kind a man my Jesus is
Oh Ananias, Oh Ananias
Won't you tell me what kind a man my Jesus is
Well he spoke to the waves, oh yes they stopped their rollin'
Tell me what kind a man my Jesus is
Oh Ananias, oh Ananias
Please tell me what kind a man my Jesus is
Oh Ananias, oh Ananias
Won't you tell me what kind a man my Jesus is
Well he spoke to the sun, oh yes the sun went down
Tell me what kind a man my Jesus is

Oh Ananias, oh Ananias
Please tell me what kind a man my Jesus is
Oh Ananias, oh Ananias
Won't you tell me what kind a man my Jesus is

Well he spoke to the dead, oh yes the dead did rise
Tell me what kind a man my Jesus is
My Jesus is oh Ananias, oh Ananias
Won't you tell me Ananias
Won't you tell me Ananias right now
Won't you tell me Ananias
Won't you tell me Ananias
Won't you tell me right now
Who's gonna soothe you when I'm gone
Who's gonna soothe you when I'm gone
Who will kindle the fire, wrap your sackcloth tight

Oh boy, oh boy you sure is a lusty one
Oh boy, oh boy you sure is your daddy's son

Well you've got a pair of lungs for such a tiny one
Sound of your voice wakes the morning sun
And I tell you boy I ain't gonna run
Ain't no big man boss gonna take my son

Oh boy oh boy sure is a lusty one
Oh boy oh boy sure is your daddy's son
Now I hear about that underground rail
They travel in the night and they ain't fail

I'll take you to a land
Where you can lift your head
If they make my child a slave
It's because your daddy's dead
Oh boy oh boy oh boy
My love is a dewdrop on a mountain
She appears and stays calls my name and fades
My love is a dewdrop on a mountain
I am the mountain she's the dewdrop

At the break of day she goes to the river
And joins in its rambling ways
I cried all night till the midnight sun
There's a river that flows between our souls
When the sun splashed river calls she must go

I'll wait till the morning comes again
When I see the tears in my true love's eyes
The mountain will die a thousand times

If only I could keep her from the river
Our life would live a timeless love
But my love is a dewdrop on a mountain
My love is a dewdrop on a mountain
She appears and stays calls my name and fades
My love is a dewdrop on a mountain
My love is a dewdrop on a mountain
If you miss me at the back of the bus
You can't find me nowhere
Oh come on over to the front of the bus
Because I'll be riding up there

Come on over to the front of the bus

Because I'll be boating right there
Tell me who is that writing, my Lordy, John the Revelator
Who is that writing, my Lordy, John the Revelator
What is he writing, my Lordy, about the revelation
Yes he's writing in the book of the seven seals

As the book was opened breaking seal after seal
There was a mighty rumbling like a chariot wheel
John said let me tell ye just what I see
Beasts began to rise up out of the sea
Four and twenty elders well they're singing a song
As God stepped out from heaven judge that right or wrong

God called out to Gabriel go blow your mighty sound
And wake the living nations and all beneath the ground
With one foot on the mountain and the other in the sea
Gabe's trumpet be like thunder as he set the nations free
The mountain it did shutter and the sea began to swell
And with one mighty blast Gabe (swept) the gates of Hell

God (snipped) out the sun like a candle in the wind
The moon began to drip in blood
The trees began to bend
God cried to the sinners come all you underneath
'Cause I set all the righteous free
The dead is gonna rise
The dumb is gonna talk
The lame is gonna pick up his bed and walk
God said let me tell you
You will never be free till you love your neighbor
As you love me
Been in jail such a long long time
Been in jail such a long long time
Been in jail such a long long time
Didn't know being born was such a crime

Big boat on the river hauling seven ton
Coming up from Natchez on the Memphis run
Paddle wheel a slipping and the keel done cracked
Mean old Mississippi trying to hold me back

Won't somebody tell my woman
Won't somebody tell my woman
Won't somebody tell my woman

Big boat up the river and it won't come down
Big boat up the river and it won't come down
Big boat up the river and it won't come down

Captain told the stokers well pack her tight
Got to get to Memphis by tomorrow night
Coming up the delta well the fathom set
Captain, Lord, Captain tell me where I at

Big boat a comin' in the pitch black night
That Mississippi fog that hits the pilot's light
Gauging, Mr. Gauger what's that rumblin' sound
Sandbank dead ahead and we done run on ground
My woman say she loves me and I know it's true
But I've done done something that you just don't do
Stayed from home too long and now I see
Some Natchez man is tryin' to take my gal from me

He's messing around with my woman
Messing around with my woman
He's messing around with my woman

When I go off this I'm gonna stay on land
Gonna take my little woman well a by the hand
Build me a cabin on a high old hill
Get me a rocking-chair and sit right still

But on some quiet night when the wind done rift
The sounds from the river will begin to drift
Some lonely rambler with a tearful eye
Will touch my heart with his mournful cry
Erini Erini who Erini who
Erini who's behind that tree
First this one then that one too
Oh, what will they think of you
Kiss one then kissing two
Hoping they will marry you

You, You're much too young
You're much too young
It is in Rome to fall in love
Don' t run,girl, you'll run astray
True love will come your way
You'll find it one fine day
You'll find it if you pray

Life is full of fun, Erini
Give your heart to none, Erini
Till you find the one, Erini
Who will love you strong, Erini

Erini Erini where Erini where
Erini where again you' ll be
You're still keeping company
There behind the orange tree
If you're with someone new
Who will be left to marry you
You, You're doing wrong
You're doing wrong
Girl, after boy should never run
There' s only one thing to do
Let the boys run after you
Ever since the time began
Woman always got her man

Life is full of fun, Erini
Give your heart to none, Erini
Till you find the one, Erini
Who will love you strong, Erini
Erini...
I have a quiet room
A room nobody can see
A secret place
That’s all my own
And only I have the key

The rest of my life
Has an open door
It’s features can all be known
But nobody knows
Of my quiet room
Where I live apart and alone

I have a quiet room
With dreams piled high on a shelf
And one long wall is a looking glass
For really seeing myself

Sometimes I sit in the lonely gloom
And I think how fine it would be
If you could come to my quiet room
And share it’s treasures with me
Lemonade, apple-pie
Read a book or swat a fly
Portrait of a Sunday afternoon
Rain or shine
I don’t care
I’m not going anywhere
Portrait of a Sunday afternoon

Lying in a hammock
Snug as I can get
Picture of contentment
And yet
Thoughts of you filter in
Dreams of all that might have been
Haunted as an old familiar tune
Portrait of a Sunday afternoon
Raindrops, raindrops
Can't go home in the rain
Who's gonna tell my own true love
Never gonna see me again

Sunshine, sunshine
Please tell me what to do
Shouldn't have loved that other girl
Oh can't be in love with two

Moonbeams, moonbeams
Shining all night long
Who's gonna tell my own true love
Oh yes I have done her wrong

Raindrops, raindrops
Can't go home in the rain
Who's gonna tell my own true love
Never gonna see me again
Never gonna see me again
I heard the weeping-willow's quiet laughter
I felt the gentle fingers of the sun
I touched your hand and knew the moment after
All of our time for loving had begun

I never knew the music of the thunder
Till in my own two arms I held you fast
Now all the world is throbbing with the wonder
All of our time for loving's here at last

It is raining, but raindrops never touch us as they fall
It is windy, it's funny I can't feel the wind at all
Must be magic and yet it's very easy to explain
Our love is a great big silk umbrella
Keeping out thе wind and rain

So many dreams to share with one anothеr
So many words just waiting to be said
So many things to learn about each other
All of our time for loving lays ahead
The honey wind blows
And the warm days dwindle
A butterfly spins a silk cocoon
On a silvery spindle
The petals fall from the last red rose
The last red rose when the honey wind blows

The petals fall and the summer goes
The summer goes when the honey wind blows

The honey wind blows
And the days grow colder
Somehow the world and I have grown
Just a little bit older

I sit alone where the fire glows
The fire glows and the honey wind blows
I sit alone and the good Lord knows
I miss you so when the honey wind blows

I sit alone and the good Lord knows
I miss you so when the honey wind blows
I remember summer morning
Dawning light and bright and gay
And the girls in their summer dresses
Walking, Walking on their way

I remember distant laughter
Afternoons of past July’s
And the girls in their summer dresses
With their secret smiling eyes

Tender arms so smooth and slender
Downy and brown from sunlit days
Wrapped in evening silvery splendor
Resting on tables in dim café’s

I remember midsummer night times
Midsummer night drеams I recall
But the girls in their summеr dresses
I remember most of all

I remember sad September
Dying summer’s brave display
And one sweet girl in her summer dress
Who softly swiftly slipped away

[Hold 'em Joe]

Hold 'em Joe, hold'em Joe, hold'em Joe
But don't let him go
Hold 'em Joe, hold'em Joe, hold'em Joe
But don't let him go

Me donkey want water, hold'em Joe
Spring 'round the corner, hold'em Joe
Me donkey want water, hold'em Joe
Everybody want water, hold'em Joe
Fuma la catchimba, hold'em Joe

We on a journey he don't walk straight
And that is because he's so underweight
Donkеy of mine he don't like wеight
Put him on a cart he never walk straight

Me donkey want water, hold'em Joe
Spring 'round the corner, hold'em Joe
Me donkey want water, hold'em Joe
Everybody want water, hold'em Joe
Fuma la catchimba, hold'em Joe
My ole donkey went courtin' one day
With a donkey named Melda across the way
She was twice his age, he put up a fight
Now he's cryin' every night
Oh lemme go, darling Melda
You breaking my back bone
Lemme go, darling Melda
You breaking my back

Some people say that my donkey is bad
An' that is because he's from Trinidad
Donkey of mine he won't work at all
All he want to do is break out him stall

[The Jack-Ass Song]

Play that theme man
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
I say the Jackass will jump and bray
Lordy let him bray, let him bray, everybody!

Now I tell you in a positive way
Don’t tie me donkey down there
Cause me donkey will jump and play
Don’t tie me donkey down there
Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
I say the Jackass will jump and bray
Lordy let him bray, let him bray, everybody!

Now me donkey gone mad they say
Don’t tie me donkey down there
'Cause his eye on a bale o’ hay
Don’t tie me donkey down there

Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
I say the Jackass will jump and bray
Lordy let him bray, let him bray, everybody!

Now the news really travel fast
Don’t tie me donkey down there
When me donkey in the meadow grass
Don’t tie me donkey down there

Jackass will jump and bray, let him bray, let him bray
I say the Jackass will jump and bray
Lordy let him bray, let him bray, everybody!

Now me heart is light and gay
Don’t tie me donkey down there
He haw ‘till judgment day
Don’t tie me donkey down there
I hear when you die after burial
You have to come back as an insect or animal
I hear when you die after burial
You have to come back as an insect or animal

Well if it’s so I don’t want to be a monkey a goat, a sheep
A mule or donkey
My brother say that he will come back a hog
Not Harry I think I’ll be a bed bug

And I will bite them fat people harder
Than a hot dog or a hamburger
But if you’re skinny there’s no cause for fright
It’s only all the fat ones I’m going to bite

You must believe me when I confеss
I be a different bеd bug from all of the rest
I biting no ordinary people
They have to be quite social and respectable

Such as big time doctors and Ministers, Head of States
And other world figures
And when I bite them friends I’m going out and pose
Calling myself king bed-bug the first
And when I eat up all I can chew
I’m going to look for something useful to do
At the united nations I’ll make a start
Checking on the delegates that take a part

If I see anyone try to sabotage
By word or deed in the world at large
I sharpen up my teeth like a razorblade
Bray back on my hunches and make a raid

And I will bite them delegates harder
Than a hotdog or a hamburger
But if you’re skinny there’s no cause for fright
It’s only all the fat ones I’m goin’ to bite
Where did the naughty little flea go
Nobody know, nobody know
Where did the naughty little flea go
Nobody know, nobody know

A naughty flea he came to town
Started searching up and down
Looking for a place to nest
Where he can get some food and rest

He saw a lady round and fat
He smiled a smile and tipped his hat
He said oh yes I’m goin’ have a ball
Man look at all that cholesterol

The naughty flea went to the beach
He saw such tasties in his reach
He said hurrah and thank you Lord
That’s what I call a small guеst bug

The naughty flea went to thе zoo
Saw a skunk and bit him too
He bit him in the usual place
And said Holy Macro what a taste
Sum up friends well can you see
The big advantage of being a flea
Just remember what ever you do
That what you bite is what you chew
It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turning
In your hand, in your hand

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well I could have loved you better
Didn’t mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

You've got reasons a-plenty for going
This I know, this I know
But the weeds have been steadily growing
Please don't go, please don’t go

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a tracе left behind
Well I could havе loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
As I lie in my bed in the morning
Without you, without you
Each song in my breast lies a borning
Without you, without you

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Well I could have loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
Guess I was born for roaming
And roam I always will
Oh I wonder if it's greener
On the far side of the hill

Oh please come look down yonder
Just earth and green and sky
I know I could get on down there
In the pattern of an eye

And further west's an ocean
A miner told me so
And the sun it shines so brightly
Well it scares off winter snow

And yes sometimes I'm tiered
Sometimes I'm lonesome too
Sometimes I see a farmer
Walking slow when day is through

And I know he's got a woman
Waiting suppеr everyday
If I have mе such a woman
I could drive my blues away
I wished I knew the reason
God does the way he does
And why he keeps me moving
From a dream that never even was
Well you gotta roll on buddy, roll on easy
How can I roll ,when the wheel won't go

I've been rollin´ yes and I've been wheeling
Just a little too long, just a little too long

Well early in the morning, I find myself  praying
That the sun don't rise, that the sun don't rise

When that sun's gotta movin´ captain done call me
To country road, to country road

Grab a my hammer, hammer is a burnin´
From the blazing sun, from the blazing sun

Forty pound a hammer just a little to heavy
For my size buddy for my size

Oh roll on buddy, roll on easy
How can I roll, when the wheel won't go
Sometimes I get a sayin´, sometimes I get a prayin´
That I never been born, that I never been born

When a man's on a chain gang all his days
Something done gone wrong, something sure is wrong

All this sweat all down my face
Never cool my tongue, never cool my tongue

Well I won't lay down somewhere that's shading
Let the cop pass by let the cop pass by

Now ain't that a shame, shame, shame ´bout the captain
That boy don't know that he bound to die

Roll on buddy roll on easy
How can I roll when the wheel won't go
The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top
The snow is softly fallin'
The air is still within the silence of my room
I hear your voice softly callin'

If I could only have you near
To breathe a sigh or two
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
Upon this winter night with you

The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead
My glass is almost empty
I read again between the lines upon the page
The words of love you sent me

If I could know within my heart
That you were lonely too
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
Upon this winter night with you

The fire is dying, now my lamp is growing dim
The shades of night are liftin'
The mornin' light steals across my window pane
Where webs of snow are driftin'
If I could only have you near
To breathe a sigh or two
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
And to be once again with you
To be once again with you
The river is wide, I can't get o'er
Nor do I have like wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall cross my love and I

Oh waly, waly, up the bank
And waly, waly down the braes
And waly, waly by yon burnside
Where me and my love was won't to go

I leaned my back against an oak
Thinking it was a trusty tree
But first it bent and then it broke
And so did my love prove false to me

I put my hand in some soft bush
Thinking the sweetest flower to find
I pricked my finger to the bone
And left the sweetest flower behind

Oh, love is handsome, lovе is kind
Gay as a jewel when first it's  nеw
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like morning dew

[Whistling]

Ain't no use to sit and cry
You be an Angel by an' by

Don't you rock, don't you rock
Don't you rock, don't you rock 'em daddy-o

I've got a home in Tennessee
That's the place that I wanna be

I got a house in Baltimore
Sail away ladies, sail away
Streetcar running by my door
Sail away ladies sail away

I got me a gal named Ida-vee
Sweet as honey in a hollow tree

Well I miss my baby but I'm on the roam
I'm gonna givin' her a lot of loving
As my aching head is begging for a sleep that will not come
I rise and walk the morning streets again
I keep a wondering how you're doing and I wonder where you are
And I know I'll be all right but I don't know when

Hold on to me babe, wherever you may be
Hold on to me babe, I'm with you always

There was something locked inside you like a secret burning pain
In a prison where you would not let me go
I was sure we'd find an answer, till I woke and found you gone
Now just what it was I guess I'll never know

Hold on to me babе, wherever you may bе
Hold on to me babe, I'm with you always

I keep hanging onto something no I don't know what it is
But at least I know the sound of my own name
And I work as hard as ever and I see the same old friends
But there's something deep inside and it ain't the same
Hold on to me babe, wherever you may be
Hold on to me babe, I'm with you always
That sounds like a rabbit-dog
I believe that's a bird-dog
Oh that’s an old civil-rights chaser
Lord, Lord I know that's a coon-dog

Talking ´bout a white dog
Talking ´bout a black dog
Talking ´bout a rabbit-dog
Talking ´bout a coon-dog
All them dogs, all them dogs
All them dogs Lordy, Lordy
All them dogs
Well why can't we sit un’  the apple tree

You walk, walk with me
You talk, talk with me
Well why don't you hold my hand and tell me
You understand now can't you see
You and me oh yes
We'll be so happy
Sit on the apple tree
My little doggy was a playing one day
Down in the meadow by a bundle of hay
Another little doggy well he come along
Said let's get together and eat this bone
Now why can't we sit on the apple tree

My little doggy started jumping around
Said let's take a trip to the heart of town
The other little doggy well he made a face
Said I don't trust the members of the human race
Now why can’t we sit on the apple tree

My little doggy said he would go
Down a town to see what was so
He stayed all day till the sky got dark
Run at home and he started to bark
Well why can’t we sit on the apple tree

He said you won't believe the news I bring
I saw some march and I heard some sing
Some was a yelling and a throwing stones
Wherever I did see weren’t sharing any bones
Now why can't we sit on the apple tree
Once in a lifetime of pain and care
Someone touches your heart with a touch so rare
That the sun seems to shine just for you
And the whole world is born a new
Once in a lifetime of shadows alights
Someone loves you with a love that is honest and wise

And the sorrow of night fades away
And you wake till the laughter of day
I walked the plains I roamed the town
But what was lost could not be found
Till once in my lifetime of doubt and fear
You reached for my hand and my way was clear

Now I treasure еach leave on it's tree
Love has opеned my eyes, I can see
It's been a long time
Since I've had the urge to sing
Such a long time
Since I noticed it was Spring

It's been a blue time
A nothing's new time
But now at last it's you time

It's such a good time
For a love as strong as this
Such a good time
To just kiss and kiss and kiss
So lets it ignore time
It's shut the door time
That's what is for to give me more of your time

It's you time, it's me time, it's we time
In the beginning there was heaven and earth
The heavens were high and the earth was green
And there was day and there was night
And the length of hours stretched between

In the beginning though the world was my own
I sorrowed for something I knew not of
And God was kind and with careful hands
He brought me love

And God was kind and with careful hands
He brought me you
Oh Annie love why did you run
When cold the winds were blowing
And did you find a brighter sun
Where your frightened feet were going

Last summertime your golden skin
Lay but a space my hands to win
The nightingale your voice within
My lazy song was knowing

But long the swallows have been here
And soon the love shall set in sear
And cold and growing is my fear
That Annie's gone forever
That Annie's gone forever
Sleep late, my lady friend
Let the warm Summer breeze
Drift through your window

Sleep late, my lady friend
And dream a dream of Ciolito Lindo
We had a time a time of our lives

We did the town turned it upside down
Then I walked you home
Sleep late, my lady friend

Let the feel of a dance hold your hand
As you lay sleeping
Sleep late, my lady friend

Dream a dream of a night we're keeping
We had a time the time of our lives
We did the town turned it upside down

Then I walked you home
Sleep late, my lady friend
Sleep late, my lady friend
The first day of forever was an ordinary morning
The first day of forever seemed to happen without warning
No trumpets blare, no banner flew
The sky was undecided neither cloudy neither blue

The first day of forever was a day that fate selected
The moment of our meeting was so very unexpected
Bur our first hello made it oh so clear
That the first day of forever was here

The moment of our meeting was so very unexpected
But our first hello made it oh so clear
That the first day of forever was here
Oh I'm sitting by the railway station
Got a ticket for my destination
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band
Homeward bound, I wish I was homeward bound

Home where my thought's a straying
And home where my music's playing
And home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Each day becomes an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And every person's face I see reminds me that I long to be
Homeward bound I wish I was homeward bound

Tonight I'll sing my songs again
Play the game and I'll pretend oh yeah
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me and take me
Homeward bound I wish I was homeward bound
When autumn winds begin to blow
I think of all the times gone by
Of all the discontent we know
A quiet tear comes to my eye
It gives me a sad heart

The wind blows cold upon my face
The dry leaves floated to the ground
The land has something out of place
What is that low and mournful sound
It gives me a sad heart

Now winter cloaks a landing wide
Forgotten bells begin to ring
But there's no silence on this night
And there is no tanking sense to bring
It givеs me a sad heart

The warmth of spring now solvе the snow
The grass returns the flowers bloom
No changes often come too slow
The smell of hope is sweet perfume
I can't have a sad heart
As I sit by the riverside
The water flowing at my feet
The sun kiss all the country side
Misfortunes come but life is sweet
I can't have a sad heart
The last time I saw her face
Her eyes were bathed in starlight and her hair hung long
The last time she spoke to me
Her lips were like the scented flowers inside a rain-drenched forest

But that was so long ago that I can scarcely feel the way I felt before
And if time could heal the wounds
I would tear the threads away that I might bleed some more

The last time I walked with her
Her laughter was the steeple bells
That ring to greet the morning sun
A voice that called to everyone
To love the ground she walked upon
Those were good days

The last time I held her hand
Her touch was autumn, spring and summer, and winter too
The last time I let go of her
She walked a way into the night
I lost her in the misty streets
A thousand months, a thousand miles
When other lips will kiss her eyes
A million miles beyond the moon, that's where she is

But that was so long ago
That I can scarcely feel the way I felt before
And if time could heal the wounds
I would tear the threads away that I might bleed some more

The last time I saw her face
Her eyes were bathed in starlight and she walked alone
The last time she kissed my cheek
Her lips were like the wilted leaves

Upon the autumn covered hills
Resting on the frozen ground
The seeds of love lie cold and still
Beneath a battered marking stone
It lies forgotten
This old world may never change the way it's been
And all the ways of war can't change it back again
I'm searching for the dolphins in the sea
Sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me

I'm not the one to tell this world how to get along
I only know that peace will come when all hate is gone
I'm searching for the dolphins in the sea
Sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me

Sometimes I think about Saturday's child
And all of the happy times when we were running wild
Oh I'm searching for the dolphins in the sea
Yea and sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me

Sometime I wonder, sometimes I wonder
I wonder do you ever think of me
Where I've been
You don't know
And what I've got
It don't show
I won't try
To teach you how
Don't talk now

Don't talk roads
Don't talk sand
Don't talk dust
Don't talk no man
Don't talk rules
Don't talk vows
Don't talk now

I don't wanna hear same old song
And too many rights still make her wrong
I know she can't hurt me less by talking more
Can't make good what was bad before
It's too late now for me to lie
And I can't make a second try
I just came on back to say goodbye, goodbye
Don't talk now
Softly she comes
Whispers the breeze with her passing
In secret love she is laughing
Softly she comes in the night

Softly she sighs
Sweetly she lies never sleeping
Her fragrance all in my keeping
Softly she comes in the night

Down the darkened hall
I hear her footsteps on my stair
And she is in my arms once more

Then softly she goes
Her shining lips in the shadows
Whisper goodbye at my window
Softly she goes in the dawn

Down thе darkened hall
I hear hеr footsteps on my stair
And she is in my arms once more
Then softly she goes
Her shining lips in the shadows
Whisper goodbye at my window
Softly she goes in the dawn
Softly she goes in the dawn
Suzanne takes you down to her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half crazy

And that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That came all the way from China
And just when you want to tell her

That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength
And lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust her
'Cause she's touched your perfect body with her mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From a lonely wooden tower
And when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could se Him
He said "All men shall be sailors
Then, until the sea shall free them"

But He Himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust Him
For He's touched your perfect body with His mind

Suzanne takes you down to her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And the sun pours down like honey

On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
A mid the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed

There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way for ever
While Suzanne holds her mirror
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust her
'Cause you've touched her perfect body with your mind
If today was not an endless highway
I today was not a crooked trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all

I can't see my reflection in the waters
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Or can't remember the sound of my own name

Yes and only if my own true love was waitin'
Yes and if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Yes only if she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again

There's beauty in the silver singin' river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes

If today was not an endless highway
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
A little bird come sit upon my window-sill
Sat there thru the falling rain
As I watched that bird upon my window-sill
Saw my thoughts of you go by again

And the picture of my face reflecting on the pane
Is it tears I see or is it rain

I remember how we talked before we said goodbye
Too young to know this world outside our door
And now the miles of time have built a wall my love
And though I try I just can't tear it down

I said that love takes many shapes it has no forms
Has no boundaries has no grips to hold
But time will take the foolish hand and twist a tinged pain
And make the heart look back with eyes grown old

And the picture of my face reflecting on the pane
Is it tears I see or is it rain
I have no regrets about the past there's nothing I can change
Life's a road you walk just one way down
But looking back I do recall that frame of time
When the world was love and time was just a thought

Then if things go many ways course of life is such
We all must pick that road of life to walk
And age gives off old memories like hand notes in a log
Where the world is time and love is just a thought

And the picture of my face reflecting in the pane
Is it tears I see or is it rain

As my thoughts go tumbling back I wonder how you look
I wonder if you've seen that little bird
I wonder if he sat upon your window-sill
I wonder if you'll ever hear these words
I wonder if you'll ever hear these words
I wonder if you'll ever hear these words
Oh Linda you done me wrong
I'm gonna sing you a goodbye song
Sing a song that's most unkind
I ain't even gonna try to change your mind

Oh Linda you made me grieve
I feel like I could die
Look out baby the moon is falling
Down from your sky

Oh gal don't you say goodbye
Now that I need you by my side
Love me now or be on your way
If you go be gone to stay

I saw Linda late last night
Dressed for town she looked alright
Painted eyes and lips like wine
Walkin' on down with a friend of mine

Oh gal don't you say so long
I feel like I could die
Look out baby the moon is falling
Down from your sky
Oh gal don't you be unkind
I ain't even gonna try to change your mind
Love me now or be on your way
If you go bе gone to stay

Oh Linda you made me griеve
I feel like I could die
Look out baby the moon is falling
Down from your sky

Oh gal don't you say goodbye
Now that I need you by my side
You can have everything I own
Take everything but a-come on home

Oh gal don't you say so long
I feel like I could die
Look out baby the moon is falling
Down from your sky

Oh gal don't you do me wrong
I'm gonna sing you a goodbye song
Sing a song that's most unkind
I ain't even gonna try to change your mind
Missouri Birds flying over old St. Louis
Hear that song they're singing to me
Go into the world, while you’re young

But the preacher's words
Echo from the old church steeple
Stay here with the decent people
Settle down and merry, while you're young

If I go into the world Susanna
Oh will you wait for me
And if I go into the world Susanna
I’ll come back and tell you what I've seen

The seeds have change
Blow across the churchyard to me
Tombstone faces see right thru me
Today, so soon tomorrow
And you're old

If I go into the world Susanna
Oh will you wait for me
And if I go into thе world Susanna
I'll come back and tell you what I've seen
Missouri birds flying ovеr St. Louis
Hear that song they're singing to me
Go into the world, while you're young
I spend the winter in the city
Cuddling close to keep me warm
Soon as I knew the spring was breaking
I got the urge for movin´ on

I like the highway roads unfolding
I like to breathe sweet country air
Hearing the note that the breeze is holding
Lightens my burden eases my cares

I got to stop this city living
And get back to some solid ground
I got to take what life is giving
I open the window, I hear the wind blow
Something will call me, off I'll go I know

When I had grown to one and twenty
I left the country far behind
Got mе a job in Pittsburg city
Loading on iron from the mine
Working me hеart off thru December
Saving my money when I can
Big city boys will try to cheat you
Women will curse you like a man

I got to stop this city living
And get back to some solid ground
I got to take what life is giving
Often all easy you can believe me
No one to tell me when to come and when to go

When I go back to West Virginia
I'm gonna set for quite a spell
Mamma will talk about Salvation
Daddy is goin' to give me hell

But I never had no long ambition
Wanna be easy in my mind
I need a horse that needs a rider
I need a girl that's sweet and kind

I got to stop this city living
And get back to some solid ground
I gotta take what life is giving
Space all around me, no troubles to haunt me
Drinking sweet country cider
Taking things real slow
Has anybody here
Seen my old friend Abraham

Can you tell me, where he's gone
He freed a lotta people
But it seems the good die young
I just looked around
And he's gone

Has anybody here
Seen my old friend John

Can you tell me, where he's gone
He freed a lotta people
But it seems the good die young
I just looked around
And he's gone

Has anybody here
Seen my old friend Martin
Can you tell me, where he's gonе
He freed a lotta people
But it seems thе good die young
I just looked around
And he's gone

Didn't you love the things they stood for
Didn't they try to find some good for you and me
And we'll be free
Someday soon it's gonna be one day

Has anybody here
Seen my old friend Bobby
Can you tell me, where he's gone
I thought I saw him walkin' up over the hill
With Abraham, Martin and John
If I had my way
I would say "It's over darling"
If I could be brave
I would say "I'm leaving you"

But I must stay on
'Till all hope is gone
'Cause girl I know
Anywhere you go
You'll still be needing me

If you find you can't make it
On your own my darling
I'll be on your side
When you can't find anyone
But for now
Let's try just to get by

Let the tide roll out
Let the tide roll in
It's time to sink or swim
La la la la la, la la la la lalalala
La la la la la, la la la la lalalala
If I could be strong
I'd be gone tomorrow morning
Still I play the part
Making life a broken toy
But I must stay on
'Till all hope is gone
'Cause girl I know
Anywhere you go
You'll still be needing me

Let the tide roll out
Let thе tide roll in
It's time to sink or swim
La la la la la, la la la la lalalala
La la la la la, la la la la lalalala
Oh fare you well my own true love
Oh fare you well for awhile
For the ship is waiting and the wind blows free
And I’m bound away for the sea Marianne

I will bring you diamonds for your hair
And of gold a cloak so fine
And wake you from your slumber with a silver bell
And rings for your every finger Marianne

Oh there’s some that say of a sailing man
That his life is free and wild
But this love that leaves you with the setting sun
Will come back on the morning tide Marianne
Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She was once a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without no seams nor needle work
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Bеtween the salt water and the sеa strands
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She was once a true love of mine
Put your tears away this cloudy eye
You'll be glad one day, he said goodbye
Though he's gone like those all
Don't you know the sun will shine
And he just isn't worth all your crying

Put your tears away and you will see
Someone wanting you, that some one is me

Let my hand take your hand
Another then you will know
There's somebody who won't let you go

I love you, oh yes I do
With a love strong and true
Put your tears away and you will see
Someone wanting you, that some one is me

I love you, oh yes I do
With a love strong and true
Put your tears away and you will see
Someone wanting you and that some one is me
I’ve got a secret, ooh, I shouldn’t tell
I’m gonna go to heaven in a split-pea shell
Lordie me, didn’t we shake on sugaree
Everything I have, down in pawn

You know I pawned my watch, yes and I pawned my chain
I’d of sold myself, but I felt ashamed
Lordie me, didn’t we shake on sugaree
Everything I have, down in pawn

You know I’ve got a song to sing, it's not very long
I’m gonna sing it right, yes if it takes all night long
Lordie me, didn’t we shake on sugaree
Everything I have, down in pawn

I’ve got a secret, ooh, I shouldn’t tell
I’m gonna go to heaven in a split-pea shell
Lordie me, didn’t we shake on sugaree
Everything I have, down in pawn
There's something in the way she moves
Or looks my way, or calls my name
That seems to leave this troubled world behind
And if I'm feeling down and blue
Or troubled by some foolish game
She always seems to make me change my mind

And I feel fine any time she's around me now
She's around me now, almost all the time
And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
And I feel fine

Every now and then the things I lean on lose their mеaning
And I find myself careening
Into places wherе I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me
And silently remind me
Of the happiness and the good times that I know
Just got know them
And I feel fine any time she's around me now
She's around me now, almost all the time
And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
And I feel fine

It isn't what she's got to say
But she thinks and where she's been
To me the words are nice the way they sound
I like to hear them best that way
Doesn't matter what they mean
She says them mostly just to calm me down
Now, I love my baby
And she's bound to love me some
Yes, I love my baby
And she's bound to love me some
Now, she throws her arms around me
Just like a circle around the sun

I lay down last night
Just to try to take my rest
I lay down last night
I was trying to take my rest
But my thoughts they kept a wandering
Like the wild geese in the west

Now I know that sunrise
Is gonna shine in my back yard someday
I said I know that sunrise
It's gonna shine in my back yard someday
And that wind just bound to rise up
Blow my blues away
She told me things I'd heard before
But somehow when she spoke they sounded new
That's not a very easy thing to do

First stories turned the strangest corners
But set inside her smile they sounded true
That's not a very easy thing to do

I didn't look for any reasons
I closed my eyes and let her lead me
Though I'd been to all the places
Still I let her take me
'Round and 'round in circles
When she wanted to
That's not a very easy thing to do

Now she's gone, I knew she'd go
But she never guessed just what she put me through
That's not a very easy thing to do
That's not a very easy thing to do
I'm walking down the highway
And I'm trying to get home
Oh lets hope I didn't wait too long
I left Louise at the window crying
Only hope she hasn't lowered her blind
Oh Louise, oh Louise, Louise please say you wait for me

I met Louise in the month of May
I knew that she had words to say
Lord I couldn't hear them at the time
It was until after I'd gone that
The words she spoke they lingered on
I knew that I had left her with an apron high
Oh Louise, oh Louise Louise please say you wait for me

I know she sitting in the darkness waiting
The streetlamp lights the tears she shedding
At a table there's a place for me
She'll make the table every night
With some wine and candle light
Even though she don't know where I'll be
Oh Louise, oh Louise, Louise please say you wait for me
I don't know what gets into me
But I must wonder aimlessly
Though I know it's wrong at the time
Many's the highway I walked down
But nothing have I ever found
They always left me homeward bound
Oh Louise, oh Louise, Louise please say you wait for me

I hope I soon will get the ride
That'll take me to Louise's side
I'll dry her tears and say that I was wrong
And hope that she forgives me then
And says that we can try again
I only hope she hasn't lowered her blind
Oh Louise, oh Louise, Louise please say you wait for me
I know your leaving is too long overdue
For far too long I've had nothing new to show to you
Goodbye, dry eyes
I watched your plane fade off west of the moon
Than I felt so strange to walk away alone

No regrets, no tears goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry again
Say goodbye again

The hours that were yours echo like empty rooms
But the thoughts we used to share
I now keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you
Not thinking you were gone
Than it felt so strange lay awake alone

Our friends have tried to turn my nights to day
Strange faces in your place
Can't keep the ghosts away
But just beyond the darkest hour
Just behind the dawn
It still feels so strange to lead my life alone
So I'm down and so I'm out
So are many others
Yes I feel like trying to hide
My head beneath these covers

Life is like the seasons
After winter comes the spring
So I'll keep this smile awhile
And see what tomorrow brings

I've been told and I believe
Life is meant for living
Even when my spirit's low
There's still some room for giving

I've been many places
Maybe not as far as you
So I think I'll stay awhile
And see if my dreams come true

There isn't much that I have lеarned
In all my foolish years
Except that lifе keeps running in cycles
First there's laughter, then there's tears
But I'll keep my head up high
Although I'm kind a weary
The way the world is going today
It all seems kind a scary

But you know it's almost funny
Things can't get much worse than now
So I'll keep on trying to sing
But please just don't ask me now
She can make a pirouette of feeling
Turn and turn inside me every time we touch
She can shade the color of confusion
So all that matters is that nothing matters much

She can take the secrets out of shadows
I was sure that I would always have to keep
She can lay all curled against the morning
And stop tomorrow with the quiet of her sleep

I have looked in house of mirrored faces
For a long, long time
But now I see myself reflected in her smile

She will smooth the edges of my questions
Growing trust where I thought trust could never grow
She will wait while I begin to love her
She will hold me while I'm letting go
She will hold me while I'm letting go
What good did that happy lie
All you wanted from the start was to cry girl

It looks like another fall
Your friends don't seem to help at all
Now when you're feeling kind of cold and small
Just look up your rainy day man

It does you no good to pretend
You've made a hole much too big to mend
And it looks like you lose my friend
So go home and look up your rainy day man

Our rainy day man don't like sunshine
He don't chase rainbows
He don't need good times
Grey days roll
And then you'll see him
Empty feeling
Lord you need him
All those noble thoughts they don't belong
You can't hide the truth with a happy song
And since you knew where you stood all along
Just call on your rainy man
If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly up the river just to see
The woman that I love
Fare thee well oh my honey
I say fare thee well

When I woke up this morning
It was drizzling rain all around my heart
Oh there was an aching pain
Fare thee well oh my honey, I say fare thee well

Now when you wore your apron low
You couldn't keep me
No you couldn't keep me from around your door
Fare thee well oh my honey, I say fare thee well

Now you wear your apron high
You say you never, oh you never you
Scarcely ever see me passing by
Fare thee well oh my honey I say farе thee well
Goodbye woman I know I done you wrong
Oh farе thee well
One day I went on a pleasure cruise
Sailing ´cross the ocean it was beautiful
All at once something caught my eye
It was Lena passing by

Right then and there I knew
This was the girl for me
As we looked at each other
She smiled and I asked her name

As she spoke I could tell
I would never be quite the same
I said will you come go with me
To a calypso jamboree

And dance the calypso, rock and roll a go-go
Lena don't tеll me no
And dance the calypso, rock and roll a go-go
Lеna don't tell me no

As we stood there together
Gazing at the open sea
I couldn't help telling her
What she meant to a guy like me
With such beauty and with such class
For I knew that I must act fast
I had to find a way to make Lena go with me
I could see she was anxious to go but she hesitate
She was afraid to agree with a stranger for a date

As the sun slowly slipped away
I was happy to hear her say
She would dance the calypso

Rock and roll a go-go
Lena I'm happy so
And dance the Calypso
Rock and roll a go-go
Lena I'm happy so

Carnival is tomorrow we're gonna have a ball
I know that Lena will be the prettiest girl of all
All the fellows will envy me
They'll be poppin' their eyes to see

When we dance together
We will want nowhither
They will want to get her
I will tell them never
Dancing the calypso
Rock and roll a go-go
Lena I love you so
Attention everybody I have a message for all of we
Attention everybody I have a message for all of we
Yes I'm out of desperation all thru the nation
We have to live peacefully, let's join the races in harmony

Black and white together
We must love one another
Black and white together
All of we are brothers, yes

Black and white and white and black and
Black and whitе and white and black and
Lets live in harmony with pеace, justice and equality
Lord yes in harmony with freedom and liberty

The black man is small and mighty
Like Dr. King and Mohammed Ali
The white man is very powerful
He could unite the whole world in brotherhood

Together we can build a nation
Of love and integration
We don't have to go to the moon
The earth has plenty of room yes
Integration today is the future of the USA
Foundations we must build
For the young generations provide the skills

The future is in our hands
So let's unite and plan, plan, plan
Let me hear you now all together
Black and white forever yes
Carnival time here in this land
An old familiar custom you will understand
Everyone looking so bright and gay
Calypso songs from the break of day

Carnival starting
People line up watching
As the bands go dancing by
Pease and rice cooking

Curry goat and lamb stewing
This is the season for carnival
This is the season for carnival
This is the season for carnival
This is the season for carnival

Lovely woman from far and near
Come to Trinidad this time of year
Young lovers strolling through the town
Caressed by the music that's all around
Lady's bracelets in the market ringing
Little children dancing and singing
All the happy faces you'll see
Gеtting ready for the jamboree
In 1876 on that bright summer morn at the Little Bighorn
The arrogant Custer caught a few licks
When he tried to stand up to the Cheyenne and the Sioux
He was confident he'd win the fight
But he underrated the Indian's might

Of White Bull, Iron Lightning, Swift Bear and Gall
Black Moon, Little Wolf, Crazy Horse
And Sitting Bull chief of them all oh, oh
Oh Sitting Bull chief of them all

Oh the Indians tried to live in peace
On that bright summer morn at the Little Bighorn
They signed the treaty that warship cease
The white man was cold he wanted gold
He killed all the buffalo, destroyed the corn
Even brought unknown diseases to the unborn

Custer's Cavalry pressed the attack
On that bright summer morn at the Little Bighorn
They thought they had driven the Indians back
But like a wave came an ocean of braves
Custer exclaimed to the noonday sun
Tell me where all these red-skins is coming from
Well it wasn't long 'for the dust settle down
On that bright summer morn at the Little Bighorn
The soldiers was spread all over the ground
The battle was gone the braves had won
Custer's men had fought their best
But the Indians had stood the test
I was walking down the road one day
When I pass a horse and a fat donkey
I overheard the donkey say
She was a movin' up in society

Seem she merry common law
To a donkey man but he had no class
She wanted to make a baby but
Not if the father was an ass

The ways of the world are very strange
Laws and pagan never change
The elegant donkey wanted class
That's why they call she jack-ass
Jack-ass, Jack-ass, Jack-ass

Well it happen in the early Spring
When the circus came she went to see
Got to know an elephant
A little too intimately
Oh the elephant ask please merry me
The donkey agree oh pity she
It's too late now to change she mind
She's in society

Well now my friends the baby born
Half donkey, half elephant
And if you see the mother now
She's only got embarrassment

Say de baby is elite
Not a common ass as it should be
And when it walking down the street
The tail ain't where it ought to be
Well now Harry's incommunicado today
And he asked me to tell you his provado is all gone away
Ah yes he's so tired today and he's sorry to keep you waiting
Now well maybe tomorrow he'll be better by far

Yes and maybe he'll see things the way they really are
Ah but he's so tired today and he's sorry to keep you waiting
But it doesn't seem to be much of importance going on any way
And he's sorry

Just a short walk in the garden, once the flowers is fine
And maybe some small talk never going me on
Ah well hе's so tired today and he's sorry to keep you waiting
But it doesn't seem to bе much of importance going on any way

And he's sorry, and he's sorry, Yes he's sorry, yes he's sorry
But it doesn't seem to be much of importance going on any way
If only it were yesterday when time belong to me
So many things I've yet to do so many sights to see
A thousand lines I never wrote and songs I've never sung
If only it were yesterday when still the world was young

If only it were yesterday when I was still a king
When winter could be wished away and overnight was spring
When all the world was spinning in a plan of my design
If only it were yesterday when still your love was minе

Yesterday pain was something I could nеver know
Such a long, long time ago
If you were here beside me now
I'd never ask for more

For I have come to realize
What every day is for
I need you here to bring the sun
My world has turned to gray
If only it were yesterday before you'd gone away
Where's that smile, hope you didn't lose it
Put it on again and wear it once with me
Sure I know, there's been some time between us
But I had to stand back some. To get the room to see

It's all right now, hold on tight now
I'll be staying, I won't go
Don't you cry now, we can try now
Just take some distance to know

We were so close we almost didn't make it
So close but it looks like we're alright
So close I almost couldn't see you
So close but it looks like we're alright

We're all right
What a day remember it was еven raining
When I said goodbye, I didn't wanna lеave
Just one look, you could see my eyes were asking
And I could feel yours pulling at my sleeve
It's all right now, hold on tight now
I'll be staying, I won't go
Don't you cry now, we can try now
Just take some distance to know

We were so close we almost didn't make it
So close but it looks like we're alright
So close I almost couldn't see you
So close but it looks like we're alright
We're all right
My old man had a rounder's soul
He'd hear an old freight train then he'd have to go

He came through town back before the war
Didn't even know what it was he was lookin' for
Carried a tattered bag for his violin
Full of lots of songs of the places that he'd been

He talked real easy had a smiling way
He could pass along to you when his fiddle played
Makin' people drop their cares and woes
To hum out loud those tunes that his fiddle bowed

This fiddler's eye caught one bеauty there
She had that rollin' flowing' glowing kind of hair
Hе played for her as if she danced alone
He played his favorites songs the ones he called his own

He played until she was the last to go
Then he stopped and packed his case and said he'd take her home
And all the nights that passed a child was born
All the years that passed love would keep them warm
Making people drop their cares and woes
To hum out loud those tunes that his fiddle bowed

Well the train one morning blew a lonesome sound
As if she sang the blues of what it took from town
And all that I recall and said when I was young
Was no one else could rally sing those songs he sung

Making people drop their cares and woes
To hum out loud those tunes that his fiddle bowed
Well it just takes one step to start a journey
No matter how far you may go
No matter how far you may go

It just takes you smiling to fill me with sunshine
And change my life ever so
And change my life ever so

Well something's a person can't understand
No matter how much he thinks knows
No matter how much he may know

Yes it just takes one step to start a journey
No matter how far you may go
No matter how far you may go
Love will abide
Take things in stride
Sounds like good advice
But there's no one at my side

And time washes clean
Love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me
But I don't know what it means

'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long, long time

Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me
When you never let me near

And I never drew
One response from you
All the while you fell
All over girls you never knew
'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think it's gonna hurt me
For a long, long time

I'm waiting for the day, you'll go away
Yes I know you warned me
Of the price I'd have to pay

Oh life's full of loss
Tell me who knows the cost
We're living in the memory
Of the love that never was

'Cause I've done everything I know
Woman to try and change your mind
Well I hope I'm gonna miss you
For a long, long time

'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long, long time
Something to hold on to
Everybody needs
Something that can’t slip
Right through your fingers

Lookin’ for that reason
Reason to believe
Something to hold on to
And I’m holding on to you

Something to hold on to
Like a baby’s hand
Something there’s no way
Of letting go

Can’t get by without it
There’s no one who can
Something to hold on to
And I’m holding on to you

All the way up
All the way down
Taking the short or long way 'round
What if this is all that there is
I’ve got enough to keep me going
I have no possessions
That can’t be thrown away
Your love is my one and only treasure

Nothing last forever
But this one’s gonna stay
It’s something to hold on to
And I’m holding on to you
People everywhere
Are marching to the fair
Oh yo yo yo yo yo yo yo
Children stop and stare
Some women marching bare
Oh yo yo yo yo yo yo yo

You'll see everyone in town
On their way to common ground
To see the bands go round and round
And if everything go right
And no one make a fight
They can go dancing through the night

Excitement in the air
For everyone who's there
Oh yo yo yo yo yo yo yo
No one have a care
They letting down their hair
Oh yo yo yo yo yo yo yo
Some of them courting there
Othеrs cavorting there
Some of thеm haughty there
Most of them naughty there

Watch out what you wear
It only going to tear
Oh yo yo yo yo yo yo yo
Those that no in pair
Might ask you for a share
Oh yo yo yo yo yo yo yo

All year you sad
You work like man
Keep you in line
With jail or fine
And if you talk
Last mile you walk
But today free
They let you be

People everywhere
Are marching to the fair
Oh yo yo yo yo yo yo yo
Children stop and stare
Some women marching bare
Oh yo yo yo yo yo yo yo

Listen to this
Through Olga I miss
My carnival band
I drink up all kind of alcohol
Just before carnival

Me head start to spin
Me knees start to buck
Me whole body start to rock
Tired, sleepy, broke-up
So I asked her to wake me up

Olga, Olga
I hearin' a boom, boom, boom
Olga, Olga
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom my darling

Olga, do do
I hearin' a steel pan
It's an old tradition
To jump in the band
I telling you friend
She wake me up 'bout half an hour too late
So I grab me hat, and my shoes
And I gone running straight through the gate

When I look back was Olga
With a fifth of rum in she hand
She say I come to ask for forgiveness
And to join the carnival band

Olga, Olga
I hearin' a boom, boom, boom
Olga, Olga
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom my darling

Olga, do do
I hearin' a steel pan
It's an old tradition
To jump in the band

You can't drop asleep that time of the year
Or you go miss all the fun
Singing, dancing, loving еach other
No class distinction

The air is clean, thе food is fresh
That's the life in the West Indies
And if the people was sleeping
There'll be no calypsos like these
Mama look at the band passing...
Olga, Olga
I hearin' a boom, boom, boom
Olga, Olga
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom my darling

Olga, do do
I hearin' a steel pan
It's an old tradition
To jump in the band

No one alive
Will ever know
What carnival mean to me
If I'm absent from carnival

Me soul does leave me body
Carnival time I feel like a king
Everybody join in and sing
'Til the carnival is over

Olga, Olga
I hearin' a boom, boom, boom
Olga, Olga
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom my darling

Olga, do do
I hearin' a steel pan
It's an old tradition
To jump in the band
Mama look at the band passing...
One day I was walking
My darling under a cloud, under a cloud
And I heard
A little mum-mumbling in the cloud, in the cloud

She's a sunbird, a sunbird
That sings along with the sky
Let her sing, let her sing
Let her sing until the morning, 'til it comes

Sing her song
Her song of farewell
Sunbird
Let her fly, let her fly
Let her fly into tomorrow all alone

She must go, she must go
She must go and find herself another song
A song of new hope, new hope, new hope, new hope
For the tune of the night is almost gone
Sunbird
The taxi cabs driving me crazy
How come dey always leaving me
Oh yes the young man drive away
Quick quick when he hear me say
One twenty-fifth and Lenox please
Don't you know
The taxi gone with the breeze

Sixteen miles I walk, walk, walk, walk
Waiting on a taxi here in New York
I didn't get home until ten o'clock
Sixteen miles I walk, walk, walk, walk

Waiting on a taxi here in New York
I didn't get home until ten o'clock
Poor boy don't you know taxi won't go
No, no, no ,no

I continued  walking the journey
Lord knows me feet was killing me
Out of nowhere up come a taxi
And he decided to take me
He ask me what's my destiny
Harlem for sure mister cabby
Just as soon as I hop in
The man holler out - no gasoline

Sixteen miles I walk, walk, walk, walk
Waiting on a taxi here in New York
I didn't get home until ten o'clock
Sixteen miles I walk, walk, walk, walk

Waiting on a taxi here in New York
I didn't get home until ten o'clock
Poor boy don't you know taxi won't go
No, no, no ,no

Taxi hey mister taxi
What's the big hurry
I decided to forget the taxi
And take the subway Lord have mercy
Six inches of snow and I freezing
All I try - I couldn't stop sneezing

I took the downtown express you know
And is uptown I really want to go
Completely lost and beat
Still looking for a taxi out on Chambers Street
Sixteen miles I walk, walk, walk, walk
Waiting on a taxi here in New York
I didn't get home until ten o'clock
Sixteen miles I walk, walk, walk, walk

Waiting on a taxi here in New York
I didn't get home until ten o'clock
Poor boy don't you know taxi won't go
No, no, no ,no

The Manhattan taxi ain't joking
They ain't going to Harlem or de Bronx
If ever they stop you'll be lucky
How come they always off duty

When you take the subway you take a chance
Keep your hands in your jacket and your pants
Don't you sleep on the train
'Cause you may never wake up again

Sixteen miles I walk, walk, walk, walk
Waiting on a taxi here in New York
I didn't get home until ten o'clock
Sixteen miles I walk, walk, walk, walk

Waiting on a taxi here in New York
I didn't get home until ten o'clock
Poor boy don't you know taxi won't go
No, no, no ,no
The river come down
The river come down
River come down
I can't cross over
Why-o, why-o, why-o
I can't cross over

I wanted to go down
To the other side  of town
There was water all around
And I couldn't cross over
Why-o, why-o, why-o
I can't cross over

Well a gal she come by
And I give she the eye
So she started to sigh
And I couldn't cross over
Why-o, why-o, why-o
I can't cross over
The river come down
The river come down
River come down
And I couldn't cross over
Why-o, why-o, why-o
I can't cross over

Now bird he can fly
Foggy jump high
Fishеs never dive
And I couldn't cross ovеr
Why-o, why-o, why-o
I can't cross over

A well I stole me a kiss
I couldn't resist
Just think what I'd a miss
If I could have crossed over
Why-o, why-o, why-o
I can't cross over

The river come down
The river come down
River come down
And I couldn't cross over
Why-o, why-o, why-o
I can't cross over
I had a curiosity
Now I got a family
Bouncing baby on my knee
'Cause I couldn't cross over
Why-o, why-o, why-o
I can't cross over

So when you see your neighbor daughter
Better run for the water
You'll do things you hadn't ought to
If you can't cross over
Why-o, why-o, why-o
I can't cross over

The river come down
The river come down
River come down
And I couldn't cross over
Why-o, why-o, why-o
I can't cross over
Heard you were looking for a permanent home
All I had was what I could carry
I know You're a gypsy and could teach me to fly
They told me that your name was Mary

Mary can fly, Mary don’t cry
She makes love by the ocean
When I am down, Mary come ‘round
Yes I carry Mary down to the ocean
Yes I carry Mary down to the ocean

When I was young I used to think about love
Wondered how to tell it was real now
Mary she kissed me then she smiled and she said
You can tell it by the way that it feels now

Mary can fly, Mary don't cry
She makеs love by the ocean
Whеn I am down Mary come ‘round
Yes I carry Mary down to the ocean
Yes I carry Mary down to the ocean
Mary makes magic and she does it so well
That's the reason that I can’t refuse her
I told her my secrets, but she'll never tell
That's the reason that I don't want to lose her
That's the reason that I don't want to lose her

Mary can fly, Mary don't cry
She makes love by the ocean
When I am down, Mary come ‘round
Yes I carry Mary down to the ocean
Yes I carry Mary down to the ocean

(Mary can fly, Mary don't cry
She makes love by the ocean
When I am down, Mary come ‘round
Yes I carry Mary down to the ocean
Yes I carry Mary down to the ocean)

She can fly, She don’t cry
She won’t turn me down
When I come to town
She makes magic

Ain't no dollar trick
Does it all with ease
Makes you want to please
Carry Mary down to the ocean
Tol’ me love was real
It's the way it feels
She can fly
She don't cry
Some say love it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love is a flower
And you its only seed

It’s the heart afraid of breaking
That never leans to dance
It’s the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It’s the one who won’t be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never leans to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the Winter
Far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun’s love
In the Spring becomes the rose
Broken promise
Lies open in a corner of the room
Empty feelings
Hang in the air like old perfume

Rhymes and reasons
Still wait untaken in my hand
Old excuses
There’s nothing here to understand

I told you, I told you
Too much about me, I don’t know
I told you, I told you
Always is just too far to go

Shadows, distance
I watch them fall across your face
I can’t touch them
And you can’t hide them any place

Endless circles
We’ve been here many times before
There’s no change now
You just can’t take it anymore
I told you, I told you
Too much about me, I don’t know
I told you, I told you
Always is just too far to go
I told you
Have you seen the old man in the closed down market
Kicking up the papers with his worn out shoes
In his eyes you see no pride, hand held loosely by his side
Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old girl who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
Shе's no time for talking, she just keeps on walking
Carrying her homе in two carrier bags

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

In the all night cafe at a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup
Each tea lasts an hour, and he wanders home alone
So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old man outside the seaman's mission
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears?
In our winter city the rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero and a world that doesn't care

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind
Kept apart for oh so long
How I’ve done without you I don’t know
And now as I recall the road we’ve traveled on
It goes on and on
Loving you is where I belong
Having you here with me would be like coming home
How I feel when I get to hold you is telling it all

Now you come to me at last
And put the miles between us in the past
And as I welcome you my smile, and tears
Can leave no doubt, I know…

Loving you is where I belong
Having you here with me is like coming home
How I feel when I get to hold you is telling it all

Think of all the things ahead
All the promise in the words we said
And as I dream about the road we’ll travel on
I know…
Loving you is where I belong
Having you here with me
Is like coming home
How I feel when I get to hold you is telling it all
Loving you is where I belong
We’ll always belong

The hotel room collecting dust
Of loneliness and broken trust
A thousand strangers left behind
Hollow laughter through the walls
Shake the dust until it falls
Inside my mind

She just left a vague good bye
No words no signs no reasons why
It’s over
I don’t need her
It’s very easy not to care
I don’t need her

Just close the door and stand beware
I don’t need her
She can’t touch me anymore
I don’t need her

The mirror echoes with my face
It doesn’t seem to fit the place
My feelings lie
I don’t need hеr
The night is giving into grey
Finally therе's the light of day
It does go by
The streets is filled with faceless names
They’ll be my forgetting games
They’ll keep me going

I don’t need her
It’s very easy not to care
I don’t need her
Just close the door and stand beware

I don’t need her
She can’t touch me anymore
I don’t need her
I don’t need her

It’s very easy not to care
Just close the door and stand beware
I don't need her
She can’t touch me anymore
I don’t need her
No no I really don’t need her
I really don’t need her
It was a cloudy morning in Oulundi
I could see the rain in your eye
I was lookin’ for a word to somehow make it right
But the only word I found was goodbye

I watched you from the doorway walkin’ over the hill
Your hand shadow wavin’
Wavin’ in the air and me saying he’ll be back
He’ll be back over and over like a prayer

Monday to Monday, scratching in the gold dust
You were so far so far away

Monday, Monday sometimes I’m forgettin’
The memory of your sweet face slips away

Monday to Monday but he’ll be home
Sometime I’ll be home

It’s terrible-terrible loving you from so far
Our flower struggling in the desert sand
Watered with the dry words on scraps of paper
Written by a stranger’s hand
But one day our home will green again
And our babies they will play under the Jacaranda tree
You and I will be loving close, close
A day will come when we’ll be free

Monday to Monday a mile down in the darkness
Prayin’, prayin’ to Morena
Monday to Monday, I can’t ride on the blue train
Watching for you by the roadside

Monday to Monday I’m fighting with the feeling
So far, so far, so far away
But I’ll be home someday
He’ll be coming home

Monday to Monday a way down in the darkness
Praying praying to Morena
Monday to Monday, mina neizobuya
Monday to Monday thinking on your sweet eyes
Thinking, thinking on your strong hands

Monday to Monday, time she sure go slowly
Monday to Monday, can’t ride, ride on the blue train
Monday to Monday, one day I’ll be coming home
Monday to Monday, hold on to yesterday
I see your red skirt splashing up against your thighs
You makin’ pretty moves, makin’ moves that smile my eyes
Your plaited hair it’s catching gold from Azanian skies
Your motion is a magic that takes me by surprise

(sweet sister hmm my sister)

Soft mounds bouncing to the rhythm of your dance
You seem to have a thousand ways to get my heart to France
You got a laugh like little mossies, fluttering in the air

(sweet sister, ah sweet sister of mine)

Sisiwami, I am a man who’s bound by doubtful things
Sisiwami, a man who’s tangled in his strings
Sisiwami, but to see you dancing sets me free
Sisiwami, you do a beautiful thing to me
Sisiwami, oh sweet sister can’t you see
Sisiwami, you do a beautiful thing to me
Sisiwami, oh, a beautiful thing to me
The way your body’s shaping to the sounds of your song
Your long brown arms snaking, so proud and strong
Oh to see you strutting down, it’s where you belong
When you’re in motion girl, nothing can go wrong

(Sweet sister, ah sweet sister of mine)

Silver bracelets rattling to the rhythms on your feet
Balancing your goods as you come strutting down the street
There’s a twinkle in your sing song talk
A sparkle in your jive
In these terrible-terrible times, you keep my heart alive

Sweet sister you’re so fine
Sweet sister of mine
The storm clouds have gathered
The young lions prowl
Prowl outside your precious metal wall
The children of your sheep
Have begun to growl
And your diamond barricade is soon to fall

We see our babies starving at the edges
Of your feast
But still you're holding fast to all your lies
A new rage is rising that your torture cannot kill
And now the time has passed for compromise

You killed the truth at Sharpville
You crushed the voice of peace
Now everyday a bitter anger grows
The young gangs prepare for war their fear burned in the flame
You Lilly white will be a blood red rose

The liberation funerals, the terror in the streets
The wounds that you refused to let us heal
The madness of your method
Has brought a white hot heat
Your fire of hate is forging hearts of steel
Homeless in our homelands
Aliens in our own lands
Hungry men with gold dust on our shoes
Our patience and our sanity
Has now turn into rage
The rage of souls with nothing left to lose

Move it
Move it
Move it

[Verse 1: Madonna, Babyface]
Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)
Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
(No one around)
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

[Verse 2: Madonna, Babyface]
Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breaking my heart
(Breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
(Just make them smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
(Role that you played)
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)

[Bridge: Madonna, Babyface]
All the world is a stage (World is a stage)
And everyone has their part (Has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story’d go?
How was I to know you'd break (You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart?

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you
(I've always been in love with you)
I guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?

Round the bay of Mexico

Round the bay of Mexico

Some beans and rice to soothe my taste

Put some kerchiefs in my bag

Tell a tale or two so I can really brag
Round the bay of Mexico

You talk about jewels and you talk about crime
In the city it's a pity if you don't look glittery
Fans in the crowd lookin' shook and shiverin'
Scared that there's gonna be a brawl or fight

So freak out everybody and pump your fists
And if you swingin' 'em fists
Break it up, break it up, break it up
And work your body
Cause there's really no reason to hurt nobody
So bring that beat back with the powerful impact
We packin' up the place with the positive contact
Intoxicate your whole mind, body and soul
*That's the Peas rhyme*, then you be on the roll

A handgun with some monkey nuts, that's all I want for Christmas
All I want for Christmas is a couple niggas missin'
A big ol' bag of firearms and plenty ammunition
All I want for Christmas is my Glock with the extension
A handgun with some monkey nuts, that's all I want for Christmas
All I want for Christmas is a couple niggas missin'
A big ol' bag of firearms and plenty ammunition

[Verse 1]
Free my niggas out the system, all I want for Christmas
Plus my MAC back with the cooler system in case they get to trippin'
Can't fall victim to pussy niggas, never catch me slippin'

And I been in every zone in every city

All I want for Christmas is a couple niggas missin'
A big ol' bag of firearms and plenty ammunition

Take a nigga back to '06 when I 

[?] on Christmas
I was bustin' bricks down, cuttin' it up with scissors
That young nigga got fired up, playin' with Guwop Christmas
Whole house just got tied up on the floor, lookin' like Twister
Opps gettin' caught on Christmas, wipe a nigga nose on Christmas
I don't give a fuck about none of that shit, if you catch his ass down bad, get him
OG just did twenty years, they didn't even see him on Christmas
Worst feelin' in the world, bein' locked up on Christmas

[Chorus]
All I want for Christmas is my Glock with the extension
A handgun with some monkey nuts, that's all I want for Christmas
All I want for Christmas is a couple niggas missin'
A big ol' bag of firearms and plenty ammunition

[Intro]
Like the Grinch
It's Wop (J. White, I need a beat I can go—)

[Verse 1]
Like the Grinch, I woke up and chose violence
I got your whole label deal in one diamond
Y'all 'bout to make me bring my chopper out retirement
I'm from the six, I'm just a product of my environment
I'm the trap president, I'm not Biden
And all my niggas never slippin', but we slidin'
A nigga try to be me, but keep tryin'
I fall off when a pig start flyin'
I sell the dope before the dope stop dryin'
I won't stop supplyin' til they stop buyin'
My lil' boy ain't evеn one, but he a giant
And for his birthday I might buy him a lion (Wop)

[Chorus]
Like thе Grinch
It's Wop (J. White, I need a beat I can go off on, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I'm Mr. Claus of givin' bricks out on consignment
I feel like Daniel, you can throw me in the lion's den
My country boy, he on the way, he want another ten
I had to cook the dope again, give it another spin
I'm like the local barbershop, I gotta shave 'em
And then I put 'em back together then I tape 'em
I'm at the brick factory, this where I made them
I got 'em in the oven now, I had to bake 'em
I had to pay a couple men to help me rake it in
Got cameras watchin' everything, hope they don't raid again
The plug just hit me and he say they gon' be late again
Might have to stretch this shit again, but it's gettin' very thin
Some think I 

[?] East Atlanta, I can't understand
Don't try to be no helping hand 'cause they'll cut off your hand
I know the Bible say you should not kill another man
But I can't let no other nigga get the upper hand (It's Gucci)

[Chorus]

Me and you could probably link since opposites attractable (Huh?)
'Cause I'm so rich and you so broke but that shit wouldn't be practical (Nah)
These people always ask me what I do for recreation time (Huh?)
I hustle through the holidays, I don't even get vacation time

Don't believe in wastin' time, it ain't no way replacin' time (Time)
Took some time and did the time, you took the stand and dropped the dime (Great)
My bitch is a hustler, a chick like that is hard to find (Nah)
Came so far from mixing dime, I'm hustlin' through the 165 (It's Gucci)

Big ol' golden gates, you at the Gucci Mane estates (It's Gucci)
It's money on the table, by your head, let's say the grace (Let's say the grace)
Got that sport protectin' me, them bricks I had to take (I had to take)

When it comes to hustlin', I go down as one of the greatest (Greatest)
Come pull up to my table, yeah, I'm passin' out the plates (Let's eat)
All my hitmen, now they peepin' out the drapes
My hustle just ain't local, now my shit move state to state (Wop)
Say you wanna be like Wop, I think your plan is great (It's great)
The difference between me and you, I came up moving weight (Wop)
Iced out like a hockey rink, but I don't even skate (Brr)
Icing on top all my bricks, they think I'm moving cake (Word)

[Chorus]
Show me something, pay me if you owe me if you owe me some (Yeah)

[Intro]
Damn (J. White, I need a beat I can go off on, ooh)

[Verse]
Beam on your nose like Rudolph
Keep a bomb on me like Eric Rudolph
Like a dog on mute, got the roof off
And like the Super Bowl, I take a nigga roof off
Got a good fight game we can duke out
A nigga touch Gucci Mane, that's a shootout
I'ma take your name off, no white out
It be a dark day in hell like a light out
You dumb as hell tryin wop, shot out
Got dummies tryna crash like Lunch pass
You a spirit from the past, you a ghost dad
You dead, I'm lock, we both sad
Put a beam on your nose like a red nose
Closed case like the casket with the red rosе
Let's get one thing hеre clear dear
This gun right here could can kill an antelope
Got a drum on it bigger than a cantaloupe
Chopper choppin' down trees like Geronimo
Fed is knocking on the door like it's Domino's
I'm at the hospital 'cause you're only comatose
Last night it was Halloween, fright night
Got 'em searching for the body with a flashlight
This double barrel here kill two deers
Crack your head like a beer, happy new year
Why an' why an' why 'an why
Why an' why an' why
Why an' why an' why an' why
Why an' why an' why

[Laughing]
Why an' why an' why an' why
Why an' why an' why
Because, because, because, because
Goodnight, goodnight

Why can't a mouse eat a streetcar
Why an' why an' why
Because a mouse's stomach is too small to hold a streetcar
Goodnight, goodnight
Why does a camel drink water
Why an' why an' why
Because a camel gets thirsty
Like you and me and everybody else does
Goodnight, goodnight

Why can't a cow have kittens
Why an' why an' why
Because a cow has little calves and a cat has little kittеns
And besides it's easiеr this way
Goodnight, goodnight

Why don't you answer my questions
Why an' why an' why
'Cause I don't know the answers
Goodnight, goodnight

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks and Dennis Edwards]
Hear that sound
The hammers pound and pound
From sun up to sundown
Men from all walks of life
Are livin' here in shame
Now they're known by numbers
They've been stripped of their name

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
Oh, breaking rocks
Serving my time
So I can get out to find
Peace of mind
Jailer, bring me water (Jailer, bring me water)
I can't pound no longer
Ooh, uh! Ooh uh, uh!

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks and Dennis Edwards]
In the morning I slave in the hot sun for little or no wage
At night I'm locked in, like an animal in a cage
Man stunted on me with a gun
Sayin' "I bet a man"
Oh, in a hole I havе to spend
The rest of my timе

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks]
Hey, breaking rocks, y'all
Serving my time
So I can get out to find
Peace of mind
Jailer, bring me water (Jailer, bring me water)
I can't pound no longer

[Interlude: Dennis Edwards and Melvin Franklin]
Ow, hold it steady right there while I hit it, hit it!
While I'm breakin' it down, I'm gonna get it now

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks and Dennis Edwards]
Inside these walls, the days seem to never end
In this place there's no such thing as a friend
Sometimes, sometimes, I wish I was there
I can't get no sleep, I've got rats in my bed, ooh

[Chorus: Dennis Edwards and Eddie Kendricks]
Breaking rocks
Serving my time
So I can get out to find
Peace of mind
Jailer, bring me water (Jailer, bring me water)
Or I'll surely be a goner

[Outro]
Free me from this ball and chain, somebody
Somebody help this slave
Free me from this ball and chain, somebody
Somebody help this slave (Free me, free me)
Free me from this ball and chain, somebody
Somebody help this slave
Free me from this ball and chain, somebody
Somebody help this slave (Free me, free me)
Don't whisper things to me you don't mean
For words down deep inside can be seen by the night
The night has a thousand eyes
And it knows a truthful heart from one that lies

Though romance may have called in the past
My love for you will be everlasting and bright
As bright as the starlit skies
And this wondrous night that has a thousand eyes

I've live my life walking thru a dream
For I knew that I would find this moment supreme
A night of bliss and tender sighs
And the smiling dawn of a thousand eyes
The night has a thousand eyes

Quiet, I’ll Forever Hold Your Piece
Better find God 'fore He find me
Tell the Devil good night, go to sleep
Windin’, windin’ roads a windin’
Home is getting far away
Will I see my love come springtime
Or when I am old and gray

Long ago I took to wandering
Had to see beyond the hill
I left my sweetheart there a waiting
Wonder if she’s waiting still

Oh I met a gal in Kansas city
Painted face and flaming hair
She took my love and stole my money
Broke my heart and left me there

Well I trailed her clear up to Wyoming
And one fine day in early spring
I rode up so soft and easy
Shot and killed that pretty thing

Now I’m living in the shadows
Starting up at every sound
Causе haunted men have rocky pillows
And bеd down on the cold, cold ground
Now my mother’s prayers can’t save me
And my young dreams won’t come true
So set the shroud it’s all to even
Cause dying is all I’ve left to do

Oh it’s windin’, windin’ roads a windin’
Home is getting far away
Will I see my love come Springtime
Or when I am old and grey
Simple, simple, life is a simple tune
Simple, simple, simple like an exercise
That’s the song I’m writing ‘bout my darling’s eyes
Play it on the piano or a sweet celeste
Just so when she hears it
She will feel she’s been caressed

Simple, simple, simple not a symphony
Life is oh so simple ‘cause my love loves me
Play it sweet and simple, gently I insist
Just so when she hears it
She will know that she’s been kissed

Life is oh so simple like a melody
When I can give all my love to thee
Life is oh so simple like a melody
When he can give all his love to me

Simple, simple, simple like an exercise
That’s the song I’m singing
‘Bout my darling’s eyes
I will sing it softly like a cooing dove
I put it on a record and I’ll send it to my love
You better listen, you better listen
You better listen, you better listen

As I was walking thru the woods one day
I saw a strange man walking on his way
I stopped him to talk awhile and hear his story told
And as he talked this story did he unfold

My daddy was an oak tree, my mama was a deer
I was born one morning in the Spring of the year
I cut me out a heart from yellow daffodil
My feet are made of dust from the road o’er the hill

When I weep my tears are deep
Deep enough to fill the sea
I’m a lonesome man ‘cause thеre’s only one like mе
Yes there’s only one like me

What an awful, awful fate to be one of a kind
No matter where you roam
You may never ever find all your natural peace of mind
And never find a home
Oh the cruel war is raging
Your daddy must fight
And I know I will miss you
From morning till night

You cannot go with me
It grieves my heart so
You cannot go with me
Oh no my son no

For your waist is to slender
Your fingers to small
And your cheeks are to tender
To take the cannonball

They will give me shiny medals
They'll call "the killing brave"
But I'd rather hold my darling son
Then fill a thousand graves

I will fight through the winter
Through Summer, Spring and Fall
And there's many a man that I will kill
That I never known at all
O listen, oh listen to me Johnny
And heave my story well
There's no glory in the killing
Just the agony of hell

Oh the cruel war is raging
Your daddy must fight
And I know I will miss you
From morning till night
It was early last December
As near as I remember
Oh I staggered down the street
In tipsy pride

Soon I lay down in the gutter
Thinking thoughts I cannot utter
When a pig came up
And lay down by my side

Two old ladies passing by
Oh gave me the choiceness eye
And laying there I over heard one say
Stststst, uh,uh,uh,uh

You can tell a man who boozes
By the company he chooses
Then the pig got up and slowly walked away
Sailor man, stay away from me daughter
I'm telling you sailor man, stay away from me daughter
You come and go as free as wind blows over the water
I ought to know, I once was a sailor man

Sailor man stay away from me daughter
She always keeps in mind everything her mother taught her
And you will never want to leave if once you caught her

I ought to know, I ought to know
It happened to me when I was a sailor man
I ought to know it happened to me when I was a sailor man
Sailor man stay away from me daughter
Look over yonder hot sun turning over
Look over yonder hot sun turning over
And it won't go down Lord it won't go down

Did you ever hear the cuckoo bird a calling
Did you ever hear the cuckoo bird a calling
Sure sign of rain Lord, sure sign of rain

I've been a hammer since last December
I've been a hammer since last December
And I'm almost dead Lord, I'm almost dead

I've been a wondering if anybody wonders
I've been a wondering if anybody wonders
Talk to me, talk to me
About poor me Lord, 'bout poor me

Look over yonder hot sun turning ovеr
Look over yonder hot sun turning over
And it won't go down Lord it won't go down
Bе my woman gal, I'll be your man
Be my woman gal, I'll be your man

Everyday's a Sunday dollar in-a your hand
Everyday's a Sunday dollar in-a your hand

Hup there Rosy, hup there Rosy, hup there Rosy

Stick to the promise gal that you made me
You wasn't gonna marry till I go free

When she walk she reel and rock behind
Ain't that enough to make a convict smile
Oh sometimes you sing for the money
Sometimes you sing for the show
Sometimes you sing for those dewy eyed darlings
It still makes them cry don't you know

One time you sang for the glory
But the glory didn't last very long
From the haze to the stage back to the days
When you used to sing for the song

Sing for the song boys
Just like you did when you stood on that corner
And didn't even feel the cold
Sing for the song boys
Just like you did before all of the cocaine
And flash bulbs and bright painted ladiеs
That haunted your soul

Sing for the song boys
Just like you did whеn you stood on that corner
And didn't even feel the cold
Sing for the song boys
Just like you did before all of the cocaine
And flash bulbs and bright painted ladies
That haunted your soul
Comes the time when you don't make much money
And you don't put on much of a show
And those dewy eyed darlings
Next week will be crying
For somebody else don't you know

Now your tune is becoming your burden
Words are all twisted and wrong
And the song that you sell
Don't taste quite as well
As when you used to sing for the song

Sing for the song boys
Just like you did when you stood on that corner
And didn't even feel the cold
Sing for the song boys
Just like you did before all of the cocaine
And flash bulbs and bright painted ladies
That haunted your soul

Sing for the song boys
Just like you did when you stood on that corner
And didn't even feel the cold
Sing for the song boys
Just like you did before all of the cocaine
And flash bulbs and bright painted ladies
That haunted your soul
As I wondered round the world so lost and angry
He called me home and reached out for my hand
He spoke with words that sounded more like music
The words my heart could finally understand

He showed me pride and said I could feel better
But no better than the smallest of the small
He showed me victories where no one loses
He showed me the answer for us all

And the song I sing
I sing for you, sweet Martin Luther King
And the song I sing
I sing for you, sweet Martin Luther King

And as we walked the people gathered round him
Open arms the only weapons that they bore
He wore us into cloth of many colors
And armed with love he marched us off to war

And the song I sing
I sing for you, sweet Martin Luther King
And the song I sing
I sing for you, sweet Martin Luther King
The more he spoke of love the more they feared him
The more he spoke the truth their lies would grow
Then suddenly with no good-byes we lost him
My sweet black prince of peace
I miss you so

They cut his dreams down thinking they would not flower
But he planted seeds everywhere he'd gone
So that someday in an endless field of colors
A million dreams would bloom to carry on

And the song I sing
I sing for you, sweet Martin Luther King
And the song I sing
I sing for You, sweet Martin Luther King

And the song I sing
I sing for you, sweet Martin Luther King
And the song I sing
I sing for you, my sweet prince of peace
My sweet prince of peace
I miss you so
Deep as the river, so deep is my loneliness
Deep as the river when we're apart
Cold as the river, so cold are my empty arms
Cold as the river my empty heart
The leaves all a-tremble, tremble no more than I

The stars all assemble and listen to my sigh
Swift as the river that’s running to kiss the sea
Swift as the river may you come back to me

Swift as the river that's running to kiss the sea
Swift as the river may you come back to me
And when I told them how beautiful you are
They didn't believe me, they didn't believe me
Your lips, your eyes, your cheeks, your hair
Are in a class beyond compare

You're the loveliest girl that one could see
And when I tell them, and I'm certainly goin' to tell them
That I'm the man whose wife one day you'll be
They'll never believe me, they'll never believe me
That from this great big world you've chosen me

They'll never believe me, they'll never believe me
That from this great big world you've chosen me
Whispering while you cuddle near me
Whispering so no one can hear me
Each little whisper seems to cheer me
I know it’s true, there’s no one, dear, but you

Whispering why you’ll never leave me
Whispering why you’ll never grieve me
Whisper and say that you’ll believe me
Whispering that I love you
Because I still get a thrill thinking of you
And I still feel your lips kissing me too
Although our love-affair wasn't to be
I wonder if you care, care about me

I still remember that night under the moon
I recall that it all ended to soon
I can't believe you're gone
Memories linger on
'Cause I still get a thrill thinking of you
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
Something here inside
Cannot be denied

They said someday you’ll find
All who love are blind
When you’re heart’s on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tеars I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovеly flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
Smoke gets in your eyes
Don't whisper things to me you don't mean
For words down deep inside can be seen by the night
The night has a thousand eyes
And it knows a truthful heart from one that lies

Though romance may have called in the past
My love for you will be everlasting and bright
As bright as the starlit skies
And this wondrous night that has a thousand eyes

I've live my life walking thru a dream
For I knew that I would find this moment supreme
A night of bliss and tender sighs
And the smiling dawn of a thousand eyes
The night has a thousand eyes
Chimney smoke, chimney smoke
A winding and a whirling
A climbing and a twirling
Chimney smoke, why did I roam
Chimney smoke lead me home

There’s a house on a hill, by an old willow tree
Where the fire-place burning for my love and me
But I got restless and send my goodbye
Now I’m roaming the hills and I’m searching the sky for that

Chimney smoke, chimney smoke
A winding and a whirling
A climbing and a twirling
Chimney smoke, why did I roam
Chimney smoke lead me home

Had an acre of land and a sky full o’ sun
And a woman who loved me and no other one
But like a sparrow one night I took flight
Now I long to be home and I pray for the sight of that
Chimney smoke, chimney smoke
A winding and a whirling
A climbing and a twirling
Chimney smoke, why did I roam
Chimney smoke lead me home

Now I’m riding the rails and I’m making my way
To the house on the hill where I’ll settle and stay
And love my love who loved me in return
By the heart and the house, where the fireplace burns, blowing

Chimney smoke, chimney smoke
A winding and a whirling
A climbing and a twirling
Chimney smoke, why did I roam
Chimney smoke lead me home
Timber, timber
Lord this timber gotta roll

I got to pull this timber 'fore the sun go down
Get it cross that river 'fore the boss comes 'round
Get it on down that dusty road
Come on Jerry let's tow this load

Cryin' timber, timber Lord this timber gotta roll
Timber, timber, Lord this timber gotta roll

Well my old Jerry is an Arkansas mule
Been everywhere and he ain't no fool
Work get heavy, ol' Jerry get sore
Pulled so much he won't pull no more

Cryin' timber, timber Lord this timber gotta roll
Timber, timber, Lord this timber gotta roll

The boss he tried to shoot ol' Jerry in the head
Jerry ducked that bullet and stomped him dead
Stomped that boss till I wanted to scream
Should have killed him 'cause he's so mean
Cryin' timber, timber Lord this timber gotta roll
Timber, timber, Lord this timber gotta roll

Well the boss kicked Jerry and made him jump
Jerry reared and kicked the boss on the rump
Now my old Jerry was good old mule
Had it been me Lord I had a killed that fool

Cryin' timber, timber Lord this timber gotta roll
Timber, timber, Lord this timber gotta roll
On Springfield mountain there did dwell
A handsome youth I knew him well
This handsome youth one day did go
Down to the meadow for to mow

Tu-rudy-nay, tu-rudy-new, tu-rudy-nay-tu-rudy-new
Tu-rudy-nay, tu-rudy-new, tu-rudy-nay-tu-rudy-new

He had not mowed quite 'round the field
When a poison serpent bit his heel
They took him home to Molly dear
Which made him feel so very queer

Tu-rudy-nay, tu-rudy-new, tu-rudy-nay-tu-rudy-new
Tu-rudy-nay, tu-rudy-new, tu-rudy-nay-tu-rudy-new

Now Molly had two ruby lips
With which the poison she did sip
But Molly had a rotten tooth
And so the poison killed them both
Tu-rudy-nay, tu-rudy-new, tu-rudy-nay-tu-rudy-new
Tu-rudy-nay, tu-rudy-new, tu-rudy-nay-tu-rudy-new

Kukla Mu my doll that's you

Kukla kukla Mu

Curley hair and saucer eyes
A little goddess in disguise
Crimson lips and button nose
My love for her just grows and grows

Dimples in her lucid cheeks
Twinkling softly when she speaks
Full of mischief full of fun
A ready smile for ev'ry one
Ever laughing ever gay
Kisses always thrown your way
To see her is to love her too
That's my little kukla Mu

Curley hair, kukla Mu
Saucer eyes, Kukla Mu
Crimson lips, kukla Mu
Kukla Mu my doll that's you
She's pretty as a rainbow after the rain
She's softer than a kitten and sweeter than cane
She's fairer than the flowers that bloom on the hill
She's mine and I love her and I always will

The first time I saw her my first day in town
The strangest thing happen the world spinned around
At first she didn't see me so how was she to know
My heart almost stopped beating kept on repeating

She's pretty as a rainbow after the rain
She's softer than a kitten and sweetеr than cane
She's fairer than thе flowers that bloom on the hill
She's mine and I love her and I always will

Though we've never spoken and we've never met
The thrill of her beauty is hard to forget
But one day I'll tell her 'cause one day she'll be
The joy of my life when I make her my wife, 'cause

She's pretty as a rainbow after the rain
She's softer than a kitten and sweeter than cane
She's fairer than the flowers that bloom on the hill
She's mine and I love her and I always will
Acorn in the meadow
Meadow filled with sun
Sun is shining warm on the meadow
Tree begun
Baby in the cradle
Cradle filled with love
Mama smiling warm on the cradle from above

Rest in the roots when I die

Hе and his woman sitting side of me
And maybe my baby with an acorn of his own

Well I cried all night, not a policeman was in sight
When Imelda get up off the bed-a, she start to play with my finger head-a
I cried out "Stop it, Melda I ticklish, don’t play with my finger"

Lemme go Melda Marcy, you’re bitin’ my finger
Lemme go Melda Marcy, you’re bitin’ my finger
Lemme go Melda Marcy, you’re bitin’ my finger
Lemme go Melda Marcy, you’re bitin’ my finger

She said, "Daddy don’t groan, I’m going to bite you down to the bone"
I felt no pain so what was the use to go and complain
I felt no pain so what was thе use to go and complain. I cried out

Lemmе go Melda Marcy, you’re bitin’ my finger
Lemme go Melda Marcy, you’re bitin’ my finger
Lemme go Melda Marcy, you’re bitin’ my finger

She said, "Daddy it’s no use, the finger taste like pineapple juice "
The louder I shout, the more finger Melda put in her mouth
The louder I shout, the more finger Melda put in her mouth
I cried out "Stop it, Melda I ticklish, not with the finger"
Lemme go Melda Marcy, you’re bitin’ me finger

The blues ain't got a time or a place
Just a lonely heart and a haunted face
It's a fever or pain you can't erase
`Cause the blues ain't got a time or a place

No the blues ain't got a time or a place
Just a lonely heart and a haunted face
It's been reeling around on its own private jag
Playing its painful game of tag

The blues its got the choked up tears
That folks ain't shed for a million years
It'll come it'll go, never leave a trace
Except my friend in your own sad face

So if your high up or low down
Can't speed up or slow down
It'll stay right with you, never miss a beat
`Cause the blues has worked both sides of the street

Swear down every muscle that burst in the sun
'Cause under the skin of everyone
It's fever or pain you can't erase
'Cause the blues ain't got a time or a place
'Cross mountains, oceans in the rain
Hidden out in dark places, where ever there's pain
On high golden slippers or harden bare feet
The blues is dance to every beat

It can change it's beat, it's tune, it's face
And when for to change it, changes the pace
Really got loose with a "what is the use"
And them rock and rolls in a real down spree

And burns fever bright in a Jamboree
Burns fever bright in a Jamboree
It sung it's own story since all this began
For man is the blues, man the blues is man

That's why it don't need a flag or a race
Just a lonely heart and a haunted face
Kept changing it's tunes since all this began
For man is the blues and the blues is man
For man is the blues oh the blues is man
The blues ain't got a time or a place
Just a lonely heart and a haunted face
It's a fever or pain you can't erase
'Cause the blues ain't got a time or a place
No the blues ain't got a time or a place
Just a lonely heart and a haunted face

Sometimes you'll see it run by in a glance
Between lovers embraced in a lovers dance
Then it shouts its story way out loud
In the midst of a laughing lonely crowd

Oh the blues ain't got a time or a place
Just a lonely hеart and a haunted face
It's been thru war it's been thru peacе
It's been thru famine and and it's been thru feast

From the jailhouse floor to the winding road
With a high class bore or target of load
It's always kept to each rhythm and rhyme
Or it's back to step for a long, long time
So don't try to dismiss it 'cause it has a way
It's coming back stronger and lingering longer
Till it's here to stay, till it's here to stay
You can't dismiss it, ´cause it has that way
A coming back stronger and lingering longer
Till it's here to stay, till it's here to stay

It can change it's beat, it's tune, it's face
And when for a change it changes the base
It really can't loose, but what's the use
The rocks and rolls in real down spree

And burns fever bright in a Jamboree
God knows it'll burn in a Jamboree
It sung it's own story since all this began
For man is the blues, man the blues is man

That's why it don't need a flag or a race
Just a lonely heart and a haunted face
Never changed it's tunes since all this began
For man is the blues and blues is man
For man is the blues oh the blues is man
Oh-ho when the sun go down sunflower
Turn around don't want to say goodbye
When the sun go down sunflower
Turn around don't want to say goodbye
Sunflower grieve to see it leave an empty sky
When the sun goes down sunflower
Turn around, don't want to say goodbye

Oh well I'm off to sea, my woman cling to me
Don't want to let me go
Holding me long, with her face bowed down and trembling so
Don't want me to see how much she cry for me
Don't want to let me go

Going out that day, she watch me sail away
Follow me with her eye
When I'm far from land
Still my woman stand follow me with her eye
Her little face holding me long, against the sky
And the last I see she reaching after me
It almost make me cry

[Chorus]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'll hold your hand when you are feeling mad at me
Yeah, when the monsters, they won't go, and your windows don't close
I'll pretend to see what you see
How long, I say, how long
Will you relive the things that are gone?
Oh yeah, the devil's on your back, but I know you can shake him off
Mmm

[Chorus]
And every day that you want to waste
That you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up
And you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change
That you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through
'Cause I just really want to be with you

[Verse 2]
You know it's funny how freedom can make us feel contained
Yeah, when the musclеs in our legs aren't used to all thе walking
Mmm
I know if you could snap both your fingers that you'd escape with me
But in the meantime, I'll just wait here and listen to you when you speak
Or scream

[Chorus]
And every day that you want to waste
That you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up
And you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change
That you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through
'Cause I just really want to be with you

[Bridge]
The truth cuts us and pulls us back up
And separates the things that look the same
You can fight it off, you can fight it off, you can

[Chorus]
And every day that you want to waste
That you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up
And you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change
That you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through
'Cause I just really want to be with you

[Outro]
Don't fade away
You can fight for what you know is true
Don't fade away
I can do it, it's a 

[?] of faith
The truth cuts us and pulls us back up
And separates the things that look the same
You can fight for what you know is the truth
The truth cuts us and pulls us back up
And separates the things that look the same
But you can fight it off, don't fight it off but you can

[Verse 1]
Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five

[Verse 2]
I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers
And two and two always makes a five

[Bridge]
It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now
Because

[Chorus]
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attеntion
Paying attention

[Verse 3]
I try to sing along, I get it all wrong, 'cause I'm not, 'causе I'm not
I swat 'em like flies, but like flies, the bugs keep coming back out, but I'm not
All hail to the thief, all hail to the thief, but I'm not, but I'm not
But I'm not, but I'm not
Don't question my authority or put me in the dark 'cause I'm not, cause I'm not
Go and tell the king that the sky is falling in when it's not, when it's not
When it's not, maybe not, maybe not

[Intro]

[Verse]
I will lay me down
In a bunker underground
I won't let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants, sitting ducks
I will rise up
Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes
Eyes

[Verse ?: Jazze Pha]
Like no pressure (No pressure!)
Like a pistol out the top dresser (Pew!)
My shit bang, I get cash, all 'hunnid dollar bills, no chingaling
Cool like the other side of the pillow (Aye!)
Caddy got white walls on it (Skrr, skrrt!)
Big daddy, got ice all on me (Blingin')
Super clean like Lysol, homie (Ooh)
You say it's some opps, I say it's a shame
That you would give me your body before your name
And I don't know why and I can't explain
I spin around like Michael Jackson (Uh-huh!)
Reminisce 'cause I'm 'bout that action (Uh, nah!)
Tryna get some satisfaction

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract  & Jazze Pha]
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse ?: Ameer Vann]
Put my dogs in a pack formation
Niggas say my name when they agitated
Nigga learn better, you can ask yo' lady
Pretty bad thang, wanna have my baby
Nigga I'm rich, I'm just actin' broke
I don't understand what you hate me for
(Verse)
Here comes the boom, boomin', bouncin', stalkin' much walkin'
Walk with the bouncin', hit 'em where it counts man
Hit 'em like a mountain
Split 'em, have 'em spittin' up blood like a fountain
Look at me like that we just might fight back
And if I might end up in me takin' your life Haps
I don't go for the bullshit 'cause divin' down
And time is just too important to be fuckin' around
Chump nigga, I stomp a mud hole in your face
Muthafucka, rip your butthole outta place
Cock the Glock to your head, let off about two in it
Yea, it's a dirty job but I just love doin' it
I did more kind of war crimes on time
Than in war times, than way before time
And way before time, you know it's sad man
That I'm such a madman, badman
With the boom you never had man

(Chorus)
Here Comes the Boom
Here Comes the Boom
Here Comes the Boom
Here Comes the Boom
(Verse)
Here comes the boom, bashing your face in
*knife slashing sounds* LIKE JASON!
I ain’t with chasing chump niggas that run fast? (Why nigga?)
I’d rather hit em off with the gun blast
Watch em stagger and fall cause I ain’t got it all
I’ll kill a bitch and take her baby hostage in a mall
I’m going all out for mine
Cause I got the Boom and my motherfuckin’ nine
Now I’m creeping on another nigga on the corner
Now he’s a goner, why, just because I wanna
But be a frontier, in front your whole crew and watch me break em
Just like Boomer used to do with other pits he’d shake em
Pick up and drop from the streets to the roof tops
Running from the cops, YO GIVE MY MAN HIS PROPS
He was a real nigga even though he met his doom
And the legend lives on so here comes the boom

(Chorus)
Here Comes the Boom
Here Comes the Boom
Here Comes the Boom
Here Comes the Boom

(Verse)
I’ve been writing rhymes every day that I’ve existed
Persistent to thoughts from my mind that were twisted
Some say I need to see a shrink
Cause I think a slaughter in the water makes it turn to a nice shade of pink
And I’m KILLING ALL THE COPS, in the 5th precinct
And put the bodies on my roof until it starts to stink
I’m a NUT CASE, and ain’t got nothing to live for
They wanna give me ten years when I just did four
For a bullshit homicide
‘Cause if a nigga didn’t run when I was robbing him he wouldn’t died
B Double O M-E-R was my man but he’s gone
A legend in his own time and in this rhyme he lives on
Word is born, he’s as real as they came
Here comes the Boom, Aka Boomer Dane
Lived as a bandit, a motherfuckin beast
One love nigga, Rest In Peace
(Chorus)
Here Comes the Boom
Here Comes the Boom
Here Comes the Boom
Here Comes the Boom

[Verse: Earl Sweatshirt & Na-kel Smith]
Give it to you straight, no frills
What I think might pay the bills
Spit on the cam like Makaveli (Fuck y'all, that's my shit)
Came home in the 2011
Pasadena, John calling me Relly
Ain't know where none of this shit was headed (I ain't even know, what, whoa)
In a LAC, Nak gon' protect me
Bro just crashed, fucked up his Dodge (Skrt)
Now he shopping for another HEMI (Skate fuck, rock out, wrecked the wheel)
Did the dash, got outta dodge
Crashed out grandmama car
They got tipped off by a civilian (Yes sir)
Yes sir, think I already feel it
Sweatshirt, 'cause you know how revenge is best served
Cold dish (Pressure cookin' roast)
No assist, I'm out here on a mission
Triple doublin' off of the strips
Get ghost like I need a killer (Shh)
Get ghost like a apparition (Ooh)
Home town hold me down like a rock
So you know how I gotta skip it (Skip, skip it)
So you know just how we living
Took it slow, saw what it could give me
Hit the road, go a mile a minute (Mm, yeah)
Mask on like a supervillain
Daniel, who you in the den with? Lion
Wasn't lying when I told
Dawg's on the floor now 'cause I skinned 'em
On the 10, east homebound
I just broke down with the chemist (Yeah)
Midtown, niggas pimpin' (You know how we get it)
Iceberg, MAC kinda slim
What they couldn't see sinking ships
Capsize mean you's a flip (We know you)
Send a postcard from the depth
Bleed the vein 'til nothing left
You look drained, you should get some rest (Yeah, go get some rest)
You look drained, you should get some rest
Blockchain, as a future technology, has become one of the important technologies that is helping to alter the industrial world today. Since 2009, Blockchain has been widely recognised as the technology powering Bitcoin, the world's most popular digital money (BTC). Over time, Blockchain innovation will not only benefit digital currencies, but will also benefit other industrial sectors, particularly in terms of financial services and payments penetration. With Blockchain financial services in the payment sector, this might make it easier for industry users to send and receive payments across countries

You're in for a-
You're in for a treat, ah, yes, you are
I was born long ago
I am the chosen I'm the one
I have come to save the day
And I won't leave until I'm done
So that's why you've got to try
You got to breathe and have some fun
Though I'm not paid I play this game
And I won't stop until I'm done

[Chorus]
But what I really want to know is
Are you going to go my way?
And I got to, got to know

[Verse 2]
I don't know why we always cry
This we must leave and get undone
We must engage and rearrange
And turn this planet back to one
So tell me why we got to die
And kill each other one by one
We've got to hug and rub-a-dub
We've got to dance and be in love

[Chorus]
But what I really want to know is
Are you going to go my way?
And I got to, got to know

Are you going to go my way?
Because baby I got to know, yeah

[Intro: 2-D]
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

[Chorus: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
(Hoo, yeah, haha)
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunеs?
Picture you getting down in a picture tubе
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype s***
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

[Chorus: 2-D & (Del the Funky Homosapien)]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on (That's right)
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this f*****' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (F*** 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherf****** remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

[Chorus: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Outro: 2-D]
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future

[Intro]
Oh, what'ch'you...what are you sayin?

[Verse 1: MCA]
All you Trekkies and TV addicts
Don't mean to diss, don't mean to bring static
All you Klingons in the f****** house
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud
Blowin' doors off hinges
I'll grab you with the pinchers
And no, I didn't retire
I'll snatch you up with a needle nose pliers

[Verse 2: Mike D]
Like Mutual of Omaha
Got the ill boat you've never seen before
Glidin' in the glades
And like Lorne Greene, you know I get paid
Like caprese and with the basil
Not goofy like Darren or Hazel
I'm a motherf****** Nick at Night
With classics rerunning that you know all right

[Verse 3: Ad Rock]
Now remain calm, no alarm
'Cause my farm ain't fat
So what's up with that?
I've got friends and family that I respect
When I think I'm too good, they put me in check
So believe when I say I'm no better than you
Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true
Like that, y'all, and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock

[Chorus]
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this muthaf****** party out

[Verse 4: Mike D]
I said, "Doc, what's the condition?
I'm a man that's on a mission"
He said, "Son, you'd better listen
Stuck in your a** is an electrician"
Like a scientist
Mmm, when I'm applying this
Method of controlling my mind
Like Einstein and the Rapping Duke combined

[Verse 5: Ad Rock]
Now, hey, baby bubba, now what's the deal?
I didn't know you go for that mass appeal
Some call it salugi, some hot potato
I stole your mic, but you won't see it later
'Cause I work magic like a magician
I add up, the mathematician
I'm a bank cashier, engineer
I wear cotton and I don't wear sheer

[Verse 6: MCA]
Shazam and abracadabra
In the whip, I'm gonna cruise past ya
Yo, money, don't chump yourself
Put that s*** back on the shelf
Light rays blazing, you're out of phase, and my crew's amazing
We're working on the record, yo, so just stay patient

[Chorus]
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherf****** party out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out

[Verse 7: Ad Rock]
Now, I go by the name of the King Ad-Rock
I don't wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the s*** that's beyond bizarre
Like Miss Piggy (Who, moi?)
I am the one with the clientele
You say, "Ad-Rock, you rock so well"
I've got class like pink champale
MCA, grab the mic before the mic goes stale

[Verse 8: MCA]
Don't test me, they can't arrest me
I'll fake right, cross-over and shoot lefty
You look upset, yo, calm down
You look like Cable Guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney
You never been me
You wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip-hop, B

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Now-
Get your clothes right out the dryer
Put Armor All up on your tire
Sport that fresssssh attire
Tonight we goin' out, set the town on fire
Set the town ablaze
Gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head and say "those were the days"

[Chorus]
Now check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherf****** party out

[Chorus:]
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

[Verse 1:]
I know you gon' lose it, this new Snoop ****
Come on, baby boo, you gots to get into it
Don't fool with the player with the cool whip
Yeah, yeah, you know I'm always on that cool ****
Walk to it, do it how you do it
Have a glass, let me put you in the mood, and
Little cutie, looking like a student
Long hair with your big fat booty
Back in the days, you was a girl I went to school with
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Hit her up with some pimp-pimp fluid
Mommy, don't worry, I won't abuse it
Hurry up and finish so we can watch Cluеless
I laugh at these ****** whеn they ask, "Who do this?"
But everybody know, ooh, girl, that you is

[Chorus]
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

[Verse 2]
When I see my baby boo, ****, I get foolish
Smack a ***** that tries to pursue it
Homeboy, she taken, just move it
I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it
We just blow dro and keep the flow movin'
In a '64, me and baby boo cruisin'
Body rag interior blue, and
Have them hydraulics squeakin' when we screwin'
Now she's yellin', hollerin' out "Snoop!" and
Hootin', hollerin'; hollerin', hootin'
Black and beautiful, you the one I'm choosin'
Hair long, thin, black and curly like you're Cuban
Keep groovin', that's what we doin'
And we gon' be together until your moms move in
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

[Chorus]
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

[Post-Chorus]
See, I just want you
To know that you are really special
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
See, I just want you
To know that you are really special
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

[Verse 3]
Snoop Dogg Clothing, that's what I'm groomed in
You got my pictures on the wall in your room, and
Girls be complaining you keep me boomin'
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you, and
You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and
Twist up my fingers, and wear dark blue, and
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
On the Eastside, that's the crew I choose
Nothing I do is new to you
I smack up the world if they rude to you
'Cause baby girl, you're so beautiful

[Chorus]
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Na-na-na

[Verse 1]
Love when it comes without a warning
'Cause waiting for it gets so boring
A lot can change in twenty seconds
A lot can happen in the dark
Love when it makes you lose your bearings
Some information's not for sharing
Use different names at hotel check-ins
It's hard to stop it once it starts (It starts)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm
Makes me wanna take a picture
Make a movie with you that we'd have to hide

[Chorus]
You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me whеn you're alone
Won't take a lot to gеt you goin' (Oh)
I'm sorry if it's torture though
I know, I know

[Verse 2]
It might be more of an obsession
You really make a strong impression (You sure do)
Nobody saw me in the lobby (Saw me in the lobby)
Nobody saw me in your arms, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mm ('Bout the way you look tonight)
Makes me wanna make 'em jealous
I'm the only one who does it how you like (Only one who does it how you—)

[Chorus]
You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me when you're alone (You're alone, you're alone)
Won't take a lot to get you goin' (Get me goin', get me goin')
I'm sorry if it's torture though (Torture though)
I know, I know
You better lock your door (Oh)
And look at me a little more
We both know I'm worth waitin' for (Waitin' for)
That heavy breathin' on the floor (On the floor)
I'm yours, I'm yours (I'm yours)

[Outro]
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental

Tryna find balance, tryna find balance, split it up
Split it up, to love you right, I gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up (Six)

[Verse 1:]
(Jeez) I’m in my bag again, don’t get you mad again
Booty so big that they think you’re East African
You get so loose in my room, I don’t know what’s happening
She says “I’ll bе your girl when words match your actions”, and
She knows I got some hoе friends, she knows I’m a lot like them
She’s not no dummy when I say it’s a work trip in Dominican
She knows I’m sinning again, she knows
Good god, damn, I can’t get shit by you
I can’t be sleepin’ on you, I wanna put some shit on you
Look how this sits on you, eugh, those tights might rip on you
Slave to the cat, I prove it, God gave me six lives too
Your ex, your ex, well he move like six times two
He a whole fuckin’ twelve ass nigga
He been out here talkin’ down for a minute
I’ma have to move, need me for you
You gon’ have to break me off a piece when I do
You gon’ have to come to terms with the truth

[Chorus:]
That thing stay bussin’ like an AK for real
This year tough, I’m tryna stay sane for real
These girls coming with the same-same for real, for real
Competition weak and I play games for real
All I ever knew was live it up
Me and all the dawgs on the grind right now, girl, sure enough
Tryna find balance, tryna find balance, split it up
Split it up, to love you right, I gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up (Six)

[Verse 2:]
(Jeez) I’m in my bag again, won’t get you mad at her again
I know, that discussion went left on us like fork in a road
I let it go, I’m down to let it go, oh
All I need from you is patience, patience
Heartbreak Drake is trippin’ on vacation
Not relations, bad news travels fast to me
These days in my conversations, allegations, yeah
I knew you kept a few things on the go
I never asked so you never told
Touch on yourself, I’ll sit front row
I’m down to see how things unfold
Want you, that’s one thing I know

[Outro:]
To love you right I gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up (Six)
I’m in my bag again

Simple conversations with no limitations
Come and have a talk with momma Tina
Let's look at the operational components of beginning an online business now that you've decided on a business strategy. The following is a step-by-step guide:


Choose a niche and a company concept

Investigate the product

Learn about the laws that govern online businesses

Market research should be done

Define who you want to reach

Find things to sell on the internet

Assess the product's viability

Dеfine your company's image and brand

Get your intеrnet store up and running
Expand your company

Choose a niche and a company concept

A company niche refers to your "focus area," which is a market segment or target demographic that you typically serve. This can range from athletes (e.g. gymnasts) to hobbyists (e.g. post stamp collectors) to professionals (e.g. lawyers) (e.g. software developers)

A  digital entrepreneur uses the internet's breadth and power to sell items and services for a profit. They have all of the attributes of a typical entrepreneur, such as vision, determination, persistence, originality, and a few additional vital characteristics


For your new firm, you must choose a specialty. How do you go about finding a decent one? Verify that your target audience possesses the following qualities:



A problem that no one else seems to be able to solve well enough

Willingness to pay a price for a solution to a problem

Having enough disposable income to pay for the remedy

Niches that don't match all three requirements should be avoided. Because starting an online business is difficult enough. When you go after folks who don't need, can't afford, or aren't interested in your items, you make things much more difficult for yourself



Investigate the Product

There are three categories of ecommerce products that you can sell online. Each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages


1. Physical possessions

These are material products that must be created, stored in a warehouse, and distributed to clients, as the name implies. Physical items can be profitable, but if you don't manage your operational costs properly, your profit margins will be minimal



2. Downloads from the internet

You can also sell digital products, which are anything that a customer can download to their device, such as music or software



EBooks, audio courses, online courses, and more formats are available



Profit margins for digital products are higher (compared to physical goods). However, because they are typically seen as having a lower value than actual things, pricing them can be difficult



3. Providers

Virtually every service that can be provided remotely can be sold online. The quickest approach to establish an online business is to sell services (and turning a profit). However, it is a business model in which you sell your time. Because you only have a certain number of hours in each day, your earning potential is limited. That is, unless you grow into a full-fledged agency


Learn about the laws that govern online businesses

Small business owners may believe that standard business laws do not apply to them since they operate an online firm. That is not the case



While an online business requires fewer licences and permits than a brick-and-mortar firm, you must still address a number of legal issues. Specifically:

Coinbase regularly engages with students and universities across the country as part of recruiting efforts. We partnered with Qriously to ask students directly about their thoughts on crypto and blockchain — and in this report, we outline findings on the growing roster of crypto and blockchain courses amid a steady rise in student interest
Key Findings

42 percent of the world’s top 50 universities now offer at least one course on crypto or blockchain
Students from a range of majors arе interested in crypto and blockchain coursеs — and universities are adding courses across a variety of departments
Original Coinbase research includes a Qriously survey of 675 U.S. students, a comprehensive review of courses at 50 international universities, and interviews with professors and students



When David Yermack, the finance department chair at New York University Stern School of Business, first offered his course on blockchain and financial services in 2014, 35 students signed up, eight fewer than the school’s typical elective

By spring 2018, the number of enrolled students climbed to 230, forcing Stern to move the class to its largest auditorium. This academic year, Yermack will teach the blockchain course both semesters to meet interest from students

Yermack says he first developed the class because he was interested in bitcoin and how quickly interest in the cryptocurrency was growing. But other reasons soon emerged, notably demand from companies for people who understood cryptocurrency-related issues. Now, he sees his class as a way to give students the skills they’ll need for jobs in the future

“A process is well underway that will lead to the migration of most financial data to blockchain-based organizations,” he says. “Students will benefit greatly by studying this area.”
Similar scenes are playing out at top universities around the world. Students are flocking to classes on cryptocurrency and blockchain — the “distributed ledger” technology that makes decentralized financial systems work — motivated in part by a hot job market for graduates with training in those fields

Universities, in turn, are forming research centers and adding more crypto-related courses, in part to meet rising demand and also because they now see cryptocurrency as an area worthy of serious academic study

Coinbase reviewed course catalogs at the top 50 universities and found cryptocurrency classes across a variety of departments, including anthropology and finance — not only computer science

In fact, the rise in offerings across disciplines maps to student interest: Students with a diverse set of majors say they’d like to take cryptocurrency classes, according to a Coinbase survey conducted in partnership with Qriously. Nearly half of all social science majors expressed interest in taking a crypto class

This is not a song
This is a announcement she made on Instagram
So if you are not interested, please leave

[Samira]
Hey guys
Uh welcome to my insta live-
Damn-
49K people on my live?
I mean damn guys lol-
Anyways
What I wanted to say or
I just wanna say the truth about Bluedress group
Since we have been keeping this secret for years
And you guys don’t even know about it yet
Ok now let’s begi-

[Røśę]
*Humming Dixie D’Amelio songs*

[Jamira]
Shut up røśę..
Okay now let’s begin
So we have been treatеd like fucking pieces of trash
Likе what the fuck?
And we can’t cuss much in our songs-
Like bitch who are you to tell me that?
You ain’t nobody that can control me
And also the secret of being super thin is doing a diet of not eating. Yeah, they forced us to do that diet to become thin and if we are fat, your outta the group. Being a K-POP idol is more harder then you expect
There are cameras in our rooms/dorms so they can see what we do
What if I’m changing and I’m naked?
Like that’s the problem there
And they just watch us get undressed so I feel like you are fucking abusing me you stupid bitch
Sorry for cussing-
I’m just so fucking mad that I’m being treated like this
And they force you to wear short dresses
Do I look like a stripper to you?
No
And also
You can’t touch your own or desgin your hair
Also-
Y’all have a bunch of hate to Borman for saying the N word even tho she is not black
Don’t tell her but i don’t forgive her either
Ramona
Come closer
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Shall pass as your senses will rise
The flowers of the city
Though breathlike
Get deathlike at times
And there’s no use in tryin’
To deal with the dyin’
I cannot explain that in lines

Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be by the touch of your skin
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes I’m in
But it grieves my heart, love
To see you tryin’ to be a part of
A world that just don’t exist
It’s all just a schemе, babe
That you must dream, babe
That sucks you into feelin’ likе this
I’d forever talk to you
But soon my words
They would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there is no help I can bring
Everything passes
Everything changes
Just do what you think you should do
And someday maybe
Who knows, baby
I’ll come and be cryin’ to you
Who’s gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who’s gonna let it down, roll?
Who’s gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who’s gonna let it down easy to save his soul?

Oh, Lucky’s been drivin’ a long, long time
And now he’s stuck on top of the hill
With twelve forward gears, it’s been a long hard climb
And with all of them ladies, though, he’s lonely still

Who’s gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who’s gonna let it roll?
Who’s gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who’s gonna low and low, and let him go?
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive as you or me
Tearing through these quarters
In the utmost misery
With a blanket underneath his arm
And a coat of solid gold
Searching for the very souls
Whom already have been sold

“Arise, arise,” he cried so loud
In a voice without restraint
“Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
And hear my sad complaint
No martyr is among ye now
Whom you can call your own
So go on your way accordingly
But know you’re not alone”

I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive with fiery breath
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
That put him out to death
Oh, I awoke in anger
So alone and terrified
I put my fingers against the glass
And bowed my head and cried
I put my fingers against the glass
And bowed my head and cried
Lets just take this one
You ready?

I went out last night to take a little round
I met my Little Sadie and I blowed her down
I ran right home and I went to bed
With a forty-four smokeless under my head

I went out last night to take a little round
I met my Little Sadie and I blowed her down
I run right home and I went to bed
With a forty-four smokeless under my head

I begun to think what a deed I'd done
I grabbed my hat and I away to run
I made a good run but I ran too slow
They overtook me down in Jericho

Standing on a corner a ringing my bell
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville
He said "Young man is your name Brown
Remember you laid-yr--blowed Sadie down?"
"Oh yes sir, my name is Lee
I murdered Little Sadie in the first degree
First degree and second degree
If you've got any papers will you serve them to me?"

Took me down town and they dressed me in black
They put me on a train and they brought me back
I had no one to go my bail
Crammed me back into the county jail

The judge and the jury they took their stand
The judge had the papers in his right hand
Forty-one days, forty-one nights
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes

[Verse 1]
Before I ever learned to walk, I learned how to stand
I still got a damn good scar underneath my chin
Between concrete curves and eatin' dirt, didn’t take me long to learn balance
Before I drank my first six pack, I had my first kiss
Between all my friends and baseball practice, and all the things I missed
Between mom and dad, work and church, didn’t take me long to learn balance
That’s right, balance

[Chorus]
There’s a right time and wrong time, and a place for everything
There’s a good guy and a bad guy both inside of me
Might do a little Saturday night drinkin'
Do a little Sunday mornin' kneelin'
It’s a give a little, take a little, make a little time for us
It’s all about balance

[Verse 2]
Now I’m standin' on my own, holdin' on to her
All the folks that need my time, I learned to put her first
Yeah, the older I get, the longer I live
Figurin' out how important it is to balance
Yeah, that’s right, to balance

[Chorus]
There’s a right time and wrong time, and a place for everything
There’s a good guy and a bad guy both inside of me
Might do a little Saturday night drinkin'
Do a little Sunday mornin' kneelin'
It’s a give a little, take a little, make a little time for us
It’s all about balance

[Bridge]
It’s just one foot in front of the other
Either two of them does not enough
Find that smile when you’re mad at each other
Always make some time for makin' love

[Chorus]
There’s a right time and wrong time, and a place for everything
There’s a good guy and a bad guy both inside of me
Might do a little Saturday night drinkin'
Do a little Sunday mornin' kneelin'
It’s a give a little, take a little, make a little time for us
It’s all about balance

[Outro]
It’s all about balance
It’s all about balance

[Verse 1]
Lover, there will be another one
Who'll hover over you beneath the sun
Tomorrow see the things that never come today

[Chorus]
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over

[Verse 2]
Nestled in your wings, my little one
Is special, morning brings another sun
Tomorrow see the things that never come today

[Chorus]
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over
Said I'd be gone by five
But it’s sun rise and I'm still in your bed
Goodnight usually means goodbye
Me re-playing memories in my head
Look at you, look at you
Look what you made me do
How do you, how do you think know my every move
Who are you? Who are you? You look so familiar
I know you, I know you, baby, I know the truth

We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I’m being honest with you

Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
We used to talk 'til midnight
All those days that you stayed at my house
We were just passing the time
When we were young and we ain't had no vows
Now, now, now maybe later on, I'll text you and maybe you'll reply
We both know we had no patience together day and night
Getting high on our supply, yeah, we ain't satisfied
I could love you all occasions

We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you

Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

Messed up too, messed up too
Just like you, just like you
Messed up too, messed up too
Just like you, just like you
We got way too much in common
If I’m being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I’m being honest with you

Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

And you know, that's what you'll always be
No matter how long it’s been, no, I don't got friends

But I seen it, it's family over everything

I've been looking for a woman to save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with the feeling of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could it be tomorrow?

I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
Such a long time now

[Guitar Solo]

I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl
A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night
You see us together chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl

[Verse 2]
Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows
For his cinnamon girl
A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night
You see us together chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl

[Bridge]
Ma, send me money now
I'm gonna make it somehow
I need another chance
You see, your baby loves to dance

[Outro]
I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl
