ape
“Remember that day?” is
Easy for me to say
Gonna get all that I got
Nancy just got shot
Amy was found dead
Nebraska’s not that far to go to hide
Tell me that you love me

[Chorus]
One can only hope someday that someone will come
Rescue thee off of a tree like a cat hiding from sun
But we already know that hope
Is a dangerous thing
But I love having it
Pandora’s a bitch
For letting out all the sickness and bad shit in the world
But she’s my girl for
Giving me hope

[Bridge]
Hope hope hope hope hope hope
The beacon rings out hope hope hope
Pandora knew what she was doing
Hope is a bitch but I couldn’t live without it

[Outro]
Read it again acrostic
Tell me your name, Auburn
It burns
On this next number in addition to
John Cambridge on drums
And Tony Visconti on bass and, of course
David on guitar, we have - uh-
Mick Ronson, who'll be playing lead guitar whose recorded on Michael Chapman LPs as you've heard Michael Chapman LPs
One of my favourite singers
And the first thing that the full band will be doing
Is called 'The Width of a Circle':

[Instrumental introduction]

[Verses 1]
In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was ageing fast

Then I ran across a monster
Who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned
And looked again at me:

[Verses 2]
Woah
Well, I said hello
And I said, "Hello?"
And I asked, "Why not?"
And I replied "I don't know"

So we asked a simple black bird
Who was happy as can be
Well he laughed insane
And quipped Khalil Gibran

So I cried for all the others
Until the day was nearly through
For I realized that
God's a young man too
Yeah, yeah, yeh

[Electric guitar solo to extended instrumental outro]

That one was called 'The Width Of A Circle'
Are you going to be doing gigs with this band?

Ha-ha, no; oh they're all looking at me, or rather, yes, we're going to be doing some gigs, aren't we Michael? Michael doesn't really know he's just come down from Hull and I met him for the first time about two days ago through John, the drummer whose worked with me once ...

I see, but you're planning to go on the road as it were, yes?
Yes, uh, surely ...
(This next one is a comedy number
This one is written by an American called
Biff Rose; Biff Rose is a legendary character now
He lives just outside of San Francisco
On a mountain in a cabin and he's got a bicyle
And he writes a lot of songs and he cycles down from the cabin to do gigs, in which he never sings, he never sings at any of his gigs
He just talks about shaving and what he saw on the way down from the cabin and how many punctures he's had, and then goes away again and nobody's really heard him sing but he does write somе good songs and he's made a couple of LPs and this onе song, this is one, one called "Buzz The Fuzz":)

Once there was a fellow
And his name was Buzz
He was just a rookie cop
Just a baby Buzz

He patrolled the Sunset Strip
In the land of the free
And the home of the hip
He protected you and me
From evil women like
Poor Alice D

Alice was the girl
That all good hippies dread
And they called her
Sweet Alice the head
Alice it was plain to see
Was full of pot and STD
She'd attract a great big crowd
Because her inner peace
Was much too loud!

Good Buzz did the thing
That all the good Fuzz must
Stuck his gun in Alice's back
And said "This is a bust"

Shone the flashlight in her eyes
She began to hypnotize
Buzz said, "What a wild sensation
Guess this must be hallucination"

Love is so sensational
When you fall in love
With eyes dilational
Now they're taking pills in shops
Buzz is not afraid of Watts

Buzz and Alice D have shown
The way of where the fuzz
Might be some day
Buzz is still a cop of course
He's the pusher on the porch
He's protecting you and me
From evil women like
Poor Alice D

(A harrowing story indeed, that's a Biff Rose song, 'Buzz The Fuzz')

[Intro]
Woah, yeah, hey, hey

Baby, you know, I'm on my way

[Lyrics from Snippet]
I thought of getting drunk but it's only half past three
I lied to myself that you would join me
Life’s tearing me apart I can't even clean my room (Hey!)
I'm hurting, these days but I’m still thinking of you (You, you)

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper, just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday, in a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City, just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls and get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill, Mama told the sailor
One heat up, and one cool down, leave nothing for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill, Papa told the jailer
One go up, and one go down, do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settlе down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Bridge]
I'm going to sing you a hundrеd verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never going to end
I'm going to march you up and down along the county line
Take you to the leader of a band

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto, just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush, aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelly, just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains and count your change and try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Bridge]
I'm going to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never going to end
I'm going to march you up and down along the county line
Take you to the leader of a band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye Mama and Papa, goodbye Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose
Ramble on Rose

[Announcer]
I and—
And I can't see to it
Keith Godchaux on piano and organ
Over on the left
Pigpen, at the moment, unfortunately, is sick
And Keith has very nobly stepped into the gap
Phil is on bass guitar
Phil Lesh
Bobby Weir is on rhythm guitar
Bill Kreutzmann on drums
And Jerry Garcia on lead guitar
They're called The Grateful Dead!
The Grateful Dead

[Verse 1: Jerry Garcia]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
I wonder if you care?
I had a run-in
Run around and a run down
Run around a corner
Run smack into a tree

[Chorus: All]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia]
Dressed myself in green
I went back under the sea
Try to see what's going down
Lord, try to read between the lines
I had a feeling I was falling
Falling, falling
I turned around to see
Who's a-calling?
You was a-running back to me

[Chorus: All]
I had to move
Really had to move
That’s why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3: Jerry Garcia]
Ran into a rainstorm
Ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
But not a drop on me
Tеst me, test me
Whoa, why don't you arrеst me?
Throw me into the jail house
Lord, until the sun goes down

[Chorus: All]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: All]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore
I had to move
Really had to move
That’s why, if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Outro: All]
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

[Verse 1: Bob Weir]
Me and my uncle
Went riding down
South Colorado
West Texas bound
We stopped over
In Santa Fe
That being the point
Just about half way
And you know
It was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2: Bob Weir]
I took the horses
Up to the stall
Went to the barroom
Ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle
You know my body hurt
It being summer
I took off my shirt
And I tried
To wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
West Texas cowboys
They's all around
With liquor and money
They load it down
So soon after payday
Know it seemed a shame;
You know my uncle
He starts a friendly game
Yeah!
High-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4: Bob Weir]
My uncle started winning
Cowboys got sore
One of them called him
And then two more
Accused him of cheating
Oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle
He's as honest as me
And I'm
As honest as a Denver man can be (That's good)

[Verse 5: Bob Weir]
One of them cowboys
He starts to draw
And I shot him down, Lord
Oh, he never saw
Shot me another
Hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion
My uncle grabbed the gold
And on we
High-tailed it down to Mexico

[Verse 6: Bob Weir]
I love those cowboys
I love their gold
I loved my uncle
God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord
Taught me all I know
Taught me so well
I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there
By the side of the road

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Yes, it has

[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since The Book of Love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from
Whoa, whoa, oh

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh! Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Oh yeah, open your arms, open your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in!
Yeah!

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makеs me wonder
Ooh, makes mе wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Chorus]
And it makes me wonder
Ohh, woah

[Verse 5]
Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

[Outro]
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Walking in the park just the other day, baby
What do you, what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sitting on the grass with flowers in their hair said
"Hey, boy, do you wanna score?"
And you know how it is?
I really don't know what time it was
Woah, oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay a while

[Verse 2]
I didn't notice, but it had got very dark, and I was really
Really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me
And asked us said please, hey, would we care
To all get in line, get in line
You know, they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Oh, oh, oh
He said that his friends would all drop by, ooh

[Verse 3]
Why don't you take a good look at yourself
And describe what you see?
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rusting
Ah! Not trying to fight it
You really don't care if they're coming?
Oh, oh, oh
I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh (No, no, no!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
If you go down in the streets
Today, baby, you better
You better open your eyes, oh yeah
Folk down there really don't care
Really don't care, don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm gonna do now
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
I really don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I really don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I really don't know...

[Intro]
1-2-3-4-5-6-1-2-3-1

[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, it's crying time
Oh, baby, I've got to fly
Got to try to find a way
Got to try to get away
'Cause you know I gotta get away from you, babe

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, the river's red
Ah, baby, in my head
There's a funny feeling going on
I don't think I can hold out long

[Chorus]
And when the owls cry in the night
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry
Baby, baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the rivers run dry, baby, how would you feel?

[Verse 3]
Craze, baby, the rainbow's end
Mm, baby, it's just a den for those who hide
Who hide their love to depths of life
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe

[Chorus]
And when the owls cry in the night
And, baby, when the pines bеgin to cry
Oh, baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the rivers run dry, baby, how do you feel?
Ah, ah...
Baby, how do you feel?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Ooh yeah, bravе I endure
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore
They can't hold the wrath of those who walk
And the boots of those who march
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, hoo

[Verse 1]
If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break
If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break

[Chorus 1]
When the levee breaks, have no place to stay

[Verse 2]
Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan, oh
Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan

[Chorus 2]
It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Ooh

[Bridge]
Oh, don't it make you feel bad
When you're trying to find your way home
You don't know which way to go
If you're going down south, they got no work to do
If you're going north to Chicago
Ah, ah, ah, hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good
No, crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good

[Chorus 3]
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move, ooh

[Verse 4]
All last night I sat on the levee and moaned
All last night, sat on the levee and moaned
Thinking about my baby and my happy home
Oh-ho

[Bridge]
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Oh, oh

[Outro]
Going
I'm going to Chicago
Going to Chicago
Sorry, but I can't take you, ah
Going down, going down now
Going down, I'm going down now
Going down, going down
Going down, going down
Oh...
Going down, going down now
Going down, going down now
Going down, going down now
Going down, going, dow- dow- dow- dow- down now
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
And put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true, the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm with you
With you

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I hit you and you hit me back
Wе fall to the floor, the rest of thе day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong, I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So even though you're close to me
You're still so distant and I can't bring you back

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It's true the way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm with you
With you
With you
With you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I, I can't wait to see tomorrow
You (No matter how far we've come)
With you (I can't wait to see tomorrow)
With you (No matter how far we've come)
With you (I, I can't wait to see tomorrow)

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
You (I can't wait to see tomorrow)
With you (I can't wait to see tomorrow)
With you (I can't wait to see tomorrow)
With you (I can't wait to see tomorrow!)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed out me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That thе face inside is herе in me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close their eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you, too
Right inside your skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Refrain: Mike Shinoda]
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(The sun goes down) It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin (I feel the light betray me)
(The sun goes down) It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within (I feel the light betray me)
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within (I feel the light betray me, me)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming) Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling)

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I'm about to break!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Give me the rock, and I'ma show you all the ways to be the MVP
Even if you own a bank, you still can't check me
See, I was born for this, I ain't the type to sport technique
And I ain't waitin' for a catch, you better accept me, ya dig?
I can hear the ball, I don't get chatty
Take you to the house like I'm Trick Daddy
If I'm skippin' through the lane, it could end badly
Hit a pose for the camera when it gets flashin'
If you don't know, my body take your vitamins
Got the bench warmed like Natisha Hiedeman
Plays they makin' could be cock-inspirin'
Next possеssion point like I'm LaMelo, then I'm firin'
Blam, crowd goеs wild, I'm the man
Baby, I'm the coach, just so you know, we had a plan
If you wanna stop me, better have a diagram
I was number one before the season had began

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Joba, Merlyn Wood]
Boy, you make me wanna, boy you make me wanna-
Boy, you make me wanna,  go head, go head, go-o
Boy, you make me wanna, jump, jump, boy, you make me wanna-
Boy, you make me wanna, jump, jump go head, go head, go-o

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
I'ma put you on a poster
Call fatheads and tell 'em
Put your head where my palm is
See yo' ass on out call the chauffeur
Speed dial, no sir, under there, Oprah?
Catch a rest from over there in Lot B
The Mazdas, the Kias, and the Air-Four 50s
Don't see passion in any eyes I see
Fear of the foe that is coming closely
I'mma slang through the lane
Rolling like window pane
Got a jump of the rank
Get a rang dang lang
Know the feet on the sheet
That's showing stain danes
I'm a beast for the title
Hit my phone like rang rang

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Joba, Merlyn Wood]
Boy you make me wanna, boy you make me wanna-
Boy you make me wanna,  go head, go head, go-o
Boy you make me wanna, jump, jump boy you make me wanna-
Boy you make me wanna, jump, jump go head, go head, go-o

[Verse 3: Joba]
Come and get it, come, come and get it
Swimmin in the paint triple digits on the ceiling?
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin'
Whippin' and winnin' minute by minute
I'm sending it up, deep in the box
Free throws you won't even see me
Bring the Bock, hands up
Did you say som'n?
Swish, swish
That's the sound of a champion!
Ankles break then its served like it's and-one
Lace up, defense, offense my fence
Get back, you don't wanna miss this
I'mma be like Mike, check it off my wishlist
Don't miss the shots I take! (Don't miss)

[Outro: Merlyn Wood]
Jump
Jump, jump
Jump
Jump!

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you about my good thing
I ain't disclosing no names, but
He sure is a good friend, and
I ain't gonna tell you where he comes from, boy
If I tell you, you won't come again, oh, hey
I ain't gonna tell you nothing, but I do will, but I know, yeah
Now let me tell you about my girl
I open up a newspaper and what do I see?

[Chorus]
Ah, ah
See my girl, ah, looking at me

[Verse 2]
Ooh, and when she walks, she walks
Let me tell you, when she talks, she talks
And when she looks me in my eye
She's my baby, Lord, I wanna make her mine, baby
Ooh, tell me baby what you want me to do
And you want me to love you, love some other men?
Ooh, ain't gonna call me Mr. Pitiful, no
I don't need no respect from nobody, no

[Chorus]
Ah yeah, no, no
Ah

[Verse 3]
I ain't gonna tell you nothing, I ain't gonna tell you no more, no
She's my baby, let me tell you that I love her so and, and
She is the woman I really wanna love and let me tell you more
Ooh! She's my baby, let me tell you, she lives next door
She's the one a woman the one a woman that I know
I ain't going, I ain't going, I ain't going to tell
I ain't going to tell you one thing
That you really ought to know, boy
She's my lover, baby, and I love her so, and
She's the one that really makes me whirl and twirl, and
She's the kind of lover that makes me feel the whole world, and
She's the one who really makes me jump and shout, oh
She's the kind of girl, I know what it's all about
Take it on
Take it, take it, take it

[Bridge]
Ah, excuse me
Oh, will you excuse me?
I'm just trying to find the bridge
Has anybody seen the bridge?
Please (Have you seen the bridge?)
I ain't seen the bridge (Where's that confounded bridge?)

[Verse 1]
Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows

[Chorus]
I said it's alright, you know it’s alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

[Verse 2]
Crazy ways are evident
By the way you wearing your clothes
Sipping booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow

[Chorus]
You know it’s alright, I said it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
Dig

[Verse 3]
You told your mama I'd get you home
But you didn't say that I got no car
I saw a lion, he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar

[Chorus]
You know it's alright
I said it's alright
I guess it’s all in my heart, heart, heart, heart
You’ll be my only
My one and only
Is that the way it should start?

[Verse 1]
So dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower, you are my power
You are my woman who knows

[Chorus]
I said it's alright
You know it’s alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, yes
My one and only, yes
Is that the way it should start?
I know it is, yeah

[Intro: John Bonham]
"We've done four already but now we're steady
And then they went: One, two, three, four"

[Verse 1]
Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags, my foots outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball
Oh ho
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar (Ooh)
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more, more! (Ooh)
Singing about good things and the sun that lights the day (Ooh)
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost its way?

[Bridge]
I don't know
Oh-oh yeah
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na

[Verse 3]
Sitting round singing songs until the night turns into day (Ooh)
Used to sing on the mountains, but the mountains washed away
(Ooh)
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
It sure is fine
I blow my mind
When the tears are going down
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Oh, so good!

[Intro]
(2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 1]
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new land
To fight the horde, and sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 2]
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your ovеrlords

[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be thе western shore

[Verse 3]
So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing

[Outro]
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
La, la, la, la.......

[Verse 1]
Her face is cracked from smiling
All the fears that she's been hiding
And it seems that pretty soon everybody's gonna know And her voice is sore from shouting Cheering winners who are losing And she worries if their days are few And soon they'll have to go

[Chorus]
My, my, my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band
We' gonna dance and sing in celebration
We're in the promised land

[Verse 2]
She hears them talk of new ways
To protect the home she lives in
Then she wonders what it's all about
When they break down the door
Her name is Brown or White or Black
You know her very well
You hear her cries of mercy
As the winners toll the bell

[Chorus]
My, my, my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band, yeah
We' gonna sing and dance in celebration
We're in the promised land

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Ooh, there is a train that leaves the station
Heading for your destination
But the price you pay to nowhere
Has increased a dollar more
Yes, it has
And if you walk, you're gonna get there
And though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance
You will wring your hands and moan
Oh yeah, moan
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, moan moan

[Ad libs continue]

[Intro]
Hey!
I've been working from seven
To eleven every night
It really makes life a drag

Baby, what can I do now?
'Cause I love you, baby

You build my hopes so high
Baby, babe, you let me down so low
I gotta tell you, I gotta tell you
I just don't know, I don't know which way to go, oh
'Cause you're a little bitty girl, yes, you are
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
You don't mean me no harm, baby
But I, I need, I need you, I need you
In my arms, oooh
Since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose, about to lose my worried mind
Oh
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose my worried mind

[Verse 1]
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my friends coming, riding many a mile
Friends, you get some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my dear friends
To keep me from the gallows pole?
What did you bring me to keep me from the gallows pole?
I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold
You know that we're too damn poor to keep you from the gallows pole

[Verse 2]
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my brother coming, riding many a mile
Brother, you get me some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
Oh, what did you bring me, my brother, to keep me from the gallows pole?
Brother, I brought you some silver, yeah
I brought a little gold, I brought a little of everything
To keep you from the gallows pole
Yes, I brought you to keep you from the gallows pole

[Verse 3]
Hangman, hangman, turn your head awhile
I think I see my sister coming, riding many a mile, mile, mile
Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand
Take him to some shady bower
Save me from the wrath of this man
Please take him, save me from the wrath of this mad man
Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile
Tell me that I'm free to ride
Ride for many a mile, mile, mile

[Verse 4]
Oh yes, you got a fine sister
She warmed my blood from cold
She warmed my blood to boiling hot
To keep you from the gallows pole, pole, pole, pole, yeah, yeah
Your brother brought me silver, and your sister warmed my soul
But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging on the gallows pole, yeah
But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging on the gallows pole, pole, pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole

[Verse 1]
I don't know how I'm going to tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me
My friend, the boy next door
I can't believe what people saying
You're gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town

[Bridge]
And when I'm out, I see you walking
Why don't your eyes see me?
Could it be you've found another game to play?
What did mama say to me?

[Chorus]
That's the way
Oh, that's the way it ought to be
Yeah, yeah, mama say
That's the way it ought to stay, yeah, yeah, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes?
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying
Had they got you hypnotized?
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters
And all you do is stand and cry

[Bridge]
I don't know what to say about it
When all you ears have turned away
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see
Is that the way it ought to stay?

[Chorus]
That's the way
That's the way it ought-ta be
Oh, don't you know now, mama said, mama said
That's the way it's gonna stay, yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Outro]
Ahhhhhhhh

[Verse 1]
I got the key to the highway, yeah
Billed out and bound to go
I gotta keep walking this highway
Walking most too slow
I eat my breakfast in California
I eat my dinner in Carolin'
Woo, I’m gonna keep on
Keep on walking this highway, yeah
Till I reach the end of the line
Walk on, yeah

[Verse 2]
Show the movie, yeah
Lordy, mama keeps on shining, shining
And the good, good, good Lord, heavens above
Everybody know life ain't, ain't worth livin'
If you ain’t with the one you love
Some trouble in mind, yeah
Lordy, mama, I’m blue, yeah
And I won’t, I won’t, I won’t be blue always
Oh yeah, the sun gon' shine
Sun gonna shine in my back door
Some ol' rainy day, oh yeah
Yes..

Pick yourself up and dust yourself off, get back in the saddle
You’re on the front line, everyone's watching
You know it's serious, we’re getting closer, this isn't over

[Lyrics from Combined Snippets]
I-I haven't known myself for very long (It's complicated)
So I don't know when something's going wrong (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd let someone rule my life instead (What you think of that?)
Cuz' I can't figure things out in my head

Because it's like that (Its like that)
Like that, just like that
It's like that
Like that, just like that

[Lyrics from Snippet]
No one ever told me they liked me till the very end
I wanna be around you tonight
I wanna be around you tonight
I wanna have a good feeling tonight
I wanna be around you tonight

[Chorus]
Did you know he's yours?
He's the wheel you steer
Tomorrow, still yours
You can lean on him forever

[Verse 1]
Your man in the sky
Your bird's lullaby
Your dream in a dream
Your blue butterfly
Your winged Frankenstein
Materialised
As a figment of
Dream personified

[Chorus]
Did you know he's yours?
Your security
Tomorrow, still yours
You can count on him forever

[Post-Chorus]
He's yours

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Did you know he's yours?
He's the wheel you steer
Tomorrow, still yours
You can lean on him forever

[Verse 2]
Your third sleeping eye
Your friend in your mind
Can make a vision
So real and refined
Like lifetime knowledge
Travelling ether
From a godly cloud
To the believer

[Chorus]
Did you know he's yours?
When you fall asleep
Tomorrow, still yours
He's a gentle breeze
Forever, he's yours
Did you know he's yours?

Dance or die
Loca (Loca)

[Verse 1: Shakira]
She's playin' dumb all the time, just to keep it fun
To get you on like, "Ahh!" Be careful, amigo
She's talking and walking just to wake you up
She'd die for your love, but your love's only mine, boy
Yo sigo tranquila, like I'm on a beach in Anguilla
Sippin' my Corona like it's nothin' goin' on
I ain't leavin' you alone, what is meant for me
No other girl is gonna take it, so give him up

[Chorus]
And I'm crazy, but you like it, loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy, loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it, loca, loca, loca
Crazy but you like it

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
That girl is a nutter
Hot girl, I heat up when I touch her
Chica Caliente, got me rapping to merengue
I feel so el prеsidente
I'm runnin' shit and I'm lovin' it
She's got a mеan lil' bopper, you should see what she does with it
She keeps it down low (Down low, down low)
I can never get enough, oh no, oh no
She gives me the runaround, but I stay chasin'
But I mean, yo, I'm in love with a crazy girl
But it's all good, and it's fine by me
Just as long as I hear her say, "Ay, papi"

[Chorus: Shakira, El Cata]
And I'm crazy, but you like it, loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy, loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it, loca, loca, loca
Crazy but you like it (Loca, loca, loca)

[Interlude]
You're the one for me, and for her no more
Though you think she got it all, I got my kiki
You're the one for me, and for her no more
Though you think she got it all, I got my kiki

[Verse 3: Shakira, Dizzee Rascal & El Cata]
I guess she doesn't know the things that I’d do to please you
I take you to the malecón por el caminito
They saw your girlfriend looking for me with a rifle
'Cause, we’re dancin' Mambo, oh, what she don't allow it?
I really can't help it if I make the lady loca
I don't want no trouble, I just wanna hit the- ooh!
And I'm crazy, but you like it
'Cause the kinda girl like me, they're running out of in the market
(Shhh)

[Chorus]
And I'm crazy, but you like it, loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy, loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it, loca, loca, loca
Crazy but you like it

[Verse 1: Jerry Garcia]
Well, this job I've got
Is a little too hard, hard
Running out of money
Lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up
In the morning, Lord
I'm gonna pack my bags
I'm gonna beat it
On down
The line

[Chorus 1: Jerry Garcia, (Bandmates)]
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Yeah, I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Yeah, beat it on down the line

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia]
Yes, and I'll be waiting
At the station, Lord
When that train pulls on by, hey hey hey
Listen, I'ma going back where I belong
Yeah
And now I'm going north
To my same old used-to-be
Hey
Well, down in Joe Brown's
Coal mine

[Chorus 2: Jerry Garcia, (Bandmates)]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
Said a coal mine (Coal mine)
Yeah-eah, coal mine (Coal mine)
Said coal mine (Coal mine)

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3: Jerry Garcia]
Yes, I'm going back
To that shack, yeah
Way across the railroad track
Uh huh, that's where I think I belong
Yes, I got a sweet woman
Lord, she's waiting there for me
Yeah, and that's a-where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro: Jerry Garcia, (Bandmates)]
I said happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, a happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy home (Happy home)
Yeah-eah, yeah-eah (Happy home)
Happy home, now
That's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, and it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at thе point of a knife
But now the die is shakеn, now the die must fall
There ain't no winner in the game, you don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We're all patiently waiting for Jerry to get his act together, decide what he's gonna do next and all that. This doesn't take long

[Verse 1]
Merry run around, sailin' up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesеl train
You better not be thеre when it rolls over
When that train pulls in, you won't know where it's been
You gotta try to see a little farther

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Outro]
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

We're carefully weeding out those tiny little bothersome technical imperfections that we just can't stand. Real soon, everything'll be just exactly perfect

[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream
And I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are and what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me, Cassidy

[Verse 2]
Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac
And I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come and wash the nighttime clean
Come and grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn and tap the tambourine
Close the gap of the dark years in between
You and me, Cassidy

[Bridge]
Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes and now here she starts
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper
Just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday
In a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City
Just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls
And get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill
Mama told the sailor
One heat up and one cool down
Nothing for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill
Papa told the jailer
One go up and one go down
Do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramblе on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred versеs in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto
Just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush
Aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelley
Just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains, and count your change
And try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye, Mama and Papa
Goodbye, Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
On either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Outro]
Ramble on, Rose

[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they's loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hеy, high-low jack and the winner take thе hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, yeah
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
Well, I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, well, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
And then we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, he taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
Well, I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman arе gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I diе

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows when she went on down alone

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
Hey, I'ma gonna sit right here until I die
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 2]
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
If you will marry me, I will set your cities free
And free all the people in the area-O

[Verse 3]
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you but your guineas are too few
And I fear my mama would be angry-O

[Verse 4]
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O?
What will your mama think if she heard my guineas clink?
Saw mе marching at the head of my soldiers-O

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
If еver I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, all your cities I will burn
And free all the people in the area-O

[Verse 6]
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, combing back your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to your William-O

[Verse 8]
Sweet William he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William he is dead and he died for a maid
And he's buried in the Louisiana country-O

[Outro]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
She bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Chorus]
Lеt it flow, let it flow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, thе cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

[Pre-Chorus]
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, no no

[Verse 2]
I've been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, no no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
And tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 1 repeated]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play, children
Please play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Outro]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, no
Don't you let that deal go down, no, no
Don't you let that deal go down, no, no
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, no
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, no
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no
Thank you. We're gonna take a short break and be back in just a few ever-loving minutes, so y'all hang loose

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Get up, get on, get out of the door
You're playin' cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Long distance runner, with one foot out the door
Caught in slow motion in a fall to the floor
You're playin' cold music on the barroom floor
You gavе all you had, why you wanna give more?
The morе that you give, the more it will take
That thin line beyond which you really can't fake

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Outro]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down under the sea
Try to see what's going down
Read between the lines
And I was falling, falling, falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling
Is running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
I had to move

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
Not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jailhouse
Until the sun goes down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Outro]
I had to move
Really had to move
That’s why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore

[Verse 1]

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
But I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
'Cause I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
Yeah, I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm gonna shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
It's gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Been so long I felt this way
'Cause I'm in no hurry, no
Still I know I lead the way
And I know where to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
'Cause I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm gonna shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shinin' on the beach, sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will rise to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)

And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame, that's right
And might and glory gonna be my name
And they gonna light my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no

And I watch the cars below
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no

Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
'Cause I'm in no hurry

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy country home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter’s summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemеr, and he slowly too fades away
Follows a wagon behind him that's loadеd with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around now)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus come by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never Ever Land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around now)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around now)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet someday
The good Lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 2]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just to hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
Shе can wade in a drop of dew
She don't comе, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
And jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out, and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
One, two, one, two, three, four
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming, blooming like a red rose
Now come on over sweetly
Ride out singin'; I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Well, come on, come along and daydream
Sunshine daydream
Coming, coming from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream
Wading in a cold stream
Crawl on out your window
Going, going where the wind goes
They're never gonna miss us
Ride out singin', I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream now, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream now
Well, come on, come along and daydream
Sunshine daydream
Well, coming, coming from a sweet dream
(Coming from a sweet dream)
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream now, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream now, ah (Coming from a sweet dream)
Sunshine daydream now, ah
Sunshine daydream now, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream now (Coming from a sweet dream)
Sunshine daydream, come on, y'all, come on, y'all
Sunshine daydream now, ow, ow
Sunshine daydream now, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream now, oh, oh (Coming from a sweet dream)
Sunshine daydream now, woo-hoo
Sweet lovin' daydream
(Sweet lovin' daydream)
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Well, I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, she's coming down the stairs
Combing back her yellow hair
And I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
Winds don't blow
And I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, she went up to her room
And she sang a fateful tune
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way
This a-way
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Well, I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
(Rain and snow, oh)
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is a little too hard
I’m running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bags
Gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Yes, I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Well, now, I’m gonna beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
Yes, and I'll be waiting at the station, Lord, whеn that train pulls on by
I, I'm going back where I belong
Listеn, I'm going home to my same old used-to-be
Uh-huh, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Coal mine, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Uh-huh, that's where I think I belong
Yes, I got a sweet woman, Lord, yeah, she’s waiting there for me
Uh-huh, and that’s where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
I said happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
I said happy home (Happy home)
I said a happy, I said a happy (Happy home)
Happy, happy home (Happy home)
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah (Happy home)
Now, that’s where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
Ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
First one say she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail

[Verse 5]
Got a wife in Chino, baby, one in Cherokee
First one say she's got my child, it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
But it's alright, 'cause I love you
And that's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guеss from their cries you werе listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
You're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only wanna hold you, I don't wanna tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, have gotten used to havin' you around
My landscape would be empty if you were gone

[Chorus]
It's alright, 'cause I love you
And that’s not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
Brave the storm to come 'cause it looks like rain
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, here come the rain
Oh, oh, it's gonna rain, here come the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Brave the storm to come 'cause it looks like rain
Yes, it looks rain; yes, it looks like rain
Ooh, here comes the rain
Ooh, said here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Brave the storm to come 'cause it looks like rain
Ooh
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here come the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Yes, it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, oh, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes on now, 'cause it looks like rain
(Here comes the rain, brave the storm to come)
'Cause my whole world's turning gray
And it looks like rain and it feels like rain, and oh
'Cause it looks rain
(Here comes the rain, brave the storm to come)
Oh, and it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain
My whole world's turning gray, yeah
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, oh, here comes the rain
Here comes the rain, here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come, oh)
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain, yeah
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, oh, here comes the rain

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moaning low
But I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Well, well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Yes, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, now, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
You know she wished she would

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well now, the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
You say the doctor call me crazy, sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
You say the preacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Chorus]
'Cause I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Yes, I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Well, well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men
Now do it, do it again

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Yes, I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Yes, I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

Do it again
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles and ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind, wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 2]
Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Yeah, this morning, people, and all it said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Drink all day and rock all night
The law comе to get you if you don't walk right
Well, you know, peoplе, it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 4]
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Catch a few winks, people, down under the bed
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 5]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 6]
I woke up feeling mean
I went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around, children, the letters read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Break]

Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven

[Verse 1]
Lazy lightning
That sleepy fire in your eyes
Is that desire in disguise?
I keep on trying but I
I can't get through
Lazy lightning
I'd like to find the proper potion
To try to capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lighting
Must admit you're kind of frightening
But you really get me high

[Verse 2]
So exciting
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to
Lazy lightning
The way you're messing with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasing
Tell me a lie and I will swear
I'll swear it's true

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening
You're a loop of lazy lightning

[Bridge]
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Rope of fire ever tightening (Tightening)
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Go on, lazy lightning
You're a loop of lazy lightning, woo

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Lazy lightning
Say you'll never strike the same place
I want a double dose in my case
I'd fly a kite if I thought
Thought that would do
Lazy lightning
The way you always electrify me
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightning will be

[Outro]
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
You're a loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My stabilities are frightening
(My lightning too)
You're my lightning too
(My lightning too)
So, come on, come on, lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Ow, my lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Woo

[Verse 1]
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening
When the dеaling got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
I picked up my matchеs
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Verse 4]
Well, there ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias
Or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Well, dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel now
You got to help me, girl, now
Well, I need some indication, good Lord, if all of this is real now
You got to tell me, girl, now
Well, I've heard the thought there may be something wrong with my head now
You got to help me, girl, now
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

[Outro]
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It's sparking my imagination
Girl, don't fight me now
It cause me such excitation
You got to like me now
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
Strike me now, woo
Way you strike me now
Way you strikе me now
Way you strike me now
Go on, my lightning too
My lightning too
My lightning too, comе on now
My lightning too
My lightning too
My lightning too
My lightning too
My lightning too
Hey, my lightning
Ow, my lightning too
Ow, my lightning
Come on, my lightning too
Hey, my lightning too
AH
M lightning too
Ooh, my lightning too
Ow
Say woo
We 'bout wanna take a short break. We 'bout gonna be right back, so you hang loose

[Instrumental]

You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental Break]

I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me

[Verse 1]
All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar
In the end there's just a song, comes crying up the night
Through all the broken dreams and vanished years

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams
In the end there's still that song, comes crying likе the wind
Down every lonеly street that's ever been

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Bridge]
I've stayed in every blue light cheap hotel
Can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Gonna make 'em shine (Shine)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It all rolls into one, and nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold for very long
In the end there's just a song, it's crying at the night
It seems like all this life was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Well, the joint was jumping, going around and around
Hey now, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
Well, no, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well, it sounded so sweet, I had to take me a chance
Rose out of my seat now, y'all, 'cause I had to dance
I started moving my feet, y'all, oh yes, and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down, yeah

[Verse 2]
Lord, now twelve o'clock, y'all, and though the place was packed
The front doors, they was locked, y'all, 'cause that old placе was packed
But when the p-p-policе knocked, well, them old doors flew, flew back

You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around, y'all
Oh, reeling and rocking, y'all, what a crazy sound, y'all
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking, no, 'til the moon went down
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around, y'all
Hey, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound, y'all
You know they never stopped rocking, no, 'til the moon went down

Thank you

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There is an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go (Go, go, go, go)
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go (Go, go, go)
Go Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
The pеople passing by would all stop and say
"Whoa, my that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
His mama told him "Somеday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from all miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Seeing Johnny B. Goode tonight"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go (Go, go, go, go); go Johnny go, go (Go, go, go)
Go now, Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go (Go, go, go, go, go)
Johnny B. Goode
Thank you, good night

One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Verse 3]
Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Verse 4]
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a young man mourn today
Didn't hear no young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't even matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

Ladies and gentlemen, this next number is a drummer's choice

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is a little too hard
I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bags
Gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Yes, I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Well, huh, well now, I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
Yes, and I'll be waiting at thе station, Lord, when that train pulls on by
I, I'm going back where I bеlong
Hey, I'm going north to my same old used-to-be
Hey, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah (Coal mine)
Coal mine, well now, down in Joe Brown's coal mine
Now rock on out

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Uh-huh, and that's where I think I belong
Yes, I got a sweet woman, Lord, yeah, she's waiting there for me
Hey, and that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
I said happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
I said happy home (Happy home)
I said a happy, I said a happy (Happy home)
Happy, happy, happy home (Happy home)
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah (Happy home)
Happy home, well now, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
I ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home beforе daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
Ran down to the lеvee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
First one say she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up to me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 5]
Got a wife in Chino, baby, one in Cherokee
First one say she's got my child, it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 1]
Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The buses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars
But I’m here by the road
Bound to the load
I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers that won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Oh, I’m drowning in you

[Verse 2]
I left St. Louis, City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
I tried to pretend it came to an end
'Cause you weren't the woman I once thought I'd met
But I can't deny, oh oh, times have gone by
I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
And I was a man when all this began
Who'd never think twice about being there yet

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind whisper mix in
It's speaking of life that passes like dew
Forced me to see you’ve done better by me
Done better by me than I’ve done by you

[Verse 3]
What's to be found, racing around
You carry your bag wherever you go
Full of the blues, trying to lose
You ain’t gonna learn what you don't wanna know
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
You capture a glance, oh oh, and make it a dance
Of looking at you looking at me

[Outro]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, now here comes the light
Going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Oh, turning around, that’s what I'm gonna do
Going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Turning around, that's what I'm gonna do
Lord, you've done better by me than I've done by you
Well, I'm going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
Well, I'm going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
You've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you
Oh oh, I'm drowning in you

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles and ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 2]
Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Drink all day and rock all night
The law come to gеt you if you don't walk right
Catch a few winks, baby, down under the bеd
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 4]
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Well, you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 5]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 6]
I woke up feeling mean
I went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around, and the letters read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 1]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to the mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'til four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keeps him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues, he can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again

[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I havе today

[Verse 2]
She said her name was Billiе Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today
Overtime

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
But I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And it made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Outro]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands

[Verse 1]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Refrain]
Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

[Verse 2]
If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

[Refrain]
Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly through the night

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep
In the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la, la, la

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Refrain]
Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly through the night

[Verse 4]
If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

[Refrain]
Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep
In the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la, la, la

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right hеre until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I followed hеr down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows when she went on down alone

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

Going to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River gonna sing me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home (Doo-doo-doo)
It's a far gone lullaby sung many yеars ago
Mama, Mama, many worlds I've come
Since I first lеft home

[Chorus]
Going home, going home
By the waterside I will lay my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Going to plant a weeping willow
By the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Harmonizing]

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Bridge]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 2]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for thе gun that he wore
My challengе was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Bridge]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 3]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Bridge]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 4]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Bridge]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 5]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kisses my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina goodbye

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

[Verse 3]
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Thank you, folks. We're gonna take a break, and we're gonna come back and play some more in a few minutes. And so we'll see you in just a few minutes

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gonе
Like a steam locomotive rolling down thе track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, he's gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
('Cause he's gone for good)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
In the attics of my life
Full of cloudy dreams unreal
Full of tastes no tongue can know
And lights no eye can see
When there was no ear to hear
You sang to me

[Verse 2]
I have spent my life
Seeking all that's still unsung
Bent my ear to hear the tune
And closed my eyes to see
When there were no strings to play
You played to me

[Bridge]
In the book of love's own dreams
Where all the print is blood
Where all the pages are my days
And all my nights grow old
When I had no wings to fly
You flew to me
You flew to me, to me

[Verse 3]
In the secret space of dreams
Where I dreaming lay amazed
When the secrets all are told
And the petals all unfold
When there was no dream of mine
You dreamed of me

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, oh, they's all around
With liquor and money, they loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
You know, high-low jack and the winner takе the hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle started winning; cowboys got sorе
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
You know I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, well, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Hey, we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, he taught me all I know
Taught me so well, well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, no no

[Verse 2]
I've been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
And tightened up my shoes
I hatе to leave you sitting therе
Composing those lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, no, no

[Verse 4]
I've been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It would burn off both your little ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Outro]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, no, no

[Verse 1]
Moses come riding up on a quasar
His spurs were jingling, the door was ajar
His buckle was silver, his manner was bold
I asked him to come on in out of the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
His brain was boiling, his reason was spent
If nothing is borrowed, nothing is lent
I asked him for mercy, he gave me a gun
Now and again, these things just got to be done

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Gideon come in with his eyes on the floor
Said, "You ain't got a hinge, you can't close thе door"
Moses stood up, a full six-foot-ten
Said, "You can't close thе door when the wall's caved in"

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked him for water, he poured me some wine
We finished the bottle and broke into mine
You get what you come for, you're ready to go
And it's more than ten thousand that come for the show

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac diggin' on a well
Mama came quick with the water witch spell
Cool clear water well you can't ever tell

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper
Just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday
In a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City
Just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls
And get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill
Mama told the sailor
One heat up and one cool down
Leave nothing for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill
Papa told the jailer
One go up and one go down
Do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settlе down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundrеd verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto
Just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush
Aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelley
Just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains, and count your change
And try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
I'm gonna march you up and down the local county line
Take you to the leader of the band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye, Mama and Papa
Goodbye, Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was
Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on, baby
Settle down easy
Ramble on, Rose

[Outro]
Ramble on, Rose

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose from the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the clouds of delusion

[Outro]
Shall we go
You and I while we can
Through
The transitive nightfall of diamonds

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Carolin'
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
We had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
And left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line, woo

[Verse 1]
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friends
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
At a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But they still don't see
Come 'round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Outro]
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Thanks a lot, people

[Chorus]
Well, the joint was jumping, going around and around
Hey, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
Oh, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well, it sounds so sweet, oh, I had my chance
I rose out of my seat, 'cause I had to dance
I started moving my feet, oh Lord, and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
They never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Twelve o'clock, though the place was packed
The front doors was locked, I said the place was packed
But when the police knocked, well, thosе doors flew back

[Chorus]
You know they kept on rocking, going around and around
Hеy, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
Oh, they never stopped rocking, woo, 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, it sounded so sweet, I had to take me a chance
I rose out of my seat, I just had to dance
I started moving my feet, oh, and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
Oh yes, kept on rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
They never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down, woo

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Well, they kept on rocking, going around and around
Oh, hey, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down, ow
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, hey, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
Hey, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
Thank you, folks

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Um, well

[Verse 1]
Thoughts of suicide going through my mind
You will find that we not very different, no you and I
Although I usually, usually find a way out
Feelin' like I'm in the skies
My hands could separate clouds
My bitch go get me take-out
They used to hate, they love me
And they used to love, they hate now
The world I rearrange, I turned it to a bloody playground
This to the homies, staying down through anything
A cheers to baby girl, who I would've coppеd a wedding ring
See money isn't evеrything, but it helps
We walk around with pride in our eyes
To the skies, the lies that we tell
Picking up a seashell, listen to the ocean
Do the whole thing all me-self
I'm living in the moment
Picking up all of the ashes, I'm burnin' the house down
Runnin' from my life, I probably ran a thousand miles now
Had powwows with millionaires
A foul child, and a style wild
That you found out I'm killin' there
Tell me how you feelin'
How's it feel?

[Chorus]
How's it feel?
Yeah, said how's it feel?
How's it feel?
Can you tell me how's it feel?
How's it feel?
To be around something real
How's it feel?
Yeah, yeah, said how's it feel?
How's it feel?
Yeah, tell me how's it feel?
How's it feel?
So can you tell me how's it feel?
How's it feel?
To be around something real
How's it feel?

[Verse 2]
They yellin', danger, danger when I hopped out of the manger
With a two-way pager, callin' all the homies screamin' saviour
This world could not be stranger
You could beat the odd behaviour
Give a inch, they take a mile, take a mile I'll take a acre
I'm a, alien communicator, fuckin' up the human nature
Projectile vomit on a song, the fluid nasty, uh
I just got the iPhone 6
It looks like Steve Jobs done ran out of tricks
Yeah, I come through stuntin' on 'em

[?] on 'em
Somebody should pump you up
You best get Joe Budden on 'em
New couch I'm fuckin' on  it, after that don't fuckin' want it
Bitch I'm fuckin' awesome
Come again? I said I'm fuckin' awesome
Press the pedal, wah wah
Hell nah, aw nah
All I want is Lana and some head from Madonna
I gots to separate the weak from the obso-lete
Real life, this is not a dream
I'm a problem, just took a jet from Nicaragua
Copped me a vacation spot that came with an iguana, uh
The hot lava, sonta
A world with no ceilin'
Come again, tell me how you feelin'
How's it feel?

[Chorus]
How's it feel?
Said how's it feel?
How's it feel?
Said how's it feel?
How's it feel?
To be around something real
How's it feel?
So can you tell me how's it feel?
How's it feel?
Said how's it feel?
How's it feel?
Said how's it feel?
How's it feel?
Can you tell me how's it feel?
How's it feel?

[Outro]
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Haha

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day that could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
They say that when your ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
In another time's forgotten space
Your eyes looked through your mother's face
Wildflower seed in the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Tell you where the four winds dwell
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
Can ring like fire if you lose your way

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
God save thе child who rings that bell
Might have one good ring, baby, you can't tеll
One watch by night, one watch by day
If you get confused, listen to the music play

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice you're gonna harvest wind

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
I'll tell you where the four winds sleep
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wildflower seed in the sand and stone
May the four winds blow you safely home

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
You better roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
You better roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a young'un's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I was bound
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried

One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her plеading I denied
That leavеs no one but me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Verse 2]
Dear old Dad, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Outro]
That leaves no one but me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
Wеll, she said her name was Billiе Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
But I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, oh Lord, he didn't even draw
And now I spend my lifetime running with the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Outro]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands, yeah

[Verse 1]
I told Althea I was feeling lost
Lacking in some direction
Althea told me upon scrutiny
That my back might need protection
I told Althea that treachery
Was tearing me limb from limb
Althea told me, "Now, cool down, boy
Settle down easy, Jim"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You may be Saturday's child all grown
Moving with a pinch of grace
You may be a clown in the burying ground
Or just another pretty face
You may be the fate of Ophelia
Sleeping and perchance to dream
Honest to the point of recklessness
Self centered to the extremе

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Ain't nobody messing with you but you
Your friends are gеtting most concerned
Loose with the truth, maybe it's your fire
But baby I hope you don't get burned
When the smoke has cleared, she said
That's what she said to me
You're gonna want a bed to lay your head
And a little sympathy

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
There are things you can replace
And others you cannot
The time has come to weigh those things
This space is getting hot
You know this space is getting hot

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
I told Althea I'm a roving sign
I was born to be a bachelor
Althea told me: "Okay, that's fine"
And now I'm out trying to catch her
Can't talk to you without talking to me
We're guilty of the same old thing
Thinking a lot about less and less
And forgetting the love we bring

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I got a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
I got a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
Keep everything in the barnyard, upset in every way

[Verse 2]
Dogs begin to bark now, and the hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark now, and the hounds begin to howl
You know the little red rooster is on the prowl

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
If you see a little red rooster, won't you please send him home
If you see a little red rooster, won’t you please send him home
Been no peace in the barnyard, since the little red rooster's been gone
Little red rooster's been gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I got a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
I got a little red rooster, too lazy, too lazy to crow for days
Keep everything in the barnyard, upset in every way

[Verse 1]
Come on all you pretty women
With your hair hanging down
Open up your windows
'Cause the Candyman's in town
Come on, boys, and gamble
Roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven, boys
I'll take your money home

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 2]
I come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
Be onе less man alive
Good morning, Mr. Benson
I see you'rе doing well
If I had me a shotgun
You know I'd blow you straight to hell

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Come on, boys, and wager
If you have got the mind
If you've got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line
Hand me my old guitar
Pass the whiskey 'round
Won't you tell everybody you meet
That the Candyman's in town

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Outro]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 1]
Good, good morning, so good to see
You weren't just a dream of mine
Real as a raven, real as thunder, real as the sun shining
But still so very undefined
Can't imagine what's behind those sleepy eyes
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Little stranger, don't try to hide now
You look so young when you're afraid
There is no danger, but from the devil
He may want you, but I'm in his way

[Chorus]
You don't know how easy it is
You don't know how easy it is to love you

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
Here come the moonrise when the dew falls
Don't be the sun that fades away
Don't leave me darkness, she is no lover, she hides the day

[Chorus]
You don't know how easy it is
You don't know how easy it is to love you
You don't know how easy it is
You don't know how easy it is to love you

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Chorus]
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

[Pre-Chorus]
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
All of my friends come to see me last night
I was laying in my bed and dying
Annie Beauneau from Saint Angel
Say "The weather down here so fine"

[Verse 2]
Just then the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can the weather command?
Just wanna have a little peace to die
And a friend or two I love at hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Fever rolled up to a hundred and five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground

[Bridge]
See here how everything
Leads up to this day
And it's just like any other day
That's ever been
Sun going up and then
The sun, it going down
Shine through my window
And my friends they come around
Come around
Come around

[Outro]
The people might know
But the people don't care
That a man could be as poor as me
Take a look at poor Peter
He's lying in pain
Now let's go run and see
Run and see
Run and see

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come ’round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 2]
I've been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don’t ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
Tightened up my shoes
I hatе to leave you sitting therе
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 1 repeated]
Since it cost a lot to win
Even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don’t you let that deal go down

[Outro]
Wait until that deal come ’round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come ’round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Well, don’t you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no
Thank you all. We're gonna take a short break. We'll be back in a few minutes

[Verse 1]
Inside you're burning
I can see clear through
Your eyes tell more than you mean them to
Lit up and flashing
Like the reds and blues
Flashing out on the neon avenue
Well, I

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger, like a stranger

[Verse 2]
Well, the music's thundering
We're reckless and hot
You keep firing glances across the room
And I can't stop wondering
Just what you got
I get the feeling I'm gonna find out real soon

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like, Feel like a stranger, stranger

[Refrain]
You know it's gonna get stranger
So let's get on with the show
Let's go, hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Yes and the wheel
Gets smoking 'round midnight
You shoot me a look that says "Let's go"
Yes and it feels
Most like we're running a red light
And there ain't no point in looking behind us, no

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger, like a stranger

[Outro]
You know it's gonna get stranger
If it's love, now how would I know?
Hey, how would I know?
Know what I know
If this were love then how would I know?
How would I know? Would I know?
If this were love now how would I know?
Woo
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like a stranger, like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger)
Woo, like a stranger, like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger)
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Feel like a stranger (Crazy night)
(Feel like a stranger)
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night (Crazy night)
(Feel like a stranger)
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Hey, crazy night (Crazy night), yeah, crazy night
(Feel like a stranger)
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Hey, crazy, hey, crazy, hey (Crazy night)
(Feel like a stranger)
(It's gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night (Crazy night)
Hey, crazy night (Crazy night)
Crazy night
Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night
Crazy night, crazy night
(Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night)
Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night
(Long, long crazy, crazy night)
Feel like a stranger
(Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
You told me goodbye, how was I to know
You didn't mean goodbye, you meant please don't let me go

[Chorus]
I was having a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Verse 2]
The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay
Now listen here, baby, 'cause I mean what I say

[Chorus]
I am having a hard time, living the good life
Don't be that way

[Bridge]
I was losing time, I had nothing to do
No one to fight, I came to you
Wheels broke down, the leader won't draw
The line is busted, the last one I saw

[Verse 3]
Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain
Now don't think too hard, baby, 'cause I know what I'm saying

[Chorus]
I could show you a high time, living the good lifе
Well, you know

[Verse 4]
Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong
Come on in whеn it's raining, go on out when it's gone

[Chorus]
We could have us a high time, living the good life
Well, you know

[Verse 1]
Compass card is spinning
Your elm is swingin' to and fro
Ooh, where's the dog star?
Ooh, where's the moon?

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been too long at sea

[Verse 2]
Some days the gales are howling
Some days the sea is still as glass
Ooh, reef the main sail
Ooh, lash the mast

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
Yeah, there's a price for being free

[Bridge]
Hear the sea birds cry
And there's a ghost wind blowin'
And it's calling you, to that misty swirling sea
'Til the chains of your dreams are broken
No place in this world you can be

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You'rе a lost sailor
You've been too long at sea
Now the shorе lights beckon
Yeah, there's a price for being free
Yeah, for being free

[Outro]
Price for being free
'Cause you're just drifting
Drifting and dreaming
Drifting and dreaming
Maybe going on a dream
Maybe going on a feeling
'Cause there's a place you've never been
Maybe a place you've never seen
You can hear it calling on the wind
'Cause you're just drifting
Oh, drifting your life away
Drifting and dreaming, drifting and dreaming
Drifting and dreaming
Maybe going on a dream
Maybe going on a feeling, feeling, feeling
Maybe going on a dream now
Maybe going on a feeling
Maybe going on a feeling, hey

[Verse 1]
This must be heaven
Last station on the line
You must be the angel
I thought I might never find
Was it you I heard singing
Oh while I was chasing dreams?
Driven by the wind
Like the dust that blows around

[Chorus]
And the rain fallin' down now
Where I never know now
Just don't ever know, no no

[Verse 2]
Got to be heaven
'Cause here's where the rainbow ends
Well, lost is the real thing
We're close enough to pretend
But when that wind blows
When the night's about to fall
I can hear the sirens call
It's a certain sort of sound

[Chorus]
When the rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down

[Bridge]
Holes in what's left of my reason
Holes in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin'
But I'll pull through

Never could read no road map
No, I don't know what the weather might do
Hear that witch wind whinin'
See that dog star shinin'
I've got a feelin' there's no time to lose
No time to lose

Well, I never know now
Just don't know

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been heaven
But even rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin'
And the wind is willin'
And I'm as good as gone again
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Just a Saint of Circumstance
Just a tiger in a trance
In the rain fallin' down now

[Chorus]
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down (Rain fallin' down)
Rain fallin' down (Rain fallin' down)
Rain fallin' down (Rain fallin' down)
Rain fallin' down

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Well, I never know, never know, no, no
No, I never, never know
Wait a minute
I sure don't know what I'm going for (I never know)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
('Cause I always do)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Of course I never know, no, no)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Na na na, that's for sure now)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Some folks going on a dream now, yeah)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Some folks is going on a feeling)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Never know, I never, never know now)
But I'm going to go for it for sure
(I know that's for sure now, ah)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Na na, that's for sure now)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Maybe going on a dream now)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Maybe going on a feeling, maybe going on a feeling)

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Verse 2]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
('Cause he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Nothing's gonna bring him back, no, he's gone for good)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Ooh, hoo)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(He's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(He's gone, he's gone, he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(He's gone, well, he's gone, well, he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Gone, well, he's gone for good)

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, no no

[Verse 2]
Hey, most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better gеt goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', likе the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
And sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
Hey, what in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
You're sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
Well, I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, no no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Get away now, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Hey, get back truckin' on
You gotta get back truckin' on
Boy, I gotta get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Well, the joint was jumping, going around and around
Hey now, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
I know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well, it sounded so sweet now, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat now, 'cause I had to dance
I started moving my feet, and yes, clapping my hands

[Chorus]
Because they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Oh, around twelve o'clock, y'all, well, that old place was packed
The front doors, they was locked, y'all, 'cause that old place was packеd
But when the police knockеd, well, them old doors flew, flew back

[Chorus]
But no, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Reeling and rocking, what a crazy, crazy sound
Never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, it sounded so sweet, y'all, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat, y'all, because I had to dance
I started moving my feet, y'all, yes, and clapping my hands

[Outro]
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, hey, hey, what a crazy, crazy sound
Well, no they never stopped rocking, 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There in an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go, go Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by would stop and say
"My, my, that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go, go Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
His papa told him "Someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from all miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go, go Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go, go Johnny B. Goode
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

Going to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River gonna take me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
It's a far gonе lullaby sung many years ago
Mama, Mama, many worlds I've come
Sincе I first left home

[Chorus]
Going home, going home
By the waterside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna plant a weeping willow
On the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Outro]
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
And I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
And my time coming, the voices say
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
Knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
Well, you know I'm gonna shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
I ain't in no hurry, no
Been so long I felt this way
Now time sure passing slow
Still I know I lead the way
Them voices tell mе so

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
I ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know whеre to go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
Knock, knock, knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
Well, you know I'm gonna shine, shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me (Ooh, ooh)
But them voices telling me you will soon receive me (Ooh, ooh)
Shining on the beach, the sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me, we will rise up to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)
And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
My work fills the sky with flame
Might and glory gonna be my name
Well, they gonna light my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
I ain't in no hurry, no
This afternoon, streets turn gray
I watch the cars below
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no

[Outro]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
I ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
I ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go
No, no, no
No, no, ooh, ooh
Don't worry about me, no, no, no, no
Ah, don't worry about me, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I know where to go
Don't worry about me
I know where to go
Don't worry about me, no
Hey

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
Ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a rеdeemer, and he slowly too fades away
Follows his wagon bеhind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Outro]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came around and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around now)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around now)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus come by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never Ever Land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around now)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming a—), coming (Coming a—), coming around (Coming around now)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine

[Verse 3]
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet someday
The good Lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, and live the life I should

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 4]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just to hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, feeling bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Goin' where the water tastes like wine
Goin' where the water tastes like wine
Goin' where the water tastes like wine
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Goin' where the climate suits my clothes
Goin' wherе the climate suits my clothes
Goin' whеre the climate suits my clothes
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Said I'm goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling oh so bad now
So I asked my family doctor about what I had now
I said now, "Doctor (Doctor), Mister M.D. (Doctor)
Oh, can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me?" (Doctor)

[Chorus]
He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need (Good lovin')
'Cause you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Yeah, you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Come on, gimme some lovin' (Good lovin')

[Verse 2]
Said come on baby, oh, squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy to be alright?
I said now baby (Baby), oh, it's for sure (Baby)
I've got the fever (Baby), you got the cure (Baby)

[Chorus]
She said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need (Good lovin')
'Cause you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
'Cause I got have lovin' (Good lovin')
Come on, gimme some lovin' (Good lovin')

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1 repeated]
Well, I was feeling so bad now

Oh, tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me?" (Doctor)

[Chorus]
He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Hey, you got have lovin' (Good lovin')
Just a little bit of lovin' (Good lovin')

[Outro]
Listen, like a friend of mine used to say
Got to have some lovin' every day
Or you're just gonna fade away
Ooh (Got to have lovin'), gimme some lovin'
Ooh (Got to have lovin'), gimme some lovin'
Ooh (Got to have lovin'), got to have lovin'
Ooh (Got to have lovin'), have lovin'
Listen, you may weak and you may be blind

Even a blind man knows when the sun is shinin'
So come on (Got to have lovin')
Everybody get right
Say "yeah" (Got to have lovin'), got to have lovin'
Say "yeah" (Got to have lovin'), got to have lovin'
Turn on your light, you won't regret it (Got to have lovin')
You got to go for good lovin', get it right
Come on (Got to have lovin'), turn on your light, hey
(Got to have good lovin') Come on, gimme some lovin'
(Good lovin') Well, you've got to have lovin'
(Good lovin') Come on, gimme some love

Thank you

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I’m still alive
It ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, well, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
I’m Uncle Sam, that's who I am
I've been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand
Of P.T. Barnum, and old Charlie Chan
Shine your shoes, light your fuse
Can you use them old U.S. Blues
Drink your health, share your wealth
I'll run your life, I'll steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Back to back, chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song the United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Outro]
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
(My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my)
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

Thank you all, good night

[Verse 1]
Without a warning you broke my heart
Taking it baby, tore it apart
You left me standing in the dark cryin'
You said your love for me was dyin'
So come on baby, baby please
I'm begging, baby, I'm on my knees

[Chorus]
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your lovelight, let it shine on me
Hey, let it shine, let it shine, let it

Well, I get a little lonely in the middle of the night
And I need you darling to make things alright
So come on baby, baby please
You know I'm begging you baby, and I'm on my knees

[Cryptical Envelopment/Quodlibet For Tender Feet]

[Verse]
The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated, "He has to die"
And all the children learnin', from books that they were burnin'
Every leaf was turnin'; to watch him die

The summer sun looked down on him, his mother could but frown on him
And all the others sound on him, but it doesn't seem to matter

And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended, he had to die

[Instrumental]

[The Faster We Go, the Rounder We Get]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady comes to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Comin', comin', comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin', comin' (Comin'), comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Skippin' through the lily fields I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never ever land

[Chorus]
Comin', comin', comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' (Comin'), comin' (Comin'), comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)

[Cryptical Envelopment Reprise]

[Outro]
And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended
Their minds remained unbended
He had to die
You know he had to die, he had to die
You know he had to die, he had to die
Well, you know he had to die

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Last leaf fallen bare earth where green was born
Black Madonna two eagles hang against a cloud
Sun comes up blood red, wind yells among the stone
All graceful instruments are known

[Verse 2]
When the windows all are broken, and your love's become a toothless crone
When the voices of the storm sound like a crowd
Winter morning breaks, you're all alone

[Verse 3]
The eyes are blind, blue visions, all a seer can own
And touching makes the flesh to cry out loud
This ground on which the seed of love is sown
All graceful instruments are known

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
No more time to tell how, this is the season of what
(Six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow)
Now is the time of returning thought
Jewels polished and gleaming
(Eight-sided whispering "Hallelujah" hatrack)
Now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein
(Five men writing with fingers of gold)
Now is the test of the boomerang, tossed in the night of redeeming

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
I went down one day
I went down to see a gypsy woman one day, yes I did
I wanna find out what's wrong with me and my baby
We ain't gettin' down like we used to do
She told me, "Baby..."
She told me, "Baby..."
She told me, "Baby..."
And she said, "Man, all you need..."
Said, "Looka here, man, all you need..." (Uh, good God)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
All you need (All you need)
Just a little touch of mojo hand
I got myself some, and I brung it back home
Tasted mighty good

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I get my peaches out in Georgia
Apple Bottom from New York, orange in Florida
Vitamin C mixed with this vitamin D, now you got vitamin me
And your prescriptions fill more than them trees in California
I'm always gon' adore ya, kiss you and caress ya
Anything just to spoil ya, gift you, protect ya
Sex ya like you never been sexed
Got your legs shakin' like the Go-Go Challenge, so (Who's next?)
Crushed grapes in Mauritius
Girl, you my flavor of love, you so delicious
I'ma make you my missus
All these candy-coated kisses, you my strawberry shortcake
That ass'll make me catch a charge and miss the court date
Sweet as honeydew, watch me kneel right in front of you
We'll set the world on fire, then light a blunt or two (Woo)
I got the keys, we can have it on lock
And I'll lick you like ice cream with a cherry on top (Luda)

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber & Usher]
And I say, oh (Oh)
The way I breathe you in (In)
It's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh
There's nothing like your touch
It's the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time (Yeah)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber, Justin Bieber & Usher, Usher]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Mmm, oh; badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, listen; yeah, that's it)

[Verse 3: Usher]
Usher baby
Don't be thinkin' that she mad at you
She from Decatur so she got a little attitude (Yeah)
She do what she wanna do (Uh)
Wonder where she learned to bounce that booty
What's her secret? I bet her mama went to Freaknik
I bought a flight, I need her with me (Yeah)
On the west side, she'll be here tonight (Yeah, uh)
She from Atlanta, she smoke, we call that a peach tree, ooh-wee
I got my peach from out of Georgia
Only one that understands me
Only one know how that lifestyle can be
Always meet me in the middle
Circle of trust, she in the center
Give her what she need
Bought her a condo on the Upper East
Big Apple, but I love that peach
So ripe, and he right, I

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Land of the tree, home is the base (Home is the base)
Kush in my woods, smokin' with grace (Smokin' with grace)
Pass it around and give 'em a taste
And you can tell that it's fire by the look on they face
Blame it on Dogg, I did it again (I did it again)
Whole VIP smellin' like it's Christmas
You don't wanna miss this
California weed on ten, this hits different
I'm like, "JB, where you been?"
This a knockout, nothin' but the heavyweight
Everywhere I go, California weed, state to state
You know I got it on me, finest only
I'm in the buildin'
I make a phone call to all my out of town homies
I'm the ambassador of legalization (Legalization)
I got a passion, I'm leadin' the nation
Haters be hatin' a lot, but all the Dogg got
Is a lot of money, weed, and patience

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

[Verse 1]
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wunderkind
You took me behind a disused railway line
And said, "I know a place where we can go
Where we are not known"
And then you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't believe that you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care

[Chorus]
But these things take time
And I know that I'm
The most inept that ever stеpped

[Verse 2]
I'm spellbound, but a woman divides
And thе hills are alive with celibate cries
But you know where you came from
You know where you're going
And you know where you belong
You said I was ill and you were not wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't believe that you'd ever care
And so you never care

[Chorus]
But these things take time
I know that I'm
The most inept that ever stepped

[Verse 3]
Oh, the alcoholic afternoons
When we sat in your rooms
They meant more to me than any
Than any living thing on earth
That had more worth
Than any
Living thing on earth, on earth, on earth
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh

[Outro]
Vivid and in your prime
You will leave me behind
You will leave me behind

[Verse 1]
Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexities
When the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"

[Chorus]
A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the rings"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about thеse things

[Verse 2]
I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruеsome that someone so handsome should care"
Na, na na, na na, na na, this charming man
La, da da, da da, da da, this charming man

[Chorus]
A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

[Verse 1]
I decree today that life
Is simply taking and not giving
England is mine, it owes me a living
Ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
Oh ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
No, we cannot cling to those dreams

[Refrain]
Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...

[Chorus]
Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Ohh...
Oh, am I still ill?
Ohh...

[Refrain]
Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...

[Verse 2]
Ask me why and I'll die
Oh ask me why and I'll die
And if you must go to work tomorrow
Well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
For there are brighter sides to life
And I should know because I've seen them
But not often

[Chorus]
Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Ohh...
Oh, am I still ill?
Ohh...

[Verse 1]
As merry as the days were long
I am right and you were wrong
Back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose

[Pre-Chorus]
But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life

[Chorus 1]
No, I've never had a job because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile, but I've never heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor? I cannot say, oh
Oh
Oh, you are your mother's only son and you're a desperate one
Oh
But I don't want a lover, I just want to be seen, oh
In the back of your car

[Verse 2]
A friendship sadly lost
Well this is true, and yet, it's false, oh
But did I ever tell you, by the way?
I never did like your face, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life

[Chorus 2]
No, I've never had a job because I'm too shy
I've seen you smile, but I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor? I cannot say, oh
Oh
Oh, you are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one
Oh
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied, oh
To the back of your car

[Outro]
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
Oh

[Verse 1]
Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds
No, it's not like any other love
This one is different - because it’s us
Hand in glove
We can go wherever we please
And everything depends upon
How near you stand to me

[Refrain]
And if the people stare
Then the people stare
Oh, I really don't know and I really don't care

Kiss my shades...

[Verse 2]
Hand in glove
The good people laugh
Yes, we may be hidden by rags
But we’ve something they'll never have
Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds
Yes, we may be hidden by rags
But we've something they'll never have

[Refrain]
And if the people stare
Then the people stare
Oh, I really don't know and I really don't care

Kiss my shades...

[Verse 3]
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
For the good life is out there somewhere
So stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
Yes, I know my luck too well
And I’ll probably never see you again
I’ll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
Oh

[Lyrics from Combined Snippets]
I-I haven't known myself for very long (It's complicated)
So I don't when something's going wrong (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd let someone rule my life instead
Cuz' I can't figure things out in my head

Because it's like that (Its like that)
Like that, just like that
It's like that
Like that, just like that

[Lyrics from Snippet]
Don't try calling me up (Calling me)
My hearts about to crash my night in the park (Night in the park)
And when I see you I say Heya! (I say heya)
But that's just not enough, enough, enough
Enough, enough, enough
Wonder if I
Gave an Oreo
To this cute guy
That I used to know
Would he have dumped his girlfriend?
Typed that email and hit send
Would it not have ended like it did?
Would we now have kids?
Oh, I don't know
Whenever I taste one
I still think we will
'Cause life is wonderfilled

[Verse 1]
Yes, she blew through the door like TNT
Put her hand on her hip, pointed a finger at me
Said: "I'm a whiskey drinking, cowboy chasing, helluva time
"I like Kenny, Keith, Allan and Patsy Cline
"I'm a full grown Queen Bee looking for honey
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."
Yeah, the band took a break
The DJ played P Diddy
She said: "I didn't come here to hear
"Something thumping from the city."
Said: "I, I shaved my legs, I paid my money
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."

[Chorus]
Crank up the band, play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar
Threw back a shot; yelled: "I'm a George Strait junkie
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country." Baby

[Verse 2]
Yeah, the bartender yelled: "Y'all, it's closing time."
She got this wild look on her face
An' said: "Your truck or mine
"I know a place down the road
"It's kinda funky
"Ha-ooh-hoo, all out in the country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, now, play something country."

[Chorus]
Crank up the band, play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar
Threw back a shot; yelled: "I'm a George Strait junkie
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."

[Chorus]
Crank up the band, play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar
Threw back a shot; yelled: "I'm a George Strait junkie
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."

[Verse 1]
I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking through the streets of Soho in the rain
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fook's
Going to get himself a big dish of beef chow mein

[Chorus]
Ah-hoo, the werewolves of London
Ah-hoo
Ah-hoo, the werewolves of London

If you hear him howling around the kitchen door
You better not let him in, ha
Little old lady got mutilated late last night
Werewolves of London again, ha

[Chorus]
Ah-hoo, the werewolves of London
Ah-hoo
Ah-hoo, the werewolves of London
Ah-hoo

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
He's the hairy-handed gent who ran amuck in Kent
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair
You better stay away from him, he'll rip your lungs out, Jim
But I'd like to meet his tailor

[Chorus]
Ah-hoo, the werewolves of London
Ah-hoo
Ah-hoo, the werewolves of London
Ah-hoo

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
I saw Lon Cheney walking with the Queen
They was doing the werewolves of London
I saw Lon Cheney, Jr. walking with the Queen
Doing the werewolves of London
I saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's
And his hair was perfect, ah, woo

[Chorus]
Ah-hoo, the werewolves of London
Ah-hoo, hoo, hoo
Ah-hoo, the werewolves of London
Ah-hoo

[Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, bye-bye, my life
Born again overnight
Bright light's up high, dark thoughts in my mind
Born again overnight
Bright light's up high, grey smog all the time
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight

[Verse 1: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
Okay, let me trace my steps
Pour a drink, let's recap the sequence
One minute, you're swigging on a green tea
Next minute, floating on a pillow in a den
From there, it gets a little hazy
Like a camera out of focus shaking
Slow motion in the club free-falling
Through my seat, hit the floor transforming
Undergoing complete metamorphous
From a moth caterpillar to chrysalis
Spinning in a silken house, like a spider spins a web
I'm a well-known insect

[Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, bye-bye, my life
Born again overnight
Bright light's up high, dark thoughts in my mind
Born again overnight
Bright light's up high, grey smog all the time
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight

[Verse 2: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
Flying through the Yu Garden to the People's Square
That's where you find your happiness
With a little too much Szechuan in the pot
Sending sensational content
Neck stuck from looking up
At the high-rise buildings trying to caress
Enlightenment through an out-of-body experience
You're thriving in this environment
Come find me on almost every continent
Cold-blooded, but I can't stand the Antarctic
Guess I've been born again overnight
(Born again overnight)

[Outro: Stu Mackenzie]
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Tell all my competition that I love them
But I brought them back just to kill them again
Chhod jaane de woh toh uska verse hai original apna toh ham toh rakhein
Thoda sa ga denge thoda macha denge kisiko farak hi kya hi pade
Omen ka smoke hai bars toh coal hai har ek move ko kiya unfold hai
Abhi toh pakdi yeh beat thi Inferno se badi heat thi
Saamne jaake face defeat ki
Kisi ki baat na patthar lakeer thi
Saamne aa jaao himmat hai jiski
Mumbling flow se baatein na banati
Oh sorry! teri baatein mujhe pta toh chalegi (Chalegi)

I should dice yeah gamble with my life yеah
No invites yeah keep my circle tight yеah
For the bros yeah i do not think twice yeah
For the bros yeah i do not feel twice yeah

Diablo

Lyrics toh likhenge mumblin flow se na karenge baatein na karenge bang
Bars toh mere yeh kholenge tere yeh saare bharam aur tere yeh plans
Spiting the facts but you just tryna attack with a pan
I got a plan to kill you with bare hands and watch you struggle and just collapse
Dikhte toh tere yeh visions hai
Lyric toh tere nhi written by somebody from your gang
Gang se yaad aaya meri yeh team hai always got my back
I should dice yeah gamble with my life yeah
No invites yeah keep my circle tight yeah
For the bros yeah i do not think twice yeah
For the bros yeah i do not feel twice yeah

Diablo

Satan toh baccha hai uske saamne I'm the bigger devil mind that
Gaano mein matlab toh poora hai balling no we're gonna play with the bat
Bakwas se door hai lyrics apne homie where they rhymes find that
You think you're the devil? I'll see that in heaven yeah
I should dice yeah... wait this isn't working bro let's try something else
I'm gonna go with the flow giving blows
We're gonna keep switching the flows
We're gonna rock with the bros
I don't care if we're old
I'm gonna rhyme on the flow
We're gonna vibe on the floor
They think they're the pro
Let's show them the door
Let's snatch their soul
They lost their sole purpose
That's the purpose giving us life
We've all got our fights
Get that straight in your mind
You're not alone in this night!
Diablo

Wrappin' my dick with some yellow tape (Hah)
Caution, this is a marriage you can't arrange
Kissin' my daddy like Lil Wayne (Ew)

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
She wanna fuck on the first date
But I'm occupied with this red state
See, my dick is got some rеal estate
No matter what, I apprеciate
They say money make you happy
But this bitch look very too happy
I got some weird fake smiles
They would think I was on motherfucking Broadway

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Ay, ay, ay, ay

[Verse]
Eminem told me to suck his fat cock
He told his knob needed polishing after a hard day's work
White boy's cock was larger than 20 inches
Surprised then bitches, fools gold where you least expect it
Could've help it, in a slit second had me jerkin
Thinkin bout his pale gherkin
Just kidding I shot that muthafucka in the chest area
But then my asthma hit, and then I realized I was dreaming
That's right, I dreamed I aucked eminem's fat gherkin
Woke up and started jerkin
Wet dreams, whatеver
I saw a gorgeous… dick. I was in the public restroom. Some guys might be like me. I cannot use a urinal when there’s a guy beside me. I freeze up. So I have to use the stalls. In this case, all the stalls were taken. I had to use a urinal. There was a guy beside me. I took a little look. You’re not picturing this. All right.

[dramatic music playing]

The bit is over. I’m not talking into his dick now. I didn’t rip off his dick. And I’m now not talking into a severed dick. The show is a series of discrete bits. That one’s ovеr. God, if you don’t get that…

[hits random piano notes and blows raspberry]
Reset thе momentum, I cannot be coasting on the inertia of past jokes.

[begins playing "Lower Your Expectations"]
I need to earn it. Every bit of it should come out of a vacuum, eh?

[Announcer]
And now… what making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich feels like when you’re high on marijuana

[Instrumental]

[Announcer]
And now… what making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich feels like… when you’re shit-faced

[Instrumental]

[Dialogue Woman & Bo Burnham]
Hey, baby, I’m home. Honey, you okay? What’s wrong?

[inaudible]
Are you drunk? Have you been… You’ve been drinking, haven’t you? You’ve been fuck… You’re fucking wasted, aren’t…I can’t hear you. Speak into the microphone
I’m not
What’s behind your back? What’re you holding behind your back?
Itching
Just…Just don’t be
Itchy back
What is, just show… what’re you hiding behind your back? Just show me
It’s a jar of peanut butter, all right? Sue me
That’s mayonnaise. That is a jar of mayonnaise. That is not peanut butter. Why are you holding a jar of mayonnaise?
Why are you holding a jar of mayonnaise?
I’m not holding a jar of mayonnaise
Touché, bitch
You know what? I am fucking done with this shit, okay? I had to get up at 5:00 a.m., I had to be at work at 6:00, I had an exhausting day, I just wanna come home, unwind, relax, and I come home to a mess that I have to clean up
I’ll clean it up
No, no! I will have to clean it up. Because you’ll make it worse if you try to, okay?
Yeah
You know what? I’m fucking done with this. You are so immature, I cannot leave you alone without you getting shit-faced

[simultaneously]
Are you? She’s done. This is what I deal with Monday through...Monday
Who are you talking to right now? You just gestured to the sink. What does that mean?
There’s an audience full of people
Okay, you know what? This bit is getting a little too weird and meta. Okay, we’re done with it
I agree. Where’s that going? Sometimes you don’t write an end to a bit, so you skip it. Before they know it, you’re on to the next thing. Guys, I was at the store recently
And, uh, no, I will save you time. I bought something
No, no, no, no. No. Sit in silence

[woman shouts indistinctly]

[Bo]
What’s that, ma’am? What did you say? This is your moment. Who said it?

[woman]
Take your pants off!

[audience laughs]

[Bo]
Do not objectify me, okay? You think it’s okay just ’cause I’m a dude?

[man]
Do it!

[audience laughs and cheers]

[Bo]
You think it’s okay ’cause he’s a dude? That is homophobia. Just the fact that you find it funny. “Ooh, a guy said take off your pants. That’s not God’s way. Ha-ha-ha!" Jesus Christ, you bigots. I, uh… Show’s been pretty rock and roll so far. You know, I know it. -And I…I’d love to keep it going, but life is not always rock and roll. I’m not gonna keep life out of my show.

[Verse 1]
Just thought about you, thought I'll give you a ring
If you only knew the joy you bring
Boy, I wanna fly like you gave me wings
Makes me wanna sing
Know you got me feeling on top of the world
'Cause everybody knows that I'm your girl
They can't take that away from us
And it's all because

[Pre-Chorus]
My love is here for you to find
You came along and changed my mind
Can't nobody tell me
Something I already know
For you, I'd do anything

[Chorus]
Oh, you're the one for me
I already know
This was meant to be
It's out of my control
Anyone who knows, knows
It's hard for me to disguise my love

[Verse 2]
Better two of us, than none of at all
Play it on the nine, even if I fall
Anywhere we are, we're not apart
'Cause you got my heart
All we had to do was take a chance
And now it's all good, then we're making plans
Much more love than I could stand
With you I can't wait

[Pre-Chorus]
My love is here for you to find
You came along and changed my mind
Can't nobody tell me
Something I already know
For you, I'd do anything

[Chorus]
Oh, you're the one for me
I already know
This was meant to be
It's out of my control
Anyone who knows, knows
It's hard for me to disguise my love

[Post-Chorus]
Never been here before
But I don't wanna leave
Never said this before
But I need you next to me
Didn't matter before
It was all about me
But I think I'm ready for more
Can you help me?

[Bridge]
In one fine day (In one fine day)
He came to stay (Oh, yeah)
And it wasn't long before I fell in his arms
And now I'm feeling away, all I know is

[Chorus]
Oh, you're the one for me (Oh yeah)
I already know ('Ready know)
This was meant to be
It's out of my control
Anyone who knows, knows
It's hard for me to disguise my love

[Post-Chorus]
Never been here before (Never, never been here)
But I don't wanna leave
Never said this before (Yeah, yeah)
But I need you next to me
Didn't matter before
It was all about me
But I think I'm ready for more
Can you help me?

[Intro]
Ooh
Yeah
Mmm

My fingertips against your lips

[Pre-Chorus]
Come with me tonight
Alright, alright
I don't really wanna be pushy but you got me feelin' lovely tonight, tonight
I don't really wanna be pushy but you got me feelin' lovely tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
You are my conscience
Forsake you I won't, I won't

I'll fall, I'll fall, I'll fall

[Refrain]
I don't wanna be alone
So come with me tonight

[Spoken:] Tonight, come with me (yeah)

Undressing me with your eyes
And butterflies coming
Don't hesitatе just do your thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Come with mе tonight
Alright, alright

[Refrain]

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
I'm about to go crazy

I know you wanna get in my head
I'd rather get in yours instead
Boy you knock me off my feet
This girl bring the heat
Don't forget to paint the town
I know you wanna hear my sound
Don't try to be too tough

[Verse 1]
Don't take this out of context
But when it comes to being the best
There ain't no contest
You should know by now my name's synonymous
With all the hottest hits, I keep them breathless
It's endless
Boy, relentless

[Pre-Chorus]
People pay me compliments (You're so wonderful)
Boosting up my confidence
All it takes is common sеnse
All it takes is money, lovе and happiness

[Chorus]
Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness

[Post-Chorus]
You know what they say about money
That it can't buy happiness
I just need to know

[Verse 2]
Is this real or just a dream?
Hold myself in high esteem
Picky about the little things
Come full circle like a band of wedding rings
Continuing living in the life of lux
Life sometimes, I know it sucks (It's real shitty)
Boy I'm not asking much

[Pre-Chorus]
People pay me compliments
Boosting up my confidence
All it takes is common sense
All it takes is money, love and happiness

[Chorus]
Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness

[Bridge]
All I gotta say, I wanna be in love
I wanna run away to a place of
Fairy land of dreams, that is where I'll find
Everything I need to have a peace of mind, ow

[Chorus]
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness
Happiness, happiness, money, love and happiness

[Outro]
Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Money, love and happiness
Money, love
Oh

[Verse 1]
Would you rather I dim the lights
Would you prefer, just like we were
Or shall I undress for you (What do you want me to do)
However may I pleasure you
Fill with bubbles
Warm you a bath
Lay back relax
Let me release the stress for you
However may I pleasure you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so perfect
That I get nervous
Tonight I'm at your service
I'm so unselfish
And though I'm helpless, whatever brings you pleasure
Whoo, yeah
I'mma just let y'all know something like this, yeah
Gonna break it down for all you girls out there

You got your ass on your shoulders and you wonder why nobody ever really wanna get down and hang with you
(Uh, nobody really wants to go out with you)
'Cause you only hang around with fake people that barely even know you, kiss your ass, and love to agree with you
(Agree with you, it's all in your mind)
You should take a look around when your down by yourself all alone and you'll see who's standing there next to you
(No one but you, gonna let you know that)
No wonder why you up and change your number every time you a blind bitch, you're crying, nobody gave a damn but you
(Nobody gave a damn but you baby) (damn but you)

(Yeah, yeah)
So where did you get that game
You don't even know my name
So who do you think you are
You a wannabe rock star (ho)

So get off of your own throne
(Get off your own throne baby)
Maybe you'll be alone
By the time you hear this song
You wanna be a rock star
XO, no love I'm gonna give you
XO, oh love I never knew you
XO, know what, I never loved you
XO, XO, XO, XO

XO, no love I'm gonna give you (I can't give it to you)
XO, oh love I never knew you (I never knew you)
XO, know what, I never loved you (nope, ah)
XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO, XO

You call every minute of the day, every second of the hour 'cause you're trying to come back but it's way too late
(Ha ha, that's what you said, not me)
How's it feel all alone on your throne and the crowd is gone and you're holding on
(Why you wanna hold on baby?)
So I saw you at the bar with your head up high but you're so down low and it's only 'cause you don't even know
(You don't even know, it's so sad, you know)
It's sad when people, they can't even recognize, that they don't have a clue
(They don't have a clue)
You wanna be a rock star

XO, no love I'm gonna give you (yeah)
XO, oh love I never knew you (yeah)
XO, know what, I never loved you (yeah)
XO, XO, XO, XO

But I'm not thinking about you (na ah)
You're so wrapped up (yep) in you're boys full of noise don't know, go ask all your boys then

[Verse 1]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda
The sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles
If you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down
I gotta get down to the mine

[Verse 2]
Keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'till four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down
Or I can't work there no more

[Verse 3]
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill
Keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all
And you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down?
Take your shift at the mine?"

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to thе Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to thе Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

[Outro]
Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues
He can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line
Just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know
If I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know
If I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know
If I'm going back again

You deep in that water and you don't know what you into (No)
Gunners on their way, why you saying what you fin' to? (Huh?)
We gon' make you sprint when we pull up in them rentals (Go)
They just left a dent, he can't run from what I sent him (No)
Niggas jumping clique, they don't even want to befriend you (Well, damn)
Niggas come to kill you and they didn't come to end you (Grrah)
Nowhere to retreat, now you screaming, "I surrender" (Quit)
Niggas ain't riding for you, don't want to revenge you (Sad)
Thought you was a lion, could've swore you was a ninja (Could've swore you was a)
Heaven or Hell, can't decide where I'ma send you (Ayy, let's go, let's go)
T-shirt with your face is the way they gon' remember (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Pooh Shiesty]
Big Blrrrd, blrrrd, ayy, big blrrrd
I'll make your favorite robber give it up
I'm just chilling with your BM, she said she wish it wasn't two of us
Having threesomes at the gym, bad bitches galore, letting me line up
All the opps seek for attention right after they go and hide from us
In a couple months, went platinum, yup
Next two years, might go diamond, huh
All-black booty Draco with the wood, can't name a bitch fine as her
Lil' baby ashed on my diamonds, wide-body full of zaza
And gotta be braver than a Arab, he thinking 'bout coming trying us
I told Wop he could drop me, he catch me outside with my chains tucked
I heard both niggas that dissed me in they songs got they ass flamed up
And they better not say shit after this, I'ma come through and finish 'em
My folk them tryna catch them, they cross they thumb and stick four fingers up
I knew I ain't get the headshot, but the fuck you mean I grazed 'em? Huh?
Swear the Lord had to be with that baby-ass lil' boy that day, He saved 'em, yup
I'm King Slime, rock you to sleep, then I put a snake in your cradle
I'll come get you 'fore you clap me, Shiesty put shit in the newspaper
Blrrrd, blrrrd, Big Blrrrd, the newspaper, yeah
Every day a new hater, yeah, every day a new opp
I got new drops on they block, goddamn, why all my members locked?
Ayy, Big 13 don't give out passes, F-O-X, no Jamie Foxx
Every day, new high speed chase, ran through state troopers and the narcs
Won't ever pull over, no way, it's a gold box behind my Glock
Blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd
Ho was talking 'bout send her a jet, sent back a one-way flight with Spirit
Yeah, I be rapping, but still'll get in the backseat without no jewelry
Lay in your yard, creep like a spy, move where you can't see or can't hear me
I said ain't no running from that fire, know I'm coming, them niggas fear me, blrrrd, blrrrd
Ayy, two Dracs on the lap, four glizzies, one MAC
In the CTS5-V four deep, push up right now, everybody getting whacked
Throw the lob up to Wop like Kobe and Shaq
Word around town, they be taking your sack
Ayy, F&N choppers and Glocks when I move, don't come around with them jamming-ass ProMags
Ayy, pour up a pint, I ain't letting it last
Fuck champagne, but I might drink it out the glass

[Outro: Pooh Shiesty]
Fuck champagne, but I might drink it out the glass

[Verse 1]
I've been feeling, don't want to feel this
I hate the memories we made, mmm
I've got secrets, been up so sleepless
I need these memories to change

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna make it stop
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
I'm gonna turn it off
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
'Cause I've had way too much
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
I'm gonna turn it off, turn it off

[Chorus]
Reprogramming our history so it's perfect in my mind
Changing the way it ended so you never see me cry
It's better in my memory
One place that you'll never leave
Turn you into what I need, what I need
You're better in my memory, memory, memory

[Verse 2]
Something's missing, the plot needs twisting
Replace these thoughts in my head
The truth needs fixing, our time rewritten
The good things we never did

[Chorus]
Reprogramming our history so it's perfect in my mind
Changing the way it ended so you never see me cry
It's better in my memory
One place that you'll never leave
Turn you into what I need, what I need
You're better in my memory, memory, memory

[Post-Chorus]
You're better in my memory, memory, memory
One place that you'll never leave, never leave
Turn you into what I need, what I need, what I need, what I need
What I need, what I, what I
Better in my memo-memo-memory, memo-mo-mo
One place that you'll never leave, leave, leave
Turn you into what I need, what I, what I, what I need
Better in my memo-memo-memory
Memo-memo-memory

[Outro]
Bring me to my
Oh, you bring me to my knees
Forget every
I'm forgetting everything
Bring me to my
Oh, you bring me to my knees
Forget every
I'm forgetting everything

[Verse 1]
I would never live here for you
I told you that I wanted to
I wonder if you get déjà vu
When your new girl is mean to you

[Refrain]
Does she try to run when you tell her
That she is everything you've wanted?
Does she make you feel heard on your worst days
Or has she already forgotten what you said?

[Pre-Chorus]
You can tell your friends that you left me
If it makes sleeping easy
You can tell them I said I was sorry
Even if the truth's a little blurry

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna lie
I was the bad guy (I was the bad guy)
I'm not gonna lie
You can tell me a hundred times (Tell me a hundred times)
(Tell me a hundred times, tell me a hundred times)
(Tell me a hundred times)

[Verse 2]
I bet you think I changed on purpose
Took a picture of who you loved and burned it
It'll break your heart for certain
That someone you loved is a different person

[Pre-Chorus]
You can you tell your friends that you left me
If it makes sleeping easy
You can tell them I said I was sorry
Even if the truth's a little blurry

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna lie
I was the bad guy (I was the bad guy)
I'm not gonna lie
You can tell me a hundred times

[Bridge]
Tell me what you see in your head right now
Are you out with friends in Koreatown?
Standing in the corner at the party
Looking at your phone thinking you should call me
Am I standing in your ex's house?
Wonder what she'd think about us now
In your bed listening to Sky Ferreira
Know you're gonna cry, mess up your mascara

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell your friends that you left me
If it makes sleeping easy
You can tell them I said I was sorry
Even if the truth's a little blurry

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna lie
I was the bad guy (I was the bad guy)
I'm not gonna lie
You can tell me a hundred times (Tell me a hundred times)

[Outro]
I bet you think I changed on purpose
Took a picture of who you loved and burned it
It'll break your heart for certain
That someone you loved is a different person

[Verse 1]
We've been here before
We opened up the door
With high expectations, hmm
I think that we both know
There’s gonna be a storm
An avalanche waiting

[Pre-Chorus]
Tried to pretend for the night
Wish it was easy to lie
But you could see in my eyes
That I was changing
Feels like I fell through the sky
Swimming through my ocean mind
Wish I could understand why
It feels like I'm breaking

[Chorus]
Everything's blue
What do I do?
If the only way to save us
If the only way to save us
Means walking through
What do I do?
If the only way to save us
If the only way to save us
Means I’m losing you
Means I'm losing you

[Verse 2]
Two years down the drain
A whole life we had made
It was ours for the taking
The last forty days
They have been so painful
I guess we won't make it

[Pre-Chorus]
Tried to pretend for the night
Wish it was easy to lie
But you could see in my eyes
That I was changing
Feels like I fell through the sky
Swimming through my ocean mind
Wish I could understand why
It feels like I'm breaking

[Chorus]
Everything's blue
What do I do?
If the only way to save us
If the only way to save us
Means walking through
What do I do?
If the only way to save us
If the only way to save us
Means I'm losing you
Means I'm losing you
(Means I'm, means I’m losing) You
(Means I’m losing) You
(Means I'm, means I’m losing)

[Verse 1]
The thing I love about you
Your wild eyed and stubborn just like me
And when your minds been made up
How it is is how its gonna be
Theres no give or take no compromise
When i see that look in your eyes
You might as well not say a thing

[Chorus]
'Cause you gotta have the last word
Cross just one last line
You gotta make damn sure nobody else is right
You back me up against the wall, won't stop 'til you said it all
If I leave, well, maybe I'll be heard
You always gotta have the last word

[Verse 2]
2 AM and fillin' pages
Tearin' up things I wanna say
'Cause it's easier on paper, to see that I can't love you this way
We talk in circles back and fourth
Forgetting what we're fighting for
Nobody's gonna win if you can lose

[Chorus]
'Cause you gotta have the last word
Cross just one last line
You gotta make damn sure nobody else is right
You back me up against the wall, won't stop 'til you said it all
If I leave, well, maybe I'll be heard
You always gotta have the last word
You always gotta have the last word

[Verse 3]
If you can't stop talkin' long enough
To look at me and see how much it hurts
And if you can't learn
You're gonna have the last word
Yeah, you're gonna have the last word

[Bridge]
A slamming door, that's all you'll hear (Last word)
You're gonna wish that I was there (Last word)
But, you always gotta have the last word (Last word)

[Chorus 2]
Oh, come on baby, hush your mouth (Last word)
I know we can work it out (Last word)
You always gotta have the last word
Hey

[Outro]
Last word, last word
I always gotta have the last word
Last word, last word
I always gotta have the last word
Last word, last word
Last word (Word, word)
Last word, last word
Last word
You always gotta have the last word

[Intro]
I think it's been bout a year
Its time to run again, disappear
You got too close, so I have to fly
Goodnight means goodbye

[Verse 1]
No, don't blame yourself, it's wasted pain
It's like standin' in front of an outbound train
And you couldn't stop me even if you tried
'Cause good night means goodbye
I aid goodnight means goodbye

[Chorus]
Goodnight, it doesn't sound like forever
Goodnight, it all works out for the better
And you don't have to stand face to face
Cry

[Verse 2]
I wasn't ready when you said, "I love you"
Maybe I wasn't ready for what I felt too
And either way you slice, I'm on a midnight drive
Goodnight means goodbye
Yеah, I said goodnight, but I meant goodbye

[Chorus]
Goodnight, it doesn't sound likе forever
Goodnight, it all works out for the better
And you don't have to stand face to face
No, you don't have to stand face to face
And cry
Cry

[Outro]
Nobody has to cry
Ooh-ooh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, he was smooth with the words he said
Felt a body rush, I got a little buzzed when I took him in
One burning kiss, no turning back
Sweet on my lips, but the problem is with a love like that

[Chorus]
When you get high high hopes
And you can't see through the smoke
And it feels to good to be true
And your mind plays tricks on you
But when you come down and he’s nowhere to be found
You end up feelin' low low low
'Cause you know, they were just high high hopes

[Verse 2]
Killing streak, it hit you fast
You’re finally free and your heart believes it's gonna last
But it's such a trip, yeah, such a lie
It leaves you wanting more, crying on the floor with bloodshot eyes

[Chorus]
When you get high high hopes
And you can't see through the smoke
And it feels to good to be true
And your mind plays tricks on you
But when you come down and he's nowhere to be found
You end up feelin' low low low
'Cause you know, they were just high high hopes

[Bridge]
I love it and I hate it
I spent so much time wasting
That I can't tell the sky from the ground

[Outro]
’Til I come down
And he’s nowhere to be found
And I end up feeling low low low
'Cause I shoulda known
They were just high high hopes

[Verse 1]
If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row, like you're s'posed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

[Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken mеrry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This mеrry go 'round

[Verse 2]
We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

[Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
Mary Mary quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
Merry go 'round

[Outro]
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more

[Chorus]
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (Oh)

[Verse]
I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Oh, I'll be fucked up, if you can't be right here

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, I'll be fucked up, if you can't be right here

[Chorus]
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, ooh-woah
Oh, ooh-woah
Oh, ooh-woah
I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

[Chorus]
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

[Verse 1]
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around
And say

[Chorus]
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late, too late, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh
I need you like a heart needs a beat
That's nothing new, yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry, like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

[Chorus]
It's too latе to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologizе
It's too late, oh, oh
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize

[Outro]
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground

[Verse 1]
I've made up my mind and what I'm gonna do
Take it or leave it boy, I'm leavin' you
You drove me outta' my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis
Instead of wastin' my time trying to make you feel good
I'm gonna see what kinda' life is up in front of my hood
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

[Chorus]
I'm halfway gone but I'm halfway saved
A couple hundred miles from a brand new day
Halfway there is a damn good start from a worn out mind
To a healed-up heart
Thank God I'm finally comin' to my senses
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

[Verse 2]
I can drive away far and I can run pretty fast
The plan for my future's puttin' you in my past
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis
So don't bother to call and don't bother to write
Cuz' freedom's just ahead in the beam of my lights
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

[Chorus]
I'm halfway gone but I'm halfway saved
A couple hundred miles from a brand new day
Halfway there is a damn good start from a worn out mind
To a healed-up heart
Halfway gone but I'm halfway saved
A couple hundred miles from a brand new day
Halfway there is a damn good start from a worn out mind
To a healed-up heart
Thank God I'm finally comin' to my senses
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

[Outro]
I've made up my mind and what I'm gonna do
You can take it or leave it boy, I'm leavin' you

His daddy fine, I'm fine, what you thought?
Shit, his daddy fine
Nah, his daddy, his momma fine, bitch
What you mean? He got his looks from me
You better tell this ho, this my nigga, though
My ride or die, I’d kill a motherfucker over this one right here, nigga
I'd stand in front of a bullet, on God, over this one
My son used to record me beatin' bitches’ ass, facts
I didn't give a fuck
I, I bossed up on teachers, principals, mamas, kids
I didn't give a fu-am I lying?
You have no reason to
No
If you fuck with my kids, I'll beat up kids over my kid, okay?
This little boy used to run, he was scared
I said, "Go get your bitch-ass mama"
I would beat your whole family and didn't give a fuck
They be like, "Tyler, Tyler mama crazy, Tyler mama crazy"
Yup, don't fuck with my kids
Tyler would be like "Get 'em, mom"
But she like "No, don't do it"
Tyler would be like "Get ’em, mom, get ’em"
"No, mom, don't do it"
I’d be like "Shut yo ass up"
She cryin' "Noo—"

Ever since I fell in love
Not quite like bein' trapped
More like a sickness that
Keeps me addicted bad

Hard for me to let you go (Let you go, let you go)

Put some babies in your life and take away the drama
Put the paper in a picture like a diorama
Gotta face a lot of people of the opposite
'Cause the world told me, "We ain't got the common sense"
Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
And you would never know a god without the goddesses
Honest as fuckin' honest get
And I could be on everything
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl
They wanna pit us against each other
When we succeedin' for no reasons
They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls

If they ever tryna knock her, put my foot up in your caca
Call your mama and your papa like I'm finna take your daughter
Turn that bitch into a soccer ball and rocka, rocka, rocka (Brrr)
Get into it like a suit and fuck a stock up like a broker

[Chorus]
They say I just got a buck (Yuh)
Get into it, yuh (Ayy)
Pop out with a truck, ha
Get into it, yuh (Pop out, pop out)
If you go to church

Nah, fuck it, get into it, yuh
And I say I just got a buck (Ayy)
Get into it, yuh
Pop out with a truck
Get into it, yuh (Yeah)
If you go to church
Get into it, yuh (Go to church)
If she ain't got a butt
Fuck it, get into it, yuh
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Thank you, Nicki, I love you
Got that big rocket launcher!

[Chorus]
Imagine, imagine
Put the studio in the mansion
Pull up in a new high fashion
Pull up just like, "Ooh, you a baddie"
Imagine, imagine
Put the studio in the mansion
Pull up in a new high fashion
I pull up just like, "Ooh, you a baddie"

[Verse 1]
You couldn't be more wrong
We show up and show out
Five-hundred racks, sold out
I never been more proud
Need more light on me (Diamond)
Shine on me
This my final form
Tell 'em all, "Chile, please"
Baby, I blow your mind (Slander)
Buy all these
Pussy on dynamite
Gimme that, dine on me

[Chorus]
Imagine, imagine
Put the studio in the mansion
Pull up in a new high fashion
Pull up just like, "Ooh, you a baddie"
Imagine, imagine (Mmm, mmm)
Put the studio in the mansion (Mmm, mmm)
Pull up in a new high fashion (Mmm, mmm)
I pull up just like, "Ooh, you a baddie" (Mmm, mmm)

[Verse 2]
All this work (This work) paid off (Off)
When they had no faith at all (Faith at all)
One min. livin' bummy, then go pray to God (Pray to God)
Fuck around and go completely un-relatable
Like imagine, imagine
Thick as fuck but all I eat is salad
Saucin' with my thousands on an island
Got imagination 'cause I'm childish

[Chorus]
Imagine, imagine
Put the studio in the mansion
Pull up in a new high fashion
Pull up just like, "Ooh, you a baddie"
Imagine, imagine (Mmm, mmm)
Put the studio in the mansion (Mmm, mmm)
Pull up in a new high fashion (Mmm, mmm)
I pull up just like, "Ooh, you a baddie" (Mmm, mmm)

[Chorus]
Baby, when you fought me at the door
Kinda hard to force what's natural
Maybe you don't want what you need most
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?

[Post-Chorus]
Now I barely need ya
Do what you do best and be alone
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die alone
It don't make sense to me
But I keep my head up high alone
You ain't even there for me
But now, you're scared to be alone

[Verse 1]
Too many drinks to think about you
I had too many thoughts to let you wander
Now you're an afterthought, I lost ya
And now you want me, babe
You want me, but it's bye
Givin' mе reasons to fly
Pack up my shit and be wise
Jump in thе ride
Hit up my dude on the side
Like, look what you threw to the side
You get the vibe
Either we fuck or we fight
But I got the feelin' you're right
I'm out my mind
Doesn't make sense when I cry
If we can't make up, 'least we try

[Chorus]
Baby, when you fought me at the door (Fought me at the door)
Kinda hard to force what's natural (Oh, oh, oh)
Maybe you don't want what you need most (Oh, oh, oh)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone? (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I ain't wanna share my dreams when it involves you
Not the man I need (Yeah)
Started feelin' like I failed my team
Missin' gigs for you, bet you never felt like me
Different levels to the game, that's fast
Spendin' bands last week while your ass act cheap (Yeah)
Lonely at the top while your ass miles deep
Got me thinkin' that you scared of yourself, not me
Impossible, from a Prius to gold carriages
Middle finger to you so you see what a whole karat is
I need a answer, a reader of more tarots
You couldn't tell that the both of us needed a whole therapist
I made you fam when I greeted your whole parents
But later, I realized they ain't teach you what no sharin' is
I know you hearin' this, I know you scared of it
But bein' lonely better than 'needs control,' cherish it

[Chorus]
Baby, when you fought me at the door (Fought me at the door)
Kinda hard to force what's natural (Oh, oh, oh)
Maybe you don't want what you need most (Oh, oh, oh)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?

[Post-Chorus]
Now I barely need ya (I barely need ya)
Do what you do best and be alone
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die alone
It don't make sense to me
But I keep my head up high alone
You ain't even there for me
But now, you're scared to be alone
Alone
Now you scared to be alone

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it
Kitchen island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options

[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
I know you faded, boy
I feel it wearin' off
When I get Henn' and Coke
I like the way you talk, yeah
I couldn't give a fuck
Givin' him paranoia
He just wanna smash on tour
Fuckin' for that new velour
I like it when you're with me all night
I can't imagine what you might try
Yeah, you so full of surprises
Guess you one of my vices
You want a picket fence and a wife
You never change your mind when I cry
Yeah, I see your flaws and you know it
Droppin' your jaw when the drawers hit the floor

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it
Kitchen island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options

[Bridge: Doja Cat]
You can count on me
To never count on you
I'm only down for you
Way you put it down, baby, wow, I, I

[Verse 2: JID]
She wanna fuck a nigga like she love me
She got a lover, but I might get lucky
But you got me on a drain like a drunkie
Lookin' at the junk in your trunk like a junkie
We don't speak, just fuck twice a week
And if she like freaks, we must try a threesome
Do it on the beach, in the sand, let me see somethin'
Seashells on the shore, I'm a beach bum
Finna eat somethin' when you come
Baby, don't you wanna let me know?
Layin' in my bed like a vegetable
Lied when you said, "Never let me go"
Just like a pro, you professional
Stand on your hand 'cause you flexible
Now she tryna fuck me in the restroom or the parkin' lot
At the restaurant, anywhere, everywhere, anytime, I

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it
Kitchen island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options
I don't need lovin', late-night cuffin'
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on, unpause it
Kitchen island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options

Falling upwards through clouds of glue
Anamnesis crashing through
Blurry photos all I've gained
From my last domain
Dream grips me and pulls me into
Global unparalleled new
Metamorphic is my name
Surrender this brain

[Refrain]
Blue morpho

[Verse 2]
Falling upwards through clouds of glue
Moonless night beckons me through
Morpheus whispers my name
Massages my brain
Falling upwards through clouds of glue
Split dry sky beckons me through
A hand outstretched calls my name
Time to wake again

[Verse 1]
Just on the down-low
I'm feeling pretty low
Some days, I feel fine
Others, I don’t know
I got a sensory road block
I'm in a binary mind lock
So I'm dancing in lockstep
To music that I can’t hear, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Failing farmer, toxic crop
Two white hearts to shake shit up
Pay someone to taste, to smell and punch through the drywall inside my skull

[Chorus]
Interior people
A lens flare in my subconscious
The gap of death, I no longer fear
The interior people

[Verse 2]
I keep thinking someone
Is standing beside me
When I turn to grab them
They jump back inside of me
They tell me to do things
And so does the radio
And learn from the satellite
That orbits my shadow, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Instigate the paradigm
Play the game and drink the wine
Communicate with the afterglow that radiates between the wall
Failing farmer, toxic crop
Two white hearts to shake shit up
Pay someone to taste, to smell and punch through the drywall inside my skull

[Chorus]
Interior people
A lens flare in my subconscious
The gap of death, I no longer fear
The interior people

[Verse 1]
For one night, I'm the hero
Suit up, tie
Open the doors to the Oval Office
In this story, I'm president

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got happiness inside my pocket
It cost me twenty-five dollars
Maybe we could go halvies?
So gimme just a couple hours
Starting fires with soggy timber
Then I'll have the magic powers
Woo!

[Chorus]
Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Swallowing the sun in a moonlight room
Standing at the foot of a rainbow
Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Riding on a yellow-bellied brown snake
Sipping on hedonism

[Verse 2]
Give me five, it's all I need
To inscribe my epitaph while I float
O.B.E, am I dead or just paranoid?

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got happiness inside my pocket
It cost me twenty-five dollars
Maybe we could go halvies?
So gimme just a couple hours
Starting fires with soggy timber
Then I'll have the magic powers
Woo!

[Chorus]
Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Swallowing the sun in a moonlight room
Standing at the foot of a rainbow
Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Riding on a yellow-bellied brown snake
Sipping on hedonism

[Refrain]
Catching smoke, catching smoke, catching smoke
Catching smoke, catching smoke, catching smoke

[Verse 3]
Hogtied to self-indulgence
Epicureanly living la dolce vita
Just pass the aux cord

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got happiness inside my pocket
It cost me twenty-five dollars
Maybe we could go halvies?
So gimme just a couple hours
Starting fires with soggy timber
Then I'll have the magic powers
Woo!

[Chorus]
Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Swallowing the sun in a moonlight room
Standing at the foot of a rainbow
Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Riding on a yellow-bellied brown snake
Sipping on hedonism

[Refrain]
Catching smoke, catching smoke, catching smoke
Catching smoke, catching smoke, catching smoke

[Bridge]
Not enough hours in the night
To keep me on this stinking horse
Everyone's rolling up pineapples
Writhing in the space between it all
Long live my decisions

Catching smoke, catching smoke, catching smoke
Catching smoke, catching smoke, catching smoke

[Intro]
Woo!

[Chorus]
It's coming up, beach boys
It's gonna be a lot of fun
The water's getting deeper
It's gonna drown everyone
It's coming up, beach boys
The weather's getting messed about
You better bring boards down
The waves are bigger than a house

[Verse 1]
2.02, killer year
No fear, proceed without blame
No shame
Playing games with lives unborn
No scorn
Not torn between just and fucked up
We've stuffed up
Time to pick up

[Refrain]
Woo!

[Chorus]
It's coming up, beach boys
It's gonna be a lot of fun
The water's getting deeper
It's gonna drown еveryone
It's coming up, beach boys
Thе weather's getting messed about
You better bring boards down
The waves are bigger than a house

[Verse 2]
2.02, killer year
The year that broke our broken wheel
Is it enough that we're a speck
Of dust speeding through a void of stuff?
We teeter on an axe edge

[Verse 3]
Water signage, never read it
How pathetic, coinciding
Mystifying, steep declining
Too little, too late to contemplate
Gotta make moves, cannot wait
Need to recreate a clean slate
Plan B, C and D
However many needs to be to keep us free in ecstasy
It's easier to swallow hiding in your burrow
No need to wallow in your sorrows
Woo!

[Outro]
It's coming up, beach boys
It's gonna be a lot of fun
The water's getting deeper
It's gonna drown everyone

[Verse 1]
Seething pot filled with hot liquid up to the top
Spinning ball with molten core of iron ore, what's it for?

[Pre-Chorus]
Staring out in the dissonance (Black hot soup)
Black hot soup in the distance (Black hot soup)
Black hot soup engulfing me (Black hot soup)

[Chorus]
Infinity is in a dream inside a dream
You can achieve reality
It gets better (It gets better)
It gets better
Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin
Floating above who you have been
It gets better
Gets better when you're with me (Bettеr when you're with me)
Hеre in my own reality with you (Better when you're with me, better when you're with me)

[Verse 2]
Colossal fireball falling for an endless floor
Warming wall is moving blind to open shores and open minds

[Pre-Chorus]
Staring out in the dissonance (Black hot soup)
Black hot soup in the distance (Black hot soup)
Black hot soup engulfing me (Black hot soup)

[Chorus]
Infinity is in a dream inside a dream
You can achieve reality
It gets better (It gets better)
It gets better
Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin
Floating above who you have been
It gets better
Gets better when you're with me (Better when you're with me)
Here in my own reality with you (Better when you're with me, better when you're with me)

[Pre-Chorus]
Staring out in the dissonance (Black hot soup)
Black hot soup in the distance (Black hot soup)
Black hot soup engulfing me (Black hot soup), woo!
(Black hot soup)

[Chorus]
Infinity is in a dream inside a dream
You can achieve reality
It gets better (It gets better)
It gets better
Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin
Floating above who you have been
It gets better
Gets better when you're with me (Better when you're with me)
Here in my own reality with you (Better when you're with me, better when you're with me)
Woo!
Woo!

Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love

[Verse 1]
I can't wait to be underneath your spell
I can't wait to spin the carousel
I can't wait for you to sweep us up
I just can't wait to feel

[Chorus]
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love

[Post-Chorus]
Your love is just a state of mind in mine
Are we here? Don't know, but I don't mind

[Verse 2]
I can't wait to go to someplace with ya
I can't wait to go on adventures
I can't wait for us to pick you up
I just can't wait to feel

[Chorus]
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, your love

[Post-Chorus]
Your love is like a dream inside a dream
Relax, close your eyes and be with me

[Verse 1]
I can't wait to be underneath your spell
I can't wait to spin the carousel
I can't wait for you to sweep us up
I just can't wait to feel-

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles, ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the passing train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 2]
Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back, you better butter my bread
Well, you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me?
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Drink all day, rock all night
Law come to get you if you don't walk right
Catch a few winks down under thе bed
Then head back to Tеnnessee, Jed

[Verse 4]
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Got a letter this morning and all that it read:
"Better head back to Tennessee, Jed"

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me?
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 5]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
"Let's go back to Tennessee, Jed"

[Verse 6]
I woke up a-feeling mean
Went down, played the slot machine
The wheels turned 'round, the letters read:
"Better head back to Tennessee, Jed"

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me?
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me?
Back to Tennessee

[Verse]
Still tippin' from all of the Benjamin heads in that bitch
I got to take you back to the days of the trap
When it was only 20s and 10s in that bitch
I was all on my 9 to 5, workin', selling weight up out of the Denny's and spendin' that shit
At 3:10 I ran out, I was bendin' that bitch
Then jumped in and sped out, I was gettin' that rich
All the money, brrt, that's the stick
Because after the snow, the shit gon' get sunny
Just trying to be warm, that shit was so muddy
That shit was so cold, the days were never lucky
Sit in cells eatin' peanut butter jelly
Now I'm on, in fuckin' Kentucky
Just did a performance and caught a milli
I popped me up 

[?]
I gеt them goons on my own
I'm used to them bеing

[Chorus]
I bust a brand new lick, it feel like I invented somethin'
They takin' one of my dogs, you know we out here bendin' somethin'
Them birds flyin' high, you know, you smell the scent or somethin'
We catch him out in traffic, shoot him out the tint or somethin'
I bust a brand new lick, it feel like I invented somethin'
They takin' one of my dogs, you know we out here bendin' somethin'
Them birds flyin' high, you know, you smell the scent or somethin'
We catch him out in traffic, shoot him out the tint or somethin'
I bust a brand new lick, it feel like I invеnted somethin'
They takin' onе of my dogs, you know we out here bendin' somethin'
Them birds flyin' high, you know, you smell the scent or somethin'
We catch him out in traffic, shoot him out the tint or somethin'
I bust a brand new lick, it feel like I invented somethin'
They takin' one of my dogs, you know we out here bendin' somethin'
Them birds flyin' high, you know, you smell the scent or somethin'
We catch him out in traffic, shoot him out the tint or somethin'

[Chorus]
Pullin' up, new Ferrari whip, that bitch go, "Yeah, ho"
22 shots in my Glock, that bitch go, "Yeah, ho"

[Verse]
Still I'm prayin', I'm bustin' the shots, I know my baby know
Slangin' that dope all on that corner, I want them AMGs
Better come correct all on that re-cut, you ain't play for keeps
He better not choke and he better not duck
I'm tryna get her all up
Might have to hold in my bust, can't get her knocked up
54 racks at the ATM, baby, I look at my tuck
I don't wanna fuck but I let her just suck
All of my diamonds they VV, none of my bitches wear BB, ayy
How many M's? I'm in your bitch DM

(The next thing the big band will be doing is a track from David's last LP, the one called "David Bowie", and
This song is "An Occasional Dream":)

[Verse 1]
I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise
Some things we could do

[Chorus 1]
In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes
To me
An Occasional Dream

[Verse 2]
And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
Between the sheets of summer
Bathed in blue
Gently weeping nights

It was long, long ago
And I can't touch your name
For the days of fate
Were strong for you
Danced you far from me

[Outro Chorus]
In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine ...
(and that was called an "An Occasional Dream" ...)

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
Hey Miss Parker
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Somethin' like (Uh-oh)
I just cut some fresh lemons, where's the sugar?
Lemon in my 'ade, lemon in my ears, call 'em boogers
Rather six feet 'fore I'm ever seen with you niggas (Hold up)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
What it is? It's that nigga T, skin look colored in (Woo)
Ridin' in double-double R, that's that Cullinan (Yeah)
Pullin' in that four hundred grand, I just ordered this (Yeah)
Switzerland, Lake Geneva where I spend my summer in (True story)
GOLF le FLEUR*, that's Gianno shoe, what I'm runnin' in
Earlobe look like headlights on a minivan (Gangsta Grillz)
I'm so motherfuckin' dead-ass, I need some Timberlands (Woo)
I battle any man, Uzi Vert, don't think they understand (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert & Tyler, The Creator]
Uh (Skrrt, cool), double C on my feet
Double G on my freak (Ooh), Louis V by my briefs
She wan' kick it with me, she better eat it then leave (Leave, woah)
She try save all the plates but keep eatin' my meat
We can't see none of 'em grow, she keep eatin' my seeds (Woo)
Got a E and a B on the back of the seat
See I'm done with the 12, got a V16 (Uh)
Say the money comin' in, yeah, that's true
The more money I get, I don't wan' sex you
Can't think about the last time that I text you
It's probably when sidekicks had them belt loops
Sign my John Hancock on a bitch every time I check you
Just like a brand new Lamb', I wreck you, uh
So what's mine is yours (Woo, woo, woo)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Lil Uzi Vert]
Ride to the dinner tapin'
Outta time and imagine her in the exit
Last deal more than what Google say my net is
I got cheddar with the chef in the tinted exit (Like woah)
Yeah, uh, uh, uh, woah

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
It's the double P, I rock double C
Man, I run them beats like you run in cleats
Man, come to me, you want somethin' to see
This internally flawed, that's a double Vs
What troubles me is you couple me
With these subtle fleas tryna double league
Hornet trapped in the hive of a motherfuckin' bumblebee
They just got the closest picture of the fuckin' sun surface, that was us
Got the LaFerrari, park that bitch just for one purpose, catchin' dust
My Secret Service carry mops, you call 'em street sweepers, back you up
Tat' you up then add you up, then give you a cover like Adwoa
If the shit's fake, I don't respect it, it's clickbait
And that's distaste like a shit shake
What a difference your wrist make when it's Richard-made
Hungry eyes tend to fixate like a empty stomach for a fish plate
Shit-faced, get this straight, this is truck wheels, deck, grip tape

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
Ride to the dinner tapin'
Outta time and imagine her in the exit (Why you even talkin' to us?)
Last deal more than what Google say my net is (Goddamn)
I got cheddar with the chef in the tinted exit (Like woah)
Uh, uh, uh (Bitch)
I know there must be something caught up in the air at the time
You know the loneliness is only temporary in mind
But is it true
It might just be you

Assessing the equation
My paranoia turns the situation
Upside down
To words that seem to tell me to create
And make me realize that

It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream

Shake it up
Shake it up
Shake it up
I mean you've got me on thousands of occasions
And my annals not adjacent
I'm certainly not a gradiеnt
Afraid I'm dead right
I wish my heart was right
But your hands that tell mе sick to click
Before I realized that it was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream

And when I wake
I bake
In the heat
Of when we meet

And when I wake
I bake
In the heat
Of when we meet

And when I wake
I bake
In the heat
Of when we meet

[Lady with a Fan]

[Verse 1]
Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
Till my tale is told and done

[Verse 2]
While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
Till things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

[Verse 3]
Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

[Verse 4]
Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love

[Verse 5]
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing therе

[Verse 6]
Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes hеr fan and throws it
In the lion's den

[Verse 7]
"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

[Verse 8]
The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster

[Verse 9]
The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise

[Verse 10]
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
And not to master

[Verse 11]
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

[Terrapin Station]

[Verse 12]
Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

[Verse 13]
Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
Oh, from the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune

[Verse 14]
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - if it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - but the train's put its brakes on
Terrapin - and the whistle is screaming:
Terrapin!

[At a Siding]

[Verse 15]
While you were gone
These faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden
With nothing to believe in
The compass always points to Terrapin

[Verse 16]
Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again
For good or ill again

[Verse 1]
See me last night
I was laying in my bed and dying
Annie Beauneau from Saint Angel
Say "The weather down here, so fine"

[Verse 2]
Just then, the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can
The weather command?
Just want to have
A little peace to die
And a friend or two
I love at hand

[Verse 3]
Fever roll up to a hundred and five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground

[Verse 4]
See here, how everything
Lеad up to this day
And it's just like
Any other day
That's evеr been
Sun going up
And then the
Sun, it going down
Shine through my window and
My friends, they come around

[Bridge]
Come around
Come around

[Verse 5]
The people may know but
The people don't care
That a man could be
As poor as me
Take a look at poor Peter
He's lying in pain
Now, let's go
Run and see
Run and see
Run and see
Run, run, and see
Hey, hey
See

[Verse]
We had something special baby
We don't need to give it to nobody else
Let's just, let's just be close again
And in my drawers it's in my drink and now I'm on it
I take my phone call your number hope you're on it
What do you do to me?
I feel so lonely
Oh, I feel lonely

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's have sex on the beach, have sex on the heat, yeah, yeah
It's so dirty, it's so, uh, flirty, yeah
She wanna make love in a private jet in the sky

[Chorus]
You wanna make love to the right one, then that might be me
And it might be, and it might be me, and it might be me
Said it might be, and it might be me, and it might be me
And it might be, and it might be me, and it might be me
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down

Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Gigi, Gigi
Take me away
Gigi, Gigi
Take me today

The boys in the clothes shop
Sold me curry for a pound
His cardboard face is soggy
And he's selling thorny crown

I loved her
I loved her
I've got to get away
But I loved her
London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down

Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Red light, green light
Make up your mind
Red light, green light
You're much too unkind

She lovеs to love all beauty
And she says thе norm is funny
But she whimpers in the morning
When she finds she has no money

I loved her
I loved her
I've got to get away now
But I loved her!

Oh, London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down
Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Oh, London bye ta-ta
Strange young town
London bye ta-ta
Brought me down

Don't like your new face
That's not nice
Got to go far, far
London bye ta-ta

Oh, London bye ta-ta
Ooh, London bye ta-ta
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Said I had to clear out my head (Said I had to clear out my head)
But tonight, I think I lost the plot instead
I said that I'd be cleared out by three (Said that I'd be cleared out by three)
To the walls, I know they listen to me
The teachers always called it a shame (The teachers always called it a shame)
They say I don't have passion the same
As I did a few years before (As I did a few years before)
They don’t see the light there anymorе

[Chorus]
They call it sad, but they’re thе outside lookin' in
I mean, they can’t understand when they all cope with everything
And when I opened my heart in front of my friends finally
It was not what I thought, 'cause they're not there anymore
I called my dad, he told me there's no room for me
Down at the house that we had when we were living as a three
Now that my family's gone, almost as far as I can see
I think they love me I'm sure, but they're not there anymore (Hey)
(Nah, nah-nah-nah-nah)
Where can I sleep tonight?
(Nah, nah-nah-nah-nah)

[Verse 2]
I'm breakin' them in half, they always say
I never wanted them to end this way
And now I have to gather all my things
They don't want the problems that I bring (They don't know the problems that I bring, hey)

[Chorus]
They-they-they call it sad, but they’re the outside lookin' in
I mean, they can't understand when they all cope with everything
And when I opened my heart in front of my friends finally
It was not what I thought, 'cause they're not there anymore

[Outro]
I called my dad, he told me there's no room for me
Down at the house that we had when we were living as a three
I called my dad, he told me there's no room for me
Down at the house that we had when we were living
I called my dad, he told me there's no room for me
Down at the house that we had

[Verse 1]
How many years will it take for these tears to dry?
Oh, my Lord please don't pass me by
Where can I run when my running is out of time?

[Chorus]
These are the moments that I'm with you
Under the pressure I'll see it through
Live out the wonder way past the borderline
Adventure as far as the eye can see
I'll try not to miss you too desperately
Live out the wonder way past the borderline

[Verse 2]
It comes and it goеs but it's always in control of me
How the hell on еarth can I set me free?
Where can I run when the ground moves beneath my feet?

[Chorus]
These are the moments that I'm with you
Under the pressure I see it through
Live out the wonder way past the borderline
Adventure as far as the eye can see
I'll try not to miss you too desperately
Live out the wonder way past the borderline, the borderline
These are the moments that I'm with you
Under the pressure I see it through
Live out the wonder way past the borderline
Adventure as far as the eye can see
I'll try not to miss you too desperately
Live out the wonder way past the borderline

[Intro]
You are the light of my world
Don't need to try so hard
Dreaming of time on my hands
Changing the ways I fall

[Verse 1]
I want you
But I don't want your reasons why
You can't even look me in my eye
I told you
So don't you make me say it one more time, like

[Pre-Chorus]
When you went away
Moonlight took the day
Stars and darkness all collide
In the loneliest of space

[Chorus]
Will you stand, stand, stand, stand, stand, oh?
Will you stand, stand, stand, stand?

[Verse 2]
Can you stand the rain?
When summer's gone and there's no use in
Weighing it out all the time all in vain
Seeping deeper into blame

[Pre-Chorus]
When you went away
Moonlight took the day
Stars and darkness all collidе
In the loneliest of spacе
When you went away
My universe divided
All that's left is the matter of asking myself

[Chorus]
Will you stand, stand, stand?
Or will you falter
Will you lean into the timeless bending
Never-ending strength in your heart
Or will you prosper
Will you recover after all the love
You've lost and lost again
Will you stand, stand, stand, stand, woo-woo?
Will you stand, stand, stand?

[Bridge]
The universe defined it over all of me (Yeah)
And I've been looking deep into my soul
Finding my reflection in the mercury (Mercury)
And turning my transgressions into gold (Whoa, whoa)
Knew you would be miles away (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Can you stand the pain, pain, baby?
Can you stand?
Can you stand the rain?
Can you stand?
Tell me, can you stand?

[Outro]
When you went to heaven, oh, I knew you would be miles
Oh, I knew you would be miles away
Hey, you couldn’t stay
Now baby, I don’t blame you
I won’t miss you
Too desperately
Can you stand the rain
Even through the pain
When they calling you out your name
Oh, you stand the rain even through the pain
When they calling you out your name
Can you stand the rain?
Make it through all the things they say

[Verse 1]
If I shoot him in the stomach
Then he’s hurting on my dime
And if I shoot him in the head, then he’s dead and he’s livin’ on my mind
My reflection in the mirror
Her perfection in his eyes
I’m a danger to myself
I run from twelve
And take my rage across the county line, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won’t let this go
Not my tomorrow
Don’t forget your pride, it’s laying in her bed of sorrow

[Chorus]
What you done to me
I swear to you it’s gonna come back like a boomerang
Wooooo
Wooooo
Woooooooooo

[Verse 2]
You knew my daddy didn’t like you
From the moment you two met
Hе knew too well, you would drag me through Hеll
And never come back for the baby we’d regret
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won’t let this go
Not my tomorrow
Don’t forget your pride
It’s laying in her bed of sorrow

[Chorus]
What you, what you done to me
I swear to you it’s gonna come back like a boomerang
Woooooo
Wooooo
Woooooooooo
What you done to me
I swear to you it’s gonna come back like a boomerang
And knock you to your knees
I swear to you it’s gonna come back like a boomerang
Woooooo
Woooo
Wooooo

[Verse 1]
I walked across the wire
Straight to the razor’s edge for you
Cut through my own desires
Only to watch you hold her

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know
I tried to call
But can I stay the night?
You whisper "one more time"
Turning my tears into diamonds that fall through your sky
And after all that you promised, ah

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted was you
And now I know we both got our obligations
All I ever wanted was you

[Verse 2]
I dreamt that we were fallin'
But it was just the pouring rain
No heat worth holding onto
So I grabbed my shit to leave again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know
I tried to call
But can I stay the night?
You whisper "one more time"
Turning my tears into diamonds that fall through your sky
And after all that you promised, ah

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted was you
And now I know we both got our obligations
All I ever wanted was you
And yes I know you promised her everything but
All I ever wanted was you
And yes I know that you promised her everything but
I can't wait too lon-lon-long on you my baby
All I ever wanted was you
And now I know that we'll never have the conversation
All I ever wanted was you
I know that you promised her everything but baby
All I ever wanted was you (Ooh, yeah)
(All I ever wanted was you, all I ever wanted was you)
(All I ever wanted was you, all I ever wanted was you)

[Chorus: YEBBA]
Roll up all my ones, take my chances
Hit another blunt, watch the embers burn away
Pour a double cup, I'm dirty dancin'
What am I runnin' from when I run so
Far away, away, away, away
Far away, away, away, away

[Verse 1: YEBBA]
I been shadowboxin' your nightmares left and right
Showin' up to the battlefield, no one to fight
Keep believin' the smoke will clear and the bombs will subside
As I lay down my pride in the things I confide in
For all these years, holdin' back my tears
Lord knows that I'm tryin', I know our love has been dyin'
I still need you here, I still need you here while I

[Chorus: YEBBA, YEBBA & A$AP Rocky]
Roll up all my ones, take my chances
Hit another blunt (Yeah-yeah, yeah), watch thе embers burn away
Pour a double cup, I'm dirty dancin'
What am I runnin' from (Yеah-yeah, yeah, yeah) when I run so
Far away, away, away, away
Far away, away, away, away

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I love shrooms (Yeah), I might get that tattooed (Yeah)
Might just keep it cool (Yeah) dependin' on my mood (Yeah)
The sun is risin' (Yeah) dependin' on my moon (Yeah)
Tell them boys back it up 'cause I'm finna act a fool (Gimme some room)
Yabba dabba doo, I'm with YEBBA in my coupe
With my fellas, butter-soft leathers, bumpin' Fela Kuti
Off that gin and juice, after, after that, I left the roof
After that, we hit the after-hours spot 'til the afternoon
I love shrooms
Verses where hands-on, I can't come now, I got my hands full
Why wait around on the answer? I just air it out like my hamper
Wax like the candle, back in the days in the bando (Back in the bando)
I can't fuck with that ho 'cause she canceled (She canceled)
With no tampon, walked with a man without holdin' her hand (Holdin' her hand)
Period
If I focus, I can transform into a lotus (Into a lotus)
Pull up with Rolls Royces, two sisters like two twin Holsters ghosted (Hocus pocus, magic)

[Chorus: YEBBA]
Roll up all my ones, take my chances
Hit another blunt, watch the embers burn away
Pour a double cup, I'm dirty dancin'
What am I runnin' from when I run so
Far away, away, away, away
Far away, away, away, away

[Intro: YEBBA]
You, ooh

[Verse 1: YEBBA]
It was a stormy winter
I watched the city burn
And ever since I can remember
That's just the way it hurts
And it goes on and on and on
Like I can never see the pinnacle of it all

[Chorus: YEBBA]
Put it in my Louie Bag, don't let it overflow
Move it in, ship it out, tell me if they want some more (Some more)
'Cause I got that fire, it's comin' for them now
Friends are fallin' off, talkin' shit for no reason
Checkin' all my locks 'cause it's robbin' season now
La, da-da, da-da, da
La-la, da-da, da-da, la, da, da-da, da-da

[Verse 2: YEBBA]
They cut my palms with paper
Made from her Autumn leaves
I'm bleedin' out disclaimеrs
Into my family tree
Fuck the interviews to еnterprise
I'd rather look into my mother's eyes
And let it be
Let it be, ee, yeah

[Chorus: YEBBA]
Put it in my Louie Bag, don't let it overflow
Move it in, ship it out, tell me if they want some more (Some more)
'Cause I got that fire, it's comin' for them now
Friends are fallin' off, talkin' shit for no reason
Checkin' all my locks 'cause it's robbin' season now
La, da-da, da-da, da
La-la, da-da, da-da, la, da, da-da, da-da

[Verse 3: Smino]
When the sky like this, I drop my top (I drop my top)
Pull up on you just like a sock (Just like a sock)
Come and ride, we ain't even gotta talk (We ain't gotta talk)
Yeah, yeah, YEBBA
Yeah, but I was 'posed to make it by now (Uh-oh)
Yeah, but life threw me in the wrong realm (Uh-oh)
Yeah, we always got time to do better (Uh-oh)
YEBBA, I was tryna do it right now (Uh-oh)
And we was growin' up in a town (Uh-oh)
Where they never showed love to the brown (Uh-huh)
Twenty-four hours ain't enough time (Uh-huh)
I was fightin', throwin' hands with the clock (Uh-oh)
Never been sweet, no honeycomb (Oh, oh)
Money gone, granny gone, run along (Woah, oh)
City burn, pin it on Pentagon (Oh, oh)
Can't make it up no Revlon (Woah, oh)
Shit bubble up, RevRun (Oh, oh)
Had the episodes, this a re-run (Oh, oh)
And they tell me, "Go pray to the reverend"
Told God that I felt like a stepson (Oh)
Buy a brand new coupe for the stress, huh
Thick thang on the way for the stress, huh
Big blunt on the way to my chest lungs
Nowadays the distance hit me hard (Hit me hard)
I admit, I'm addicted to livin' large (Livin' large)
One, three, five, seven, beat the odds (Beat the odds)

[Chorus: YEBBA]
Put it in my Louie Bag, don't let it overflow
Move it in, ship it out, tell me if they want some more (Some more)
'Cause I got that fire, it's comin' for them now
Friends are fallin' off, talkin' shit for no reason
Checkin' all my locks 'cause it's robbin' season now
La, da-da, da-da, da
La-la, da-da, da-da, la, da, da-da, da-da
I've been livin' out of this suitcase for way too long, oh
Sellin' my coat and smokin' my last
Promise not to look into your past, no
Now I can say that I'm stronger
At least now that I can say that I was stronger
Won't hold it against myself
Won't hold it against myself
Hold it against myself
Hold it, yeah

Oh, I used to put it in my Louis bag
Tell me if they want some more

Now I want to stay a while, stay a while
And I can't figure it out, but I'll stay a while
Stand outside my door, just one more smile
Stay a while, stay a while
Oh, stay a while, stay a while
Stay a while, stay a while

[Verse 1]
I was so lost in love
Six feet underground
Until your love came down
A hopeless soul
I was hellbound
Until your love came down

[Chorus]
Your love came down, your love came down
Your love came down
Your love came down, your love came down
Your love came

[Verse 2]
I was a rolling stone
Nowhere to be found
Until you came around
Your heart of gold
Mend my broken crown
That's when your love came down

[Chorus]
Your love came down, your love came down
Your love came down
Your love came down, your love came down
Your lovе came down

[Bridge]
Now I laugh at the thunder
'Causе I know it's above me
And we can make it somehow
Holdin' on to each other
No, I don't have to wonder
If I'm safe and sound
Until your love came down

[Chorus]
Your love came down, your love came down
Your love came down
Your love came down, your love came down
Your love came down
Your love came down, your love came down
Your love came down
Your love came down, your love came down
Your love came

[Verse 1]
Tell me, will you leave me lonely?
On and on and on, I know you told me
The most important reason why
You'll color in as many lines as I need you
Tell me, when we have no money
And the sirens start their calling, you say
Slow down, slow down
Come on, slow down

[Chorus]
And this paranoia purple turns to green
And nothing is as simple as it seems
What's happening to me?

[Verse 2]
Say now, when my life is over
Will you find somebody good enough to hold ya?
Someone like my Abigail
To tell you all is good and well like me now
Say now, I feel my color show how
I think it's almost time for me to go now
Go now, go now

[Chorus]
But this paranoia purple turns to gray
And all that's good and well, it melts away
Until we meet again

[Bridge]
Woah, ah-ah-ah
How could I forgеt you?
I still can't figure it out
It's two years, mom
I still can't figure it out
Woo, ooh
Oh, how could I forgеt about you now? (How could I forget about you now?)
Tell me, how could I forget about you now? (How could I forget about you now?)
Now, now
Now
How could I, yeah, for-forget about you?
I still can't figure you out
Into the Dawn

[Outro: Dawn]
Hope you're having fun, and I hope you're singing away
You're my little joy, you're my little star
I love you, bye
Love, Mama
Call me a ghost
But mind you
I've got some pain so real it came alive

In me (In me)
In me (In me)

I'm halfway dissolved
I'm half there
More than a phantom but less than a man

Haunting her halls
Like dust
I'm halfway surprised at the touch of her hand

On me (On me)
On me (On me)

Picture perfect, broken frame
Throw it away and start all over
Lift me through a broken plane
My open wound, my escalator

[Verse 1]
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Verse 2]
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let thеm be
Some boys try, and some boys liе
But I don't let them play (No way)
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

[Chorus]
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Interlude]
Living in a material world
Living in a material world
Material

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Interlude]
Living in a material world (Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (Material-al)
Living in a material world

[Verse 3]
Boys may come, and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich, and now they're after me

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

[Outro]
A material, a material, a material, a material world
Material

[Verse 1]
I've got a message for you, baby
'Cause you ain't done nothin' for me lately
And if you want to be my man
Come on, baby, catch me if you can

[Chorus]
I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonight
I'm talking whisky slammin', dirty dancin', romancin' come daylight
No matter what you're thinking that I wouldn't, baby, I just might
'Cause I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonight

[Verse 2]
Well, I paid way too much for these jeans
They look too damn good not to be seen
So if you don't want to play, baby
I'll go meet up with the ladies
You know exactly what that means

[Chorus]
I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonight
I'm talkin' starting trouble, seein' double, hey handsome, you got a light?
No matter what you're thinking that I wouldn't, baby, I just might
'Cause I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonight

[Bridge]
Body shots, French kiss
Hold my beer and watch this
That's what I had in mind
Well, do you wanna? 'Cause I'm gonna, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonight
I'm talking whisky slammin', dirty dancin', romancin' come daylight
No matter what you're thinking that I wouldn't, baby, I just might
I said I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonight
No matter what you're thinking that I wouldn't, baby, I just might
I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get crazy tonight

[Verse]
So, what's left of your imagination?
When time slows down, you lay still, oh-oh
Looking back, it's not always worthless
You're aware of the bed you lay in, hmm-mmm
Cling to youth, it's your own devotion
Though it's juvenile, you remain open, mmm-mmm
Oscillations that ricochet
Let the child in you slowly meditate, oh

[Spoken Word: Lil Yachty & Tyler, The Creator]
You gotta speak, you gotta, tell 'em, tell 'em what happened, tell 'em what happened
You talkin’ 'bout? This bitch got bad, he definitely left the country
You don’t, you don’t even have a passport
Have you ever tried the phone, like... What?

[Verse 1: All]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine-ine-ine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin', my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
And one's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't no winner in this game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4: All]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
There ain't no place a man can hide, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 6: All]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him, a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving
Much too slow

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: All]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
I’m really, really honored to be receiving this award because it honors the part of my job that is so magical and mystical to me, still. I love songwriting so much because there’s an element to it that is still really mysterious — like I think any songwriter will tell you, when you get an idea you’re not quite sure where it floated down from, but if you can grab onto that idea and turn it into something, a piece of music, that’s where craftsmanship comes in; that’s where you have thе opportunity to learn and to nurture that craft, and I want to take a momеnt to thank the people who were my professors, my teachers, of the craft of songwriting.

First of all, to anyone who wrote with me in Nashville when I was in eighth or ninth grade: That is insane that you did that, and I am so lucky that I got to learn from some of the best writers on Music Row. Liz Rose was someone who spent hours and hours and hours with me when there was absolutely no sign that anything would happen in my career. My dance card was not full, I was 14, and she wrote with me so many times and taught me how to edit my ideas down into something that would pack an emotional punch.

Then, later in my career, I got to work with Max Martin and Johan Shellback, who I learned so much from 

[in] a melodic sense, and I will carry those lessons with me for the rest of my life. I will learn more lessons from them next time we work together, and I feel really lucky that they’ve been a part of my life.

Jack Antonoff is such a wonderful creator and such a nurturing presence — with his own art and other artists, he’s just so versatile and such a wonderful friend. Aaron Dessner came into my life recently, and he is just such a prolific creator. All of these people changed my writing and helped shape it.

There are so many others, though. So if you’ve ever sat in a room and cowritten with me, thank you so much. Anyone who’s ever wanted to produce one of my songs, any collaborator I’ve ever had — I’ve learned from all of you. I want to say thank you to Troy Tomlinson for always being excited to hear new songs of mine, and to Jody Gerson for being such a champion of female songwriters throughout the industry.

This is something I am so proud to receive. And to the fans who are out there who care about my lyrics — you have no idea how much it means to me that you dissect them and copy them into your journals and care about the words that I write.

There are amazing songwriters who came before me who deserve this, there are incredible songwriters coming up now who are so impressive and amazing: I have such an affinity and respect for all of you. I am honored to receive this. Thank you so much.

[Verse 1]
He was a hard-headed man
He was brutally handsome, and she was terminally pretty
She held him up, and he held her for ransom
In the heart of the cold, cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, "Faster, faster, the lights are turnin' red"

[Chorus]
Life in the fast lane, surely makеs you lose your mind
Life in the fast lanе, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Are you with me so far?
Good

[Verse 2]
Eager for action and hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills
There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice, she was caught up in the race
Out every evening, until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

[Chorus]
Life in the fast lane, surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, yeah
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, blowin' and burnin', blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worst
She said, "Listen, baby, you can hear them engines ring"
"We've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a hot damn thing"
He said, "Call the doctor, I think I'm gonna crash"
"The doctor says he's comin', but you gotta pay in cash"
They went rushin' down that freeway, messed around and got lost
They didn't know, they were just dyin' to get off and it was

[Chorus]
Life in the fast lane, surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, yeah
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world
And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

[Chorus]
Well good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doing great out there without me
Baby, god, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But, you're so unaffected
I really don't get it
But, I guess, good for you

[Verse 2]
Well good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
It's like we never even happened, baby, tell me what is up with that
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to god I was the only person who got you
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

[Chorus]
Well good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doing great out there without me
Baby, god, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected
I really don't get it
But, I guess, good for you

[Bridge]
{Instrumental}

[Verse 3]
Maybe I'm too emotional
But, your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
But, your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doing great out there without me
Baby, like a ---- sociopath

[Chorus]
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But, you're so unaffected
I really don't get it
But, I guess, good for you

[Outro]
Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

[Chorus: Jerry Garcia]
Well, my mama told me, my papa told me too
Now my mama told me, Papa told me too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Instrumental]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1: Jerry Garcia]
Well, I went to the depot, I never got there on time
Went down to the depot, never got there on time
Well, my train's going down, she's a-rolling down the line

[Verse 2: All]
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies!
Mister jailer, go away, don't tell me no lies!
Well my train's going down, she's a-rolling down the line

[Instrumental]

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Jerry Garcia]
Well, my mama told me, my papa told me too
Now my mama told me, Papa told me too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Chorus]
Wake up fucked up like a college kid
Back and forth how she suckin', you so good at this
Brand new Rolls, brand new broads, they so good at his
Got so fucked up last night, had to wonder what it is (You stupid, Quazi)

[Intro]
Quazi, you stupid
Mmm

[Chorus]
I got, different diamonds and they bustin' on me, yeah
I just, switch the count and when I walk in flooded, yeah
I got different bitches and they fuckin' on me yeah
Okay, fuck my exes, I'm just stuntin' on 'em, yeah-ah-ah
And they bustin' on me, yeah-ah-ah
Blower clutchin' on me, yeah-ah-ah
In due time, I'll be the man, yeah, yeah
For now I got 'em bustin' on me, yeah

[Verse 1]
I had a broken heart and a broken heel
And a break down when those big old wheels
Left with him and left me in a cloud of deep old dust
She was sittin' there with her beehive hair
And said, "Honey, that's a waste of good mascara"
She handed me a pink Kleenex
And I'll never forget what she said next

[Chorus]
"Boys and buses got a lot in common
They both pick up speed when you try to stop 'em
You could waste your breath
You could scream and cuss 'em
But there's no use chasin' after boys and buses"

[Verse 2]
She said, "Some leave with a guitar casе
Some wind up at an army base
Some makе out much under the hood
And some roll it on out to Hollywood
But the cost is lost once the ticket's bought
And you can't catch but don't wanna be caught
But when those tail lights start to dim
There's another one comin' right around the bend, 'cause

[Chorus]
Boys and buses got a lot in common
They both pick up speed when you try to stop 'em
You could waste your breath
You could scream and cuss 'em
But there's no use chasin' after boys and buses

[Bridge]
Sometimes love and transportation
Will spin your wheels and keep you waiting
But anytime you think you've missed it
Just give it ten or fifteen minutes

[Chorus]
Boys and buses got a lot in common
They both pick up speed when you try to stop 'em
You could waste your breath
You could scream and cuss 'em
But there's no use chasin' after boys and buses
Yeah, there's no use chasin' after boys and buses

[Intro]
Two broken hearted people
That never should have crossed that line

[Verse 1]
We both cheated on each other
Drove our love into the ground
Told each other we're so sorry
But it's all over, too late now
Now I could never trust you
And you know (Know) you can't trust me
We're both standing (Standing) here convicted
With no reason to believe

[Chorus]
So why can't we just call it even?
You go your way and I'll go mine
Just two brokenhearted people
Who never should (Should) have crossed that line

[Verse 2]
Well, I love you, but I hate you
You've done things I can't forgive
And no, I (I) have been no angel
You paid me back for what I did

[Chorus]
So why can't we just call it even?
You go your way and I'll go mine
Just two brokenhearted people
Who never should (Should) have crossed that line

[Outro]
Yeah, we're just two poor brokenhearted people
Who never should have crossed that line

[Intro]
Ah-one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Who needs a house up on a hill
When you can have one on four wheels
And take it anywhere the wind might blow?
You don't ever have to mow the yard
Just hang a map and throw a dart
And pray to God the engine starts and go

[Chorus 1]
Water and electric
And a place to drain the septic
Any K.O.A. is A-OK as long as I'm with you
So come on hitch your wagon
To the living room I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you

[Verse 2]
Parking lots and county lines
And counting mile marker signs
Where the buffalo and antelope all roam
Greetings from Niagara Falls
One more postcard for the wall
Off in our own sweet home away from home

[Chorus 1]
Water and electric
And a placе to drain the septic
Any K.O.A. is A-OK as long as I'm with you
So come on hitch your wagon
To thе living room I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you

[Bridge]
In Washington, in Idaho
In Oregon, and away we go
To Tennessee and Arkansas
No, we won't stop 'til we've seen 'em all
'Til we've seen 'em all

[Chorus 2]
So what else could you ask for?
You don't even need a passport
To see the whole world from our living room
So come on hitch your wagon
To the happiness I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you

[Outro]
It don't matter where we go
We'll never be alone
Anywhere beside you is a place that I'll call home
It don't matter where we go
We'll never be alone
Anywhere beside you is a place that I'll call home

[Verse 1]
Are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he stepped to thе bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskеy jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over, and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack on Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hick'ry just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 5]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Outro]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on
Snippet

[Verse]
Take a look at me
I just whipped that bitch just like I'm booker T
Quarter million dollars only time a nigga bookin' me
4k just came home, he just did a bid and took a 3
I paid lawyer fees when all you stand up niggas took a seat

[Intro]
Okay

[Verse 1]
Change like the wind
Like the water, like skin
Change like the sky
Like the leaves, like a butterfly

[Chorus 1]
Would you live forever, never die
While everything around passes?
Would you smile forever, never cry
While everything you know passes?

[Verse 2]
Death's like a door
To a place we've never been before
Death, like space
The deep sea, a suitcase

[Chorus 2]
Would you stare forever at the sun
And never watch the moon rising?
Would you walk forever in the light
To never learn the secret of the quiet night?

[Verse 3]
Still like a stone
Like a hill, like home
Still, what I find
Is you are always on my mind

[Chorus 3]
Could I feel happy for you
When I hear you talk with her like we used to?
Could I set everything free
When I watch you holding her the way you once held me?

[Verse 4]
Change like the sky
Like the leaves, like a butterfly
Death, like a door
To a place we've never been before

[Chorus 1]
Would you live forever, never die
While everything around passes?
Would you smile forever, never cry?

[Intro: Ant Clemons]
Turned to a Mothra, bro, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Phantom of the opera, it goes where it goes
My nightmares still haunt me (Dream)
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me (Ooh)
And my nightmares, they haunt me (Ooh ooh)
But I won't let 'em get the best of me (Yeah)

Alex Jones said the same shit and fried, oh shit!
Alien, pyramid, fly off, take off
Break off, Kit Kat, take off, wake up
Make off, they go, say go, get makeov'
You let go in Waco, Texas
Pull up, err-err, 'Lexus

Message, message, bless it
Don't stress it, don't stress shit
Don't test it, don't test this
Don't touch this, man they Hammer time
On the dotted line, on the camera time
When it's out of line and they meant it right
Done it down to nine, on the dotted line
Want a better line and I'm feeling right
Kill the feeling, right, oh and I made it rhyme
'Cause I met a time and you're out of time
And you wear the line and he out of line
But he set it off, on the Adderall
When they got it all, set it off y'all

[Verse 1: Bob Weir]
Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali blues
Yeah

[Chorus: All]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose?
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2: Bob Weir]
She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose."
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues

[Chorus: All]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose?
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billy Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues
Yeah

[Chorus: All]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose?
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

Don't settle, move away from the ghetto
Put your family somewhere special
If you love her you should tell her
Ain't no pretty way to paint it
This love could rearrange it
I'm still hanging 'round with my boys that I came with
It's beautiful, ain't it?
The way that you play me
I'd either end up as Lupe or Jay-Z
I still remember when Noah said he wasn't buying my image
Don't make god, he did it better
Now look, I'm here forever
Even if I never end up as a Jackson
Some 

[...] only make it to the game just to pay they taxes
And pay rent
And keep the way I'm laughing, that's it
Say it ain't so, dawg
That could be, that could be-
T-t-t-that could be me when it ends

Don't put me off, 'cause I'm on fire
And I can't quench my desire
Don't you know that I'm burning up for your love?
You're not convinced that that is enough
I put myself in this position
And I deserve the imposition
But you don't even know I'm alive
And this pounding in my heart just won't die
I'm burning up

[Chorus]
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love
For your love

[Verse 2]
You're always closing your door
And that only makes me want you more
And day and night, I cry for your love
You're not convinced that that is enough
To justify my wanting you
Now tell me what you want me to do
I'm not blind, and I know
That you want to want me, but you can't let go
C'mon, let go

[Chorus]
I'm burning up, burning up for your love

[Verse 1]
Figured I be more well prepared for this time in my life
Figure I quit eating tostitos, start drinking red wine
But I'm still stuck on thirty-two opal an
Second floor bedroom across the hall from my open
No boys allowed
Kill that noise around me
Your voice so loud
Feels like God's around me
Calling, just come on in, oh, la-la-la

[Chorus]
In this midnight hour
I've been searchin' and I've come to find out
I'm the only one who comes to comfort me
Close my eyes, I fear I'm all I see

[Verse 2]
Give it a rest now sister, miss my baby sister
She's growin' up and I'm not growin' with her
Who is your saviour now? (Tell hеr)
Don't get caught smokin' loud
It ain't worth it
I promise you'll learn it
And fuck all that surfacе shit
I promise you're perfect, you're perfect, baby girl

[Chorus]
In this midnight hour
I've been searchin' and I've come to find out
I'm the only one who comes to comfort me
Close my eyes, I fear I'm all I see

[Verse 3]
I don't really think about where I'm goin'  what I'm doin' life is lonely
If your days is ruined, I wrote this for you, you
I wrote this to soothe you
She don’t really think about where she’s going
What she’s doin’ oh her life is lonely
Now her days are ruined
She wrote this for you, you
She hopes that it’s moves you
(She hopes that it moves you)

[Intro]
Three, two, one

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just can't take it
Sometimes I just can't take it and it isn't alright
I'm not gonna make it
And I think my shoe's untied (Ooh-ooh)

I'm like a broken record and I'm not playin' right
Drocer nekorb a ekil mi
'Til you tell me on your heavenly phone

When for so long I'd been down on my knees
Then your love song saved me over and over
For so long I'd been down on my knees
'Til your love song floats me on
Ee-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your arm, says "Don't you see?"
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 1]
Been walking all morning, went walking all night
I can't see much difference between the dark and light
And I feel the wind, and I taste the rain
Never in my mind to cause so much pain

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your arm, says "Don't you see?"
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
From day to day just letting it ride
You get so far away from how it feels inside
You can't let go 'cause you're afraid to fall
But the day may come when you can't feel at all

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your arm, says "Don't you see?"
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Outro]
Only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Guitar Solo Outro]

[Snippet]
I loved you then

[Part I: SWEET]

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
No, no, no, no, no, no, listen, listen (Call me when you get lost, lost)
The driver gon' drop you off
Alright, it's warm (Call me when you get lost, lost)
The waterfall is crazy
I don't know, make somethin' up, tell him somethin'
Uh, come on
Still on the boat
Call me if you get lost

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You and I, we fell in love
I ain't read the signs, ain't know what it was
But God gotta know he might have peaked when he made you
The cosmos' only mistake is what they named you (What that mean?)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
They should call you sugar, you're so sweet
Well, they should call you sugar, 'cause you're so sweet to me
Well, they should call you sugar, sugar, oh, you're so sweet
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest thing I've known

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Baby, you're the sweetest thing

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Even if
You left me out here stranded, my feelings wouldn't change a bit (You know how I feel about you, are you ready?)
You know how I feel, baby
Infinite
The love I have for you, a diamond couldn't put a dent in it (Uh, go to the bridge thing, okay)

[Bridge: Brent Faiyaz]
Darling, you're the wind under my wings
My heart beats triple time when I see you
Somethin' I can't control
If I compared you, the sun is a stand-in (Sun)
You got a smile that could light up a planet (Smile), yeah (Oh, oh)
And I just wanted you to know (They should call you sugar)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, Brent Faiyaz & Both]
They should call you sugar, you're so sweet
Well, they should call you sugar (Why?), 'cause you're so sweet to me (Sugar)
Well, they should call you sugar (Sugar), you're so sweet (Oh, oh)
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest thing I've known (Ooh, girl)

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
You're the sweetest

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, Brent Faiyaz]
They should call you sugar, you're so sweet (Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar)
Well, they should call you sugar (Why?), 'cause you're so sweet to me
Well, they should call you sugar, you're so sweet (You're so sweet to me)
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest (I know)

[Outro: Brent Faiyaz & Tyler, The Creator]
And you look so good (Yeah)
And you smell so good (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you taste so good (Yeah)
And you're so, so good (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're the sweetest (Yeah)
Yeah, you are, ha-ha
Sweet like, like motherfuckin' brown sugar sweet potatoes (Are you ready?)
Or somethin'
Ha-ha

[Segue: Tyler, The Creator]
The plan was to stick my toe in and
Check the temperature, but
Next thing I know, I'm
I'm drownin'
Appelle-moi si tu te perds

[Part II: I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE]

[Intro: DJ Drama]
This here for the sunseekers
Run the track

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
What makes you think
I'm not in love?
How could you know
What's best for us?
Why am I here
Standing alone?
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance, yeah (Welcome to the disco)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You're so good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, it felt good to me, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah, yeah
You're so good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, it felt so good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, Fana Hues, & Both]
So, what makes you think (What makes you think)
I'm not in love? (I'm not in love?)
And how could you know (How could you know)
What's best for us, us, us? (What's best for us?)
Why am I here (Why am I here)
Standing alone? (Standing alone?)
Because I thought you wanted to dance with me

[Verse 2: Fana Hues]
Honestly, it's all about the timing, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I ain't mean to lead you on, because
Him and I got some things that we're trying
But my energy belongs to you
I want you so bad, but not too fast
It's not your fault, we can't pretend
Because we both in the wrong

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
So what makes you think
I'm not in love? (Feels so good)
How could you know, know, know
What's best for us?
Why am I here
Standing alone?
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance, yeah (Run the track)
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance
('Cause I thought you wanted to dance with me) I thought you wanted to dance
('Cause I thought you wanted to dance with me) I thought you wanted to dance
I thought you wanted to dance

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
I wish that we never met, I wish that we ain't connect
Like Lego, connection good, but mixed signal
If you say so, like cardio
We stared up and down, but we didn't blink
Felt like dirty dishes 'cause we was in sync
I swear to God, if you and him never linked
I'd tear that ass up like somethin' was stole
I'd make them glass balls roll back to your skull
Call a tail number, where you wanna go?
The fuck do he got that I don't got a lot of?
There go my ego again, that's the problem
The fuck you expect? I go get what I want
I want you to say you pick me with your voice
I'm twenty-five up, but I can't buy your choice
You're priceless to me, but that's not the point
You got me out here smokin' joints
You got me out here losin' point
I'm cancellin' shoots and I'm cancellin'—
I'm hitchhiking, you pull over, so invitin'
The seat got my name on it, but who driving?
He hiatus, we spend time, and we repeat and we rewind it
Your headlights? It hit my eyelid
Love is blinding, y'all together? Don't remind me, so confusin'
What we doing? How y'all doing?
Oh, you choosin' him? Okay, I gotta cope with losing, fuck
I ain't been sleepin' well
Twin, I'll never tell
Stay busy so I don't think, 'cause downtime is when it sink in
I stare at old pictures, I, I thought you wanted to dance (Dance)
I thought you wanted to dance, I

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Fana Hues, Tyler, The Creator & Fana Hues]
Maybe, maybe (For you)
What's the chance, though?
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you
So don't forget about me, ba-ba-ba-da
I'll save a dance just for you
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you (Only for you, only for you)
So don't forget about me (No), ba-ba-ba-da
I'll save a dance just for you

[Verse 1]
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue, but you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new

[Chorus]
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

[Verse 2]
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you, 'cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold, oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

[Chorus]
Like a virgin (Hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Whoa whoa whoa
Ah

[Verse 3]
'Cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel I've nothing to hide

[Chorus]
Like a virgin (Hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, ah
Whoa whoa whoa

[Verse 4]
You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'til the end of time, 'cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel I've nothing to hide

[Chorus]
Like a virgin (Hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine
Like a virgin

[Outro]
Like a virgin
Ooh-ooh, like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me
Oh-ooh oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh baby, yeah
Can't you hear my heart beat for the very first time?
Don't save your kisses just pass them around
You'll find my reason is logically sound
Who's gonna know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today

And why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen
You're nearer heaven on mama earth's green
If you had millions what would they all mean
One hundred years from today

So laugh and sing
Make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one
Beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way

The moon is shining and that's a very good sign
Cling to me closer, say you'll be mine
Remember baby, we won't see it shine
A hundred years from today
A hundred years from today
Hey, laugh and sing
Make love the thing
Be happy while you may
'Cause there's always one
Beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way

The moon is shining and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer, say that you'll be mine
Remember baby, we won't see it shine
One hundred years from today
A hundred years from today

[Verse 1]
Why am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around?
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now, I realize

[Chorus]
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
In disguise, I can see it in your eyes

[Verse 2]
Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why

Full of wonder and surprisе

You've got style, that's what all the girls say

But I've got something that you'll really like

Gonna dress you up in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up in my love

The season is upon us now
A time for gifts and giving
And as the year draws to its close
I think about my living

The Christmastime when I was young
The magic and the wonder
But colors dull and candles dim
And dark my standing under

Oh little angel, shining light
You've set my soul to dreaming
You've given back my joy in life
You've filled me with new meaning

A savior king was born that day
A baby just like you
And as the Magi came with gifts
I come with my gift too

That peace on Earth fills up your time
That brotherhood surrounds you
That you may know the warmth of love
And wrap it all around you
It's just a wish, a dream I'm told
From days when I was young
Merry Christmas little Zachary
Merry Christmas еveryone
Merry Christmas littlе Zachary
Merry Christmas everyone
If I woke up without ya
I don't know what I would od
Thought I could be single forever 'till I met you
Usually don't be fallin' be fallin' first
You gotta way of keeping me comin' back to back
I just found out the only reason that you lovin' me
Is to get back at your ex looover but before you leave
Usually I would never would never even care
Baby I know she creepin' I feel it in the airEvery night and every day
I try to make you stay

Some glad morning when this life is o'er
I'll fly away
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)

I'll fly away, oh Glory
I'll fly away (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)

When the shadows of this life have gone
I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars has flown
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)

Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joy shall never end
I'll fly away (I'll fly away)
Lyrics from Snippet

[Tyler, The Creator]
Try to forget her, hey
Try to forget her, hey
Try to forget her, hey
Try to forget her, hey
Try to forget her, hey
Try to forget her
Try to for—
(What's your number?)
I just hope to God you saved my number (What's your number?)
Call me when you can

[Verse 1: Nathan]
I thought I was cool but it turns out I'm a fake
Tryna make some money off of something that I hate
Wish it'd been as fun as it was back in the day
But hell, I guess it ain't so bad as long as I get paid

[Chorus: Nathan]
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Fuck all the celebrities you're idolizing over
Music sucks, people change, do as many drugs as you can
Probs won't ever be this good again

[Verse 2: Nathan]
Time is of the essence but the essence is abstract
So what's the use in worrying about something I don't have?
Everybody told mе growing up that I was rad
But Disney fucking lied to me, so ask mе why I'm mad

[Chorus: Nathan]
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Fuck all the celebrities you're idolizing over
Music sucks, people change, do as many drugs as you can
Probs won't ever be this good again

[Outro: Nathan & Whistler]
You're cool, you're really on a roll
I wanna be like you when I get older
You're cool, you're really on a roll
I wanna be like you when I get older
You're cool, you're really on a roll
I wanna be like you when I get older
You're cool, you're really on a roll
I wanna be like you when I get older
You're cool, you're really on a roll
I wanna be like you when I get older
You're cool, you're really on a roll
I wanna be like you when I get older
(You're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're)

[Intro: Jake]
Ah!

[Verse 1: Whistler & Jake]
I couldn't feel it without seeming like
I'm swollen, choking on the view
Sitting still, eyes glued to my mind
I've lost
Let me out, sterilize that
Get bent like you'll never feel the kick back
Shhh, Johnny, we'll just kick it with the knee pads
Got me out, got me feeling like a fleabag

[Chorus: Jake]
Hard pressed for a dub this time
Madness like it's peace of mind

[Verse 2: Whistler & Jake]
So now I'm freezing and freaking and
I'm sneaking out so I can get a little bit of warm in
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm looking at my phone and
I don't realize that I'm missing out on everything I wanted
I see you hanging with sad man, vanity
I saw it like I called it and we left it there as enemies
I rolled a blunt while you coughed up a memory
Now everybody's mumbling there stuck fucked up about it

[Chorus: Jake]
Act up like it's not enough
Bite down 'til you're drawing blood
Bitching when you don't find love
Rude boy pushing his luck
Act up like it's not enough
Bite down 'til you're drawing blood
Bitching when you don't find love
Rude boy pushing his luck

[Bridge: Jake]
Making peace with my exes, think I kind of missed this
Maybe it's a waste of time
Shit, thanks a million, think I'm going to kill this
Think I'm going to lose my mind
Catch me on the way up, gonna need a seance
Gotta get a grip this time
Turn the click on, baby
Baby, turn the click on
I know you wouldn't waste my time

[Chorus: Jake]
Act up like it's not enough
Bite down 'til you're drawing blood
Bitching when you don't find love
Rude boy pushing his luck
Act up like it's not enough
Bite down 'til you're drawing blood
Bitching when you don't find love
Rude boy pushing his luck

[Verse: Melii]
Way too much emotions, I can't process shit
And Tina catching vibes when I'm hidin' shit
Buttoned up too early to acknowledge this
Stoopin' to your level for your pride and shit
Way too lit, way too blessed to be poppin' shit
Way too many hoes hit your phone for your confidence
And you knew I had your back, like Jada, you was talkin' shit
Thought you was my ride, on some Jay and Beyoncé shit
Now I'm bitchin', only a few will hold it down 'til it all switches
You got options, 'fore I came in you was lost in it
Thought you would change up all your ways but love involved in it
Now I can't see your ass the same, yeah, I'm done with it

[Snippet]
Tell me if I couldn't sing this way, would you love me the same?
Without all of these fancy cars, would you still swing this way?
What if I couldn't get you everything, let alone anything?
Would you still feel this way? Would you still feel this way?
'Cause I don't
I don't think you'd feel the same
I don't
I don't feel
So now I'm walking with my head down, guard up
Can't get caught up, no
Head down, guard up
Can't get caught up, no

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
(You) Gotta get focused on what you're doing, baby
(You) Keep pushing, but gotta keep it moving, make a (Move)
You're telling yourself, stop telling yourself
Only you know how to do what it do (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
If you're waiting on tomorrow, no, not waiting on tomorrow
You can count it when it's borrowed
Leave it up for today, here's to makin' that change
Baby, you got one shot, bite the bullet, bite the bullet
Finger on the trigger, aim, and pull it
Bite the bullet

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Trust your heart, finish what you started, what you started
You've come so far, don't you cry about it, cry about it
So before your time's done, bite the bullet, don't run, run
Trust your heart, finish what you started, what you started

[Post-Chorus: Trey Campbell]
Here we go now, darlin', fire the gun
Never slow down, bite the bullet and run
Here we go now, darlin', fire the gun
Never slow down, bite the bullet and run

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
(I) Think it's time, it's time to pull up on 'em with it
(I) Know that can't nobody get it like I get it (True)
I'm telling myself, been telling myself
There ain't no way I'll be the one to (Lose)

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Baby, you got one shot, bite the bullet, bite the bullet
Finger on the trigger, aim, and pull it
Bite the bullet

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Trust your heart, finish what you started, what you started

So before your time's done, bite the bullet, don't run, run

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Trust your heart, finish what you started, what you started (Started)
You've come so far, don't you cry about it, cry about it
So before your time's done (Before your time's done)
Bite the bullet, don't run, run
Trust your heart, finish what you started, what you started

[Outro: Dua Lipa]
Bite the bullet

[Verse 1]
Footsteps in the rain
Memories wash away
Beyond the headlight glare
It's kind of dark out there
And everywhere I've been
It's hard to find a friend
I've got no alibis
For the state I'm in

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody needs
Needs a place to go
God knows I have seen
It's a twisting, winding road

[Chorus]
Every day the sun comes up again
A little hope begins
And it starts with you
'Cause you get me through it
And every day I'm closer to the shore
I smile a little more
And because of your faith
I get closеr now every day
Said evеry day, I said every day, every day

[Verse 2]
It's hard to recognize
Across the great divide
Just what you left behind
And what you keep inside
A ripple in the calm
You keep me safe from harm
Somehow you still believe
You believe in me

[Pre-Chorus]
Where it starts and ends
Only time must know
Wherever you will be
Is where I wanna go

[Chorus]
Every day the sun comes up again
A little hope begins
And it starts with you
'Cause you get me through it
And every day I'm closer to the shore
I smile a little more
And because of your faith
I get closer now every day

[Outro]
'Cause you set me free
'Cause you set me free

[Chorus]
And every day the sun comes up again
A little hope begins
And it starts with you
'Cause you get me through it
Every day I'm closer to the shore

Where's the party?
Where's the party?
Where's the party?
Where's the party?

[Verse 1]
Working Monday through Friday takes up all of my time
If I can get to the weekend, everything will work out just fine
That's when I can go crazy, that's when I can have fun
Time to be with my baby, time to come undone

[Chorus]
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to free my soul
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to lose control
Wherе's the party? (Where's thе party?)
I want to free my soul
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to lose control

[Verse 2]
Couldn't wait to get older, thought I'd have so much fun
I guess I'm one of the grown-ups now, I have to get the job done
People give me the business, I'm not living in fear
I'm just living in chaos, got to get away from here

[Chorus]
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to free my soul
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to lose control

Don't want to grow old too fast
Don't want to let the system get me down
I've got to find a way to make the good times last
And if you'll show me how
I'm ready now

[Refrain]
Slow down, you move too fast
Gonna make the good times last
Gonna let my hair hang down
I'm ready now
Slow down, you move too fast
Gonna make the good times last
Gonna let my hair hang down

[Verse 1]
It's funny that way
You can get used to the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

[Verse 2]
Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father, I have sinned

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I nеver felt so good about myself

[Bridge]
Oh fathеr, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?
Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?

[Verse 3]
Maybe someday
When I look back, I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

[Verse 1]
I have a tale to tell
Sometimes, it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Verse 2]
I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
And how would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

Why's it so hard to love one another?
Why's it so hard to love?
Why's it so hard to love one another?

What do I have to do to be respected?
What do I have to say?
What do I have to do to be accepted?
How do I have to play? (How do i?)
What do I have to look like to feel I'm equal?
Where do I have to go? (Go)
What club do I have to join to prove I'm worthy?
Who do I have to know?

[Chorus]
I'm telling you brothers (Brothers), sisters (Sisters)
Why can't we learn to (Why's it so hard?) challenge the system
Without living in pain?
Brothers (Brothers), sisters (Sistеrs)
Why can't we learn to (Why's it so hard?) accept that wе're different
Before it's all too late?

[Verse 2]
What do I have to learn to know what's right for me?
What do I have to know? (What do I have to know?)
What am I gonna do when I feel righteous?
Where do I have to go? (Where do I have to go?)
Who should get to say what I believe in?
Who should have the right?
What am I going to do with all this anger?
Why do I have to fight?

I'm telling you brothers (Brothers), sisters (Sisters)
Why can't we learn to (Why's it so hard?) challenge the system
Without living in pain?
Brothers (Brothers), sisters (Sisters)

Why's it so damn hard?

[Verse 1]
I got brothers, I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle, tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of sharing all the hand-me-downs
To get attention, I must always be the clown
I wanna be different, I wanna be on my own
But Daddy said, 'Listen, you will always have a home"

[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters, they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

[Verse 2]
I hit the big time, but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger, city life can get to you
People can be so cold, never want to turn your back
Just giving to get something, always wanting something back

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters, they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

If you play, you lay for playin' with me and that's just how I see it (True)
This F&N gon' watch my back for me, that's how I see it (Damn)
If she wink, then she'll fuck and that's exactly how I see it (Ho)
With me, that bitch'll slip, and when she wit' you, she conceited (Woah)
She think she work for Birkin, that's just not the way I see it (Nah)
They trade pussy for purses, that's exactly how I see it (Wow)
It ain't trickin' if you got it, fuck it, that's just how I see it
You can't take it to the grave with you, that's just how I see it (Stop)
My house big as a castle, like a king, I should be greeted (It's Gucci)
A snitch gon' be a snitch, and like a rat, they should be treated (Rule)
We, like, ninety-nine and O, it's likе my squad can't be defeatеd (Well damn)
My young niggas, they super rich, a blind man can see that (Burr)
That ho said she don't fuck with me, but that's not how I see it
Diamonds dance like Michael Jackson, told that ho to beat it
A island, dressed up fresh, no stylin', money keep on pilin' (Wop)
On the charts, I keep on climbin', on TV, you see me shinin' (Damn)
Big ol' diamonds blindin', hard to find me how I'm eatin' (Eatin')
Court-side where I'm seated, VIP, that's how I'm treated (Treated)
When you get the type of chips I get, they love to call you greedy (Greedy)
But the more I get, the more I give and that's just how I see it (Well damn)
Say I'm hidin' behind these Gucci shades, but that's not how I see it (Huh?)
I'm hidin' behind these Cartiers, but I can't let 'em peep it (Nah)
Limo tint, can't let them see me, that's just how I see it (I see it)
Keep some snakes, can't let them sneak me, got a section full of demons (Demons)

Ear Drummers
My posse on Bouldercrest
Mike WiLL Made-It, Gucci Mane slayed it

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Me and my gang at home away from home
In a all-red Phantom, in the backseat on the phone
It's callin' up the posse, it's time to get rippin'
And if they get to trippin', then we shootin' like the Pistons
Everybody lookin', if you jealous, turn around
These twenty-six inches got us so high off the ground
The Forgiato rims, they're skinny as the tires
My system soundin' good, but I need the volume higher
The Mike-WiLL kick drum make the bitches get dumb
Rollin' Rolls-Royces, so the jealous wanna get some
Every time we do this, these niggas wanna battle
I'm the man they love to hate, the richest one in East Atlanta
Picked up the posse on 34 and Gresham
Headed up to Bouldercrest, we 'bout to start flexin'
The Phantom kind of crowded, the front was leanin' back
Scarr, he in the Birdie, got two bitches in his lap
On Martin Luther King, the set look kind of dead
We need a new street, so posse move ahead
We all drippin' in ice, the crew you can't forget
The So Icey Boys and we rippin' up the set

[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My posse's on Bouldercrest
My posse's on Bouldercrest (Mike WiLL Made-It)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
The cash is rollin' in, my posse's gettin' bored
There's not another posse with more points scored
We stone cold criminals, we flex like big gorillas
We not the average artist, bitch, we certified killers
I spent a million dollars just for diamonds on my teeth
And every time they see 'em, make their girls get weak
People think we crazy, some think that we are funny
But it ain't hard to tell that we make a lot of money
We clockin' all the dollars, we rock a lot of gold
The other crews mad 'cause we fuckin' all they hoes
Woodland, Custer Ave, me and my crew are thugs
And they so full of drugs they may never sober up
And I'm a dope man and the pack just dropped
If you ain't tryna cop, then this Phantom won't stop
At Boulevard and Moreland the driver broke left
And Shiesty shouted "Bouldercrest, it's time to get def"
My girl blew me a kiss, she said I was the best
She's lookin' mighty freaky in her black silk dress
The closer that we get, the crazier I feel
My posse on Bouldercrest, it's time to get ill

[Verse 3: Pooh Shiesty]
Certified, I'm that lil' nigga that make big ones pay respects
CGE, 1017, covered in choppas and baguettes
We just flipped one of they niggas, tryna see who gon' be next
Soon as I burn up this steamer, take me where I parked the 'Vette
Why he keep talkin' like he gangster? Cook him, put him to the test
My opps don't never show they background, know I'll send some' where they at
Them pigs can ask a million questions, still won't get me to say shit
It ain't no tellin' who got shot, if you don't know, you never slid
And they can't act like they don't know me, remember I flew out your bitch
I take they Rollies and their chains, nigga, I'm the reason you hide your wrist
For real menace, been causin' hell, I done did shit you can't forget
I got glizzies around the globe, it ain't shit to get to them sticks
1017, livin' a dream, come eat with us, we'll get you rich

[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot & Pooh Shiesty]
My posse's on Bouldercrest (Big blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd, blrrrd)

[Verse 1]
I'm a trapper, I am not a rapper (No)
I mount the Dawn up, it's lookin' like a Raptor (Damn)
You a hater, you are not a factor
Big diamond choker on my neck, I got asthma
Heavy watch on my wrist, it cost a meal ticket
Just stack your money up, get rich enough, then we'll kick it
It's 'bout survival, I'm bustin' at my rivals (Pow, pow)
I put a glacier on her hand, it went viral (Burr)
Egyptian fabric on my skin, it came from Cairo
Say ain't no cap in your rap, but you a gyro
They kicked me out of college, I wasn't embarrassed (No)
I graduated from pointers, moved on to carats (Damn)
I promoted myself, gave me a salary (Millions)
It's still hard to believe I'm a celebrity
Dark shades, I still see all the jealousy (I see 'em)
I'm in a Pegasus, I'm racing for my legacy

[Chorus]
I'ma rock my jewelry d-boy style
Bust down my watch, bust down my smile (Bling)
These fuck niggas tried to steal my style (Steal my style)
But cookin' up grams can't go out of style
They said, "Gucci went broke," I said, "Hush your mouth"
I'm off paper, got paper, they done fucked up now (Fucked up now)
Kick back on the couch in this big-ass house
With this Olympic-size pool, I went the He-Man route

[Verse 2]
Diamonds so cold, it's like the heat ran out (Huh?)
I need a Wonder Woman spouse and a He-Man house (Yeah)
I dropped the top in the V, then the freak came out (Freaks)
Then when she suckin' on the dick, I thought her teeth came out
Nigga, I ain't go to practice, nigga, I don't wanna scrimmage (Nah)
Twenty-two bricks, runnin' with 'em like Emmitt
Mama couldn't talk to me, I ain't wanna listen (Nah)
Teacher couldn't teach me 'cause I ain't pay attention (Fuck it)
Mr. Drippy Drippy have you swimmin' with the fishes
They want the old Gucci Mane that do a verse for a chicken (Skrrt)
Old Gucci Mane sellin' chicken for a living (Wop)
Water whippin' in the kitchen, even then I had the vision (It's Gucci)

[Chorus]
I'ma rock my jewelry d-boy style
Bust down my watch, bust down my smile (Bling)
These fuck niggas tried to steal my style (Steal my style)
But cookin' up grams can't go out of style
They said, "Gucci went broke," I said, "Hush your mouth"
I'm off paper, got paper, they done fucked up now (Fucked up now)
Kick back on the couch in this big-ass house
With this Olympic-size pool, I went the He-Man route (Wop)

Higher than an eagle, leanin' like Beanie Sigel (I'm leanin')
Flyer than a pilot, jean jacket by Diesel (Phew)
All-gold rocket, the socket matchin' my Foamposite
You's a nobody, she goin', she fuck with everybody (Go)
Lil' 'Crest boys in the hood, wanna see a dead body?
Four pockets stuffed and LaFlare, we bust at everybody
At Club Crucial, thеse hood bitches, they lovе Crucial (Wow)
That's my young shooter, recruit him to send some slugs through you
We search 'em 'fore they come in the trap, might have a bug on 'em (Huh?)
He's a walking dead man, don't know it, he got a dub on him (Yeah)
Beat him with a bat, then fuck it, pour kerosene on him
Everybody searchin' for holmes, but we ain't seen homie
Chainsaw massacre, call 1017 on 'em
Make it look drug-related, man, pour some lean on him

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Everything I rap 'bout official, I'm from the streets, bitch (Street)
Hundred thousand all my pockets, this ain't no sweet lick (Sweet)
'Nother 60K on my wrist, this a Patek, bitch (This a Patek, bitch)
All my hoes got fat asses, they all on fleek, bitch (They all on fleek, bitch)

Fifty racks cash on me, that's just today's profit (Today's profit)
4 Pockets Full, lil' bitch, I ain't got no damn wallet (I ain't got no wallet)
Fuck around and got in the game, I got the streets poppin' (I got 'em poppin')
Pussy niggas tellin' on me, I know the feds watchin' (I know they watchin')
How the hell he gettin' this money? I keep on buyin' watches
Jackboys thinkin' I'm sweet, I keep on buyin' choppers
Lock me up, I'm gettin' out tomorrow, I think I'm El Chapo
Bricks came 1017, I got some damn extras
Flexin' on these niggas on purpose, check out this damn necklace
Dropped eighty racks on a Charger, next day, I damn wrecked it (Skrrt)
Pull up with them sticks like the army, they say we young veterans
They won't pull up in them apartments, they say we too treacherous

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Everything I rap 'bout official, I'm from the streets, bitch (Street)

Fold that money up, fold that money up
Tryna stack my money 'til I can't fold it up
Tryna stack my money 'til I can't fold it up

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I was a jit full of shit tryna sell a brick (Huh)
Just a knucklehead nigga from the projects (Huh)
Niggas sleepin' on me, they kept sendin' death threats
Like that Gucci Mane can't come in with a slick left (Shh)
Man, I was jabbin' with the right, man, my whole life
They said that, "Gucci Mane, you're crazy, uncircumcised" (Haha)
I whip that dick off on that bitch, she said, "Surprise, ho" (Yeah)
I said, "I'm thinkin' so crazy, I got a mastermind" (Wizzop)
I got so much money, my money doin' backflips
I made it flip again and then it made me happy
I made an Elliot today, they call it trappin'
I might just smile, I'm your dog, fashion (Haha)
I put the Atlantic on my skin, did that shit again
The Evil Genius, you can't touch me, not even kick my shin
They say, "Doc, what's goin' on in your dirty mind?"
That bitch so fine, when she doin' all the time
You saw them bring her out, what's this going on?
My money long, long, long, long, real long (Long)
My money longer than the adlibs on every song (Burr)
My money, it got it goin' on (Yeah)

Keep your head above water, fuck that, I'm a founder (Fuck that)
These hoes down here legs open, pussy drowned ya (Swish)
Was always pullin' guns on them niggas who wasn't from 'round here
Runnin' off with funds, AK drum, that's an out-of-bounder (Damn)
Have your moms in a black dress puttin' you in the ground, sir
Your baby mama head was so good, had to crown her
Weed you was smokin', it make no noise, mines louder

Ha-ha

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Looking like a four-eyed nerd with these Cartier frames (Nerd)
Fuck a bowtie, I'm rocking diamond chains (Burr)
Titties perking, ass poking out
Got my dick so hard, see the vein coming out (Damn)
Probably won’t get no star on the sidewalk (Huh?)
White chalk on the sidewalk and it's my fault
Gucci keep going up, posting all his whereabouts
In these foreign lands shaking hands he don't care about
I don't give a damn 'bout nothing but the pay amount
I ain't never going broke, all I rеally care about
Money coming in and out, trapping like it's In-N-Out
Monеy every minute, nigga, I look like a millionaire
Big player, sitting at the end of the boss chair
Sewing loose ends, get you caught up in the crossfire
Looking back, I was in the pen behind barbed wire
And I ain't tried to blend, I’m a stand up tall guy

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Testing, testing, Gucci flexing, let me see if this mic working (Mic)
Always make a good impression, live at the Grammy’s, let me tuck my shirt in
Snuck the work in the Birk' like a vet do
You can’t gas me, bitch, 'cause I'm selling jet fuel
Real life freaky girl live in the bedroom (Freaky)
Snuck off and hit my bitch in the red room (Shh)

[Post-Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I remember you from school, nigga, you a hall guy
I don't think nobody got the balls that I got (No)
Shotgun hunter, had his whole clique hog tied
Gucci Mane shotter, I’ma start a bonfire

[Verse 2: Peewee Longway]
Strapped with the FN, I don't need a fall guy
Standing in the kitchen flipping chickens just like Five Guys
.223'll shitbag, blow out your whole teste
I just made a new investment, ice Wayne Gretzky
Testing, testing, Longway flexing
I just make the GT go skrrt like the Jetson's
S&L top floor, fucking two besties (Bitch)
Took a hundred pound and went and baguettied the necklace (Ice)
Paramount diamonds, just exquisite suggestion
Remy bust down, you can tell by the setting
It's a high limit room, I see you bettin' by the petty
Go out like a hot balloon, gon' pop it when we ready
I get your bitch and trap her, make her suck it like spaghetti
The brick came with the stamp on it, we cook it 'til it's ready
I'm hittin' her from the back, she say I'm fuckin' up her edges
Live at the Grammy's, Longway sippin' on Texas (Longway, bitch)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Testing, testing, Gucci flexing, let me see if this mic working (Mic)
Always make a good impression, live at the Grammy's, let me tuck my shirt in
Snuck the work in the Birk' like a vet do
You can't gas me, bitch, 'cause I'm selling jet fuel
Real life freaky girl live in the bedroom (Freaky)
Snuck off and hit my bitch in the red room (Shh)

[Post-Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I remember you from school, nigga, you a hall guy
I don't think nobody got the balls that I got (No)

[Verse 1]
I'm icy, bitch, the reason that it's froze up
Got lil' kids wanna be me when they growed up
Wrist all rocked up, charm all chunked up
Ring so big, got my pinky finger swole up
Pull up to my club, red carpet roll-out
Feeling like a star player, I might pull a whole lot
Bitch in a Lamborghini, she just did a donut
DropTop Wop, got more Glocks than a pawn shop
Hoes so fine, in the summer got the toes out
Niggas gettin' money, get drunk, they like to show out
Shout out to the landlord who know that's the old house
Put some diamonds in the golds like the old South
Asked me for a diamond in her nose, I said "Woah, now"
Pay attention, diamonds in the Rolls, we in the truck now
I just put some diamonds in the ceiling, what the fuck, now
Keisha got ice, got everybody bust down

[Chorus]
Bust down, bust down, everybody bust down
I don't got much feeling in my heart, who can I trust now? (No)
Bust down, bust down, everybody bust down (Wop)

Bust down, bust down, everything bust down (Bling)

I keep an assassin that's on payroll in the cut, now
I got that hush money, say the word, your business shut down
I don't put my sniper in IG, he play the background
I can't take him every place I be, they check his background
Nigga tried provoke me, I done bust, so now it's that now
He used to be my dawg, but now he act just like a cat now (Pussy)
Used to be stuck but now I'm up, I got a sack now
Treat me like a king, this Atlanta, this ain't Sac town (Atlanta)
Every time I cop a new piece, it's something to chat about (Chat)
He tried to play bully on the bargains then got scratched out (Stretched)
Gucci Mane took all his juice, handcuffed him, and went cash cow (Cash)
On jewelry I done spazzed out, my watch, it cost a stash house

[Chorus]
Bust down, bust down, everybody bust down
I don't got much feeling in my heart, who can I trust now? (No)
Bust down, bust down, everybody bust down (Wop)
Playin' with my money, lotta people gotta duck down (Bow)
Bust down, bust down, everything bust down (Bling)
Rolling with some certified hitters in the truck, now (Woah)
Bust down, bust down, everything bust down (Huh)
Hit him in the gut, he ran, they shot him in the butt, wow

My lil' jit just like shootin' up shit, they don't еven really like to rap (Huh?)
Ran off on ya, owе you one, the coke was color Doja Cat (It's cream)
Guess he thought that Gucci was a ho, I wonder who told him that?
Playin' with my backend on the road, got the promoter whacked (Baow)

Beef ain't really shit to me, a nigga ain't did shit to me (No)
I'm not Billy Batts, but a nigga ain't takin' shit from me (Nah)
Niggas talkin' down on me like they ain't bought no bricks from me
Suckers tryna clown me like they never hit no licks with me (Ha)
Ran my M's up, left the streets, now that's a flawless victory (Well damn)
Lace my cleats and fed the streets, yeah, everybody eats with me (It's Gucci)

You alway– you always keep the picnic blankets in the back
'Cause you, you never know (Gangsta Grillz)
You never know where the fuck you gon' end up at
(Okay, haha, let's go, now we ready)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, DJ Drama & Jasper]
Rolls-Royce pull up, Black boy hop out
Shoutout to my mother, and my father didn't pull out
MSG sell out, fuck these niggas yap 'bout?
Whips on whips, my ancestors got they backs out (Yeah, oh)
Too far? Five hundred stacks for the hood (I dare you, nigga)
Call me lumbеrjack 'cause I wish a nigga would race (Uh-huh, right)
Do it like I? This thе wish-a-nigga-could face (Uh)
They ain't gettin' paper like they should, wait
(You niggas woulda, coulda, shoulda, oh, shit)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator, DJ Drama & Jasper]
Niggas ain't really on the type of shit he on
I hit Drizzy and told him I had a milli' for him (Oh shit)
I own my companies full, told 'em to keep the loan
I took that gold bitch home, niggas was big mad (Ugh, oh shit)
I put that bitch on the shelf to let it ventilate
And bought another car 'cause I ain't know how to celebrate (Top shelf, nigga)
That big boy, that big bitch for all weather
It never rain in Cali', came with an umbrella (Ooh)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, DJ Drama & Jasper]
Rolls-Royce pull up, Black boy hop out (Man, what the fuck?)
Shoutout to my mother, and my father didn't pull out
MSG sell out, fuck these niggas yap 'bout? (Sold out)
Good credit score, this card really can't max out (Wow)
Too far? Five hundred stacks for the hood
Call me lumberjack 'cause I wish a nigga would race (Uh-huh)
Nigga this the face, man I wish a nigg— (It's the face)
It's different, it's really different (Catch up, niggas)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator, DJ Drama & Jasper]
Ayo, I might just sled in Utah, LA is too warm
My nigga tall, he look like a bitch, I call him Mulan (Hey, oh)
Salad colored emerald on finger, the size of croutons
Niggas can not fuck with performance of magic (Oh), new wand (Nigga)
That's my nuance, used to be the weirdo (Ah)
Used to laugh at me, listen to me with their ears closed
Used to treat me like that boy off Malcolm in the Middle  (Why I'm motherfuckin' rich)
Now I'm zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero (That's six)

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator, DJ Drama & Jasper]
Rolls-Royce pull up (Zero), Black boy hop out (That's seven)
Nah, I can't take this shit no more, man, I quit
That's it, I quit, I swear to God, nigga
Fuck niggas talking to me about? Close y'all fuckin' faces
Quality Wednesday music
Wish-a-nigga-could face
(Them stones is cloudy, nigga) Oh yeah, you asked for it
(Fuckin' crumbs) Wish-a-nigga-would face
Fuck you mean, nigga?
(From snippet)

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, whoop!

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]

My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture, uh
She's really messin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone

You wanna be mean, boy, whoo! (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, yeah, I just got a magic wand, uh (Don't leave)
We can finally be together, together, together, baby, uh

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Boys II Men]

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you will not be here
I will not fetch the ball
My eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
But it has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned, that's new magic wand

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
One, two, three, elementary
I need you, I got no plan B
You're my girl
You're my girl
Four, five, six, no magical tricks
Mint condition getting my fix
You're my girl
You're my girl

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
You can turn me on like a TV, strutting through the city
Making me sweat, you make it look easy
The beat of my heart, the beat that won't leave me
My girl

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
You're unbelievable, baby, how you do it like that?
You walk by and give the world whiplash

You show up and make the wholе room clap
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy
Mercy, mercy, girl

She don't try hard
Dance and don't think
Loves karaoke, says, she can't sing "My Girl" (My Girl)
I'm talking 'bout my girl

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas, (Nick Jonas)]
You can turn me on like a TV, strutting through the city
Making me sweat, you make it look easy
The beat of my heart, the beat that won't leave me
My girl (My girl, my girl)

[Intro]
Uh

[Verse]
Let me give her this intermission
Put it in good position
You know I got good intentions
Said you know I got good intentions
I done sitted on FaceTime with it
No, I don't wanna waste time with it
Baby girl, can I get a minute?
Let me put it on break time with it
Let me give her this intermission
Strong in serenity, baby
Treat me like you friend but we fuck like some enemies
That's how it's meant to be, baby
Fuck what intended me, baby
I said fuck what intended me, baby
If you cut me off in that pussy it'll be the end of me baby
So I'm pulling up late night for it
Go gorilla, go ape night for it
Netflix with the Chill, after dinner on the beach, I could put you on a date night for it
First class on a safe flight for it
I put you under my high cuz
I'm not saying I'm too fucked up
I'm too gone off this intermission

[Verse 1]
01-21-2020
The day the Lord took my best friend from me
And I kind of find it funny, but not really though
I should've been six feet twenty years ago
I'll never forget all the laughs we had in the hoopty
Whipping through the country
He had a way of making cloudy days sunny
But what I miss most was when he would son me
"Like Travie, do this if you love me"
I love you, Bob

[Chorus]
2-0-2-0
So long to the bitterness
Just a spoonful of cinnamon
You know, I know
This knee on my neck is causing me to choke
Like a spoonful of cinnamon

[Verse 2]
Last year I flew to Jessup, Georgia
To meet my papa and my nana, the family of my mama
All my life I was scared he never cared for me
Because my father was black, he couldn't handle that
I could see his shadow in the doorway next to the windchime
That's poetic justice 'cause it looked just the same as mine
(He hugged me) Then he apologized for lost time
And then I lost them both, and damn near lost my mind

[Chorus]
2-0-2-0
So long to the bitterness
Just a spoonful of cinnamon
You know, I know
This knee on my neck is causing me to choke
Like a spoonful of cinnamon

[Refrain]
Feel like I'm stuck in a hole, it's kind of cynical
Downing these bottles is getting old
It's not the way, it's not the way, it's not the way
Too many funerals, biting 'em down to the cuticles
It's not the way, it's not the way, it's not the way
Over again and over again
Over again, over again

[Verse 3]
2-0-2-0
You probably think I had season tickets to funerals
I'm so sick of seeing Rest In Peace T-shirts
I swear I prayed so many prayers my fucking knees hurt
And COVID got us all stuck in the house like Mouse Trap
And ain't no telling when the hell we gonna bounce back
Plus it's open season on the melanin inclined
We all had shitty years, thanks for hearing mine

[Chorus]
2-0-2-0
So long to the bitterness
Just a spoonful of cinnamon
You know, I know
This knee on my neck is causing me to choke
Like a spoonful of cinnamon

[Refrain]
Feel like I'm stuck in a hole, it's kind of cynical
Downing these bottles is getting old
It's not the way, it's not the way, it's not the way
Too many funerals, biting 'em down to the cuticles
It's not the way, it's not the way, it's not the way
Over again and over again
Over again, over again, over again, over again

[Intro: Sampha]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Sampha]
See, I am a mirror
The side of the car
Rear-view, I see you
And you're getting nearer
See, I am a mirror
I mirror 'em suffer
Looking back
To the days in December

[Chorus: Sampha & 2-D]
(I am a mirror)
The addiction was so strong
(It's cold, it's cold)
(I am a mirror)
The addiction was so strong
(It's cold, it's cold, it's cold)
The addiction was so strong

[Verse 2: Sampha]
I'm strong enough to stay
Stay and turn to stone
Stay and make a couple calls
And now I'm back to life, my
But my actions are my own (My actions are my own)
But my actions are my own (My actions are my own)
Zombie on a throne

[Chorus: Sampha, 2-D & Both]
(I am a mirror)
The addiction was so strong
(It's cold, it's cold)
(I am a mirror)
The addiction was so strong
(It's cold, it's cold, it's cold)
The addiction was so strong

[Verse 3: Zebra Katz & 2-D]
Yo, new black king, New York dream
Tell these motherfuckers everything I'm seeing
My world's darker than the young black dream
Of the first black prince of a new white king (Oh, oh)
I just wanna play, have it my way
Make a bunch of fucking rules, then tell 'em obey (Ooh)
They can't fuck with me, yeah, yeah, Ojay (Yeah)
First name, government? No, him, I slay (Slay)
New black king, oh (You can be mad at me)
New black king, yeah
New black king, oh (You can just lie with me)
Uh, obey, obey, obey (Oh, oh)

[Chorus: 2-D]
(I am a mirror)
I am a distant voice
I'm inside your head
I'm a part your soul
But you don't know me
(It's cold, it's cold, it's cold)
(I am a mirror)
I am a distant voice
I'm inside your head
I'm a part your soul
But you don't know me
(It's cold, it's cold, it's cold)

[Intro]
Youuuuu
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Before we bounce- Before we bounce, I just wanna do this song

[Verse 1]
Nowadays it's hard to make a livin' but easy to make a killin' 'cause
People walk around with just one itchy feelin'
I feel nauseated from your evil drug dealin', bless feelin'

[Spoken Stop]
Hold on, hold on, I want you to listen to the words, just me and George, the lyrics are serious
Check this out

[Verse 1]
Nowadays it's hard to make a livin' but easy to make a killin' 'cause
People walk around with just one itchy feelin'
I feel nauseated from your evil drug dealin', bless feelin'
The dеfinition of top billin'
It's illin' my vocabulary
Diggin' your lifestyle scary
No wonder why you carry a two, to rеtaliate
Tryin' to annihilate
The one a two annihilate you
They got some dude just to get you bugged
Really y'all, this shit is all out of whack
You can't go out at night yet and you won't come back
And this verse that I'm kickin' someone might take it personal
And come out and get me, but worst of all
These rap fans are taking this shit serious
It ain't New York versus L.A
'Cause really it's hip-hop, with a big ole' problem
Now let's see what we could do to solve them

[Chorus]
Na, na, na...
We gotta keep it on the positive (Positive...)
Na, na, na...
We must keep it on the positive (Positive...)

[Verse 2]
Lucifer's got your little mind twisted
'Cause God once gave you the meaning of life and you missed it
You've been listed in the devil's books
Livin' the life of crooks and hoes and in such and such
All that shit, that don't mean much
You got one hand on your gat while your genitals are being touched
Livin' the life that's plushed and glamorous
Drunk and high with your little soul's crushed
Don't you know that life is a mirage
I keep myself sober so my soul is camouflaged
If the devil cannot see me tell me how can he attack me
If he can't grasp a hold tell me how can he try to snatch me
I ain't talking about the white man, the black man or a Jew man
'Cause the devil can exist in every human
Look how Biggie went out, and 2Pac went out
And Martin, and Malcolm, and Kennedy
And Adam, and Rene, and so on, and so on...

[Chorus]
Na, na, na...
We gotta keep it on the positive (Positive...)
Na, na, na...
We gotta keep it on the positive (Positive...)
Even though we got problems
We gotta find some way to solve 'em
I hope you come and follow me now
(Keep it on the positive)
Even though we got problems
I hope you find some way to solve 'em (Solve 'em...)
(We gotta Keep it on the positive)

[Spoken Bridge]
Yo, stay positive, keep thinking about conscious and positive things, all the shit they talkin' about, killin' people, and bitch this, bitch that. It's all 

[???], Don't take those motherfuckas too serious y'all. Thank y'all very much for supporting the Black Eyed Peas. Word up!

[Chorus]
Na, na, na...
We gotta keep it on the positive (Positive...)
Na, na, na...
We gotta keep it on the positive (Positive...)
Na, na, na...
We gotta keep it on the positive (Positive...)
Na, na, na...
We gotta keep it on the positive (Positive...)

[Outro}

Yo, how the fuck is the stores now picking up we're gonna be signing CDs, and partying tonight. 'Cause I'm having a good time with Chicago tonight!

[Verse 1]
Nights my mind is speedin' by, I'm holdin' on
Askin' God to help 'em, are you hearin' me?
Girl is tellin' me she don't know what she want
Lotta demons creepin' up, they're livin' underneath
Gotta take a minute, y'all, traveled far
Feelin' somethin', no, I can't ignore my instincts
Back just where I started, it's the same old damaged song
It's the shit I need

[Pre-Chorus]
Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Hm, talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't lose, I'm in the third act
Lord seein' me swerve
Do this to my loved ones, I've got some nerve
Some nerve, some nerve
Don't think I'm not sorry

[Verse 2]
(Yeah) Standin' on the cliff right off Mulholland Drive
(Yeah) Back up on my late night session remedy
(Oh) Something 'bout the night that keep me safe and warm
Just me, the universe, and everything I think
Lotta shit is weighin' on me, it's a storm
Never thought I would be back here bleeding
I'm not just some sad dude
You can see my life, how I grew, I want serenity

[Pre-Chorus]
Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't lose, I'm in the third act
Seems I'll never learn
I won't stop 'til I crash and burn
And burn, and burn
Tell my mom I'm sorry

[Chorus]
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
Can't stop this war in me (Yeah)
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
Hm, hear me now, hey (Woah, ooh)
This time I'm ready for it
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

[Post-Chorus]

Can't stop this war in me (Yeah, yeah)
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
And the story goes, hey, hey

In the dead of the night, I have these dreams
What'll happen to me? Will I burn out?
Have I been wrong? What does it mean?
All these things, can't understand why
Say something's wrong with me, I know
By myself alone driving, I go
Full moon as it glows, I search for truth
Tryna be brand new, yeah, I will try

Rolling the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
I'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

[Chorus]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about the night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky?
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

[Chorus]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Bridge]
Pursuit of happiness, hey
I know everything that shine ain't always gold
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Harmonizing with orchestral solo]

[Chorus]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine, I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

Quite possibly the most difficult and energizing games, Cata.io on Mad
Boy Hub is creating a ton of raves at the present time. Individuals can’t
Quit playing, and the purpose for this is its worldwide leader board
Taking your username to the highest point of the leader board in
Catac.io isn’t pretty much as simple as it appears. Players all throughout
The planet are trusting on MadboyHub.com and giving different attempts
To this experience multiplayer game yet at the same timе missing the
Mark with not many focuses
On the off chancе that you need to score high in Catac.io, you truly need
To peruse further. With the assistance of online heroes of Catac.io, we
Have incorporated a rundown of the best systems that will help you rout
Each sham in this nasty squabble in space


1.           Trapping the Imposter
The best technique for Catac.io is catching the faker. You can pick any
Arbitrary sham, and afterward you can trap him by surrounding him
Thusly, the faker will in the end quit any pretense of, giving you a simple
Execute
This procedure sounds simple, yet it takes a great deal of preparation
And fast reasoning. The primary principle of this technique is, never be
Consistent with your moves. Be dynamic however much as could
Reasonably be expected. On the off chance that you continue to circle in
A similar movement, at last, the faker will make up for lost time. So
Consistently be flighty during a nasty squabble
2.           on the edge
Another successful technique of making a score in Catac.io is taking the
Sham to the edge. It is that one spot where not very many fakers stick
Around. At the edge, you can zero in on a solitary faker. It is the ideal
Spot for catching your foe
There are not many things you need to remember while taking your
Adversary to the edge. The first is never to uncover your arrangement
Previously. Keep the faker diverted until it arrives at the edge. Moreover
When arriving at the edge, take him out for the last time
3.           Take it moderate
While at first beginning, make sure to take things moderate. Pick your
Slaughter cautiously, take out the most fragile first and afterward
Gradually push ahead on the leaderboard. On the off chance that you go
Straightforwardly for the star player, you will lose. Keep yourself far
Removed of ace players toward the beginning
Track down the most vulnerable, and bring them down, individually
Keep in mind, there is a motivation behind why a few players are at the
Highest point of the scoreboard. They know each conceivable system
There is. It takes tolerance and ideal intending to get the hotshot
4.           The tracker and the camper
In the wake of scoring a few focuses and taking out powerless players
You need to change your system totally. Presently, you need to choose
Shams haphazardly and afterward chase them down
Pick an irregular fraud, and chase after him for quite a while. Yet, recall
Don’t let him/her understand that you are onto them. Track down the
Ideal second, and afterward snap, very much like Thor, go for the head
5.           The turmoil producer
The turmoil producer is perhaps the most vile and savvy approaches to
Score various executes. It requires a procedure on a major scale. Things
Move pretty quick during this system. It is perhaps the least secure
Methodology out there
The tumult creator is the fraud who utilizes confusion as a stepping
Stool to arrive at the highest point of the scoreboard. The principal thing
You need to do as a mayhem producer is, track down the most populated
Region in space. When you discover it, break down it cautiously. Track
Down the ideal second for entering the group. Go for the enormous
Slaughter, as it will cause a ton of frenzy among other close by fakers
Then, at that point cautiously and with covertness, go for others rapidly
On the off chance that you consummately plan out every one of the
Previously mentioned systems, you will get relentless. Yet, do recollect
You are not by any means the only one who has the force of information
And abilities. Visit Madboyhub.com to play this marvelous online

Say, uh-oh

Everything you sayin' soundin’ good to me
No need to convince me anymore
Swagger, it's right, one blade is tight
And I smell your cologne in the air

You say you love my bag, and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me

Work hard, make money
Couple days of the year, go somewhere sunny, honey
I just wanna make you smile
Love right, live better
The only thing that matters is doing it together
Forever ain't really forever
Its just a little while

[Chorus]
So I wanna spend all my days with you
Mornings, afternoons and night time too
Yeah, I wanna spend all my days with you
'Cause who knows when our days will all be through

You don’t kiss me in the mornin'
You look through me when I’m talkin'
It doesn’t matter what I say
You don’t hear it anyway

[Verse 2]
You hate how I make the coffee
Question everyone who calls me
I’m not at home inside these walls
Damned if I do anything at all

[Pre-Chorus]
It doesn’t matter what I’m guilty of
The love I give won’t ever be enough

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Tap my phone
Read my mail
Suffocate our love until
You build a wall
That's ten foot high
Like that'll keep my love in sight

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it doesn't matter what I'm guilty of
The love I give won't ever be enough
I know you and you'll just

[Chorus]
Keep me down
Tie my hands
Send my soul to Alcatraz
Lock my heart
Hide the key
'Cause that’s your way of lovin' me

[Outro]
That's your way of lovin' me (Ooh)
That’s your way of lovin' me, lovin' me
Yeah that’s your way of lovin' me

[Intro]
The seven things I hate about you
(Sha)

[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't say this, but at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standin' in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear

[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear (Clear, clear)
Oh, I'm not comin' back
You're taking seven steps here

[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Bridge]
And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the seven that I like

[Chorus]
The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Outro]
You do, oh
Ooh, ooh (La, la, la)
Ooh, ooh
You make me love you

[Intro: Ben Mendelsohn]
Twilight
Carnival swept you down the plughole, annihilated
Carnival

[Verse 1: Anthony Hamilton]
We play to win, just to find the dark
Go home again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend this time with you
Doing nothing
Keep you satisfied, while they rob us blind
I hear the music in the background
Singing, singing

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
Oh, I haven't see the glory
Coming, coming, coming
And we play
We play, we play, we play like a

[Chorus 1: Anthony Hamilton]
Just like a carnival
Game, just like a carnival
Laugh, just like a carnival
Joke, just like a
Spinning me round and around and around
Just like a carnival

[Refrain: Anthony Hamilton & 2-D]
Ahh, ahh
Ah-ah
Ah-ah

[Verse 2: Anthony Hamilton]
We play to win, just to find the dark
Go again, and we both fall out
I wanna spend this time with you
Doing nothing

[Chorus 2: Anthony Hamilton]
We, just like a carnival
We laughed, just like a carnival
Sleep with the dеad, just like a carnival
Playing with your mind, just like a
Spinning me round and around and around
Just likе a carnival, yeah

[Interlude: The Humanz]
(We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)

[Bridge: 2-D & The Humanz]
It's made up of junk (We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
Sitting in wood (We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
Ripe in the passport tree (We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
Stepped in the light (We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
Oh, then the tree came down (We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
(We have to wake up)
Seven hours more

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Play, just like a carnival
Game, just like a carnival
Laugh, just like a carnival
Joke, just like a carnival
Spinning me round and around and around
Huh? Just like a carnival, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be your mother, your brother, sister or a friend
I don't wanna be your preacher or your grade school teacher
Always holdin' out my hand
I don't wanna say all the right things
Ever have a sufferer fight
I don't need you to be wrong and I don't have to be right

[Chorus]
Just let me your lover
Want you to need me and not know why
I leave town and you're all empty inside
And the bed, it's just too damn wide
And so you hide, under the covers
Let me be your lover
Let me be your lover

[Verse 2]
You know a lover is a danger
It's a blind roll of a dice
It's mine is yours, and yours is mine
And we become's an I

[Pre-Chorus]
And I say were here for a long time
So we don't have time to waste
You gonna sit and stare at the apple all day
You're gonna give that thing a taste

[Chorus]
Just let me your lover
Want you to need me and not know why
I leave town and you're all empty inside
And the bed, it's just too damn wide
And so you hide, under the covers
Let me be your lover
Let me be your lover

[Bridge]
It's now or never, maybe forever
Don't make me say this twice

[Outro]
Just let me your lover
Let me your lover
Lover
Let me your, ooh
Lover
Ooh, ooh
Let me your lover

[Verse 1]
She had a couple different daddies
Could never make her mama happy
And her skinny little sister
Got all the attention
So she slept with half the town
And when the gossip got around
That was she fast, she blamed her past

[Chorus]
We've all got our issues, all the shit we've gotta get through
A dozen different reasons to fall apart
So don't start with all that "poor me"
'Cause everybody's got a story that'll break your heart

[Verse 2]
You blame the drinkin' on your childhood
You blamе the school 'cause you don't talk good
You blame thе drive-thru for the weight gain
Your hot temper on your last name
You blame for your ex for your divorce
And the judge for the child support that you've gotta pay
And you'd blame God if you prayed

[Chorus]
So, yeah, We've all got our issues, all the shit we've gotta get through
A dozen different reasons to fall apart
So don't you start with all that "poor me"
'Cause everybody's got a story that'll break your heart

[Bridge]
I could sit and talk for days about
What the world has put me through
But when you point a finger
There's three more pointing back at you

[Chorus]
We've all got our issues, all the shit we've gotta get through
A dozen different reasons I could fall apart
So, I don't wanna hear that "poor me"
'Cause everybody's got a story
And we've all got a cross to bear
And nobody's life is fair
So don't start with all that "poor me"
'Cause everybody's got a story that'll break your heart
Yeah, everybody's got a story that'll break your heart

[Outro]
Alright
Mmm

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Used to pray for a moment just like this
There's a fire in your eyes I can't resist
Baby, we're gonna wanna remember this
Baby, we're gonna wanna remember this
I can taste the forever on your lips
There's a lifetime livin' inside that kiss
Baby, we're gonna wanna remember this
Baby, we're gonna wanna remember this

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
We ain't gettin' any younger, to be honest, I don't care
I'm not tryna live forever, I'm just tryna be right here
This I know, only now it's all we got
This I know, mmm
All the nights of strikin' matches, just tryna find a spark
Countin' down to raisin' glasses, countin' up to broken heart
This I know, yeah, the countin' never stops
This I know

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Just one more dance
Two more drinks
It'll go by fast
So don't you blink

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Used to pray for a moment just like this
There's a fire in your eyes I can't resist

Baby, we're gonna wanna remember this
Baby, we're gonna wanna remember this

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Life moves a little faster every second I'm with you
I didn't know what I was after until I found it all in you
This I know
If tonight is all we got, then don't let go, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Just one more dance
Two more drinks
It'll go by fast
So don't you blink

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Used to pray for a moment just like this
There's a fire in your eyes I can't resist

Baby, we're gonna wanna remember this
I can taste the forever on your lips
There's a lifetime livin' inside that kiss

Wanna remember, remember, remember
Wanna remember, remember, remember

Baby, we're gonna wanna remember this

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas]
Used to remember pray for a moment just like this
There's a fire in your eyes I can't resist

Baby, we're gonna wanna remember this

[Intro]
Yeah
Oh, Oh

[Verse 1]
She's the girl I've always wanted
Never knew she would be mine
Like a fairytale story
But the ending's not that nice
She's a beautiful deceiver
Paints a picture with her words
Gives a kiss I don't believe her
Cause I know where she will go
And I don't want to lose her
Don't wanna let her go

[Chorus]

Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
Cause I will leave you alone
Floodеd with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Likе I did before the storm
(Yeah)
(Before the Storm)

[Verse 2]

With every strike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
Not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up

[Chorus]

Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
Cause I will leave you alone
Flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm

[Bridge]

Trying to keep the lights from going out
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
They always say a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm

[Chorus]
Standing out in the rain
Needs to know if its over
Cause I will leave you alone
Flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm

[Outro]

(Yeah)
Before the Storm
Like I did before the storm

It feels better that way

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
Please don't go, please just stay

Like he skipped autumn and spring some more wins
Look, you tell me I can't, I tell you I can (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
You tell me I can't, I do it again
Reversin' the job, like blowin' a fan (Da-da, da-da, da-da)
No matter which way you look at it
Understand, it's plugged in
You tell me it's nine lives, I'm pushin' it up, ten
You tell me to do five, I'm pushin' a buck ten
I might just cut off the brakes and aim for the sidelines (Ahhh)
For you nothin'-ass niggas and screamin' out "Fuck him," fuck them

When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now (It's gon' hurt watchin' the chart)

[Intro]

[Bridge: The World Famous Tony Williams]
Just imagine if you could take the moment and live it
And own it, believe it
Supposed
You’d only have one life
What y'all wanna do tonight?
From, oh, are we alive or just living, listening to what they tell us?
Come on, come on
Funny how we say, the more we live, the more we die
And we don’t really know why
If you feel like it, if you feel like it
Might as well if you feel like it
When your high as hell
I know the the time feels rough, when you’re tryna tell
They try to bring down everyone rainin’ in

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, you see sharks in the water
They ain't tryna do nothin' but put cocks in your daughter
Don't say nothin' 'bout what 'Ye said
Don't move, motherfucker, play dead
Too cool, motherfucker, we there
Yeah, we cool, motherfucker, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Refrain: Kanye West]
God level
What y'all wanna do tonight?

[Outro]
You're alone all the time
Does it ever puzzle you? Have you asked why?
Oh, baby, why fall in love and out again?
Do you really ever love or just pretend, oh, baby?
Or just pretend, oh, baby
Or just pretend, oh, baby
Why, you're alone all the time
Does it ever puzzle you? Have you asked why?
Oh, baby, why fall in love and out again?
Do you really ever love, ever love, ev-ever love?
Do you really ever love, ever love, or just pretend
Oh, baby

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

[Verse 2]
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

[Verse 3]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus 1]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

[Chorus 1]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

[Verse 3]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus 2]
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play

[Chorus 1]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters

[Piano Outro]

[Intro]
Well, that's life
Why would it change now?
I wanna, I wanna (Yeah)
I wanna go back, but

[Chorus]
That's life, why would it change now?
One minute I'm up, one minute I'm face down
I don't care what the cost is
I wanna go back, back, back, but

[Verse 1]
She is my guiding star
She's on my tarot cards
She wants to break up, why don't you say
That you dug your own grave?
But I'm wondering if you want love anymore
I wanna go back, but

[Chorus]
That's life, why would it change now?
One minute I'm up, one minute I'm face down
I don't care what the cost is
I wanna go back, back, back, but
That's life, that's what you told me
You think too much, shut up and hold me
I don't care what the cost is
I wanna go back, back, back, but

[Verse 2]
Now she won't want me back like this, no
Now that I have gone and messed up
She wants to break up, why don't you stay?
I've been grinding my teeth so long, long, long
Won't be able to smile when you're gone (Gone, gone, gone)

[Bridge]
You're my baby girl
Only one for me
And when the walls are closing in
You turn and say to me
You wanna go back, but (One, two)

[Chorus]
That's life, why would it change now?
One minute I'm up, one minute I'm face down
I don't care what the cost is
I wanna go back, back, back, but
That's life, that's what you told me
You think too much, shut up and hold me
I don't care what the cost is
I wanna go back, back, back, but

[Outro]
Oh yeah
(I wanna go back, back, back, but)
I wanna go back, back, back, but

[Verse 1]
Like a dream you want to believe
Everybody is naive
From your mother to Gandhi
There you go, your ducks in a row
So many things you'll never know
If you want it, I could show you
But

[Chorus]
You wouldn't last a day in my head
A day in my head
A day in my head
(You should try it out sometime)
You wouldn't last a day in my brain
You'd probably go insane
You'd probably never be the same again

[Verse 2]
I bet you wanna know
Why I keep my windows closed
It's not baggage, it's cargo
You like to think that you had it rough
But I'm gonna call your bluff
And you'll pray it's been enough
'Cause

[Chorus]
You wouldn't last a day in my head
A day in my head
A day in my head
(You should try it out sometime)
You wouldn't last a day in my brain
You'd probably go insane
You'd probably never be the same again

[Bridge]
My temptation is to overusе
My imagination
So don't you stand too close to me
Just take it from mе now, yeah

[Chorus]
You wouldn't last a day in my head
A day in my head
A day in my head
(You should try it out sometime)
You wouldn't last a day in my brain
You'd probably go insane
You'd probably never be the same again

[Outro]
(A day in my head)
(A day in my head)
(A day in my head)
(You should try it out sometime)
(A day in my brain)
(You'd probably go insane)
You'd probably never be the same again

[Intro]
(Why would you want me?)

[Chorus]
Why would you want me?
Why would you care?
Tell me you need it bad
Well, I love to be your hair
Why would you want me?
Why would you care?
Tell me you need it bad
Well, I love to be your hair

[Verse 1]
You don't run for me
You just come for me
Well, I find
All of this is wonderful
I don't help the fool in my mind
I never know what's best for me
You're arresting me all the time
I thought we'd be over by now
But you don't have a clue or you're blind
(Well)

[Pre-Chorus]
Why the fuck would you come back?
I never knew you like that
I never knew you like that
I never knew you'd come back
I never knew you like that
I never get it right

[Chorus]
Why would you want me?
Why would you care?
Tell me you need it bad
Well, I love to be your hair
Why would you want me?
Why would you care?
Tell me you need it bad
Well, I love to be your hair

[Verse 2]
Well, I complicate my day
You just took an edible
And now I'm the fool, okay (Okay)
Love the way you give me shit
Like I can handle it always (Always)
Cookie, cookie, cookie, goddamn you win
So I'll give in
But I still don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
Why the fuck would you come back?
I never knew you like that
I never knew you like that
I never knew you'd come back
I never knew you like that
I'd never get it right

[Chorus]
Why would you want me?
Why would you care?
Tell me you need it bad
Well, I love to be your hair
Why would you want me?
Why would you care?
Tell me you need it bad
Well, I love to be your hair

[Outro]
You gave me
No reason why
You gave me
Ah, ah, ah, ah
You gave me
No reason why
You gave me
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Intro]
Clean, clean

[Chorus]
Well, I go down, shaking up on the floor
You're shaking me up
I can’t take any more
But I can't get enough
Shit would be such a chore
Without you shaking me up
So shake it up, you gon' shake it up
You gon’ shake it for ya

[Verse 1]
A gloomy day (Oh), you had your hair down
So I went off and turned it all around
I broke my foot but I'd do it again
She looked me up and down
And then she started to laugh
This is how we get by, givin' it another try
I've lost my head but I'd do it again

[PreChorus]
Mm, she knows that's what she does to me
(Sunshine sittin' in my pocket)

[Chorus]
Well, I go down, shaking up on the floor
You're shaking me up
I can’t take any more
But I can’t gеt enough
Shit would be such a chore
Without you shaking mе up
So shake it up, you gon' shake it up
You gon’ shake it for ya

[Verse 2]
I locked you out and fell asleep and
You 007'd your way back in
I'll never question you ever again
(Thank God)
I got some knees to ground me
Somebody around me
And now I know how it goes
I never lose myself when you're around

[PreChorus]
Mm, she knows that’s what she does to me
(Sunshine sittin' in my pocket, yeah)
She's happy, mm, she knows that's what she does to me
(I got sunshine sittin' in my pocket, yeah)

[Chorus]
Well, I go down, shaking up on the floor
You're shaking me up
I can't take any more
But I can't get enough
Shit would be such a chore
Without you shaking me up
So shake it up, you gon' shake it up
You gon' shake it for ya
Down, shaking up on the floor
You're shaking me up
I can't take any more
But I can't get enough
Shit would be such a chore
Without you shaking me up
So shake it up, you gon' shake it up
You gon' shake it for ya

[Post-Chorus]
We get by (You're shaking me up)
We're just gonna give it another try (But I can't get enough)
We get by (You're shaking me up)
So shake it up, you gon' shake it up
You gon' shake it for ya

[Verse 1]
I wasn't in this life before you were mine
Now, I took an endless route and I crossed all the lines
And now I'm wide awake thinking it through
Would you hold it and kiss me too? (No)

[Chorus]
I've been hoping my best will
Hoping my best will define me
Hope for the best, still
Maybe I shouldn't hold my breath, oh no
Maybe I shouldn't hold my breath
Maybe I

[Verse 2]
I was a waste of space before you were mine
Yeah, just thinking about myself all the time
And now I don't even wanna look in the mirror
I just hope you see me clear

[Chorus]
I've been hoping my best will
Hoping my best will define me
Hope for the best, still
Maybe I shouldn't hold my breath, oh no
Maybe I shouldn't hold my breath
I know I shouldn't hold my breath

[Bridge]
Oh, I've been
Hopin' that my luck don't fail me now
Hopin' that she wouldn't throw in the towel
Hopeful, I got a shot, but still (Damnit)

[Chorus]
Maybe I shouldn't hold my breath, oh no
Maybe I shouldn't hold my breath
I know I shouldn't hold my breath

[Outro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
All I want is to be happy
All I want is to be happy
All I want, all I want is love
All I get is another day
All I get is another day
That I can't, that I can't get out of

[Chorus]
When I wake up, slap my face
When I wake up far away
Now we're laid up, all okay
And we made up for today

[Verse 2]
All I want is to be laughing
All I want is to be laughing
With you one, with you one more time
But I know now, I've been stupid
"Just keep moving," that's what you said
And I will, and I will, alright

[Chorus]
When I wake up, slap my face
When I wake up far away
Now we're laid up, all okay
And we made up for today

[Intro]
She wanna get—, I wanna get—

[Chorus]
She's gonna break me
But I don't give a damn right now
She wanna get down, I wanna get down
We're gonna get down, so
She's gonna take me
It ain't even a thing right now
She wanna get down, I wanna get down
We're gonna get down, so

[Verse 1]
She gave me a look that made me sweat
I think about it and I won't forget
Your hips locked into mine
And we're takin' our time, yeah, so slowly
And then we get on the ATV (Vroom)
I could feel you hangin' onto me
To thе black sand beach of Santorini
Like slow it

[Pre-Chorus]
No way that I could evеr hold back
With you comin' like that
You comin' like that

[Chorus]
She's gonna break me
But I don't give a damn right now
She wanna get down, I wanna get down
We're gonna get down, so
She's gonna take me
It ain't even a thing right now
She wanna get down, I wanna get down
We're gonna get down, so

[Verse 2]
I could not think of goin' back
Too late, too late, I'm on the track
I'm gonna quit my job
I hope you do too
I had you on the dance floor
I swear, I swear, it was in the air
Well, some things are just not fair

[Pre-Chorus]
No way that I could ever hold back
With you comin' like that
You comin' like that

[Chorus]
She's gonna break me
But I don't give a damn right now
She wanna get down, I wanna get down
We're gonna get down, so
She's gonna take me
It ain't even a thing right now
She wanna get down, I wanna get down
We're gonna get down, so
(We're gonna get down)

[Verse 1]
You think you got my back against the wall
You don't have a clue, you got nothing at all
You got nothing left and it's all your own fault
I don't give a fuck if you died and that's all

[Verse 2]
You know the pipes, the pipes are calling
And it's about time, better fuck off to Stalin
I would throw a party but I'm just a shut-in
But I won't shut down anymore because I'm buzzin'

[Chorus]
'Cause it's over and I'm over it
I can breathe again a bit (Just a bit)
'Cause it's over and I'm over it
I can breathe again a bit (Just a bit)

[Bridge]
Oh, my God, I don't know how I got here
(Movin' on like you should)
It's bad blood and I know you've got it comin'

[Verse 3]
But, but I'm back, I finally found out
What you went and left, oh, you went and you left out
And now I'm sick, but I don't have any doubt
No, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't

[Chorus]
'Cause it's over and I'm over it
I can breathe again a bit (Just a bit)
'Cause it's ovеr and I'm over it
I can breathe again a bit (Just a bit)

[Post-Chorus]
'Causе I finally found out
I wasn't wrong, all along, all along
Well, I finally found out
I wasn't wrong, all along, all along
At least, I finally found out
I wasn't wrong, all along, all along
Yeah, well, I finally found out
I wasn't wrong, all along, all along

[Outro]
(All along)

[Intro]
Love you when my soul is good
Love you when my soul is good

[Chorus]
Love you when my soul is good
I can be your darlin' or you could be too
Would you come over, darlin'?
Come over, darlin', come over, darlin', do

[Post-Chorus]
Come over, darlin', come over
Come over, darlin', do

[Verse 1]
No, I don't really know what we're doing here
Don't ask me no questions, I don't wanna hear
Wanna get this thing underway, you look at me to hush up
Then I hear you say ay-ay-ay-ay-ay, yup

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a mouth that could run a mile
And a brain in a downwards spiral
Just don't lie, just don't lie to me
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
Love you when my soul is good
I can be your darlin' or you could be too
Would you come over, darlin'?
Come over, darlin', come over, darlin', do
Love you when my soul is good
I could never get anything past you
Would you come over, darlin'?
Come over, darlin', come over, darlin', do

[Post-Chorus]
Come over, darlin', come over
Come over, darlin', do

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'ma pick you up when your head is down low
Just call me the bus, I always come around eventually
Appear like a hold-up with no guns and no rings
I've been working for the both of us

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a mouth that could run a mile
And a brain in a downwards spiral
Just don't lie, just don't lie to me
No, no, no, no

[Refrain]
Love you when my soul is good, mmm
Love you when my soul is good
Love you when my soul is good (Oh, please, don't you worry)
Love you when my soul is good (Mmm, uh)

[Chorus]
Love you when my soul is good
I can be your darlin' or you could be too
Would you come over, darlin'?
Come over, darlin', come over, darlin', do
Love you when my soul is good
I could never get anything past you
Would you come over, darlin'?
Come over, darlin', come over, darlin', do

[Outro]
Come over, darlin', come over
Come over, darlin', do

Don't you see it's all over me? (Like)
Low would've been bad by now
Don't you give up, give up on me? (Like)

[Bridge]
(Like)

I know that it's hard to see me like this
But I'm glad you're here
Hopefully, I'll wake up tomorrow
And I'll be thinking clear

They go on, they go on
These days, they go on
They go on, they go on

Come on, y'all
Aowah

[Verse 1]
What's the matter with your life
Is the poverty bringing you down, yeah?
Is the mailman jerking you 'round?
Did he put your million dollar check
In somebody's box?

[Verse 2]
Tell me, what's the matter with your world
Was it a boy when you wanted a girl?
(Boy when you wanted a girl)
Don't you know straight hair ain't got no curl
(No curl)
Life it ain't too funky
Unless it's got that pop
Sing it

[Chorus]
(Pop life)
Oh, everybody needs a thrill, oh
(Pop life)
We all got a space to fill, yessir
(Pop life)
Oh, everybody wants to be on top
But you know what?

Unless it's got that, huh

What you putting in your nose?
Is that where all your m-m-m-m-money goes?
The river of addiction flows
You think it's hot, but there won't be no water
When the your blows
Oh oh

[Chorus]
(Pop life)
Sing!
Oh, everybody needs a thrill, oh
Pop life
We all got a space to fill, yessir

Oh, everybody wants to be on top

Life it ain't too funky
Unless it's got that jazz

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Las Vegas!
Aowah!

[Verse 1]
Gotta broken heart again
'Cause my only supposed-to-be friend
He stole my old lady, he stole her away from me
And now I'm sure blue ass can be

[Verse 2]
Gotta broken heart again
'Cause I ain't got no money to spend, no no
I spent it all on a long distance phone call
Begging her, begging her to please come home

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3]
It don't matter what I do
I can't stop... thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, baby
The little things you said
Things you did to me in bed
Oh baby, I can't get you out to my head
Ooh, oooh
Oooh oooh oooh, gotta broken heart again
This time it's serious, it's serious
Feels just like the end, yessir
Once your love has gone away
There ain't nothing, ooooh
Left to say, ooh-ooh

[Intro]
Welcome to NPG Radio
Take it over, y'all
Everybody on your feet
Recognize

[Verse 1]
I guess you know me well, I don't like winter
Seem to get a kick out of doing me cold
Oh, what the hell, you always surrender, girl
What's this strange relationship that we hold on to?

[Chorus]
Honey, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey, if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship-ship-ship?

[Verse 2]
You came you took my love, you took my body
You took all the self-respect I ever had, sugar
You took me for a ride and yo, baby, I'm sorry
The more you love me, sugar, the more it makes me mad

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad, yessir
Honey, if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship-ship-ship?

[Interlude]
Las Vegas!
What's this strange relationship
Do you know?

[Verse 3]
I bet you wish this was some old movie
And then you could rewrite my every line, sugar
I'll take all the blame, yo baby, I'm sorry
But I didn't like the way you were, so I had to make you mine

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad, uh
Honey, if you left me I, let me I
No no no no no no

[Outro]
Vegas, can you feel NPG

[?]
NPG on your radio
Just jam
Just jam
One word, y'all
Say "jam"
(Jam)
Say it
(Jam)
On the bass, Miss Rhonda
Jam
One word, y'all
Say it
(Jam)
Say it like you mean it, y'all, come on
(Jam)
You hear that Rhonda?
(Jam)
Girl, can you step on something?
(Jam)
Oh, step on it
(Jam)
One word, y'all
(Jam)
Come on
Come on say it
(Jam)
Hold Rhonda, too much, on the one

[Verse 1]
It runs away now
Down the mountain
Through the pebbles
I see you clearly
And old storm sprue
Clouds of ego
Rained down slowly
Bathe me gentle
The river's flowing
Can I hold on
To this moment?
Or will I let go?
To head downstream
To the people
That don't know me
Please the old me
The old me

[Chorus]
Fading
Save all my
Beliefs
Find ways to make me see
I need

[Verse 2]
See I'm shrinking
To a dark space
Where my vision
Stay on replay
Can you hear me?
Am I still safe?
Slowly sinking
To my bed now
Feel the current
Start to calm down
Pass the old me
The old me

[Chorus]
Fading
Save all my
Beliefs
Find ways to make me see
I need

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
Just after I wiped away his last tear
Maybe he's better off than he was before
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
Oh, I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again, oh oh
But sometimes, sometimes life ain't always that way

[Chorus]
Oh, sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
But all good things, they say, never last
All good things, they say, never last
Love, it isn't love
Until it's past

[Outro]
Thank you all, so much

[Verse 1]
Plead to the sky
Wings are waiting at your doorstep
Know just the time
You don't even try to ignore it

[Chorus]
Run away from here
Run from the atmosphere
Run away from here
Run from the atmosphere

[Verse 2]
The time's floating by
Sleeping further than important
Hope you arrive
Take this blessing for your daughter

[Instrumental Bridge & Outro]
I Need A Gun To Keep Myself From Harm
The Poor People Are Burning In The Sun
But They Ain't Got A Chance
They Ain't Got A Chance
I Need A Gun
Cos All I Do Is Dance
Cos All I Do Is Dance

I Need A Gun To Keep Myself From Harm
The Poor People Are Burning In The Sun
No, They Ain't Got A Chance
They Ain't Got A Chance
I Need A Gun
Cos All I Do Is Dance
Cos All I Do Is Dance

In My Backpack
I Got My Act Right
In Case You Act Quite Difficult
And Yo Is So Weakin'
With Anger And Discontent
Some Are Seeking And Searching Like Me, Moi
I'm A Peace-Loving Decoy
Ready For Retaliation
I Change The Whole Occasion To A Pine Box Six-Under
Impulsive Don't Ask Wild Wonder
Orders Given To Me Is:
Strike And I'm Thunder With Lightning Fast Reflexes On Constant Alert
From The Constant Hurt That Seems Limitless With No Dropping Pressure

Seems Like Everybody's Out To Test Ya
'Til They See Your Brake
They Can't Conceal The Hate
That Consumes You
I'm The Reason Why You Flipped Your Soosa

Chill With Your Old Lady At The Tilt
I Got A 90 Days Digit
And I'm Filled With Guilt
From Things That I've Seen
Your Water's From A Bottle
Mine's From A Canteen

At Night I Hear The Shots
Ring So I'm A Light Sleeper
The Cost Of Life
It Seems To Get Cheaper
Out In The Desert
With My Street Sweeper
The War Is Over
So Said The Speaker With The Flight Suit On
Maybe To Him I'm Just A Pawn
So He Can Advance
Remember When I Used To Dance
Man, All I Want To Do Is Dance
(Dance!)
(Dance!)
(Dance!)

I Need A Gun To Keep Myself From Harm
Lyrics from Snippets

[Verse]
Tonight, tonight I'm (Tonight)
Invoicing my exes for the waste of time (Stupid bitch, ha)
'Cause I hate wasting time
Ashamed to ever say that you was ever mine (Fuck love, haha)
Shit, you were never mine

[Verse 1]
There’s a burned out bulb on the Cafe sign
It feels just like this heart of mine
When I untie these apron strings
Tonight, I'm gonna spread my wings
Every time I fill a coffee cup
I wonder if it's ever gonna be enough

[Chorus]
But it's not the crown that makes the queen
You don't have to close your eyes to dream
I'd like to live somewhere in between
Singin' la la la la la la la
But that's just me

[Verse 2]
It doesn’t matter where you are
As long as you can see some stars
What’s the point in a pot of gold
If you havеn't got a hand to hold
Every time I've еver had to choose
I feel a little richer when I've got nothin' to lose

[Chorus]
'Cause it's not the crown that makes the queen
You don't have to close your eyes to dream
Just learn to live somewhere in between
Singin' la la la la la la la
But that's just me

[Bridge]
Heaven ain't behind some pearly gate
And you don't have to die just to get a little taste

[Chorus]
'Cause it's not the crown that makes the queen
You don't have to close your eyes to dream
Just learn to live somewhere in between
Singin' la la la la la la la
But that's just me

[Outro]
That's just me, mmm

[Verse 1]
Last night you rolled into town
And you asked me to go one more round
And I want to, but I know that I'm just your sideshow
And the big top; it always comes down

[Chorus]
It's time that I wake up and wipe off this makeup
It's only a fool could take up with some clown
On a tightrope, in a tight dress, but it all seems worthless
'Cause just like the circus, you always leave town

[Verse 2]
You say what I wanna hear
But then you always disappear
You're the ringleader, but there's no ring on my finger
You're nothin' but smoke and mirrors

[Chorus]
So it's time that I wake up and wipe off this makeup
It's only a fool could take up with some clown
On a tightrope, in a tight dress, but it all seems worthlеss
'Cause just likе the circus, you always leavе town

[Outro]
I'm gonna takе off this tight dress and learn how to hurt less
'Cause just like the circus, you always leave town

[Intro]
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light inside of me

[Verse 1]
Tried not to show it
To make you feel good
Pretended I couldn't
When you knew that I could

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't cry when the cold wind blows
Gonna let it shine
'Cause now I know

[Chorus]
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light inside of me
There was a shadow of a doubt
But baby, it's never going out
There is a light inside of me
There is a light

[Bridge]
There is a light
It's so bright
But I've been hiding it
There is a light
Inside of me
There is a light

[Outro]
There is a light inside of me, ah-ha
There is light inside
There is a light
Oh, there is a light
Oh, there is a light
Oh-oh
There is a light inside of me, ah-ha
There is a light inside of me
There is a light
There is a light inside of me

[Intro: Soulja Boy]
Yeah (Yeah), yeah
Draco, Soulja
You know what the fuck goin' on
Look

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I'm havin' bond money
Went it to shoot it for fun, done it
My choppa tote hundred round drums, don't it?
Don't reach for my chain, you a dummy, dummy
I was trappin' and shit with a hundred round drum
Gotta pull out and shoot, we do that fun
I'm on my third come-back, you ain't had one
I'm double 007, the golden gun
A young nigga trap out the Tesla
These niggas be faker than wrestling
I put that boy on a stretcher, ayy, ayy
Uh, I'm applying pressure, bitch
Big Draco and nigga, I'll stretch your electric (Boom)
Run up on the gang, nigga, you gon' get popped, uh
Only thing I killed was an opp, wasn't no Hip-Hop
Throw back down with the thirty
Puttin' more holes in that boy than a jersey
We takin' the jet and we go to New Jersey
Smokin' on dope, swag on early
Pull up and shoot, Kyrie Irving

[Chorus: Soulja Boy & T.I.]
Yeah, yeah, they copied the drip (Yeah)
Yeah, they copied the drip
Yeah, yeah, they copied the drip
Yeah, copy me, copy me, copy me (Copy), copy me
These rappers copy me, copy me (Copy), copy me, copy me
Yeah, copied the drip
Yeah, copied the drip
Yeah, cop, copied the drip
Cop, cop, copied the drip (Yeah, yeah)
Copy me, copy me, copy me (Yeah), copy me (What?)
These rappers copy me (What?), copy me (What?), copy me (What?), copy me (What?)
Copied the drip, copied the drip (Yeah, yeah)
Copied the drip, uh, uh, copied the drip (King, bitch)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Okay, I just be minding my business (Uh-huh)
And niggas ain't gon' wan' admit it (Uh-uh)
But trap music wouldn't be in existence if I ain't invent it (What?)
You're welcome, so silly
Poppin' my shit, hope them fuck niggas hear me
Y'all know it's my city, I own 

[the more building?] (Yeah)
Who would've thought an anonymous killin' could lead to such a phenomenal feeling?
Consequences come from incompetence
Confident that I'm one of the one percent
I can't see that fuck shit, I got tunnel vision
From the pot to piss in to a hundred million
Brand new big ole' estate with a lil' pavilion
Here my middle finger for your lil' opinion
Despicable me got a million minions
Riding bandwagons, I'm setting trends
Niggas in camp (Camp)
I've been reppin' the town, holdin' it down
Through it all still stayed solid
Tell 'em if they had a problem with it, should've did something 'bout it
Breakin' Rolls in the Hills?, I'm probably
Sittin' on the hood of the Denali
Takin' two dodgin' Federales
In Cali duckin' paparazzi
I'm a one-of-one, these suckers can't copy this shit, man

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Copy me, copy me (Cop, cop)
These rappers copy me
Copy me, cop, cop, cop, copy me
Cop, cop, cop, copy me, copy me
These rappers copy me (Drip)
Copy me, cop, cop, copy me (Drip)
Cop, cop, copy the drip, copy the drip, copy the drip
Copy the drip, copy the drip, copy the drip
Copy and paste, copy and paste, copy me
Copy me, cop, cop, cop, cop, cop, cop, copy me

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
I'm up in Balenciaga, I'm on a shopping spree
Buying two bricks then I'm buying three
I'm outside, how they say that they ain't find me?
Bust down the Audemars, perfect timing
Walk out the jewelry store, you know I'm shining
Double R, Cullinan, seats, they reclining
I came a long way from the yellow diamond Breitling
Now I put a hundred pints on the E-way
Scrape the block just like a DJ
Big Backwoods, ZaZa in the ashtray
Murder Gang, Money Gang came up from Blast Gang
OGOD, I can't forget Ocean Gang
VVS', bust down, drip, splash all on my Cuban link chain
Fuckin' this bitch, I don't even know her name
Head shot if you speak on my gang

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Copy me, copy me (Cop, cop)
These rappers copy me
Copy me, cop, cop, cop, copy me
Cop, cop, cop, copy me, copy me
These rappers copy me (Drip)
Copy me, cop, cop, copy me (Drip)
Cop, cop, copy the drip, copy the drip, copy the drip
Copy the drip, copy the drip, copy the drip
Copy and paste, copy and paste, copy me
Copy me, cop, cop, cop, cop, cop, cop, copy me

[Verse 1]
Just before our ship got lost, you said
"I am as constant as a northern star"
And I said, "You're just as silly as a northern fish
And if you want me I'll be in the bar"
On the back of a cartoon coaster pad
That didn't make me laugh at all
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
And I charted our last squall

[Chorus]
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I'd still be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

[Verse 2]
Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paint
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm scared to death by saints
I remember when you told me "love is touching souls"
Surely you touched mine, you know
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In black and white designs

[Chorus]
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

[Verse 3]
I met a woman
Who had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said
"Go to him, stay if you can
But be prepared to bleed"

[Chorus]
Oh, but you are in my blood, you are my holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I'd still be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

[Verse 1]
Sitting in a park in Paris, France
Reading the news and it's all bad
They won't give peace a chance
That was just a dream some of us had
Still a lot of lands to see
But I wouldn't wanna stay here
It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here

[Chorus]
Oh, but California
California, I'm comin' home
I'm going to see the folks I dig
I'll even kiss a Sunset pig
California, I'm comin' home

[Verse 2]
I met a redneck on a Grecian isle
Who spent my money very well
He gave me back my smile
But he kept my camera to sell
Oh, the rogue, the red, red rogue
He cooked good omelets and stews
And I might have stayed on with him there

[Chorus]
But my heart cried out for you, oh, California
California, I'm comin', comin', comin', home
Oh, make me feel good rock 'n roll band
I'm your biggest fan
California, I'm comin' home

[Bridge]
Oh, it gets so lonely
When you're walking in a street of strangers
All the news of home you read
Just give you the blues

[Verse 3]
So I bought a ticket
I caught a plane to Spain
Went to a party down a red dirt road
There were lots of pretty people there
Reading Rolling Stone, reading Vogue
They said, "How long can you hang around?"
I said a week, maybe two
Just until my skin turns brown

[Chorus]
And then I'm going home to California
California, I'm comin' home
Oh, will you take me as I am?
Strung out on another man
California, I'm comin' home

[Outro]
Oh, it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
More about the war
And the bloody changes
Ohh, will you take me as I am?
Will you take me as I am?
Ohh, will you take me as I am?
Will you? Will you?
Will you take me as I am?
Hmm, mmh
Will you take me as I am?

[Verse 1]
I was alone and sickly
It was a quarter of a moonlit night
I heard him cry through my window shade and it filled me so full of fright
But I could not turn my back on him
I put on the back porch light
"Can I help you?" said the good samaritan
"Can I help you?" said the good samaritan

[Verse 2]
I brought him bread and a blanket
But I told him "You can't come in here"
You can sleep outside in the tool shed
Though a little rain comes in
Well, I don't know you, you're a stranger to me
No, I don't know where you've been
"You can't come in here," said the keeper of the inn
"I don't want you in here," said the keeper of the inn

[Verse 3]
But I couldn't sleep for the thinking
You know my night got so insane
I thought, maybe hе was an angel
And I left him out in the rain
And what if hе was the devil?
He'd be coming after me again
But when I woke in the weary morning he was gone
When I woke in the weary morning he was gone

[Verse 4]
I thought maybe he was an angel
And I left him out in the rain
And what if he was the devil?
He'd be coming after me again
When I woke in the weary morning he was gone
He was gone
He was gone, he was gone, he was gone, he was gone
When I woke in the morning, he was gone

[Verse 1]
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Verse 2]
But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Chorus]
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

[Verse 3]
He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Verse 4]
I'm so hard to handle
I'm sеlfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the bеst baby that I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Chorus]
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

[Verse 5]
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Verse 1]
I awoke today and found
The frost perched on the town
It hovered in a frozen sky
Then it gobbled summer down
When the sun turns traitor cold
And all the trees are shivering in a naked row

[Chorus]
I get the urge for going
But I never seem to go
I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is falling down and winter is closing in

[Verse 2]
I had a man in summertime
He had summer-colored skin
And not another girl in town
My darling's heart could win
But when the leaves fell on the ground
And bully winds came around
And pushed them face down in the snow

[Chorus]
He got the urge for going
And I had to let him go
He got the urge for going
When the meadow grass was turning brown
And summertime was falling down and winter was closing in

[Verse 3]
Now the warriors of winter give a cold triumphant shout
And all that stays is dying all that lives is gettin' out
See the geese in chevron flight
Flapping and racing on before the snow

[Chorus]
They got the urge for going
And they've got the wings so they can go
They get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is falling down and winter is closing in

[Bridge]
I'll ply the fire with kindling now
I'll pull the blankets up to my chin
I'll lock the vagrant winter out
And I'll bolt my wandering in
I'd like to call back summertime
And have her stay for just another month or so

[Chorus]
But she's got the urge for going
So I guess she'll have to go
She gets the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And all her empire's falling down
And winter's closing in

[Outro]
And I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is Falling Down

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator, Ty Dolla $ign & DJ Drama]

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator & Ty Dolla $ign]
Aw, you look malnourished (Malnourished)
Let's get some bread, fry it in egg yolk and drown it in syrup (Drown it in syrup)
You pick a spot, I pick a tail number and we could be tourists (Ooh, yeah)
Let's go to Cannes and watch a couple indie movies that you never heard of (Baby)
Listen to bands, groove and we dance
Disco in France, smell some perfume, head in the wind (In the wind)
We can switch off
I can show you how you can really exfoliate skin
If you got a man, you should cut it off
Get your passport 'cause we runnin' off (Run off)
We can sit and talk
You can tell me everything that's on your chest, baby, get it off
You are my type, you a bright light
I'm like a moth, this is not a game (This is not a game)
But before we start (Before I say)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator,  both & Ty Dolla $ign]
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Check it out)
(What's your name?)
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Tell me)
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Check it out)
(Oh, what's your name?)
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Oh, girl)
Yeah

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Tyler, The Creator & Ty Dolla $ign]
What is your name, what do you bring? (Yeah)
I think that I got what you need
And I'm willin' to do anything that you please (Baby)
I'm tryna get down to the root of the apple
The deepest I could in them jeans
McLaren like Sonic, can't speak, no
No, you can't hit my lean, no (Baby)
Baby, tell me where the piece go, 'cause I'm lost
Your body compared to the fashion
I hope you ain't proud of the shit that I bought (Baby)
'Cause money, it don't mean a thing
I value the times that I take you out
One minute, it's a beautiful scene
Then it probably end with me bein' took out, woah-oh
Think slow, 'cause I move fast (Oh, me)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, both & Ty Dolla $ign]
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Check it out)
(Oh, what's your name?)
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Tell me)

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator, Ty Dolla $ign & DJ Drama]
Since when did I bring a C5?
I wanna know your name
I feel like I had your name
Oh-oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh
Stop playin' and let me pay your momma debt off, haha

[Verse 1]
This is really happening
I'm about to lose my way
Bracing for the reckoning
Feel the weight of my mistakes
Life is where you're heading
I'm about to lose my faith
Taking all my medicine
Diving into my mistakes

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
This is really happening
I'm about to lose my way
Bracing for the reckoning
Feel the weight of my mistakes
Life is where you're heading
I'm about to lose my faith
Taking all my medicine
Diving in

[Bridge]
Find myself
When you look away, look away, look away
Look away
Find myself
When you look away, look away, look away
Look away
Find myself
When you look away, look away, look away
Look away
Find myself
When you look away, look away, look away
Look away
Find myself
When you look away, look away, look away
Look away
Find myself
When you look away, look away, look away
Look away

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
I can see the cold world
Every time I want
Though it's heating up here
I should let it snow
Wrap my hands around you
Holding on for sure
And you had to disappear
Not yet truly gone, hmmm

[Chorus]
Family
You’re still part of me
Family
And though I know your heart's in tears
Family
I've been my brother’s fears
Just don't let time be wasted here

[Verse 2]
I have seen the angels
Put me down to sleep
And when all is settled down
They were there to see
Now it seems unstable
Though you disagree
That our lives were torn apart
By your selfish greed

[Chorus]
Family
You're still part of mе
Family
And though I know your heart's in tears
Family
I bear my brothеr's fears
Family
Just don't let them be wasted here

[Outro]
Family
Family
Family
Family

[Verse 1]
These words weigh heavier away from home
I found my peace alone
Besides I see you in me all the time
For now, at least it's mine
I'll say I did my best to stay afloat
It felt impossible
My way can't paint this picture differently
I'll take it as it goes

[Chorus]
And though it's your style
Even if I cared
Had to make me understand
Like I've never been aware
I send my love, send my love
Take back what's mine
Now I've found my plan
Had to leave it all behind
I'm a shell of a man
Now I've taken a hold
Just to feel alive
I send my love, send my love

[Verse 2]
My fate invested in the in-between
But grows up over me
I'll say I'm shifting ever slowly
Had time on side of me
I take what's left
And over my stay
I silently fade away
Those things I've kept
Will ride till the day
I'll silently fade away

[Chorus]
And though it's your style
Even if I cared
Had to make me understand
Like I've never been aware
Send my love, send my love
Take back what's mine
Now I've found my plan
Had to leave it all behind
I'm a shell of a man
Now I've taken a hold
Just to feel alive
I send my love, send my love

[Bridge]
I need you to have faith in me
Riding round my own so freely
Sending all my love home
It's not too hard to be alone
'Cause I have time to follow a dream
Making my own wishes to my victory
Sending all my love home
It's not too hard to be alone

[Outro]
Send my love, send my love
Send my love, send my love
Send my love, send my love
Send my love, send my love

[Verse 1]
Out there, lady shadows
Bound by blood
Free stream and the mess of love
Unshaken, lazy animal
Tie to us, defending it's only love
And I believe
Of a sweet soul filled with lust
Building what's in front of us
Send the ravens on their way home to you
To be yours

[Chorus]
Just give it up
It's never nothing
I'm losing myself from getting fairy tales
Just leave it up
And keep it from here
I'm losing myself from getting fairy tales

[Verse 2]
Out here
Given the time and place
I've shown and throw this mess away
Unshakеn, lazy animal
Saving face
Watching was around and raise
See to beliеve this
Of a sweet soul, hot in face
Slowly as they disappear
Is it free will?
Or do we surrender to our fate?

[Chorus]
Just give it up
It's never nothing
I'm losing myself from getting fairy tales
Just leave it up
And keep it from here
I'm losing myself from getting fairy tales

[Bridge]
Give it up, hmm
Leave it up, hmm
Give it up, hmm
Leave it up, leave it up, pull it up
Give it up, hmm
Leave it up, hmm
Give it up, hmm
Leave it up, leave it up, leave it up
Give it up, hmm
Leave it up
Give it up, hmm
Leave it up
Give it up, hmm
Leave it up, hmm
Give it up, hmm
Leave it up, leave it up, leave it up
Give it up, hmm
Leave it up, hmm
Give it up, hmm
Leave it up
Give it up, hmm
Leave it up, hmm
Give it up, hmm
Leave it up, leave it up, leave it up

[Chorus]
Just give it up
It's never nothing
I'm losing myself on getting fairy tales
Just leave it up
And keep it from here
I'm losing myself on getting fairy tales

[Outro]
Losing myself on getting fairy tales
Losing myself on getting fairy tales

[Verse 1]
For a while
I let myself imagine
That fear of love
Had me
But deep ties
20-odd years of habit
Can break down
From me
These days
I'm finding time to reappear
Or fall away
From it
If I could
Pen my old self a letter
I'd give him life for better

[Chorus]
I'm unguarded
I saw you in surrender
Found somebody
Who had shown me forgiveness

[Post-Chorus]
I let it break away
I break away
I let it break away
I break away

[Bridge]
There's no easy way to live without love
There's no easy way to live without you
I'm so tired
I'm so tired
And so helpless
I can't believe it's coming to
There's no easy way to live without dreams
There's no easy way for dreams to come true
I'm so tired
I'm so tired
But I gather myself, I'm coming for you

[Chorus]
I'm unguarded
I saw you in surrender
Found somebody
Who had shown me forgiveness

[Verse 1]
Birth right
I'm standing in silence
Holding on for dear life
Reprimend acquired
Ignorant to my compliance
Hold tight
It's getting too violent
Rince into the moonlight
Find a way to hide it
Leading myself to defiance

[Pre-Chorus]
Who am I? Who am I?
But a slave to the lie
It's my dangerous mind
Under the skin of my darkest white (Yeah)
Who are you? Who are you?
But a slave to the news
There's a side to choose
See it disguise with no will to lose

[Chorus]
White clouds in the sky
Yet the world around me makеs them cry
Black clouds by the moon
Therе's a righteous world inside of you

[Verse 2]
Hope forces
Making a division
Blinded by the state and religion
I'm asking themselves
I'm seeing both side's in position-sition
Encore's full
Finding ways to listen
All I see is lakes and the rivers
Flooding themselves
I'm seeing both side's on a mission

[Pre-Chorus]
Who am I? Who am I?
But a slave to the lie
It's my dangerous mind
Under the skin of my darkest white (Yeah)
Who are you? Who are you?
But a slave to the news
There's a side to choose
See it disguise with no will to lose

[Chorus]
White clouds in the sky
Yet the world around me makes them cry
Black clouds by the moon
There's a righteous world inside of you

[Outro]
There's a righteous world inside of you
There's a righteous world inside of you
There's a righteous world inside of you

[Verse 1]
Do you dream of strangers?
Or just darkness in an empty room
While your brothers play without you
Are you suffering?
Just lie there for a minute
Can hear the eldest spoiled serenity
They're not friends, this time, your enemies
Are you suffering?

[Chorus]
Is this what we call life?
Is this anything I ask for?
What we call life
I need to question why

[Verse 2]
Early hours come creeping
No apology, just warm embrace
Maybe now it's time to state your case
That you're suffering
Whilе they're acting so differеnt
They're cementing the worst part of you
Always pushed aside and try to please
Now you're suffering

[Chorus]
Is this what we call life?
Is this anything I ask for?
What we call life
I need to question why

Is this what we call life?
Is this anything I ask for?
What we call life
I need to question why

Is this what we call life?
Is this anything I ask for?
What we call life
I need to question why

Is this what we call life?
Is this anything I ask for?
What we call life
I need to question why

[Verse 1]
My wicked mind won't quiet
Oh the thunder strike is silent
Grab it at the root, yet the soil is non-complied
Leaves start falling from my tree
My poison's so clean to me
Just to start believing
I try to show I'm human
My ego forces me to prove it
Just so I don't lose it

[Bridge]
Please be starting, mind
Gonna get started, mind
Please be starting, mind
Gonna get started, mind
Please be starting, mind
Gonna get started, mind
Nobody cares for me no more
Please be starting, mind
Gonna get started, mind
Please be starting, mind
Gonna get started, mind
Please be starting, mind
Gonna get started, mind
Please be starting, mind
Gonna get started, mind
Please be starting, mind
Gonna get started, mind
Please be starting, mind
Gonna get started, mind

[Verse 2]
I started all on my own pieces
Try to pinpoint tricks up on weakness
Don't care no more, don't care no more
I should've come to my senses
Try to find hope in the senseless
Don't care no more, don't care no more

[Chorus]
All this time alone and feel
The rush of blood flooding to my bone
And there's no time to waste for the miracles, miracles, miracles

[Verse 3]
I made it through to the unknown
Try to flood my senseless ego
Don't care no more, don't care no more
I should've come to my senses
All I found was everything but the senseless
Don't care no more, don't care no more

[Chorus]
All this time alone and feel
The rush of blood flooding to my bone
And there's no time to waste for the miracles, miracles, miracles
Miracles, miracles, miracles

Can you be? (Be) Can you be? (Be)
Can you be? (Be) Can you be? (Be)
Can you— (Be, b—, be, b—)

Verse 1
Goddamn machinery
Why don't you speak to me
One day I am going to take an axe, to you
The pitter patter
What does it matter?

I've had my fill
I've had my fill of hurt
Had had my fill of hurt
I've had my fill of hurt

I had a ex who said I gave her the best years of her life

You've ever had anyone ever compliment your wife too many times
5 years from now i'mma uh
I had a ex who said I gave her the best years of her life

You've ever had a day where the president gave your wife too many compliments
5 Years from now I'mma compliment your wife, uh
In my mind I got a hundred moving (?)

She in a walk of shame, hall of fame
You know what to say to get her off
You know exactly what to say to set her off
Maybe it would be better if you let her off the hook for a second
Man, whatever you would call it
Do you remember what you'd call it?
Do you remember what the name is?
(?)
Lose track, never ever mix the lean with the (?)

You remember you was athletic, she was pathetic
Pathological liar, (?)
Asmathic, couldn't breathe (?)
Guiness book of world records uh
Niggas say they the most trill, the most ill
What's the guiness book of world records (?) for the real
Get the fuck outside
Follow by the drones

Happy Pride everybody!

[Verse 1]
No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through (Break through, break through)
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leavin'
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh

[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside mе say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

But I've had time to think it through, uh
And maybe I'm too good for you (Let's go!)

Well honey, I don't need you anymore (I don't need you anymore)
No, I don't need you anymore

[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no, no
No, no, no (Do you believe in life after love?)
I can feel something inside me sayin'
I really don't think I'm strong enough, no, no
No, no, no (Do you believe in life after love?)
I can feel something inside me say
(I really don't think you're strong enough, no)
Show me how strong you are!
(Do you believe in life after love?)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

[Outro]
Do you believe in life after all

Good day, Sir Baudelaire, what can I do for you?
Oh, dude, I am so fucking hungry, and I just want to eat
Can I get the, can I get the brown sugared salmon?
Mkay, so our dinner plates this evening are the braised bohemian beef or the brown sugared salmon
Heh, yeah, I know, I want, I want the brown sugared salmon please
With the, with the potatoes, and I don't, I don't want brussels sprouts
Mmm, I'm so sorry, we are out of that
The chef actually ran out of salmon because there was a trivial boat shortage at the lake so-
So why did you mention it in the first place?
Because that's our specials
Okay, alright, cool
Let me just get the ehm, the braised bohemian beef with the potatoes, and I don't-
Oh, Mr. Baudelaire, I'm gonna have to check if we have the braised bohemian beef
Are you fucking dumb?
I'm just gonna have to double check that we have that
Who's- who's running this place? Who's in charge here?
I'm in charge Mr. Baudelaire, and thank you so much for traveling with us
Is there a dilemma I can sort out?
I'm starving, and I just want dinner
Oh, well, our dinner specials are the braised bohemian beef, and the brown sugared salmon
I know, I fucking know, and this lady keeps on telling me that-
Oh, ah, my name's Trina, sir
Okay, well, Trina Sir, keeps saying "It's no salmon, it's no beef, it's no anything, I just want-
It's not "No anything" Mr. Baudelaire, it's the braised bohemian beef or the brown sugared salmon
I think he's leaning towards the beef
Trina, would you quadruple check if we have the beef?
Yes
Mmmm, we do not have the braised bohemian beef
Oh jeez, I'm so sorry Mr. Baudelaire, I have just got word, that we are in fact out of the braised bohemian beef
But, we are now serving complimentary yogurt
Now, would you like strawberries or granola?
Oh-oh, oh, we are out of the yogurt

[Verse 1]
Stratocaster
Play me that one we used to play
Does it matter?
My heart belongs to yesterday

[Chorus]
Just me and you and moonlight
Me and you and moon
Your song ends too soon

[Verse 2]
Live below no master
And all of your troubles blow away
Oh, my Stratocaster
Play me that one we used to play

[Chorus]
Just me and you and moonlight
Me and you and moon
Your song ends too soon

[Intro: Grill Z & MATR0]
To let you in my arms
Yeah, Let the world know what's on your mind
Don't ever leave me alone
Don't come around here no more
I love the way that you move
You think that you're the one
Cause I won't play the game
You haven't done a single thing
(Guess I’ll keep on ridin till the morning light)
When you got nothing to say
It helps me see you through
And I hope song gets to you
So you can talk to other guys
Oh girl, stop ignoring me (Ooh)

[Verse 1: The Weeknd & MATR0]
This house is not a home to you
But you decide to go ahead and lay down, lay down
There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
’Cause I see you’re here to stay
Should’ve known to pick my fate
(MATR0 ON THE)

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Yeah, I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Ooh) (Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Hey there, lonely girl
Did you have to tell your friends
About the way I got you screaming my name?
Did you have to tell the world?
Now your girls all wanna-
Oh no girl you could’ve been the one
Gotta change my number twice a month
When you could have simply kept it on the down low

[Chorus: The Weeknd & MATR0]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
MATR0 ON THE
MATR0 THE BEAT

[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Baby if I knew you’d be living in my sheets
I wouldn’t have shown you any love
I would have left you in the club
You said you don’t belong
You keep saying there’s no one
And there’s no where to go
But who keeps calling on your phone?
(Why girl? ooh)
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)

[Outro: The Weeknd, Grill Z, & MATR0]
Girl, if your man call your phone again
Girl, if your man call your phone again
(Hey)
And you might think it feels good to be with him
But just wait until stuff happens and one day-
(One day)
You both argue and then he shuts the door slammed
Oh, hey oh, hey
Oh, guess you shouldn’t have gotten with him in the first place
(In the first place, the first place)
Lyrics from snippet

[Verse]
-all At me, i gaved a peace of mind oh oh oh oh

[Chours?]
I said let's slow down (woah)
Don't you scroll down

[Spoken Verse]
Niggas is blessed
I'ma put a bike track and the zipline at the other-other crib
Golf Wang's doin' amazing, might open up another store
​le FLEUR* is goin' insane, smell good, nail polish
Converse, Gucci
Camp Flog Gnaw one of the best festivals
I'm healthy, my skin glowin', my friends healthy
I'm fuckin' who, what, when, where, haha
Karen and Alex Moss 'bout to drop off some new pieces
I'm out here scorin' commercials, movies soon
We writin' shows, man, life is fucking beautiful
I done fell in love and th-th-thе—
The only flaw is my fuckin' hair won't grow
It's been like two years and this shit likе two inches
Come get lost with me, man, come, come, come see the world
When you, when you really get out there, call me, I'll be there
And I don't take jets like that, I'm scared to go broke, so
I don't take none of this shit for granted
It's opulence, baby

[Intro]
Ahem, fuck, yeah

[Verse 1]
Met you on a Saturday, knew it was somethin' soon as you spoke it
Eye fuckin' across the table, don't think anybody noticed
You asked me if I was comin' to city you from
Maybe we should kick it, I was interested, that would be dumb
If I denied long legs, good ears, great taste
Smell good, sense of humor, obvious a good face
And we clicked, we was at each other's hips
I ain't even wanna fuck 'cause your presence was enough
You and I make sense, you stayed back at my telly
We was chattin' 'til mornin', the vibrations was heavy
I wasn't drownin' or yawnin', that's when I told you my feelings
You told me you felt the same, but you got homie you dealin' with
Damn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected
But I get it, it's whatever, least I can do is respect it
We still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it
The problem is he my friend, but if I'm honest, I'm really hopin' you drop him
It's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross
But you got somethin' that make all them good intentions get lost
I try to keep it together, never felt this way
We spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day
And they say, "Bros over hoes," I'm like, "Mm, nah, hey"
I would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake
But whatever, we still could be friends, it could still be chance
I'ma play it cool, we got somethin', we cannot pretend, uh, uh

[Interlude]
It's, it's like starting a race
And then when you take off, they like, "No, no, it's not a end," ha
It was too late and shit

[Verse 2]
FaceTimin', it ain't 'bout nothin', you laughin', packin' your luggage
It's nothin' incriminatin', but please delete our discussions
You hit me with the look and replied like, "Duh, bitch"
Don't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back
Cross the line, cross the line, cross the— nah, we never did that
Though I haven't seen him in months, shit is rare he never hit back
Anyway, convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it
Right in front of his lenses, nothing here is malicious
You sat by me in that movie, we went outside for them doobies
We walkin' off when we talk, man, that nigga not fuckin' stupid
He see it, he know it's somethin' we frontin' like, "Ha-ha-ha"
Whenever we "Ha-ha-ha," we subtly press his buttons
Not on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose
If I fucked our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it
But, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it
And plus y'all got depth, I'm just the nigga on the surface, for real
Surface

[Interlude]
I said surface, like, 'cause they got roots
Like, I'm the new nigga
But you know, they be fuckin', haha
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Didn't see you a couple weeks, think he want you away from me
Know y'all argued 'bout if you mad you met him before you met me
I feel guilty, but not as much as I should
I tried to have that self-control, but not as much as I could
I been down for days, you in my city and I can't see your face
I can't eat knowin' you with him and not at my place
I never been jealous of another man
Especially when I have everything I want at hand
Except you, you

[Interlude]
You know, I got every damn car, multiple cribs
But it's like, "No, I want that," ha

[Verse 4]
He left for some days, I cleared out my sched', I cleared out my head
You dropped off at mine, I say that we fled, "No, you pick a place"
We could Tulum, or we could Capri, or die right here
As long as you with me, I'll be at peace, huh
You was supposed to go back home to see your bestie
I told you I can't hit that zone, too busy next week
You was like, "Hmm, I'll stay a week, she'll get over that"
Seven days with me, your nigga like, "Where the fuck you at?"
Dirtyin' my bakin' pots, tennis at my mama spot
Chauffeured in the Rolls, the back entrance for them restaurants
Parks playin' chess games, givin' wigs pet names
Manicures, night swims, Jerrod providin' methane
Shoppin' 'til we droppin', what you coppin'?
See, the price is not a option
It's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me
I know around him, you gotta act like you not into me
I know your answer, but you gotta keep it honest with me
Said you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him
Then why the fuck when we link it's like he doesn't exist?
They all know that we friends, but we both aware that it's more
Everything I got, if you say the word, then it's yours
The only thing I'm missin' in life, I know you could be it
And everyone around me that care about me can see it
I could fuck a trillion bitches every country I done been in
Men or women, it don't matter, if I seen 'em, then I had 'em
But with you, it's a feeling 'cause we twinnin' and we matchin'
You stayed in the car when I went on date with that actress
Whole time I'm eatin', I couldn't wait to get back
In the back of the car with you and talk about who we are
You told me when you with me, it's like heroin
Told me that your confidence went up since we befriended, and
Told me that you didn't wanna hurt him, why we doin' this?
Told me this a awkward situation and you just wanna be through with it
Told me every time you not with him, it started problems, and
Told me every time you not with me, you always ponder
What type of sweater I'm wearin', what music have I been finding
Girl, you know that I'ma play it whenever, that's what we bonded over
You said you told him the truth and you never lied
Now he lookin' at you with them eyes
We never crossed the line, but he got every right to be a lil' pissed off
He picked you up, y'all got an argument, he got his shit off
My energy like, "Get lost," your energy just want peace
I couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak
He ain't even call you his bitch
Until he see me make you smile, that nigga threatened as shit
I'm in the wrong, though
I picked you up, your energy off
Your lips really dry, something is off
You ask if I gotta, I ask if you gotta
We trip on our words, nobody is lyin', hakuna matata
We sat in the car and cried for a hour
My shirt look like a showerhead got it, we called it off
I'll skip the details but that night I seen hell
You was in a room I was payin' for, I took three Ls
No, I didn't sleep well, woke up and my knees fell
They buckled to the ground, I cannot walk, shit, I need Vill
Next day I'm drivin' 'round the city with no destination back-up
Water in my eyes kept falling like Niagara
Vill right beside me makin' sure I didn't crash or
Do something heinous 'cause I'm emotionally jabbed up
You checked every box, I thought it was it
Felt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff
No, I'm in the wrong, that was a friend
No, fuck that, the energy we had, never again will find it
You in the wrong, gotta remind you 'bout the times that you stepped
Gotta rewind it— aw, fuck
We talkin' 'bout our kinks, real cautious with the links
You don't do that type of shit when you in relationship
And you a hundred with your mate, so don't go actin' like no saint
'Cause it's a two-way street, and shit, you knew what I was on
And while that nigga out and gone, shit, you was loungin' in my home
Shit, I even let you meet my mama and y'all got along
But shit, I'll take my L, though it's not fun
You still got your nigga and still had your fun
Shit, I can't even look at you and think about bad words
That's why I called and said we couldn't end this on bad terms
We straight like a bad perm, we'll always be good friends
And laugh about it on a sandy beach while our back burns, huh
This my perspective, this how I feel
I ain't fabricate nothin', I kept it real
I told you I love you and always will
And if he ever put his hands on you, promise I'll get him killed, true
True, true, true, yeah

[Outro]
On God, I love that girl, f— mhm
I'm a sh— I'm a bad person, like, I'm in the wrong, I'm a bad person
I had no ill intentions, though
Shit, everybody got hurt
I got hurt, bruh
It's a shit situation
All the morals and power you have just vanish when a certain energy is nearing
And those feelings got so much gravity and it's out of your control
That made me realize adults don't know what they doin' either
We're all just children
I ain't mean to fuck nobody's shit up, man
I thought I was bulletproof
She proved me wrong, man
I felt two hundred percent with her
It was beautiful
I was able to feel
But it was, it was bad timing
And I'm mad private with this side of my life 'cause people are weirdos, and
I just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows
Safe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts
'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of it
But I guess you're just another chapter in the book

[Intro: DJ Drama & Tyler, The Creator]
Destination: remote
We done been everywhere
Only thing we ain't traveled
Is time (Yo)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
The boy record smell like bleach
I can travel where I want
I'm accustomed clearin' customs
It ain't custom, I don't come
Flee the bird to the truck
I scream, "Au revoir," to the stewardess
Border control asking stupid shit
Stayin' at home, I hate
Runaway love, but I'm no Ludacris
Sippin' on mint tea, take my shoes off
Then we take off, then I snooze off
Until I land where I'm foreign
Then I wake up, wipe the drool off
Got my passport in my weekend
I'ma cool off, get a sweet tan
Loafers filled with beach sand
Recline 'til it's time to peace sign
Fuck all the chains and the cars, get a passport
See the world, open your eyes 'til your back hurt
Niggas get bread and won't leave, shit is backwards
Start with your feet, then a car, then an airport
Get out your bubble gum
Blow up horizons, sun
Sled in the Alps or go tube in Missoula
Or tour in Japan or go scuba in Cuba
Or land in a borough, Jerrod got the brioche
Ciabatta in Como, it matches my peacoat
Oversee the sea, all the things that you could see
Like them languages I speak, out in Paris for a week
Take my nephews out to Nice, they like "Who?" I'm like, "Oui," ha

[Break: DJ Drama & Tyler, The Creator]
We on a safari
Legendary (Safari)
World-renowned
Globally recognized
Catch us if you can (Baby, we on a safari)
Are you keepin' up? ('Fari)
Once in a lifetime (Baby, we on a safari)
This what it sounds like when the moon and the sun collide
Speakin' matter-of-factly (Baby, we on a safari)
We're just light years ahead (You said that it was you I saw with another in my place)
Yeah

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Every car retarded, the garage look like a loony bin
What coupe he in? Depends on the 'fit and the type of mood he in (Ugh)
I been switchin' gears since Tracee Ellis Ross was UPN
Clutch, then he stroke outta nowhere like a droopy grin (Ugh)
Huh, took that Grammy home, couldn't lose again
The suit was so sharp that it could get Medusa coochie trimmed (Ugh)
Hov talkin' 'bout a hundred million, nigga, loop me in
Like who that young, rich, handsome nigga with the gooey skin? (Ugh)
Mama named him Tyler and his brothers call him T
And the bank, they call him when that wire clear like season three or somethin' (Ugh)
Skateboard named him Bunnyhop, it's Baudelaire or Wolfie, though
The felines named him hour for how long he eat the— (Pussy) wait a minute (Ugh)
Pink loafers scuff quickly, Fiat cost a buck sixty
I'll keep it a buck fifty, y'all can't really fuck with me (Ugh)
Bitch, I got the fuzz and I'ma own it 'til they bury him
Only twenty-nine, but I've been focused since thirty M (Ugh)

[Outro: DJ Drama & Tyler, The Creator]
Wolf
Call me if you get lost (Gangsta Grillz)
And like that (Uh), we gone

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Ladies and gentlemen
We just landed in Geneva
Yeah, that's in Switzerland
We on a yacht
A young lady just fed me French vanilla ice cream
We all got our toes out, too
Call me when you get lost

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
I'ma travel the globe, you keep the block hot
Driver, open the door for me, my hand hurt
Find us, we playin' hide-and-seek with the passports
Where the fuck we at? Oh, the pilot gotta remind us, yeah
The luggage is pilin', I needed clothes to wear (Woo)
So many stinkies sit in my wallet, look like a folding chair (Yeah)
The Cartier so light on my body, thought I floated here
We boated here, it's Tunechi and Tyler, but call me Baudelaire, yeah
Out in Switzerland, travel with my bitch again, we kissin', dawg
I love when she let me rub her like Michelin (Skrrt, skrrt, facts)
A hundred grand to sleep on the bird, the wings are whistlin' like—
Man, they ain't listenin'
We crossed the line like immigrants and benefit from it
Keep on stuntin' on these niggas, make 'em sick to they stomach, man (I can't stop it)
Y'all don't understand, fish so fresh that you could taste the sand
Yeah, we gettin' lost but we know who we am (True story)
Bada-bada-bada, somethin'-somethin'-somethin'
Treat that last part like you niggas ain't sayin' nothin'

[Break: DJ Drama, Tyler, The Creator & Lil Wayne]
(Hot wind)
Yeah, haha
You see these excursions right here?
Just too lavish to post on the 'Gram (Gangsta Grillz)
Uh (Tunechi)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Excuse me, pardon me, the wind, it blow so hard at me
Like mother nature arguing about some baby father beef
And I'm stuck in the middle of the sandwich like slaughter meat
Got my middle fingers to the cameras that's recording me
From y'all to me, brrt, stop callin' me unless you're ordering
I'm on the beach, I got my feet out, and I stay on my feet
The corner beat, I'm on a deep route, just throw the ball to me
Thought all this lean would have me senile, I guess they see now
Let's touch down, catch a beat-down like I catch touchdowns
I fuck 'round and slow the beat down and take the drums out
And speed up my flow, I'm so greedy, I'ma eat my own flow
And I'm in need of a flow, might eat me a rapper and I might as well eat me a ho (Oh)
I'm hot as hell when the weather is freezin', as cold as the devil and demon and ghost
I'ma get even and even, get even some more, it's too late to even get low, baow
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, that's what I need you to know, Mula, Weezy the G.O.A.T.
The wind beneath my wings, Desert Eagle underneath my coat
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Mula (Bitch)

[Outro: DJ Drama]
(Hot wind)
(All aboard, nigga)
You see
We just over here admirin' the view of the mountains from the lake
Of course
Y'all know it's Wolf Haley, man, stop fuckin' playin'

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Whatever your shit is, man, do it
Whatever bring you that immense joy, do that, that's your luxury
The greatest thing that ever happened to me was
Bein' damn near twenty and leavin' Los Angeles for the first time
I got out my bubble, my eyes just wide
My passport is the most valuable—

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Massa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me—, ehm, I'ma just go

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, when I turned twenty-three, that's when pubеrty finally hit me
My facial hair started growin', my clothing ain't really fit mе
That caterpillar went to cocoon, do you get me?
See, I was shiftin', that's really why Cherry Bomb sounded so shifty
My taste started changin' from what it was when they met me
But first impression is everything, ain't wanna let me go
Always curious as a child and askin' questions, so
I ain't give no fucks, if, and, buts if they accept me
Yo, my boy Skateboard P gave me that speech in Italy session, um
Thankfully, by hour three it detoured perspective, um
Thoughts changed so rapid, turned to butterfly, Flower Boy happened
All the bees buzzed me, the bugs screamed they loved me
First time I private airlined, accolades, song got airtime
Grew into my style, body, and feelings, and fixed my hairline
Calmed down in front of cameras, business hit tens of millions
I'm not that little boy y'all was introduced to at one-nine
Mom was in the shelter when "Yonkers" dropped, I don't say it (I don't say it)
When I got her out, that's the moment I knew I made it (Yeah, yeah)
I don't come from money, they deny it
Since I don't mirror the stereotypical products of my environment
Eight figures in taxes taken, that shit is stupid
A flower gets its petal, they pluck it, but never use it
It's still potholes in the schools, where does it go?
It's still loopholes that I use, nobody knows

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Massa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch
Got too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss
They try to talk me up, but I keep short like Caesar
Eyes open if I pray 'cause I can't trust God either, uh

[Break: DJ Drama]
Seein' that we only get one life to live
How far do you really wanna take it?
Don't let 'em ever tell you nothin' you can't do

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, I purchase more wheels when I feel like I'm third-wheelin'
My favorite part of the double R is the bird ceilin'
The panoramic view of the sky and the sun beamin'
That ray of light show that nobody is front-seatin'
I'm on the hunt for perfect but decent is what I been on
I know she fell in love, but commitment is not my end goal
And all my friends that did got too comfy, a little chubby
And that drive to make that money dried up when that nose was runny
We ain't gotta pay attention to the stuff that he battles
Everyone I ever loved had to be loved in the shadows
Tug-of-war with X and Y felt like a custody battle
Felt like the boat goin' down, it felt like I'm missin' a paddle
Might buy that crib in Seattle covered in grass, lackin' gravel (Yeah)
It come with two boats and cattle, I'm livin' sweet, ain't you heard? (Ain't you heard, nigga?)
This perspective from the beak of a bird
You hope I peak, you take my peace
You gon' see me and run like thieves in the night
I'm paranoid, I sleep with a gun
The heat on my dungaroos because they beefin' for fun
I'm vegan for now, I'm conscious, know my hands meet when I bow
I'm grateful, you niggas hateful, you eat at me, you got a plate full
You can't relate to these things I say to these instrumentals
Whether it's wealth talk or shit that's painful
I paint full pictures of my perspective on these drum breaks
Just for you to tell me it's not good from your lunch break

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Holiday season
A vision you have to understand from perspective
Check your resources, nigga

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator, Teezo Touchdown & DJ Drama]
Fuck you niggas talkin' to me about?
See, see, as a kid, I felt alienated by the niggas who looked just like me
Niggas treated my nuance like it, like it was a nuisance
So, so I was like, I was like, "Fuck 'em"
Fuck 'em, I did my own shit, and now I'm up and now all that paid off
And all them niggas, they peaked in high school
I always had confidence, I ain't never been nervous, I ain't never had anxiety, I ain't never second-guessed myself
If I want it, I go get it
I'm always on go mode, I just go
I don't know what fear is
When they talk about, "That nigga," I'm him, I'm him, I'm that nigga
(Run)
It's funny, right? (Run)
For some reason, y'all didn't really think we was gon' be here (Run)
See, for y'all, the sky is the limit
For us, the sky is just what we stand on to reach the beyond (Run, run, run)
High above the clouds, as you see us (Gangsta)
Catch up, niggas

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator & Teezo Touchdown]
Bitch, I'm runnin' up the check like I got racks on (Run, run)
And I'm runnin' up that shit 'cause I got racks on me (Run)
Bitch, I'm runnin' (Run)
Bitch, I'm runnin' (Run)
We gon' run it up (Bitch, I'm runnin')
We gon' run it up (Run)
We gon' run it up (Bitch, I'm runnin')
We gon' run it up (Run, run, run)
We gon' run it up

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Teezo Touchdown]
I just might spend it all (We gon' run it up)
I might just spend it all (We gon' run it up)
Here today, but gone tomorrow (We gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (We gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (We gon' run it up)
I might just spend it all (We gon' run it up, run)
Here today, but gone tomorrow (We gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (We gon' run it up, run, run)
I just might spend it all (We gon' run it up)
I might just spend it all (We gon' run it up, run)
Here today, but gone tomorrow (We gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (We gon' run it up, woo, woo, woo)

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator & Teezo Touchdown]
He off the dope (Yeah)
We off it, we off the boat (Okay, true story, run)
Crosshairs 'til he off, we tee off like G-olf
We (Phew-phew-phew), we see off the scope
So I (Run), grin (Run)
Bunnyhop been zoomed in
Ever since I hit two tens
Of the faces with the blue skin
With the green background, don't know how to act now (Now)
But I need unagi on my bluefin (Yeah)
Fiends moonwalk when I come (Hold up)
Deaf hoes speak when I'm here
The dead hit sprints when I hum
Why you actin' so dumb?
Bitch, you know I got the fuzz (Now)
I'm live from the 310
Green Goblin, it bend tires (Ah)
No lots, they send photos, I send wires
Gumballs cool me down, I'm on fire
Can't fuck with him (Yeah)
Rap (Rap music, nigga)
Helped us see clear when the lightin' was dim, dim
We
Ain't nothin' to you, but we somethin' to them, them
When you in your room and you starin' at the ceilin'
Dreamin', I want you to know it's no ceilings
I want you to notice that feelin'
I want you to leap and go for it (Yeah)
I want you to reach with no fearing
Throat clearing, scream it, let 'em hear it
Run that shit up, baby (Yeah)

[Outro: Teezo Touchdown, Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up (Let's go up, baby)
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
Here today but gone tomorrow (We gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all (We gon' run it up)
I just might spend it all
I might just spend it all
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
I'm runnin' like a politician (I'm runnin' like, runnin' like)
I'm runnin' like the water on the dirty dishes (I'm runnin' like)
I'm runnin' like the roaches in the kitchen
I'm runnin' like the damn transmission (I'm runnin' like, I'm runnin' like)
I'm runnin' like I'm not tryna catch a whippin' (I'm runnin' like, runnin' like)
I told you, nah, I told you (I'm runnin' like, runnin' like, I'm runnin' like, runnin' like, I'm runnin' like)
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up

We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
Lil' white bitch gon' say
"You need to say something about that"
"You need to say somethin' 'bout black—"
Bitch, suck my—
Yeah
Go time

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
That ain't your religion, you just followin' your mammy
She followed your granny, she obeyed master
Did y'all even ask up questions?
It's holes in them stories
Is it holes in your blessings?
Yeah, I'm bold with the message
I know I ain't got the answer
But I ain't gon' cheerlead with y'all just to be a dancer
I'ma groove to my own drums, sunlight in my shadow, baby
Move 'til my soul cums, let them serpents rattle, baby

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis & DJ Drama]
Crackin' like broke porcelain, bitch
We ocean deep if you just pour us in a portion of shit
Them people try to twist my view on some contortionist shit
I had to reevaluate what was important and shit (O-F)
Finders, keepers, when you creep inside my mind it's madness (Yeah)
If I see peace, I'm like a fiend (Ooh), uh, gotta have it
Lord, cover me I'm goin' in, walls closin' in (Uh)
How I'm supposed to be protected (Huh?) when the laws want us in?
Y'all want us dead, just 'cause the skin is the black type (Ah)
Teach me everything and be amazed I don't act right
What the fuck?
I'm tapped in the matrix, I'm back and they hate it
I'm black and make 'em pay me capital statements, you dig? (Ching)
Word on my back, I'm tryna fashion a statement
I ain't no bastard, we the master of the path that we blazin', you dig? (What?)
(On God, now)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
I came a long way from my past, nigga, it's obvious
V12 engine, I'm fishtailin' on some sloppy shit (Skrrt)
Internet bringin' old lyrics up, like I hide the shit
What's your address, I could probably send you a copy, bitch
I was canceled before canceled was with Twitter fingers (Haha)
Protestin' outside my shows, I gave them the middle finger (Fuck 'em)
I was a teener, tweetin' Selena crazy shit
Didn't wanna offend her, apologize when I seen her
Back when I was tryna fuck Bieber, Justin
I say with my chest out, you say with your chest in, nigga (Say it with your chest, nigga)
Black bodies hanging from trees, I cannot make sense of this (Uh)
Hit some protest up, retweeted positive messages (Uh)
Donated some funds then I went and copped me a necklace
I'm probably a coon to your standard's based on this evidence
Am I doin' enough or not doin' enough?
I'm tryna run with the baton, but see, my shoe's in the mud
I feel like anything I say, dawg, I'm screwin' shit up (Sorry)
So I just tell these black babies, they should do what they want
Freedom, need 'em, my niggas, seen 'em
Free 'em, don't fuck with the law like, damn, Gina
So calm the fuck down before we duck rounds
And fireballs that make your family have to duck the fuck down
We frontline, we got the molotov that we can chuck now (Woo)
'Cause anytime we movin' up, it's like a "What the fuck now?"
They playin' games, we strappin' up, we cock and aim (Yeah)
We aim to shoot, we shoot to claim what we need
We done with pain and the grievin', niggas is done with the peace
Whether it's personal or for the whole of niggas, indeed (Yah)
I might not have dreadlocks, I might have these gold teeth
But I'm a nigga like you, and you's a nigga like me (Yeah)
So let's be niggas together, and let's be niggas with plans
But put this plastic on first, 'cause shit is hittin' the fan, Scott

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
Shit like this make me wanna turn my baseball cap to the side
You know, with the T.I. lean
Y'all fake mad
Catch up, niggas
Gettin' y'all identity, huh?
Gangsta Grillz
Go get a fuckin' hobby
Shit
Ain't nobody perfect
Well, at least y'all ain't, hah

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
"Somewhere you never been to"
Little town outside of Knoxville
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach

[Chorus: All]
Yeah but, now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastеrn Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with mе was some sand in my boots

[Verse 2: Morgan Wallen and All]
I said "Let's go shoot tequila"
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said "Don't cowboys drink whiskey?" (huh)
So we drank bottom shelf
She said "Damn, that sky looks perfect"
And I said "Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home"
And she said "Maybe I should, see 'em for myself"

[Chorus: All]
Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

[Bridge: Morgan Wallen]
I said meet me in the mornin'
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up

[Chorus: All, Morgan Wallen]
Oh, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

[Verse 2]
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

[Verse 3]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never carеd for what they know
But I know

[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't bе much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Verse 2]
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

[Verse 3]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know

[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
Now, nothing else matters

[Verse 1]
Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman, he comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land

[Verse 2]
Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We'rе off to never-nevеr land
Yeah-hah

[Bridge]
Now, I lay me down to sleep (Now, I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep (Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
If I die before I wake (If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take (Pray the Lord my soul to take)
Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head

[Chorus 2]
Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land (yeah, haha haha)

[Outro]
Oh! Yeah-yeah, yo
We're off to never-never land
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
We're off to never-never land
We're off to never-never land
We're off to never-never land

[Intro]
It's that D2 shit, you know
Hit-Boy

[Verse]
Yeah, Freshman 10
This shit makin’ me feel old, damn
I gotta go back to '010
When the best car I rode in was a old Benz (Swerve)
And new enemies was still old friends (Friends)
Honestly, I think it was around '09
The time I got the XXL cosign (Yeah)
Remember thinkin’, "I should been on the last couple years, nigga, both times" (Both times)
For the first time, felt like I was walkin' in my truth
Cold day in NYC, nervous, walkin' in the room
Bumped into the coolest nigga, Wiz, he like, "Dude
You made it here too? You know I really fuck with you
I even hit you on MySpace like two years ago, you the truth
Anyway, I'm 'bout to drop a new mixtape
Two of 'em, Cabin Fever and Kush & Orange Juice, I need you on there"
I'm like, "Shit, send it through" (Send it through)
Then I saw OJ tha Juiceman walkin' too
He like, "Sean, what it do?"
First nigga that I seen rockin’ that many diamonds and real diamonds inside his tooth
I said, "Shit, nigga, just tryin’ to be as poppin' as you" (Ayy)
He ain’t laugh, it was cool
Then they made us all stand together like we was a big-ass group (Group)
Then I seen my nigga Nipsey there in all blue (Woah)
Back then, niggas thought he talked and looked just like Snoop, damn
I'm just lookin' for this new nigga that Hov' signed
Some nigga from North Carolina
I heard him named J. Cole (Cole) and they said they delayed his flight
So they gotta Photoshop him in, I hope that shit look right (I hope it right)
Goddamn, Freshman 10
The funny thing about bein’ next up is that shit, you'll never be next again ('Gain)
Got my foot in the door, been steppin' it up ever since (Since)
Crazy how some of the longest, most stressful days of your life
End up bein' the times that you wish you could live twice
Only two mixtapes in, but in my city, one of the realest, though
And at that time, niggas peep niggas was stealin' flows and buildin' off it (Off it)
And at that time, that nigga Ye was like, "Dre, I'm just tryin' to make them Ms off it" (Ms)
Later that night, I hit the stu' with Nip' and Wiz
French Montana too, but he wasn't on the cover
I mean, at least not ours, but they put him on another (Another)
And to sum up the whole night, I get back to the hotel, few doors down
It was Jay Rock, he said, "Today was wild, shit
But let me introduce you to my young dawg, next up, named K. Dot" (K. Dot)
Who woulda thought? It's crazy memories, our gems our mind keeps in the vault
My, how life can change in on year?
Okay, but what about ten? I guess I'll check back in, what up?
Yeah, huh, you know, freshman ten
I know some niggas made it and some niggas didn't (Didn't)
That's the realest reality we all hate hittin'
But love to the whole clique (Clique)
'Cause we got a platform that most don't get (Get)
So shoutout Nip', Wiz and Cole (Cole, who else?)
Shoutout Pill and OJ too (Yeah)
Gangsta Gibbs, Fashawn, Donnis, and Jay Rock too
I pray you got as much love for me as I got for you
Real shit, I think we was the best class that ever came through (Through)

[Outro]
Huh, freshman ten
I remember my graduatin' class in like '06
And I remember between then, and, you know, to the XXL cover
Them was prolly some of the hardest years of my life
'Cause a lot of my niggas, a lotta, you know what I'm sayin'
Just, everybody around me was in school, goin' to college, gettin' jobs, whatever it was
And I was just still chasin' that dream, you know what I'm sayin'?
I just remember havin' to record in my niggas' basements
You know, settin' up the mics in our fuckin' closets and the bedroom
And, just like, goin' in
And all them lessons, even though I had the deal from Ye, which was a blessin'
It was like, shit, Ye was Ye, so he was busy
You know, shit was a little stagnant
But in them four years, when my niggas was graduatin', you know
That was the same year that I got the XXL cover
So in a way, it was like, that was my college degree
You know, all the mixtapes, all that grind, all the hard work
That was like my, my first degree, you know what I'm sayin'?
So I just appreciate the whole process, the whole journey
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda lived in the moment more, but
I guess that's what memories are for

[Verse 1]
I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl
I'm a back row sinner at a tent revival
But she believes in me like she believes her Bible
And loves me like Jesus does

[Verse 2]
I'm a lead foot leaning on a souped-up Chevy
I'm a good old boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee
But she carries me when my sins make me heavy
And loves me like Jesus does

[Chorus]
All the crazy in my drеams
Both my broken wings
Every single piеce of everything I am
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
The devil, man, no, he don't stand a chance
Cause she loves me like Jesus does
Yes, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
That devil, man, he don't stand a chance
She loves me like Jesus does
I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl

[Intro: Flo Rida & INNA]
Are you ready for the beaches?
Are you ready for the weekends?
Are you ready for the summer?
'Cause summer's not ready for me
Are you ready for the long nights?
With your body lookin' just right
Are you ready for the summer?
'Cause summer's not ready for me

[Verse 1: Flo Rida & INNA]
Uh, game stopped, it was ready for me
Stock going up heavy on me
No stress on me
Put that Patek on me
I keep a check on me
Your girl sex on me
She likes summertime, number six, number nine
Lemon-lime, man, I mix it up and give it to her, baby, anytime
I got plenty time, push that thing into mine
I know exactly what to do, baby, you, baby, you ain't (Ready)
I mean, you probably got a dude, but you ain't (Ready)
Slim thick, summer fine, get (Ready)
Pump that beat, you funky little bomb

[Chorus: Flo Rida & INNA, Flo Rida]
Are you ready for the beaches?
Are you ready for the weekends?
Are you ready for the summer? (Summertime, bae)
'Cause summer's not ready for me
Are you ready for the long nights?
With your body lookin' just right (Just right)
Are you ready for the summer?
'Cause summer's not ready for me

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
I think you're ready for the main event (Yeah)
Come and get it, baby, play to win (Play to win)
Spread it for me, don't get spread too thin (Yeah)
If I'm too much, baby, hit two friends
I got the Seamoth
Summer body lookin' like Ibiza (Ibiza)
She'll do anything for a visa (Yeah)
She got the fever
She gon' squirt a liter
Saucy, I'm fever
Lookin' like no gag reflex, respect
Fresh out the pack, no defects, secret
Baby, no hands and that's on T-Rex
Throw bands, OnlyFans might be next
Summer come, then I'm coming, we can ball
Yeah, I put the summer off, summer '20 was a loss
But we back home and it's finger licking good 'til the last drop
Sasquatch with the back shots (Yeah)

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
Yeah
I must confess
I'm freakiest
In the summertime
Can I get an amen? (Amen)
I'll get some rest
When summer ends
So let me blow your mind
Ayy

[Chorus: Flo Rida & INNA]
Are you ready for the beaches?
Are you ready for the weekends?
Are you ready for the summer?
'Cause summer's not ready for me
Are you ready for the long nights?
With your body lookin' just right
Are you ready for the summer?
'Cause summer's not ready for me

[Outro: Flo Rida & INNA]
'Cause summer's not ready for me

[Verse]
Days within my reign
I'd sneak outside my window
My mother would always catch me
Footprints upon the 'sil
She'd look out
I'd run away
Days within my reign
Days of wayward sorrow
I'd go where none could follow
Notes from my radio
Adrift out into the day

[Chorus]
Days come and go
Suddenly I begin to see no difference
Between a life alone and love
And night and day, so long I'm off to surf my Lewa Lani
Morning comes, seems I can never put an end to the dreaming
Soon I'll be back to say "Hiyo"
You know it feels quite nice to be back home
Although
Though I will never be alone

[Verse]
Days within my reign
I'd sneak off into sundown
Getting to know you, writing my songs
Flowеr of the wall, I'm holding on
Look out along the way

[Chorus]
Days come and go
Suddеnly I begin to see no difference
Between a life alone and love
And night and day, so long I'm off to surf my Lewa Lani
Morning comes, seems I can never put an end to the dreaming
Soon I'll be back to say "Hiyo"
You know it feels quite nice to be back home
Although
Though I will never be alone

And night and day, so long I'm off to surf my Lewa Lani
Soon I'll be back to say "Hiyo"
You know it feels quite nice to be back home
Although
Though I will never be alone
Waiting around for waves
I'll wait round for days
Shakin' fear from under my pillow
While I wake to Neptune's billow

Thundering through bars
I chase him through bumper cars
Good grit I've come to my senses
I've fallen over the fence

Through drawn drapes
Into my dreamscape
I fake way through the coming storm
Far marooned
I've been defeated
I guess you're just what I needed

When you're gone
I lay so low you'd never know I was home
Go run so far from me
Go bury your bone
And when I turn around
You were there all along
Waiting around for waves
I'm counting down the days
Your shark tooth won't chew at my window
While I brine in Neptune's billow

Hunkered down ya dart
I chase you in my bumper car
Good grit I've come to the feeling
I'm way in over my head

Through drawn drapes
Into my dreamscape
I fake way through the coming storm
Far marooned
I've been defeated
I guess you're just what I needed

When you're gone
I lay so low you'd never know I was home
Go run so far from me
Go bury your bone
And when I turn around
You were there all along

When you're gone
I lay so low you'd never know I was home
Go run so far from me
Go bury your bone
And when I turn around
You were there all along
Been driving for miles
Back home from the wild
Looking at my rearview
Change from pink to pale blue

Into dark marine
It's been so long since I've seen
You fall back in my arms again
Spend the night with me

When I wake up
I put on my clothes
And when you're asleep
I tip on my toes
And take off
Into the morning
When I give up
My head hanging low
You always are the first one to show me all
All of your loving
The colors of your love
The colors of your love
The colors of your love
The colors of your love

Leaving
Tomorrow I'm leaving
This familiar ache
Fades from blues and into grays

Think of mе
Sketch it all out in green
Over the linеs that we trace
Darling I'm with you always

When I wake up
I put on my clothes
And when you're asleep
I tip on my toes
And take off
Into the morning
When I give up
My head hanging low
You always are the first one to show me all
All of your loving
The colors of your love
The colors of your love
The colors of your love
The colors of your love
I could do well
If life were easy, I'd give you shells
A couple days later
Find sand in my nails
A rock to climb
For I like Marielle
If life were easy

But life keeps living
Life will keep my living
Heart away
If that's what they're saying
That if I have to keep moving
Life will keep her living
Heart at bay
Cause that's where she stays

And I, and I can only hope
To be back again in the bay
With my Marielle
I could do well
If life were easy and under your spell
Put on the socks
That you sеnt in the mail
Roll out and skate
For I like Mariеlle
If life were easy

But life keeps living
Life will keep my living
Heart away
If that's what they're saying
That if I have to keep moving
Life will keep her living
Heart at bay
Cause that's where she stays

And I, and I can only hope
To be back again in the bay
With my Marielle

[Instrumental]

And I, and I can only hope
To be back again
Hope to be back again
Yeah, to be back again in the bay
With my Marielle

And the fire glows

There in your eyes
And oh I want to
Give you this light

Out of reach

My heart exploded
Supernova

You know I’m not a liar
When I tell you “you are too”

Yeah, we'll be hidin' from the weekend sun

[Verse]
Take me back to things as normal
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Workin' every day of your life
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Watchin' all the days passin' by
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

[Intro]
After that sweet Summer afternoon
When for the first time I saw you appear
Dreaming of you I composed a tune
So will you listen to it, dear?

[Verse]
Do I love you, do I?
Doesn't one and one make two?
Do I love you, do I?
Does July need a sky of blue?
Would I miss you, would I?
If you ever should go away?
If the sun should desert the day
What would life be?
Will I leave you? Never
Could the ocean leave the shore?
Will I worship you for ever?
Isn't heaven forever more?
Do I love you, do I?
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see
Don't you know I do?
Don't I show you I do
Just as you love me?

[Outro]
Do I love you, do I?
Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see
Don't you know I do?
Don't I show you I do
Just as you love me?

[Intro]
When the little blue bird who has never said a word starts to sing spring, spring
When the little bluebell in the bottom of the dell starts to ring ding-ding
When the little blue clerk in the middle of his work starts a tune to the moon up above
It is nature that's all, simply telling us to fall in love

[Verse 1]
And that's why birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love
The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Fins
Folks in Siam do it - think of Siamese twins
Some Argentines without means, do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

[Instrumental Break]
Take it Brian
Mmm
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Electric eels I might add do it
Though it shocks 'em I know
Why ask if shad do it - Waiter bring me "shad roe"
In shallow shoals English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

[Outro]
Let's do it, let's fall in love

[Verse]
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born

[Pre-Chorus]
And now it's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
Oh, when you walk

[Outro]
Life's goin' nowhеre, somebody help mе
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
Life's goin' nowhere
East, west!
East, west!

East (East) meets west (West)
Different drummers side by side
When east (East) meets west (West)
The best of both survive
From the nights in Hollywood (Hollywood)
To the lights on Broadway, yeah
Some said we never could ever cross that line

I remember hanging out in '62
Down at the diner scorin' all the time
When out in California where the surf was up
You had a woodie, buddy, girls would stand in line
We were thе kings of the things we liked to do
A gamе of rivalry comparing me and you, me and you (They're comparing, they're comparing, they're comparing)

East (East) meets west (West)
Different drummers side by side
When east (East) meets west (West)
The best of both survive
Drivin' down the Jersey shore, riding 'round La Jolla, yeah
Top Forty evermore on the radio
Got the rhythm of the breakers in my blood
I take it with me everywhere I go
I need to feel the inner city energy
Can't do without it it's the only way I know
There's no goodbye to the ties that bind us to
The way will always be comparing, me and you, me and you (They're comparing, they're comparing, they're comparing)

East, west!
East, west!

From the nights in Hollywood (Hollywood)
To the lights on Broadway, yeah
Some said we never could ever cross that line
(Cross that line, cross that line, cross that line, cross that, cross that line)

East, west!
East, west!

Two different drummers playing side by side, whoa
You know the best of them will survive
Two different drummers playing side by side, whoa
You know the best of them will survive
Loop 1: First - Just walk to the end of the hallway and go through the door

Loop 2: Dropped Picture - Walk to the main open area and then turn around and head toward the clock area. Look at the picture on the ground and zoom in on it. The door will open

Loop 3: Loud knocking - The door is open

Loop 4: Cracked Door - After the door at the end of the hallway slams shut walk towards it. The bathroom door will open when you get close. When that happens, go to it and zoom in and look at the sink through the crack. The door will slam shut and the door the previously closed will open

Loop 5: Lisa standing - The door is opеn

Loop 6: Flashlight - Go into the bathroom and pick up the flashlight. Once thе door closes look at the sink. The rest of the sequence will play out once the crying commences and the door will open

Loop 7: Gouge it out - Look at the picture frame beside the radio and press the gouge button (X on vontrollers/keyboard; Right Trigger on VR Controllers). The door will open
			!- This loop will repeat itself if you walk through the door once. If you get attacked the second time, the loop will reset again

Loop 8: Window fall - The door is open

Loop 9: Slow fridge - The door is open

Loop 10: Fast fridge - The door is open but this section can loop infinitely. Look at the wall near the phone and look away until all letters not including "O!" disappear. Head to where the fridge is and look at the writing on the wall. The door will now open
Loop 11: Foreign song - The door is open

Loop 12: Infinite hallway - Keep running around the hallway until you see a picture frame on the ground and a hole in the wall in its place. Look into the hole and a short sequence will play and the door will open. After that head forward and go to the next loop

Loop 13: Crash - The sequence will play itself out

Loop 14: Final 	- The final loop will only commence if you have found all 6 pieces of the torn portrait. If not, the locations are as follows:
			1. In the pot of the big plan; You may have to walk around to the back of it to pick it up properly
			2. Direcrly below the clock behind one of the cans
			3. In the corner under the first lamp with a lampshade
			4. In the top left corner of the second archway, looking from the main room towards the bathroom
			5. Between the right side of the big cabinet in the main room and its adjacent wall
			6. Wedged in the third step up of the staircase at the end of the hallway
		- Wait until the clock strikes midnight and starts chiming
		- Once it has done so, walk exactly 10 steps and stop. This has a will trigger the first laugh
		- Start wandering around the hallway until you hear crying. Go towards it and try to find its location. Once you find Lisa, get close enough to see her entirely, but not close enough for her to to scream and posess you. If she does you will have to restart the loop
		- If done correctly, there is a chance you will hear the second baby laugh shortly after she disappears naturally
		- Immediately after the second laugh stay completely still and do not touch any of the controls. You will hear a third laugh shortly
		- Once the phone starts ringing go to it and zoom in on it to answer. The door will then open
		- NODE: If you dont have all 6 pieces at the start of the loop, walk more than 10 steps before the first laugh, get posessed, or move after the second laugh, the loop will not continue and you will have to walk through the door at the end of the hallway to restart the loop
Step right up and step inside
You ain't seen nothing yet
Life's a rollercoaster ride
One ticket's all you get
Nothing like it anywhere
It's cheap at any price
You won't believe the view up there
From hell to paradise
Honky tonk and pleasure palaces
There's so much to see
We can take a trip like Alice's
Leave it all to me
Satin sheets and sailing ships
Never touch the shore
Painted lights and paintеd lips
That always ask for more
Taste it, try it, don't deny it
You'll bе glad you came
Once you told me of your diet
You won't be the same
Step right up and step inside
You ain't seen nothing yet
Life's a rollercoaster ride
One ticket's all you get
Satin sheets and sailing ships
Never touch the shore
Painted lights and parted lips
That always ask for more
Taste it, try it, don't deny it
You'll be glad you came
Once you add me to your diet
You won't be the same
Step right up and step inside
You ain't seen nothing yet
Life's a rollercoaster ride
One ticket's all you get
Nothing like it anywhere
It's cheap at any price
You won't believe the view up there
From hell to paradise
There are honky tonks and pleasure palaces
So much to see
We can take a trip like Alice's
Leave it all to me

And this next number by David Bowie will also be his next single, to be released on March the sixth
And produced by bass player Tony Visconti it turns out; it's called "The Prettiest Star":

Cold fire
You've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place
Near you

So tired
It's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart
In pieces

[Chorus 1]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the dark
How you move is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus 2]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the dark
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star

One day
Though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star

[Guitar solo outro]
Lyrics from Snippets

I kept it one hundred when nobody else did
Turn your back on me, you selfish
But you know that I went to Hell and back for you
Oh, I guess that everything that I said
And everything that I did, meant nothing to you, oh
I can't fuck with you, I'm honest
I took a gamble with you
Uh, way more than I can handle with you
Used to keep it a hundred, nowadays you on some other shit
Now...

[Verse 1]
You got me thinking about
The things I'd do to your body (Yeah)
I can almost taste your lips
I can feel how much you want me

[Pre-Chorus]
But to think what you wanna do to me
Close your eyes and visualize me
Go with it, flow with it
Come on, be a man
Take control of it

[Chorus]
Let's get outta here
'Cause you know that we're
Gonna love tonight
Got a private spot
That's not all I got
For you, tonight

[Verse 2]
Your eyes are burning through me
I'm not afraid of your fire
I can almost taste your lips
I can feel how much you want me

[Pre-Chorus]
But to think what you wanna do to me
Close your eyes and visualize me
Go with it, flow with it
Come on, be a man
Take control of it

[Chorus]
Let's get outta herе
'Cause you know that we're
Gonna lovе, tonight
Got a private spot
That's not all I got
For you, tonight

[Bridge]
There are places that I know
No one else can ever go
But you and me
Welcome to me

[Chorus]
Let's get outta here
'Cause you know that we're
Gonna love, tonight
Got a private spot
That's not all I got
For you, tonight
If Columbus never sailed the sea (If Columbus never sailed the sea)
If Longfellow never wrote a rhyme (If Longfellow never wrote a rhyme)
If leaves have never grown upon a tree (If leaves have never grown upon a tree)
And if the sands have never told the time (And if the sands have never told the time)

Then I guess I don’t love you
(Like I do)
Then I guess I’ll have to find me
(Someone new)
Then I guess this love I feel couldn’t possibly be real

If Beethoven never wrote a song (If Beethoven never wrote a song)
And if Shakespeare never wrote a play (And if Shakespeare never wrote a play)

And if night has never followed day (And if night has never followed day)

Then I guess I just don’t love you

Then I guess I’ll have to find me, baby
(Someone new)
Then I guess my love for you couldn’t possibly be true
If high is low, and up is down
And if love is not considered an emotion
(If yes is no)
(And square is round)
(And if waves have never road across the ocean)
Oh-o-oh
If Michelangelo could never paint
And if Jezebel was a saint

Then I guess I just don’t love you
(Like I do)
Then I guess I’ll have to find me, baby
(Someone new)
Then I guess this love is wrong, couldn’t possibly be strong

Then I guess I just don’t want you
(Like I do)
Then I guess I’ll have to find that someone
(Someone new)
Then I guess my love for you couldn’t possibly be true

Then I guess I just don’t need you
(Like I do)
Then I guess I’ll have to find me, baby
(Someone new)
Then I guess this love I feel couldn't possibly be real

[Verse 1]
I'm coming home
I've done my time
Now I got to know what is and isn't mine
If you received my letter telling you
I'd soon be free
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me
If you still want me

[Chorus]
Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
It's been three long years
Do ya still want me
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
I'll stay on the bus
Forget about us
Put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round that ole oak tree

[Verse 2]
Bus driver, please look for me
Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see
I'm really still in prison
And my love, she holds the key
A simple yеllow ribbon's what I need to set me free
I wrote and told hеr please

[Chorus]
Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
It's been three long years
Do ya still want me
And if I don't see a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
I'll stay on the bus
Forget about us
Put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree

[Bridge]
Look-y here
The whole damned bus is cheering
And I can't believe I see
A hundred yellow ribbons
A hundred yellow ribbons
A hundred yellow ribbons
'round the ole oak tree
Don't deny me, satisfy me one more time
Barricade me and invade me one more time
Sacrifice me, don't be nice, be wild and free
Make a sex-pot symbol out of little old me

Caress me, molest me, one more time
Misuse me and abuse me one more time
Excite me and ignite me with your sweet torso
Use your muscles, my corpusclеs, wanna grow

Assault me, attack me, lose control
Lеt's smother each other in a good old strangle-hold
There's nothing but loving on my mind
Don't deny me, satisfy me one more time

Compromise me, vandalize me, have a ball
Destroy me and enjoy me through it all
Demolish, disassemble and dismantle my empower
If my birthday suit ain't cute I'll wear a barrel

Bite my ears, baby, nibble on my nose
Let your dimples put those pimples on my toes
There's sugar oozing over from my elbows to my knees
So cover me with kisses, get yourself some calories
If you don't want me climbing up the wall
Don't fool around my fertile ground at all
While the cold is getting colder, just be sure
Everything we've got is body temperature, pump it up

There's still a lot of gooey goody's left
When you reach the cookie jar, just help yourself
Saying nothing, but the loving on my mind
Don't deny me, satisfy me one more time

Encore, encore, encore
I never wanted to cast out in your mind
I’m not acting the way I think you’d like
We went for dinner, and now you’re out in paradise
If only you knew the way I felt inside
I’m like
(Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh)
(Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh)
(Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh)
(Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh)

[Lyrics from Snippet]
I had no friends, t-t-t-talk to last night
My mum was asleep
And my 'pa was 25
They say I'm in line
They say I'm satisfied
But first they wanna make out with me
This time

[Verse 1]
I never wanted to cast doubt in your mind
I'm not acting the way I think you'd like
We went for dinner and now you're acting paranoid
If only you knew the way I felt inside on that night

[Refrain]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
Your paranoia, it happens all the time
And that's 'cause lying's a big problem of mine (Just a problem for me)
But I still do it, now I'm by myself again
I tell so many that I can't see them end, so I said

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could, I would make amends
Today, I wrote a list of them
The way it starts, the way it ends
I signed my name in marker pen (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I must apologise
Before I end the night

[Post-Chorus]
It's not a gamе, I want to change
These days it doеsn't feel the same
The way it did some years before
I've lost so much, I'll lose some more

[Verse 3]
I'm not able
To tell you what you need, it's a shame 'cause
They say I should be honest more, one day, I'm sure
I'll figure out the reason I was telling lies for

[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (I must apologise)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Before I end the night)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
So we had a date prepared
It's in your diary, don't forget
I know last time you were making your bed, so you couldn't make it isn't that what you said?
But now I think you’re the cause for my grief
I haven’t slept for a week
You are somebody that I want to keep
But you said it's not deep
Into the arms that I weep

[Verse 2]
It’s weird how people still think it's pretend
The bond between us doesn't end
But they don't know the distance I went, to write your name in my journal fifty times on each page
You still ignore me as we pass on the street
And you still haven't askеd me yet to meet
But therе's no other place I'd want to be
Sat here behind you watching you leave the seat

[Chorus]
And I think I need a picture 'cause it's never enough to see you smiling in my mind, my mind is still in the dark
It starts with you
Starts with you
I'm obsessed with the idea that one day we’ll break up
Cause after that I know I'll never be as capable of love
After you
After you

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
As you speed down the highway
Goddamn, motherfucker, uh
There's only one way out this motherfucker
Goddamn, motherfucker, uh

[Chorus: Halsey, Kevin Abstract]
Every time you go, you take the rest of me
That's the best of me
'Cept my world don't see
I was all alone, but that was yesterday
Now you're next to me
That's the price I pay
Every time you go, you take the rest of me
That's the best of me
'Cept my world don't see (Goddamn, motherfucker, uh)
I was all alone, but that was yesterday
Now you're next to me
That's the price I pay (Goddamn, motherfucker, uh)

[Verse 1: Halsey, Joba]
Can't made my mind up
I got a different expectation
For every situation
I've been tryna feed my time up (Red hands on the table)
I got a dinner reservation
A Caribbean vacation
I've been feeling so sublime, yeah
I got the number to my old phone
And I never ever go home
My family still divide, yeah
I know my grandma wanna kill me
And my bedroom probably filthy
But my ex is sleeping with me
And she know I'm really busy
But she calls, she calls, she calls
She calls, she calls still
But she calls, she calls, she calls
She calls, she calls still

[Chorus: Halsey]
Every time you go, you take the rest of me
That's the best of me
'Cept my world don't see
I was all alone, but that was yesterday
Now you're next to me
That's the price I pay
Every time you go, you take the rest of me
That's the best of me
'Cept my world don't see
I was all alone, but that was yesterday
Now you're next to me
That's the price I pay

[Verse 2: Matt Champion, Kevin Abstract]
Yeah, made it with a little bit of champagne
On that tub, lay shoulders back
Wanna come in and out my life like
You was flippin' on remote back
How we get another pocket like this (I know)
Every time we gotta meddle with this (I know)
I just got me, I just got me
I was hidin' out
Roll hits in the nighttime mix
And my eyes around like a heat seeker
And the missile don't miss (Don't miss)
You been keeping me Enchante (Hah)
Let me out and I'm on my way (Hah)
Car shining like Kryptonite (Aha)
I'm down to get scooped tonight (Hah)
Introverted, I'm a ghost, alright?
Haunting me, I been a whole life

[Chorus: Halsey & Kevin Abstract]
Every time you go, you take the rest of me
That's the best of me
'Cept my world don't see (Madness)
I was all alone, but that was yesterday
Now you're next to me
That's the price I pay (Madness)
Every time you go, you take the rest of me
That's the best of me
'Cept my world don't see (Goddamn, motherfucker, uh)
I was all alone, but that was yesterday
Now you're next to me
That's the price I pay (Goddamn, motherfucker, uh)

[Interlude: Halsey]
Every time you walk away
You come back around, around
You say you never call me up
So why you calling me now? (-me now?)

[Bridge: JOBA & Jabari Manwa]
Double down, spin it back around
Red hands on the table
Curtains closed, never know
Let it show, we both a bit flirtatious
It's so evident if I give you too much
It's so evident that I'm losing myself
I love you so much

[Outro: Halsey, Halsey & Ryan Beatty, & Kevin Abstract]
You keep me close enough to reach
Always wasting my time
As long as you still come for me, I don't mind, I don't mind
You keep me close enough to reach
Always wasting my time
As long as you still come for me, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind (Goddamn, motherfucker)
I don't mind, I don't mind

[Verse 1]
New blood joins this Earth, and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in, this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on
He's known, ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Nеvеr free, never mе
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"

[Verse 2]
Thеy dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven," whoa

[Outro]
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
You labeled me, I'll label you
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
Ah, never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
You labeled me, I'll label you
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"

[Intro]
I- I was sittin' here wrapping up my album, and I got a call
You know, uh, I- I got a pink phone
And they said "It’s Big Draco"
I said, "Yo, Big Draco, what up? It's Big Barbie"
He said, "Big Barbie, I need you to pop out"
I said, "You know, I don't hop out unless I'm looking like a knockout"
But yo, the Queen 'bout to do interviews 'cause the Queen wrapping up her album
And I got a lot of stories, I wanna tell motherfuckers about you motherfuckers, ha!
And don't get scared now
The album coming, yeah, yeah, haha
Big Draco, shit on these niggas

[Verse]
It's over for you, nigga, take a bow, wow
Big Draco hit' em with the .40 cal'
Why nigga tryna take Big Draco style?
Give a nigga inch, now they wanna take a mile
Queen talk fact, where the printer and the file?
Bitches is my sons, that's why I be like, "Chile"
Chile, chile, chile, chile, ch-i-i-i-chile
Big Draco really fly, he know how to keep his balance
We was on a jet, not the Bow Wow challenge
Challenge, challenge, challenge, challenge
We was on a jet, not the Bow Wow challenge

[Outro]
Mhm, haha, haha, woo

[Intro: DJ Drama]
If we find anything in these days and times
I hope it's to live your life
There's no rules to this
Be your motherfuckin' self

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
Fishtailin', I'm fishtailin'
I'm fishtailin', ain't no tellin' if I'm out of control
I'm fishtailin', I said, I'm fishtailin' (With everything we accomplish)
I'm fishtailin', ain't no tellin' if I'm out of control (Yeah, it's still so much more to do)

[Verse 1]
Hawthorne, California, years that I was formin' up
Before the world would know me and I would come and perform for ya
I was baby bossin' things outside of my cornea
In the world with mama, where papa didn't show up for us
I ain't let it phase me, I just focused on my wishes
Execute ideas and accumulate multi-millions (Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow)
Gеt a bigger house with a kitchen to cook our mеals in
No niggas that can press me whenever I exit buildin'
A boy on handlebars that would listen to all my demos
That list was 'bout as long as a limo, but, here's the memo
Them niggas that look like me treat my nuance as a nuisance
So they would segregate me 'cause I didn't match they blueprint
What you think that's tied to? Shit, they don't know, but I do
So we don't match in eye view, nigga, you peaked in high school
So we can not compare, your perspective is stuck, goner
'Cause I was signin' eight-figure checks with my gloves on

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & DJ Drama]
I'm fishtailin', I'm fishtailin'
I'm fishtailin', ain't no tellin' if I'm out of control (Don't regret tomorrow what you didn't do today)
(Dreams can always become reality)
I'm just livin' my life as the best I see
If it don't excites me, we not the same team
Watchin' comma, comma, comma since I turned nineteen
So do not pay me no mind

[Verse 2]
Yeah
"How it feel? How it feel?" My nigga, it's so good
Smile on that baby face, schooling I was fuckin' up
Focused, I was comin' up, them kiddies had them tummies up
Was nineteen years of age when my pockets was 'bout a hundred up
How I get them checks off, nigga?
I ate and I paid my mama's debt off, nigga
Now the pay stubs is silly, it's millis from old banter
The ice near my shoulders colder than Homelander
No lackin', ma, the jimmy is strapped like some old sandals
I don't brag 'em, but she said my shit longer than old phantoms (Skrrt)
No alcohol or opium (Nope), he sober like some polar skin
He focused, 'cause he ain't think rap could take him to this podium (Yeah)
Livin' every day to the fullest, but move in silence
So romanticize your life, 'cause tomorrow ain't pinky promised

[Interlude]
Bitch, I'm fishtailin', yeah
I ain't think rap could take me this far, for real
Changin' niggas lives
I took my mom to Roscoes, early on
And I was like "Listen, you never have to work again in your motherfuckin' life"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
I kept that promise

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Who would've ever thunk it?
I mean, did you see we was gon' make it this far?

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Baby, when I go wild like that
When I ain't shy like that
Steppin' out and look fly like that
He ain't touchin' on it
Make him wanna go cry like that
When I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh, why, oh, why? Oh"
And I know you hate it when I tease you, baby
See, when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh, why, oh, why? Oh"
Let me hear you tellin' me, "I need you, baby"
See, when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh, why, oh, why? Oh"

[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
Hit me when you frustrated (Boy)
You ain't picky and get ignorant 'round them other ladiеs
I could come fix you, but you broke hatin'
You want Whitney, you want Britnеy, Jennifer, and Halle (Baby)
They ain't cold like me
Put them bitches in my old winter coat, that is so last week (Week)
Them other niggas, they been waitin' for it, they gon' hold my seat (Mmm)
Kryptonite when I'm throwin' ass, 'cause I know your weakness (Oh)
I can't forget how it used to be
In your thoughts, livin' good with me
And it feel so right, when I make you scream, "Please"

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Baby, when I go wild like that
When I ain't shy like that
Steppin' out and look fly like that
He ain't touchin' on it
Make him wanna go cry like that
When I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh, why, oh, why? Oh"
And I know you hate it when I tease you, baby
See, when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh, why, oh, why? Oh"
Let me hear you tellin' me, "I need you, baby"
See, when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh, why, oh, why? Oh"

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I know I'm not your type like that
But I'm gon' still try
Her pretty face, ass fat, waist snatched
It ain't got no size
Her Kelly crocodile fifty stacks (Yeah)
You don't even know why, you don't know why
But it's all on me (It's all on me)
Make you smile just to help you show your all-white teeth (Your all-white teeth)
Bust down with a purple dial, this a flawless AP (Flawless AP)
She said, "You can have any girl around this town, why me?" (Why, why me?)
'Cause I can see loyalty and ambition and style like me
Arch her back into position, I'ma tryna dig deep (Tryna dig deep)
I gave her some racks towards her business, she don't need a degree (She don't need a degree)
We flew a genie-nie-nie to the Philippines, our backyard a sea
She make GunWunna ease, we infinity, I don't never wanna leave

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Baby, when I go wild like that
When I ain't shy like that
Steppin' out and look fly like that
He ain't touchin' on it
Make him wanna go cry like that
When I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh, why, oh, why? Oh"
And I know you hate it when I tease you, baby
See, when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh, why, oh, why? Oh"
Let me hear you tellin' me, "I need you, baby"
See, when I wine, wine, wine, wine

He go, "Why, why, oh, why, oh, why? Oh"
See, when I wine, wine, wine, wine
He go, "Why, why, oh, why, oh, why? Oh"

[Chorus]
Oh, where is your jealousy? Why won't you cry? (Why won't you cry?)
This is just telling me you took me for a ride
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down

[Verse 1]
Boy, I'm lookin' at you, don't walk away
Comin' home at like two, then four, then eight
Boy, you lookin' like you don't know my name
Every day you wanna butter me up then you're pushin' me out the way (Yeah)
Now you wanna be a bad boy, papa
You ain't a man, you're just a handsome knock-off
I saw you sneakin', tryna plant one on her
Oh, you mad all the sudden 'cause your man got my number? (Yeah)
I wish you saw what I saw in you
Never opened that door to you and gave it all to you
How the fuck I wasn't on to you?
And it's a round of applause, but I'm warnin' you, boo

[Chorus]
Where is your jealousy? Why won't you cry? (Why won't you cry?)
This is just telling me you took me for a ride
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm a toy 'til you wind me
I'll be on the run 'til you find me
Bad thing, I don't want a bad mind, me
Can't wait 'til you realize, finally
Big mouth but the steam on tiny
I been seein' everything unwinding
And I bought you all your chains in a fistful
Rollie dead on your wrist, untimely
Baby, need somebody to trust in me
Need somebody to love on me, baby, baby, oh
Low-key I love it when you talk to me
But I don't wanna be your one-night thing
Oh, help me, can we? Oh

[Chorus]
Where is your jealousy? Why won't you cry? (Why won't you cry?)
This is just telling me you took me for a ride
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down with lies
And baby, you wind me up, took me for a ride
And baby, you drive me up the wall and down

In my loneliness
When you're gone and I'm all by myself
And I need your caress
I just think of you
And the thought of you holding me near
Makes my loneliness soon disappear

Though you're far away
I have only to close my eyes
And you are back to stay
I just close my eyes
And the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings

Yes I love you so
And that for me is all I need to know
I will wait for you
Till the sun falls from out of the sky
For what else can I do
I will wait for you
Meditating how sweet life will be
When you come back to me
There's no use of a moonlight glow
Or the peaks where winter snows
What's the use of the waves that will break
In the cool of the evening?
What is the evening without you?
It's nothing

It may be, you will never come
If you never come to me

What's the use of my wonderful dreams?
And why would they need me?
Where would they lead me without you?
To nowhere

What's the usе of my wonderful dreams?
And why would they need mе?
Where would they lead me without you?
To nowhere
Just nowhere
(Snippet)
You love me
You know what i'm on, You know i'm on home, You know Na Na Na, Love Me
You've watching on Aye Aye You know what i'm on home, i'm on home, if you na na aa
Do it over again with take one, tape one

One, two, three, go

There's a story told
Of a very gentle boy
And the girl who wore his ring
Through the wintery snow
The world they knew was one
For their hearts were full of spring

As the days grew old
And the nights passed into time
And the weeks and years took wind
Gentle boy, tender girl
Their love remained still young
For their hearts were full of spring

Then one day they died
And their graves were side by side
On a hill where robins sing
And they say violets
Grow there the whole year round
For their hearts were full of spring
That was a sample of Beach Boys, Nick... Venet
OK, let's all have it for the fabulous Beach Boys!

[Verse 1]
I'm making the most of my life
'Til the day that I hit twenty-five
I know that they’ll make an idol of me
I know that I’m not quite ready to be

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know I've got some growing, I realized the other day
When I said some things that I knew that I shouldn’t say
I opened up a letter of bills that I didn’t pay
They were due in April but now it’s the end of May

[Chorus]
It's sad that I
Prepare to be so young 'til the end of time
I realized
When I struggled to get out of my room last night
Got on my phone
And I bеgged for my brother to take mе home
When he asked why
I said I’d rather be here alone

[Verse 2]
I went to the doctor again
Said I was behind on my rent
He told me it's not a problem for him
I said that you’re so good at listening

[Pre-Chorus]
And they know I've got some growing, I realized the other day
When I said some things that I knew that I shouldn’t say
I opened up a letter of bills that I didn’t pay
They were due in April but now it's the end of May

[Chorus]
It's sad that I
Prepare to be so young 'til the end of time
I realized
When I struggled to get out of my room last night
Got on my phone
And I begged for my brother to take me home
When he asked why
I said I’d rather be here alone

[Intro]
Sit down and drink some champagne with me and let me rap

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
I'm balling with my friends
Staring at the money in a trance
Lil' baby, can I be your mans?
I might have to buy her OnlyFans
Huh? She gave me pussy as just friends
I feel like nothing but a middleman
I'm done, baby, I can't be your friend
You might give the pussy to my mans

[Verse 1: Baby Keem]
Huh? Ugh, you toxic
Ah-ha-ha-ha, you toxic
You wanna stay? Don't stay late
Do you not like your house? Hate your place?
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
Spent half a mil' on Grandma house and then I zoomed
Got way more money than my peers, you would assume
In competition with myself, I cannot lose
What we gon' eat?
I don't do Nobu, baby, that's him, not me
We fuck, wakе up, you go, we go to
London, we up, the top floor, еatin' soul food
I don't wanna eat nothin' else
It's new, I wanna see your room
It's new, I wanna fix your wounds
It's new, bitch, I'ma, ha, ooh

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
I'm balling with my friends (Hee-hee)
Staring at the money in a trance (Hee-hee)
Lil' baby, can I be your mans? (Hee-hee)
I might have to buy her OnlyFans (Hee-hee)
Huh? She gave me pussy as just friends
I feel like nothing but a middleman
I'm done, baby, I can't be your friend
You might give the pussy to my mans

[Verse 2: Don Toliver & Baby Keem]
I love to spend it, she coppin' levitators (Uh-huh)
I took her out to eat, I took her out to Denny's
She always call me plenty, drunky-drunky off the Remy (Uh-huh)
Sometimes no callback and Donny tooked off on the Henny
I'm touchin' down in your city just to get it litty (Uh-huh)
Better check the bar when we in the strip, we throwin' fifty (Go, yeah)
Do not be the Ghost, you can't get too close (Nah)
Shawty be doin' the most (Ooh), one hand better ride that roll
Xannies got me goin' down, put me in my mode
I just ate lil' baby up, shawty taste like cocoa
Ten feet, down deep, then I'm here and gone (Cocoa)
Got the beater out the sheets, you couldn't keep her home
Niggas pull up to the function, whip, I leave it on (Pull up)
I leave it on, Told you that I pack a punch

[Chorus: Baby Keem]
I'm balling with my friends
Staring at the money in a trance
Lil' baby, can I be your mans?
I might have to buy her OnlyFans
Huh? She gave me pussy as just friends
I feel like nothing but a middleman
I'm done, baby, I can't be your friend
You might give the pussy to my mans

[Verse 3: Baby Keem]
Two freaks in the club, but they attitude trashy
Don't fuck with broke boys, so the opps down bad
Baby Keem in the cut, she know that's a hefty tag, huh
I just put the whole 702 on my back
You ain't comin' home with us, please, don't you ask
I might throw a hundred ones, please, don't be mad
Tit-for-tat, goin' back and forth is not my passion
Took a trip to Paris to post another caption
It's too much liquor, I get it, huh
Steakhouse, takin' out, eight-hundred-dollar dinners, huh
Baby, go ahead and grab that, t-t-t-t-t-t-tease (Whew, whew, whew whew)
Bruises on your knees (Whew, whew, whew)
While I'm drinkin' tea (Whew, whew)
She gettin' teed, I hate when you tease
Don't try to hide your ass, we'll tag a picture on your back, huh
If that pussy good, there's a chance I get attached

So many days, I sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark and clearly I came along

[Chorus]
And you, you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

[VERSE]
You're rollin' at sea, hey, adrift on the water
Could it, could it be finally yeah, that I'm turning for home? Yes, I am
Finally, a chance to say, "Oh, I love you"
Never, never again to be all alone

[BRIDGE]
And you, you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
Oh, you light up my days
And fill, fill my nights, fill 'em up with song

[Chorus]
And you, you light up my life oh
You give me hope to carry on oh, oh
You light up my days
You fill my nights with song

You light up my life, my life, li-li-li-life

[Chorus]
All I, all I ever heard was good things
Good things about you and your ways
All I ever do is think of you
Think of you and me holding hands

[Verse 1]
At the school dance
No, no, no, we're just friends
Hope that we can be more
I dreamed of you last night
You had on a big old gown and a wedding ring, you were my wife
Baby, you were my wife
Baby, you run my life
Girl, I don't know where we will stand if we do not dance, you are my type
Baby, you are my type

[Chorus]
All I, all I ever heard was good things
Good things about you and your ways
All I ever do is think of you (Yeah)
Think of you and me holding hands

[Verse 2]
Will I ever forget you? Something I cannot do, I am all burned out
I only want you in my face, everyone else in my space can get the fuck on out
You stole my heart, one day, broke on the floor
Gaze in your eyes, I don't need nothin' more
The quicker picker upper, you are mi amor, for sure
I'll put a bounty on you for your love
Driving through counties to meet you for love
Don't ever doubt me, I'll always show up

[Chorus]
All I, all I ever heard was good things (Oh, yeah)
Good things about you and your ways (Ooh)
All I ever do is think of you (Yeah, yeah)
Think of you and me holding hands

[Outro]
Mwah

[Verse 1]
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 2]
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

[Chorus]
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Outro]
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Verse 1]
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

[Verse 2]
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Verse 3]
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeah
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

How we would wake up warming
In the morning by the kerosene
Outside the banks were forming
Like an ocean of evangeline

[Chorus]
I live and dream
You live and dream
In the branches of the evergreen

[Verse]
We take Betsy walking
In the back field by the lumber yard
Sammy cut worms with bare hands
And I loved him with all of my heart

[Chorus]
I live and dream
You live and dream
In the branches of the еvergreen
I live and dream
You livе and dream
In the branches of the evergreen

[Chorus]

You live and dream

I live and dream
You live and dream
In the branches of the evergreen

[Verse]
Some man told me it's all in the ripple
Cast that stone and see how it triples
I've been living on the dimes and the nickles
Not that starlight means something simple
I can see you stuck like a stone in the ground
Burning all those bridges that you found
Adam even told you as you ate the apple down
This is for the body so the flesh can be profound

[Pre- Chorus]
Following the detonation line
Hoping that I get to you in time to let you know

[Chorus]
In your hair, in your hair
In your hair, in your hair
Yeah your hair's so sweet and I just want to live there
In your hair, in your hair

[Verse]
Darling dole me, give me a nipplе
I could suck like a lake to a trickle
Oh I mеan it honey I ain't fickle
Bight my thigh like a wide-eyed pit bull
Oh and that night when the moon shone bright on your face
Wearing all your finest and the lace
I was always running, you were in it for the chase
Would you want me honey if I up and quit the race?

[Pre- Chorus]
Following the detonation line
Hoping that I get to you in time to let you know

[Chorus]
In your hair, in your hair
In your hair, in your hair
Yeah your hair's so sweet and I just want to live there
In your hair, in your hair

In your hair, in your hair
In your hair, in your hair
Yeah your hair's so sweet and I just want to live there
In your hair, in your hair

[Verse 1]
Say the word
And I’ll be coming back again
Like a bird
I’ll fly across the water on the wind

[Chorus 1]
If love is blind
How did I find you, how?
And you ripple like a dream
Over the machine of this town
And you know no limits

[Verse 2]
True and rare
To travel through the chambers of your care
Soft and true
To welcome in the emptiness with you

[Chorus 2]
If love is kind
How can I find you now
When you echo like a dream
Over the machine of this town?
And you know no limits

[Verse 3]
Tuesday morn'
I saw some stars die, some were born
No surprise
The embers meet the image in our eyes

[Chorus 3]
If love will grow
How can we follow the light
Which ripples like a dream
Over the serene of the night?
And it knows no limits

[Verse 1]
Wrapped in the wings of a sparrow
Beak is as sharp as an arrow
Sings in a whispering whistle
Sleeps in the ivy and thistle
Owls out swooping and howling
Deep in the midnight a-prowling
Mama, the scream of the eagle
Threading my heart through the needle
Threading the blood through the apple
Sucking the juice from the apple
Eating the seeds of the apple
Bearing the tree of the apple
Trapped in the weeds like a scarecrow
Stuck to the wind like Velcro
Distantly hearing the bell toll
Warbling chime through the meadow

[Verse 2]
Mama, the scream of the eagle
Threading my heart through the needle
Threading the blood through the apple
Eve sucked the juice from the apple
Nakedly running, I saw her
Boy chasing after to stall her
I wish I'd have spoken to call her
Before she found fabric to shawl her
Breasts bound and burdened with fiber
Adam came trembling beside her
And he said, and he said
That she has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her
She has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her
She has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her
She has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her

Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?

[Chorus]
I will always think about you
That's why I'm calling you back on my way through

[Verse 1]
We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine
You know I know you've moved on
Found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
(Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you
Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy (When she's with you)
Just not like how you were with me (Do you get déjà vu?)
That was the show, we talked about
Played you the song she's singing now
When she's with you
Do you get déjà vu?

[Verse 2]
Watching reruns of Glee (Beautiful girl you've еver seen)
Being annoying, singing in harmony (You know you'll nevеr mean)
I bet she's bragging to all her friends saying you're so unique
She probably gives you butterflies

[Chorus]
And I hope you're happy (When she's with you)
Just not like how you were with me (Do you get déjà vu?)
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy but don't be happier

[Chorus: Madonna]
Let me blow up this house tonight
Bitch, I'm Madonna

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
God is King, we the soldiers
Ultrabeam out the solar
All these people dumb dumb
And they claim they for the culture
Tryna keep my composure
When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
Pour the lean out slower
Got us clean out of soda
Before the flood, people judge
They did the same thing to Noah
Everybody wanted Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But thе strong start on Sunday
Copped the whole gamе for four hundred years
The prophecy 2019
Them people is woke, those people is woke
Them people ain't woke like me
Hop off the boat like me
Y'all don't want smoke like me
Y'all supposed to be mad at them
Y'all ain't supposed to fight me

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, He is wonderful

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
If you woke, then wake up
Sob, sob then we make up
Stop killin' and make-up
That's the **** that shake-up
Bars sound like a ****
God's somethin' they can't front
Stab your back, they can't front
Drop us off where we want
Ain't no wantin', know we need it, huh
We must have, we ain't greedy, huh
Stomp, stomp, they been needy, huh
Told the money, "They ain't see me, huh"
We ain't the product, we are the juice
We going wild, we staying loose
Home for the Zeus, we got the proof (Yeezy, Yeezy)
(Yeezy, Yeezy)
****, what they do
We in the streets (Yeezy), we goin' through (Yeezy)
We like the we (Yeezy), y'all **** you (Yeezy)
Hold up for you (Yeezy), you, you, you, you (Yeezy)

[Outro: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Wah, woo, wah, woo, woo, woo, woo
Keep bustin'
Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a
Kiss
You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on
If we can not make babies
Maybe we can make some time
Baby, you're so creamy

She said how'd you like to waste some time
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind
Nikki, oh

Don't worry, I won't hurt you
I only want you to have some fun
Baby, baby, baby I'm a star (Star, ooh)
Might not know it now
Baby, but I are, I'm a star, eh (Star, ooh)
I don't wanna stop 'til I reach the top, oh
Ow!
If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
All I can do is just offer you my love
All I can offer you is my love

I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted one time to see you laughing
Only want to see you laughing in the purple rain

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today to get through this thing called life
Fly me to the moon

Let me play among the stars

Let me see what spring is like on

A-Jupiter and Mars

In other words, hold my hand

In other words, baby, kiss me

Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore

You are all I long for

All I worship and adore

In other words, please be true

In other words, I love you
Fill my heart with song

Let me sing forevermore

You are all I long for, all I worship and adore

In other words, please be true

In other words

In other words

I love you

(d.a. got that dope)

[Chorus]
Count up the bands, stickin' out
No rubber band is big enough
Chain is so heavy, can't pick it up
Came with the gang, a myriad
I see your whip, hilarious
Where is my roof? Mysterious
My whip from Fast & Furious
Curtains with yellow interior
I get the commas, period
Covered in ice, Siberia
I'm at the top of the pyramid
Bitch, I'm a star, I'm Sirius
We came to play, it's serious
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the motley crew

[Verse 1]
Sit-up, pour, I just forgot where I was
Pour it up, throw it up, sit up, what?
Get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up
Came with a wig splitter
I got John Wick hitters (Ooh)
I'ma go get, get up (Wow, uh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Camе with the army, army, army, yeah
The pеople 'round me still the same
We just wanna party, party, party, yeah
We rowdy and we'll never chill

[Chorus]
Count up the bands, stickin' out
No rubber band is big enough
Chain is so heavy, can't pick it up
Came with the gang, a myriad
I see your whip, hilarious
Where is my roof? Mysterious
My whip from Fast & Furious
Curtains with yellow interior
I get the commas, period
Covered in ice, Siberia
I'm at the top of the pyramid
Bitch, I'm a star, I'm Sirius
We came to play, it's serious
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the motley crew

[Verse 2]
What you gon' do? I'ma pull up with the crew
When I'm off the juice, I like to hang out the roof
I'm rockin' jewels, I like when the diamonds, they move
I just go through, I do not wait in a queue
Baby, baby, pick it, Brady, Brady
AP navy, navy, chain like two Mercedes
I'll come when they pay me, come with Katy, Amy
Crew go crazy, crazy, kick it down daily (Uh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Came with the army, army, army, yeah
The people 'round me still the same
We just wanna party, party, party, yeah

Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the motley crew

[Verse 1]
As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn
We settle down to cut ourselves apart, yeah
We cough and twitch from the news on your face
And some foreign candle was burning in your eyes, your eyes

[Verse 2]
Held to the past, too aware of the pending
Chill as the dawn breaks and finds us up for sale
Enter the fog, another low road descending
Away from the cold lust, your house and summertime

[Chorus]
Blind to the last cursed affair, pistols and countless еyes
A trail of white blood betrays thе reckless route your craft is running
Feet to the sun turns into wood, dousing an ancient torch
Loiter the whole day through and lose yourself in lines dissecting love, love

[Verse 3]
Your name on my cast and my notes on your stay
Offer me little but doting on a crime
We've turned every stone and for all our invention
In matters of love lost, we've no recourse at all, at all

[Chorus]
Blind to the last cursed affair, pistols and countless eyes
A trail of white blood betrays the reckless route your craft is running
Feet to the sun turns into wood, dousing an ancient torch
Loiter the whole day through and lose yourself in lines dissecting
Yourself in lines dissecting
Lose yourself in lines dissecting
Lose yourself in lines dissecting
Lose yourself in lines dissecting
Lose yourself in lines
Lose yourself in lines dissecting
Lose yourself in lines dissecting
Lose yourself in lines

[Outro]
Lose yourself in lines

[Verse 1]
Is there somethin' that you wanna say
Somethin' you need to get off your chest?
I can tell you either way
The answer's yes

[Chorus]
We don't have to dance around, what's goin' down here
So maybe it's about time that you shifted into gear
Something's on your mind, well, don't be shy, I'm all ears
Come on, baby, you can say it
You now what I wanna hear

[Verse 2]
What's the matter with you, boy?
Am I getting through?
You're thinkin' what I'm thinkin' that you're thinkin'
Well, me too

[Chorus]
We don't have to dance around, what's goin' down here
So maybe it's about time that you shifted into gеar
Something's on your mind, well, don't be shy, I'm all еars
Come on, baby, you can say it
You now what I wanna hear (Hey)

[Bridge]
You don't even have to be sincere
Well, you can tell me I'm the only one
I think you know just what I wanna here
So, let it roll off your tongue

[Chorus]
We don't have to dance around, what's goin' down here
So maybe it's about time that you shifted into gear
Something's on your mind and don't be shy, I'm all ears
Come on, baby, you can say it
Tell me what I wanna hear (Hey)
We don't have to dance around, what's goin' down here
So maybe it's about time that you shifted into gear
Something's on your mind, well, don't be shy, I'm all ears
Come on, baby, you can say it
Tell me what I wanna hear

[Outro]
Come on, baby, you can say it
Tell me what I wanna hear

[Verse 1]
It wasn’t just like a movie
The rain didn’t soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
There's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I, I still love you but I can’t

[Chorus]
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you bad but it’s come down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah

[Verse 2]
The picture frame is empty
It’s black and white, you’re smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation, we’re so sure of everything
Everything we thought we’d always have
I'm lost in the sound of it
The here and the now comes in
Seems like I’m becoming
Part of your past

[Chorus]
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you bad but it’s come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

[Bridge]
And there’s so much that I can’t touch
You’re all I want but it’s not enough this time
And I can feel you like you’re slipping through my hands
And I’m so scared of how this ends

[Chorus]
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you bad but it’s come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you bad but it’s comin' down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah
There was one thing
I knew would never leave me

[Outro]
It wasn’t just like a movie
The rain didn’t soak through my clothes
Down to my skin

[Verse 1]
Like tears in my eyes
We both know
We drifted apart
A long time ago
I hate to say it
It's sad but it’s true
I know what you're feeling
'Cause I’m feeling it too

[Pre-Chorus]
I knew you wanted to go (ah)
But you didn't leave me
So you know what I'm doing now (ah)
It's not that easy

[Chorus]
But it's alright
It's okay
Don't know why
But it happens everyday
People change
And sometimes
Love just goes away
Oh, oh
Sometimes love just goes away

[Verse 2]
Stay for a while
Take this sweet time
I finally decided
To leave this behind
Don't know really when
Just know that it’s gonе
Yeah, love doesn’t stay
Whеre it doesn't belong

[Pre-Chorus]
I knew you wanted to go (ah)
But you didn’t leave me
So you know what I'm doing now (ah)
It's not that easy

[Chorus]
But it's alright
It’s okay
Don't know why
But it happens everyday
People change
And sometimes
Love just goes away
Oh, oh
Sometimes love just goes away
Oh, oh
Sometimes love just goes away

[Outro]
Don't know what to say
Sometimes love just goes away
Sometimes love just goes away

[Verse 1]
We hurt each other, showin' our true colors
But words are stones and hearts are glass
You break mine 'bout as bad as I break yours

[Hook]
Everybody's gonna hurt you
We just gotta find the ones worth hurtin' for

[Verse 2]
Hate is pretty, as I was when I was twenty
Sometimes you're weak, sometimes you're mean
Sometimes I hate you, but I always love you more

[Hook]
Everybody's gonna hurt you
You just gotta find the ones worth hurtin' for

[Verse 3]
We scream and cuss and mess it up
We lose and win and lose again
We make each other better
Through the bad, we learn to weather any storm

[Hook]
Everybody's gonna hurt you
And I know I found the one worth hurtin' for

[Verse 4]
I'll stay mad until you make me laugh
And i forgive what I was mad about
It ain't always easy, but I ain't never bored

[Hook]
Everybody's gonna hurt you
You just gotta find the ones worth hurtin' for

[Bridge]
We scream and cuss and mess it up
We lose and win and lose again
We make each other better
Through the bad, we learn to weather any storm

[Hook 2]
And everybody's gonna hurt you
And I know I found the one worth hurtin' for
Everybody's gonna hurt you
And I'll be damned if I desert you
And no one's ever gonna love you more

[Outro]
Yeah, everybody's gonna hurt you
And baby, Im the one worth hurtin' for

[Verse 1]
I knew that you were out there
I knew that you would come
The patience is a hard thing to find
When you can't find the one
Yeah, I've been hurt and I've been burned
When you finally came along
I guess some things are just worth waiting on

[Verse 2]
Never had a problem
Finding what I need
And all I'd made most of the time
It was all about me
Took your smile for me to realize I had it wrong
I guess some things are just worth waiting on

[Chorus]
Well, I'll sit all day and wait on a sunset
It don't even matter how long
I found out when I found you, baby
Anything worth havin' is worth waiting on

[Verse 3]
Kinda like a little kid
Waits on the last day of school
Like a first kiss under an old porch light
Tryna act real cool
You're like a Sunday afternoon
Under the covers all day long
Yeah, I guess some things are just worth waiting on

[Chorus]
Well, I'll sit all day and wait on a sunset
It don't even matter how long
I found out when I found you, baby
Anything worth havin' is worth waiting on

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'll sit all day and wait on a sunset
It don't even matter how long
I found out when I found you, baby
Anything worth havin' is worth waiting on

[Outro]
Worth waiting on
Lyrics from Snippets

[Intro: Francis and the Lights]
We began after the storm inside
Lay the land, it's just the morning light
Oh my god, Ronny!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Ooh, scoop, watch me scoop
That bitch do the scoop
That bitch do what I just do
That bitch do, how they do?
Whoop, scoop, watch me scoop
That 

[?]
That bitch stop 

[?]
Jeet, woo, jeet, woo, poopity-scoop
Let me grew up in the bitch
I guess I’m gon’ get it rich
That bitch 

[?]
Whoop, scoop, watch me zoom
That bitch stop by..

[Verse 2: Ant Clemons]
Ooh, ooh, this that, this that Adam fruit
This that, this that Adam fruit
This that, this that Apple Juice
Ooh, ooh…

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Have you seen her on the dance floor?
She got the boom, shake the room
That's the lightning and the thunder
You wanna meet her, you wanna touch her
See the light in her eyes
And it starts to make you wonder

[Refrain: Jennifer Lopez]
All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man, bring him to the dance floor
Go on, let them jeans touch you while you're dancin'
It's his birthday, give him what he ask for

[Verse 2: Iggy Azaela]
They beggin' me to drop down on it

But baby knowin' that only makе me
Wanna tell all of my ladies
To gеt up on the floor and just shake it, shake it
Y'all know what I've been on, y'all know that I've been on
Queen Big Booty Iggy, now find me a throne to sit on
Girls with the cheeks, put 'em hands in the air
Then pop that, pop, let 'em know that you in here
Y'all know what I've been on, y'all know that I've been on
Queen Big Booty Iggy, now find me a throne to sit on
Girls with the cheeks, put 'em hands in the air
Then pop that, pop, let 'em know that you in here

Throw up your hands if you love a big booty

[Refrain: Jennifer Lopez]
All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man, bring him to the dance floor

Let me show you how to do it
I thought coming back home would close the distance

But now we're just close and distant

Because I stepped out and went to your old assistant

I'm sorry but she needed assistance

You know how I am I'm so consistent

You know how I'm so persistent

You should hear me out but that would require you to shut up and listen

New guy but you know something is missing

And the other day at your crib either we did or we didn't

You think you broke your commitment

Is he your man though? I mean either he is or he isn't
Or maybe I'm tripping

You know that relationship is in shambles and

You lеft and had to break fast now you out here scrambling

You got mе rambling

[Chorus]
Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seats
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seats
All eyes on me, all eyes on me

[Verse 1]
Are you feeling nervous? Are you having fun?
It's almost over, it's just begun
Don't overthink this, look in my eye
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Come on in, the water's fine

[Pre-Chorus]
We're going to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody
Wе're going to go where еverybody knows
Everybody knows

[Chorus]
Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah
Hands down, pray for me
Heads down now, pray for me
Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me

[Verse 2]
Are you feeling nervous? Are you having fun?
It's almost over, it's just begun
Don't overthink this, look in my eye
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Come on in, the water's fine

[Verse 3]
You say the ocean's rising like I give a shit
You say the whole world's ending, honey, it already did
You're not gonna slow it, Heaven knows you tried
Got it? Good, now get inside

[Pre-Chorus]
We're going to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
We're going to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows

[Chorus]
Come on, get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Come on, get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seats
All eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah
Hands down, pray for me
Heads down now, pray for me
I said, get your fuckin' hands up
Get up, get up
I'm talking to you, get the fuck up

[Chorus]
Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Hey, fuckin' get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah
Come on, hands down, pray for me
Heads down now, pray for me
I said get your fuckin' hands up
Get—
All eyes on me, all eyes on me

Moment tough, it caused the anxiety
I'm flyin' home, I'm checkin' my money there, no

I got caught with pussy on my dick, that was a rookie mistake
And my bitch sped it off, I tried to

'Cause you know we live that
And even though I did that, and 

[?] to be scared for another nigga to hit that

She probably fucked some niggas, she gon' take it to the grave
She probably fucked 'em niggas that was really fuckin' paid
She probably fucked them niggas that was jumping on the stage
She probably left yo' crib and got fucked the same day

[Refrain]
What you say? Ayy
I would say I'd never worry, but I do as much as you

[Chorus]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday
Roman holiday, a Roman holiday

[Verse 1]
You done? You tight? You suck at life?
You don't want a round three? You done suffered twice
Worship the queen and you might could pass
Keep it real, these chickens couldn't wipe my-
Anyway, stylist, go get Bvlgari
I am the ultimate Svengali
You, you chickens can't even spell that
You, you girls bugging, repel that
Let me tell you this, sister
I am, I am colder than a blister
'Cause my flow's so sick, and I'm a lunatic
And this can't be cured with no Elixir
'Cause y'all know who the-, what the- I do
I done put the pressure to every thug I knew
Quack, quack to a duck and a chicken too
Put the hyena in a freakin' zoo (Pew)

[Chorus]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday
Roman holiday, a Roman holiday

[Verse 2]
Witch, twitch
Bitch, godmother's right, this is World War Six
This right here might make a chick die
And this right here is gonna make a chick cry
And if we being honest, I am such a great guy
And this what I do when a chick breaks flock

[stuttering]
I'mma put her in a dungeon under, under
No, them birds ain't eating, they dying of hunger
Mother, I me, who is this? (Oh)
And yes, maybe just a touch of Tourette's
Get my wigs, Terrence, go and get my beret

[Chorus]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday
Roman holiday, a Roman holiday

Come all ye faithful

They must be smokin' a couple of OZ's
They want the outline, I give them a goatee
Godmother, they talking about me

Them chickens must be smokin' a couple of OZ's
A-buh-buh-buh now give then a goatee

[Chorus]

Girl, you know I run a love game, never play Uno
You wanna leave, follow me to the two-door
Rock your culo, love it when you call me your papi chulo
I got a thing for you, you got a thing for me
Heard she kiss the Milky Way and bring to life your fantasies
You're sweeter than Mama's homemade Kool-Aid
Touch it, then make the seas split two ways
You love it, I do too, girl, don't play
I'm just waitin' to hear you say

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Let's hit the sweet spot, oh, I, I, I, I

And makes you feel like everybody need to have it this sweet
Baby, just a hit, just speak, I got your candy, shawty
Come around, give it to you that deep
Ooh, don't you get me started, hit the afterparty all night
You done ran into a freak that'll take you home
Make you moan, watch the throne
Yeah, lil mama, I'm the king of these sheets, gotta love it
Girl, you want it, you can have it, no question
Been a whole lot of rubbin' and touchin'
What you know about the candy I'm hustlin', musclin'?

Bring it back like, baby, who you rushin'?

I'll be the first to give your body sweet justice
So pack a luggage and let's, let's

All your crying won't help you now

All your crying won't help you now

But the whole time I was with you baby
Everybody, everybody knowed you weren't no good no how

You built my hopes so high
Honey, you let me down so low

Yes just one more, one more time baby, yeah
Why don't you let me, let me prove my love to you
I want to do all the little things baby
All the little things I will you ask to do
Now when I saw you this morning
Tell me, why did you walk away?
When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me, why did you walk away?

Can't believe that you don't love me
I thought our love was here to stay
Well, buzz me baby
I'll be waiting for you when you call

Buzz me, buzz me baby
Yes, I'll be waiting for you when you call
And if you forgot my number
Come on over and don't call at all

I never lied to no one
I ain't gonna lie to you
Say I'm yours forever
Every word I say is true

Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me baby
I'm like a ship that's lost at sea
If I ever gеt my arms around you
I ain't gonna let go till 1973
Buzz me, baby
I said buzz me, buzz mе, buzz me baby
Yes, I'll be waiting for you when you call
If you forgot my number
Come on over and you don't even have to call at all
Well, I feel so bad - I wonder what's wrong with me
Well, I feel so bad - I wonder what’s wrong with me
I think I'll call my baby, find out just what the matter can be

Last night I dreamed about my baby
I woke up and the tears were runnin' all down my face
Now, when I woke up - early this morning
The tears were runnin’ all down my face
You know I was dreamin', that some other man was takin' my place

I said, I dreamed about you baby
I dreamed you didn't want me 'round no more
I said, I dreamed about you baby
You know I dreamed you didn't want me round no more
Now, That's the reason I'm callin’ you this evening
Baby, tell me, ’cause I've just got to know

I’ve been worried all day long
I just don't know what to do
I've been worried all day long
You know, I just don't know what to do
You know it may sound silly to you woman
But tell me that dream was not true
People, people, people
You know what it means to be left alone
People, people, people
Don’t you know what it means to be left alone?

No letter today
Not even called on the telephone
Understand that a little lovin’
And I know that’s all in the world I need

Understandin’ and a little lovin’, baby
And I know that’s all in the world I need
Misunderstanding of a no good woman
They’ve both caused my heart to bleed

Every mornin’
The willows weep and moan for mе
Every mornin’
Those willows weep and moan for me

Thе bird sings me a little song
My baby’s caused my heart to bleed
People, people, people
Don’t you know what it means to be left alone?
People, people, people
Don’t you know what it means to be left alone?
No letter today
I ain’t got no call on my telephone
Oh
I just talked to my baby on the telephone
She said, "Stop what you're doing, come on home"

I can't hold out
I can't hold out too long
I get a real good feeling talkin' to you on the phone

She said, "Baby, you know I love you and you're my desire
You know I love you, baby, I hate to see you cry"

Can't hold out
I can't hold out too long
I get a real good feeling talkin' to you on the phone

She said, "Baby, you can run, walk or fly
You know I love you, baby, and you're my own desire"

Can't hold out
I can't hold out too long
I get a real good feeling talkin' to you on the phone
I'm gettin' up soon in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gettin' up soon in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I quit the best girl I'm lovin'
Now my friends can get in my room

I'm gonna write a letter
Telephone every town I know
I'm gonna write a letter
Telephone every town I know
If I don't find her in Mississippi
She be in East Monroe I know

I don't want no woman
Want every downtown man she meets
I don't want no woman
Want every downtown man she meets
Man 'cause no good darlin'
They shouldn't liе her on the street
I beliеve, I believe my time ain't long
I believe, I believe my time ain't long
I ain't gonna leave my baby
I ain't gonna leave my happy home

I'm gettin' up soon in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gettin' up soon in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I quit the best girl I'm lovin'
Now my friends can get in my room

I believe, I believe my time ain't long
I believe, I believe my time ain't long
I ain't gonna leave my baby
I ain't gonna leave my happy home
This is a mean old world
Try to live in by yourself
This is a mean old world
Try to live in by yourself
You can't get the one you love
Yes, you got to use somebody else

You know I hate to remember
What a fool I used to be
Yes, I hate to remember
What a fool I used to be
I give you all my loving

You know I smile to keep from worrying
I laugh to keep from crying
Yes, I smile to keep from worrying
You know I laugh to keep from crying
That's why I don't let the public know
Yes, what's on my own mind

Someday, baby
When the blood runs cold in my veins
I said someday, baby
When the blood runs cold in my vеins
You won't have to worry on me no more
'Causе my heart won't feel no pain

[Verse 1]
When the world starts to get you down
And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane
There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story (Story, story, story, oh)
(Story, story, story, oh)

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio, turn up the radio, turn, turn, turn
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Radio, turn, turn, turn, turn, radio

[Verse 2]
It was time that I opened my eyes
I'm leaving the past behind
Nothing's ever what it seems
Including this time and these crazy dreams
I'm stuck like a moth to a flame
I'm so tired of playing this game
I don't know how I got to this state
Let me out of my cage 'cause I'm dying
'cause I'm dying
When the world
When the world

Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules
Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow

Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

[Verse 1]
When the world starts to get you down
And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane
There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

[Verse 2]
It was time that I opened my eyes
I'm leaving the past behind
Nothing's ever what it seems
Including this time and these crazy dreams
I'm stuck like a moth to a flamе
I'm so tired of playing this game
I don't know how I got to this state
Lеt me out of my cage cause I'm dying

[Chorus]
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio

[Bridge]
I just wanna get in my car
I wanna go fast and I gotta go far
Don't ask me to explain how I feel
'Cause I don't wanna say where I'm going
Turn down the noise and turn up the volume
Don't have a choice 'cause the temperature's pounding
If leaving this place is the last thing I do
Then I want to escape with a person just like you
Buzzing around like a moth to a flame
I'm so sick and tired of playing this game
We gotta have fun if it's all that we do
Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules
Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow

[Outro]
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
There's something you don't need to know
Just let me turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Just let me turn up the radio
Just let me turn up the radio

[Intro: Far East Movement]
Yo, yo I'm closing down the block
Just bonkin',

Looking for a party
There's jumping, moving
With the girls, they got the party
There's bangin', 

[?]
I want to get started
Get wild, get moving (Oh yeah)

[Verse 1: Madonna]
When the world starts to get you down
And nothing seems to go your way
And the noise of the maddening crowd
Makes you feel like you're going to go insane
There's a glow of a distant light
Calling you to come outside
To feel the wind on your face and your skin
And it's here I begin my story

[Chorus: Madonna]
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

[Bridge: Madonna]
Turn down the noise and turn up the volume
Don't have a choice 'cause the temperature's pounding
If leaving this place is the last thing I do
Then I want to escape with a person just like you
Buzzing around like a moth to a flame
I'm so sick and tired of playing this game
We gotta have fun if it's all that we do
Gotta shake up the system and break all the rules
Gotta turn up the radio until the speakers blow

[Chorus: Madonna]
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Don't ask me where I wanna go
We gotta turn up the radio

'Cause it's the first time and the last time
You'll ever see me cry
Fucked it up

[Verse 1]
I think it does
You can forget about it, baby
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
Bye bye

You’ll ever see me cry
You can forget about it, baby

[Intro]
This is not a love song
Bye bye baby

[Verse 1]
I keep on waiting, anticipating
But I can't wait forever
To say you love me
You’re thinking of me
But we're never together

[Chorus]
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That’s why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
This time we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

[Verse 2]
You had your chances
All your romances
And now I just don't want you
I know I love you because I hate you
And now I'd rather haunt you

[Chorus]
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

[Verse 3]
You’re so beautiful
What makes you feel exciting?
What wakes you up inside?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That’s why it's time to say bye bye

[Chorus]
Bye bye baby bye bye
It’s your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So save it

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna keep the bright flame
Of your ego going
So I'll just stop blowing in the wind
To love you is a sin
Adiós

[Breakdown]
Uh, this is not a love song
What excites you? What turns you on?
What makes you feel good?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?

Forget your fears, forget my tears
You can forget about it, baby
Bye bye baby bye bye
You can forget about it, baby
'Cause it's the first time and the last time
You f**ked it up

[Verse 1]
Take a good long look
At a lonely house
And all the stuff I took
On my way out
I got a box an' a bag
I'm gonna hit that door
You're gonna wish me back
I'm gonna miss you more
And all this

[Chorus]
Gettin' up, fallin' down
Chewin' up, spittin' out
Guess that's half my trouble with you, boy
You're gonna realize
That I was right, you were wrong
When I'm your everything, everything and gone

[Verse 2]
You know it hurts like hell
When you cry this much
You know I wish you well
I guess we just got stuck
I tried it all
Nothing works
Trust me, baby, this is gonna hurt

[Chorus]
Gettin' up, fallin' down
Chewin' up, spittin' out
Guess that's half my trouble with you, boy
You're gonna realize
That I was right, you were wrong
When I'm your everything, everything and gone

[Chorus]
Gettin' up, fallin' down
Chewin' up, spittin' out
Watch it fall
Hit the ground
Lose it all, what you found
There's gonna come a day
And it won't be long
That you're gonna realize
That I was right
You were wrong
When I'm your everything, everything and gone
That I'm your everything and gone

[Verse 1]
Say good-bye
To not knowing when
The truth in my whole life began
Say good-bye
To not knowing how to cry
You taught me that

[Chorus]
And I'll reme-
I'll remember
I'll remember
I'll remember
I'll remember happiness (Remember)

[Verse 1]
Say good-bye
Say good-bye
Cry
You taught me that

[Chorus]
And I'll reme-
I'll remember
I'll remember
I'll remember
I'll remember happiness (I'll remember, remember)

[Outro]
Remember

[Verse 1: Madonna, Babyface]
Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)
Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
(No one around)
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's truе)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is ovеr, say good-bye

[Verse 2: Madonna, Babyface]
Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breaking my heart
(Breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
(Just make them smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
(Role that you played)
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

[Bridge: Madonna, Babyface]
All the world is a stage (World is a stage)
And everyone has their part (Has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story’d go?
How was I to know you'd break (You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart?
Say good-bye
Say good-bye

[Outro: Madonna]
The show is over, say good-bye

[Verse 1]
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

[Chorus]
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

[Intro]
Mmmm, mmmm

[Verse 1]
Say good-bye
To not knowing when
The truth in my whole life began
Say good-bye
To not knowing how to cry
You taught me that

[Chorus]
And I'll remember
The strength that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you saved me
I'll remember

[Verse 2]
Inside
I was a child
That could not mend a broken wing
Outside
I looked for a way
To teach my heart to sing

[Chorus]
And I'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you changеd me
I'll remembеr (Mmmm)

[Verse 3]
I learned
To let go
Of the illusion that we can possess
I learned
To let go
I travel in stillness

[Bridge]
And I'll remember happiness
I'll remember
Mmmmm... (I'll remember)
Mmmmm...

[Chorus]
And I'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you changed me
I'll remember

[Outro]
No, I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)
No, I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)
No, ​I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)
No, ​I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why (Mmmm..)
No, ​I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why

[Verse 1]
You think that I can't live without your love
You'll see
You think I can't go on another day
You think I have nothing
Without you by my side
You'll see, somehow, some way

[Verse 2]
You think that I can never laugh again
You'll see
You think that you destroyed my faith in love
You think after all you've done
I'll never find my way back home
You'll see, somehow, someday

[Chorus]
All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive
All on my own
I don't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see

[Verse 3]
You think that you are strong, but you are weak
You'll see
It takes more strength to cry, admit defeat
I have truth on my side
You only have dеceit
You'll see, somehow, someday

[Chorus]
All by mysеlf
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive
I'll stand on my own
I won't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see
You'll see

[Intro: Chant]
Evita, Evita, Evita

[Verse 1]
It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

[Verse 2]
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argеntina
The truth is I never lеft you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

[Verse 3]
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I shall not leave you
Though it may get harder for you to see me
I'm Argentina (I'm Argentina)
And always will be

[Verse 4]
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I shall not leave you
Though it may get harder for you to see me
I'm Argentina (I'm Argentina)
I'm Argentina

[Outro: Chant]
Don't cry for me

No llores por mí, Argentina
Mi alma está contigo
Mi vida entera te la dedico
Más no te ves, te necesito

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time

[Chorus]
No llores por mí, Argentina
Mi alma está contigo
Mi vida entera te la dedico
Más no te ves
No llores por mí, Argentina
Jamás yo te he abandonado
Aunque en silencio, mi alma te grita
Oye por siempre (Soy Argentina)
Soy Argentina

[Verse 4]
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all

Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no

[Verse 2]
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress you had to burn
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
I pray to God that it won't be long
Do you wanna go higher?

[Chorus]
There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye
(Do you wanna go higher?)

Than the power of good-bye

[Interlude]
Learn to say good-bye
I yearn to say good-bye

[Chorus]
There's nothing left to try
There's no more places to hide

There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise

Than the power of good-bye

[Verse 3]
Your heart is not, your heart is not
Your heart is not, your heart is not
Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress

[Chorus]
There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye
There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye

[Verse 2]
Do you wanna go higher?
Do you wanna go higher?

[Interlude]
Learn to say good-bye
I yearn to say good-bye

[Chorus]
There's nothing left to try
There's no more places to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye
There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye

[Interlude]
Learn to say good-bye
I yearn to say good-bye

[Verse 2]
Do you wanna go higher?
Do you wanna go higher?
Do you wanna go higher?
Do you wanna go higher?

[Intro]
You know who this is
Back at it

[Verse 1]
I was just chilling in the club me and my crew
Buying out the bar, you know how we do
And the dj let the people know teddy pain in the house
Then i locked eyes with this pretty thang
Waved at ya boy and said hey tpain
Feeling fresh got a brand new dico ball in my mouth
Grabbed her by the wrist
Had to pull her back i just wanna tell her this
Im not trying to be mean I'm not trying to be rude
But this is a strip club and baby im just almost tipped up
And i jsut want this last lap dance but only from you

[Bridge]
She started popping she started rolling
Popping that pussy 

[?]
And she turned around and she bent over
And asked me was i was really in love with a stripper
I said no but baby its possible
She bent over and she started popping more
Shawty we can go to my crib
You know just how it is
We can do this here over

[Hook]
All i need is one night
I got one rubber
Daytime friend and your late night lover
Even though your body's tight lemme show you right
All i need is one night
All i need is one night
I got one rubber
Daytime friend and your late night lover
Even though your body's tight lemme show you right
All i need is one night
All i need is one night

[Verse 2]
The spirit of Chicago
Ignores my one chance
To get it right, even when I tell them

Giving up on all the dreams I have
Giving up on all the dreams I made
I said they'd get it right

But all I needed is a shot in the arm
Telephone calls that do you harm
I'll leave you alone if you can get me home

And all the faith and healing that I can stand
Spiritual dreams I don't understand
The doctor finding evidence is not to hear

[?]

Now is one is wanted said 

[?]
Alone look alright {?}
All someonе else said

Some kind you can't еxplain
Don't understand why they get away
It's alright, we'll get em
And all I needed was a shot in the arm
Accused and I do you harm
For every hungry caterpillar everywhere is alone

Where valentine's day is as bad as payday
Spiritual dreams and love and safety
With digital and constipated minds

For our digital and constipated minds
To die in your arms
Your words forming again
We kiss very hard and wild
To rise in the dark
Like birds, preying on skin
We pray with our oxygen

And Joe, nothing is real
But we still have that feel
You're closing up the bar
And I'm warming up the car
Ten miles away

Two children of ours
They came twirling in
We laughed very hard, for a while
But they've grown very far
And tall, how we miss them
Though happy they're travelling

And Joe, nothing is real
But we still have that feel
You're closing up the bar
And I'm warming up the car
Ten miles away
We set no alarm, eyes wide
6am wake up on the farm
Slowly walk to the barn
Horse feed, you take the yarn
I'll read
I'll read

Joe nothing is real
We still have that feel
You're closing up the bar
And i'm warming up the car
10 miles away

To die in your arms
Your words forming again

[Verse 1]
Just leave me alone
And I never phone
Another mile
Of roses
She's hanging up and out
And putting on a coat
He waits a while
Door closes

[Chorus]
But he already know about her
He already knew about her
She is an an-
We already know about her
He already knew about her
She is and angel

[Break]
(So he said you were my best friend)
(

[?] what is for friend to burn why)

[Verse 2]
From the patio
He wa- watches as she goes
Her walking style
Like a willow
And now it fades to black
He's never coming back
And all the while
To the pillow

[Chorus]
But he already knew about her
He already knew about her
She is an angel
But he already knew about her
He already knew about her
She, she is an angel

[Verse 1]
Sky fits heaven, so fly it
That's what the prophet said to me
Child fits mother, so hold your baby tight
That's what my future could see

[Verse 2]
Fate fits karma, so use it
That's what the wise man said to me
Love fits virtue, so hold on to the light
That's what our future will be

[Chorus]
Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go?
I think I'll follow my heart
It's a very good place to start

[Post-Chorus]
Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as I go
Traveling, traveling
Watching the signs as I go
You've seen it all
Turned friends into strangers
But they forget to call
And after all, you felt like hanging

But now you're alone
You didn't wanna be
Watching the TV
Too little, too soon
And there's this song
In a minor key
Hey, how could it be
Such a cloudless tune?

I know there's rain
Falling somewhere, overflowing
Into this trust
We hold without ever knowing

But you
You might be the sun
Orbiting no one
Pulls me closer
Watch it rise
And I
I could be the one
Who stares too long
But if you could see yourself
Just once
Thе way that you are
Then I beliеve
That the sun is just a star

[Intro]
We started singing
We started singing
We started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
The day that I die
The day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be thе day that I die
This'll be the day that I diе
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I
This'll be the day that I
This'll be the day that I

[Chorus 2]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Outro]
We started singing
This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 1]
A long, long time ago I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew that if I had my chance
I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

[Verse 2]
Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in Rock 'n' roll?
And can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

[Verse 3]
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes (Both kicked off your shoes)
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

[Verse 4]
I was a lonely teenage bronking buck
With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck
But I knew that I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 5]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
Well, I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

[Verse 6]
Well now, in the streets the children screamed (The children screamed)
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed (The poets dreamed)
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire the most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
We started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Post-Chorus]
We started singing, We started singing
We started singing We started singing
We started singing We started singing
We started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 1]
So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But somethin' changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit, then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite, concert after concert
I was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom, therе was nowhere for me
To not go and bе seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a three, then three
Years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called The Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold

[Verse 2]
I got a letter from a fan that said he's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every letter I get
But something told me to go ahead and open it
But why would someone pray for you
When they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
At least a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watching it from a opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now, on how to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for 'cause I got the shit

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold

"Breaking news: Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour to check himself into rehab after admitting an addiction to sleep medication
We'll have more on this story as it develops"
"Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently survived a gunshot to the head in what appears to be a random drive-by shooting
Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be alienated--"
"On again/off again relationship with..."
"This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus..."
"Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire at an after-hours club, wе've learned that thе rapper Proof has been fatally shot"
"Shady/Aftermath recording artist..."
"Long-time best friend of Eminem and a member of the rap group D12"
"D12, back in the news again today..."
"Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation continue to swirl around Eminem
He insists he's just taking a break, but doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask, 'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'"
I, I should have been listening
To every word you said
Oh, what have I been missing
Wishing that you were dead?

I didn't mean to be so disturbing
So far from home
Oh, what have I been learning
By being all alone?

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing just tears you apart

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing just tears you apart

When, when we were younger
Sleep while I'm awake
I was trying to keep the door locked
And I realized, that's a mistake
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing will tear you apart

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing will tear you apart

Every little thing that you do
Seems so much better than I can do

I, I should have been listening
To every word you said

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing will tear you apart

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing will tear you apart

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing will tear you apart
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing will tear you apart

(I don't ever wanna sing this song live)

[Take a Bow]

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)

[Outro]
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
She begs me not to miss her

She says forever
To light a fuse
We could use
A day off
And a bruised road
A handful of wheel
However you might feel
Tonight is real
Tonight is real

When I forget how to talk
I sing
Won't you please
Bring that light to shine
And turn my eyes red
Unless they close
When you click
And my face gets sick
With the look stuck
Like a question un-posed
Climb aboard
The tracks of the train's arm
In my fragile family tree
Just watch me floating above
The people under me

Beware the quiet front yard
Before they were water skies
I warned you not to drive
With sharpened teeth on lies

I believe it's all because
Daddy payday is not enough
I believe it's just because
Daddy's payday was not enough

Just climb aboard
The tracks of the train's arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me float inches above
The wooden grain under me

She's a jar
A heavy lid
A pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
She begs me not to hit her

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
And, and, and
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Like a cloud, his finger explode
On the typewriter ribbon, the shadow grows
His heart's in a bowl behind the bank

And every evening when he gets home
To make his supper and eat it alone
His black shirt cries while his shoes get cold

It's just a dream he keeps having (ooh ooh)
It doesn't seem to mean anything
It's just a dream he keeps having
It doesn't seem to mean anything

One summer, a suicide
Another autumn, a traveler's guide
He hits snooze twice before he dies

And every evening when he gets home
To make his supper and eat it alone
His black shirt cries while his shoes get cold
It's just a dream he keeps having (ooh ooh)
It doesn't seem to mean anything
It's just a dream he keeps having (ooh ooh)
It doesn't seem to mean anything

He feels lucky to have you here
In his kitchen in your chair
Sometimes he forgets that you're even there

Ooh ooh
Doesn't seem to mean anything
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
(Let me try another one
Just keep rollin')

There's a whisper
I would like to breathe
Into your ear but
I'm too scared
To get that close
To you right now

There are dreams
We might have shared
And I still care
And I still love you
But you know how
I've been untrue

In the beginning
We closed our eyes
Whenever we kissed
We were surprised
To find so much inside
When I let go of your throat, sweet throttle
And clean the lash of your black belt model
Will I set the sun on a big-wheeled wagon?
I'm braggin'
I'm always in love

When I hold the cold in my jet-lagged palm
When I soak so long, I forget my mother
Will I catch the moon like a bird in a cage?
It's for you I swoon
I'm always in love

I don't get the connection
This is only a test
Hope I do my best
I hope I don't forget

Why, I wonder, is my heart full of holes?
The feeling goes, but my hair keeps growing
Will I set the sun on a big-wheeled wagon?
I'm braggin'
I'm always in love
It's a drag, I snag
I'm always in love
I'm worried
I'm always in love

*whistling*

I'm worriеd
Oh, I'm worried
Oh, I'm worried
Oh, I'm worried
I'm worriеd
Oh

(One, two, three, four
Let's roll another one)
(Same thing every time, alright
I'm ready)

Go to sleep now, my darling
I’ll try to keep the bad dreams away
Breathe now, breathe easier
And I'll think of all the right things to say

Because we made you, my darling
With the love in each of our hearts
We were a family, my darling
Right from the start

Grow up now
Please don't you grow up too fast
Be sure
To make all the good times last

Because we made you, my darling
With the love in each of our hearts
We were a family, my darling
Right from the start
Like a cloud, his fingers explode
On the typewriter ribbon, the shadow grows
His heart's in a bowl behind the bank

And every evening, when he gets home
To make his supper and eat it alone
His black shirt cries while his shoes get cold

Tried and true, oooh oooh
Tried and true, oooh oooh

I guess I'm lucky to have you here
In my kitchen in your chair
Sometimes I forget that you're even thеre

One summer, a suicidе
Another autumn, a traveler's guide
He hits snooze twice before he died

And every evening, when he gets home
To make his supper and eat it alone
His black shirt cries while his shoes get cold
Tried and true, woo oooh
Tried and true, woo oooh

Tried and true, oooh oooh
Tried and true, oooh oooh

[Verse 1]
Don't tell me to stop
Tell the rain not to drop
Tell the wind not to blow
'Cause you said so, mmm
Tell the sun not to shine
Not to get up this time, no, no
Let it fall by the way
But don't leave me where I lay down

[Chorus]
Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But please don't tell me to stop

[Verse 2]
Tell the leaves not to turn
But don't ever tell me I'll learn, no, no
Takе the black off a crow
But don't tell me I havе to go
Tell the bed not to lay
Like the open mouth of a grave, yeah
Not to stare up at me
Like a calf down on its knees

[Chorus]
Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But don't ever tell me to stop
(Don't you ever) Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
(Don't you ever) Tell me everything I'm not
But don't ever tell me to stop

[Outro]
(Don't you ever)
Please don't
Please don't
Please don't tell me to stop
(Don't you ever tell me) Don't you ever
Don't ever tell me to stop (Tell the rain not to drop)
Tell the bed not to lay

My body is a map of LA
I stand straight like an angel with a halo
Hangin' out the Hilton Hotel window
Screamin', "Hey, you, baby, let's go"
My chest, the Sierra Madre
My hips, every high and byway
That you trace with your fingertips like a Toyota
Run your hands over me like a Land Rover

[Chorus]
In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
America, America
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to you, Arcadia

[Verse 2]
My body is a map of LA
And my heart is like paper, I hate you
I'm not from the land of the palms, so I know I can't stay here
I'm not native, but
My curves, San Gabriel all day
And my lips like the fire licks the bay
If you think that you know yourself, you can come over
Lay your hands on me like you're a Land Rover

[Chorus]
In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That get the blood flowing straight to the heart of me
America, I need a miracle
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to you, Arcadia

[Outro]
They built me up three-hundred feet tall just to tear me down
So I'm leavin' with nothing but laughter, and this town
Arcadia
Findin' my way to you
I'm leavin' them as I was, five-foot-eight, Western belt
Plus the hate that they gave
By the way, thanks for that, on the way, I'll pray for you
But you'll need a miracle, America

[Verse]

Thanks, that's it
Well, I know I haven't paid my dues
And I've poured out all my love in vain
But if you haven't heard the news
Well, I'm losing interest in playing the blues

I'm still shaking, but I can't dust my broom
And my arm grows numb while I strum
And just when I thought there was nothing left to lose
Well, I'm losing interest in playing the blues

My money's gone, my car keys too
My baby's gone and so are you
Then I'm losing interest in playing the blues

Well, the sun shines wherever my childrеn are
And my blood runs deep in their hearts
And if thеy should ever happen to find you
Please don't let them lose interest in playing the blues

Please don't let them lose interest in playing the blues
Shhh
One, two, one, two, three, four

Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong

You know it’s gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Oh, we could be married
(Oh, we could be married)
(Oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy
(And then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let’s talk about it
Oh, wouldn't it be nice

Good night oh, baby
Sleep tight oh, baby
Good night oh, baby
Sleep tight oh, baby
Good night oh, baby
Sleep tight oh, baby
Good night oh, baby

Don't ask me to slow down
I don't wanna go down
You won't catch me lookin' back
'Cause people like me don't live like that
I got dreams and I got plans
It's not hard to understand
There's no bottom and no top
'Cause people like me don't ever stop now

[Chorus]
If you wanna catch up to me
You better run as fast as you can
If you wanna live up to me

[Intro: Katie Webster and B.B. King]
You know B.B.?
Yes baby
Life is hard being out here on the road by myself all the time
I know it honey, I know it
And I'm just getting tired
How do you spell it baby, how do you spell it?
T-I-D-E, tired
Yeah, I got you, I got you
Sometimes it, it makes me feel like I wanna clean up my act
But somehow I always let you men send me up this one-way road
Now I’m intelligent enough to recognize a detour sign
But I'm hard-headed
Yeah
I just go right past the detour sign and always run into a dead end
Yes, I know baby
But they always told me that
Something worth having is worth waiting for
And I have definitely been waiting a long time
Mmm hmm
But you know B?
Since I met you
I feel that all my strifes and troubles are all over in my–
Yes they are baby, I'm here with you
Because I feel like you are the man
I’m the one
That I want in my life
Someone who will treat me like the queen I am
The swamp boogie queen
I know what you mean, I'm the one you need

[Verse 1: B.B. King]
Since I met you baby
My whole life, my whole life has changed
Since I met you baby
My whole life, my whole life has changed
Everybody tells me
They all say that I'm not the same

[Verse 2: Katie Webster and B.B. King]
You know I believe that
'Cause I don't need nobody
You don't need nobody but me baby
To tell my troubles to (No, no, no, no, no)
I don't need nobody
You don't need nobody but me baby
To tell all of my troubles to (Oh Lord)
’Cause since I met you baby
Since I met you baby
All I need you is you

[Verse 3: B.B. King, Katie Webster, Both]
Since I met you baby
I’m a happy man, yes I am
I know that's real
’Cause since I met you baby
Since I met you baby
You know you've made me feel like such a happy, happy woman
I'm gonna try to please you
No doubt about it baby
In every way I can (Oh yeah)

[Verse 1]
Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
I've been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away
I’ve been swimming in the ocean
Till I'm almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can do drugs, and we can smoke weed, and we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high, and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue, and we can do E, and we can drop acid
Forever be lost, with no way homе

[Chorus]
Yeah, we can run and we can hidе, but we won't find the answers
If you go down, then you’ll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul, then we should travel all together
And make the devil pray

[Verse 2]
Mother Mary, can't you help me?
'Cause I've gone astray
All the angels that were around me
Have all flown away
The ground beneath my feet's getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on, but I'm getting weaker
Watch me disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can do drugs, and we can smoke weed, and we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high, and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue, and we can do E, and we can drop acid
Forever be lost, with no way home

[Chorus]
Yeah, we can run and we can hide, but we won't find the answers
If you go down, then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul, then we could travel all together
And make the devil pray

Ooh, ooh, sing hallelujah
Ooh, save my soul
Ooh, ooh, the devil’s here to fool ya
Until my story’s told
I said ooh, ooh, sing hallelujah
Ooh, save my soul

First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard
I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was
I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees
Alone in the dark
I was blind to your game
You fired a shot in my heart

Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on

Put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

So lеt the fire burn, this music is bumping
We'rе gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

[Verse 2]
Behind the curtain of the New World Order
It's not platinum encrypted corners

It's not Bieber or LeBron
Clinton or Obama
Or anyone you love to hate

You know that everything that glitters ain't gold
So let the music take you out of control
It's time to feel it in your body and soul
C'mon, let's go
We're gonna dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati

You can't buy this at no luxury store
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
There's a place you gotta go
Before I let you take it all
It's like a drug, it should be illegal
Baby, you should get down low
And drink my precious alcohol
You look so thirsty, I think you need it

[Chorus: Natalia Kills & Madonna]
Kiss it better, kiss it better
Don't it taste like holy water?
Make it wetter, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, kiss it better

[Verse 2: Madonna & Natalia Kills]
I can teach you all the things you don't know
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)
It's rare like mink, it's something you wanna own
(Bitch, get off my pole)
(Bitch, get off my pole)

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
There's something you gotta hit
It's sacred and immaculate
I can let you in heaven’s door
I promise you it's not a sin
Find salvation deep within
We can do it here on the floor

[Chorus: Natalia Kills & Madonna]
Kiss it better, kiss it better
Don't it taste like holy water?
Make it wetter, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, make it wetter
Don't it taste like holy water?
Kiss it better, kiss it better

[Bridge: Madonna]
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
Bless yourself and genuflect
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
If you like it, please confess
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?
Bless yourself and genuflect
Don't it taste like holy water, like holy water?
Don't it taste like holy water?

[Verse 1]
Do we need to start a war?
Do we need to take a side?
If we open up our eyes
Realize that we are blind
Is it all worth fighting for?

[Pre-Chorus]
It all comes down to
Who's wrong or right
Who's black or white
It doesn't matter what you're bleeding for
Straight or bi, your God or mine
It doesn't matter underneath it all

[Chorus]
'Cause we're only here to love
Like there's no tomorrow
So let's live each moment like
Our time is only borrowed

[Drop: Avicii]

[Verse 2]
Do we need to build a bomb?
Do we need to fire a gun?
If you have to stand your ground
It's a war that can't bе won
Is it all worth dying for?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It all comes down to
Who's rich or poor
Virgin or whore
It doesn't mattеr what you're praying for
Death or life, your truth or mine
It doesn't matter underneath it all

[Chorus]
'Cause we're only here to love
Like there's no tomorrow
So let's live each moment like
Our time is only borrowed

[Drop: Avicii]

[Snippet]
Don’t know what it is about today that made me think the way I am Maybe it’s the way these Alabama pines swing
It reminds me of how you dance
Now I’m pulling out your pictures while I’m pulling on a fifth
Why the hell I race to forget you
Got me remembering
Where’d you go now baby
No, you can’t be that far
'Cause all that I been feeling lately is you creeping back on my heart Thought I put enough miles down to get you going by now
But now I hear you saying no so fast
Thought I’d finally drink you gone
So I’d try to drink u back, tried to drink u back

'Bout to slide out
Jump up in the coupe, drop the top back
Yeah, we 'bout to ride out

Got them chopsticks, on God, we 'bout to slide out
Is you slidin' or not, is you ridin' or not?

[Verse: Matt Champion & Dom McLennon]
Are you okay with the way life going? (Going, going, going)
Do you feel safe in their arms or are you bluffing? (Why you bluffing?)
Brand new paintjob with rims on it (Screen paint)
Brand new partner, got feelings for 'em (Alright)
Brand new house with the down payment on it (Run it up, run it up)
Nice front lawn, mailman knock on the doorstep (On the doorstep)
It'd be a shame if someone ruffled up the perfect (Way too perfect)
Not made for perfect, I'm a fray mistake and I'm afraid you used to leave
Mosaics on the block, memories is skipping rocks
Mama late, mama ain't raise no bitch, mama ain't raise no bitch

[Refrain: Matt Champion]
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh

[Chorus: Matt Champion]

Around, around again (Around, around again)
Around, around again (Around, around again)
Mr. and Mrs. Perfect
Mr. and Mrs. Perfect
Mr. and Mrs. Perfect
Bitch, I'm Mr. Perfect
Ahh—
In a vacuum like a plane at night
Nothing there except a flashing light
Hands are clammy but the air is dry
Couldn't we leave it for another time?

My out of shape is bent
I never go to bed
Is everything so tense?
Inside a house, pay rent
Like something else I said
Could change it up instead
Of some other thing I was wondering

Crank the roll to take a little piece
Chew it down to muffle out the heat
Must be something deep inside of me
Something nobody will ever see

My out of shape is bent
I never go to bed
Is everything so tense?
Inside a house, pay rent
Like something else I said
Could change it up instead
Of some other thing I was wondering

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just can't take it
Sometimes I just can't take it and it isn't alright
I'm not gonna make it
And I think my shoe's untied (Ooh-ooh)
I'm like a broken record
I'm like a broken record and I'm not playin' right
Drocer nekorb a ekil mi
'Til you tell me on your heavenly phone

[Chorus]
You've got a higher power
Got me singin' every second, dancin' every hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know, ooh

[Verse 2]
This boy is electric
This boy is electric and you're sparklin' like the universe connected
And I'm buzzin' night after night after night (Oh-oh)
This joy is electric
This joy is electric and you're circuiting through
I'm so happy that I'm alive
Happy I'm alive at the same time as you

[Chorus]
'Cause you've got a higher power
Got me singin' every second, dancin' every hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know
(I wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)

[Outro]
When for so long I'd been down on my knees
Then your love song saved me over and over
For so long I'd been down on my knees
'Til your love song floats me on
Ee-oh, oh-oh
Let's hear it!
Look who came to sing!
Louder!
Are you ready for ’em?
Well, let 'em know you're welcoming ’em, come on!
They can't hear ya!
Let's introduce 'em now, the fabulous Beach Boys!

We had a song out
We had a song out last summer that was number one six or seven weeks in a row here in Sacramento
Now that's good
And it goes like this

If everybody had an ocean across the U.S.A
Then everybody'd be surfin' like Californ-i-a
You'd seem 'еm wearing their baggies, Huarachi sandals too
A bushy bushy blondе hairdo, surfin' U.S.A

Let's go

You'd catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar, Ventura County line
(Inside, outside U.S.A., inside, outside U.S.A.)
Santa Cruz and Trestle, Australia's Narrabeen
(Inside, outside U.S.A., inside, outside U.S.A.)
All over Manhattan and down Doheny Way
(Inside, outside U.S.A., inside, outside)
Everybody's gone surfin', surfin' U.S.A
We'll all be planning that route, we're gonna take real soon
We're waxing down our surfboards, we can't wait for June
We'll all be gone for the summer, we're on surfari to stay
You tell the teacher we're surfin', surfin' U.S.A

Let's go

Haggerties and Swamies, Pacific Palisades
(Inside, outside U.S.A., inside, outside U.S.A.)
San Onofre and Sunset, Redondo Beach L.A
(Inside, outside U.S.A., inside, outside U.S.A.)
All over La Jolla at Wa'imea Bay
(Inside, outside U.S.A., inside, outside)
Everybody's gone surfin', surfin' U.S.A

Well

Everybody's gone surfin', surfin' U.S.A
Everybody's gone surfin', surfin' U.S.A
Yeah, everybody's gone surfin', surfin' U.S.A

[Verse 1]
Escalator going down, stairs going up
Feeling shy and walking slow around a little much
I was thinking about you today
Something to do with the reason you never say
What’s keeping you

[Chorus]
There’s a car in the street
Passenger seat covered in magazines
Happy to be sitting here endlessly, in front of the heat
Blowing out of the thing pointed at me

[Verse 2]
Maybe I said something wrong, it’s no surprise
It was circling my mind so long, tears in my eyes
There was broken windows, but I don’t remember why
Hope you find a time to let it out, don’t wanna pry

[Chorus]
There’s a car in the street
Passenger seat covered in magazines
Happy to be sitting here endlessly in front of the heat
Blowing out of the thing pointed at me

[Snippet]
Who's that sexy motherfucker over there?
That's me, standin' in the mirror
What's that icy thing hangin' 'round my neck? Mmm
That's gold, show me some respect (Oh-ah)

[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
Therе's no time for tears
I'm just sitting herе planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn

[Verse 1]
Hanging on tenterhooks
Faking some tender looks
Trying to look through the crowd
Everyone talking so loud
Walls are sending on me
Listening to other things
Found myself trying out
Feel myself turning to dust

[Chorus]
Chilling on aspirin
Trying to be water rushing through
Like I can't help myself
Like I could even turn
Ready to give in
I could be water if I do
Give me no place to go
Give me no water, no

[Verse 2]
Taking my middleground
Hang my feet on the ground
Let my head drift away
Thinking of something to say
Washing machine will spin
Space will move slowly
All the while being now
Everything being around

[Chorus]
Chilling on aspirin
Trying to be water rushing through
Like I can't help myself
Like I could even turn
Ready to give in
I could be water if I do
Give me no place to go
Give me no water, no
… We will, we will rock you
… We will, we will rock you (Britney: oooh)
… Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day
You got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Kickin' your can all over the place
Singin'
… We will we will rock you (Britney: ooh)
(Britney: I said) we will, we will rock you (Beyoncé: oh, yeah)
… Buddy you're a young man hard man
Fightin' in the street gonna take on the world some day
Blood on your face
Big disgrace
Wavin' your banner all over the place, yeah
… We will, we will rock you
(Beyoncé: We will rock you, yeah)
We will, wе will rock you (Pink: Oh, yeah)
… Buddy you're an old man poor man
Pleadin' with your еyes gonna make you some peace some day
You got mud on your face
Big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place
(Beyoncé: Back into your place)
… We will, we will rock you
(Pink: we don't know, we don't know)
(Britney: I said, WE WILL rock you)
We will, we will rock you
(Pink: Yeah, come on)
We will, we will rock you
(Beyonce: oh, oh, rock you, oh hey yeah)
We will, we will rock you
(Beyoncé & Pink: Will rock you)
We will, we will rock you...

[Verse 1]
I don't know how to say it
I think about it every day
If nothing lasts forever
How come it doesn't feel that way?
This organ in my body
I′m always trying to press it down
Ended underneath it
Don't know how to get around

[Chorus]
Not that it's so essential
Steady living without
Is it something I dream of?
Feel better when it′s cold out

[Verse 2]
Have a conversation
Only ever one or two
My pencil tip is broken
Breathe in another moment
I wanna be like water too

[Chorus]
Not that it′s so essential
Steady living without
Is it something I dream of?
Feel better when it's cold out

Not that I'd wanna change it
Sun is shining on you
It's only somеthing I dream of

Feel better whеn it′s cold out
Feel better when it's cold out
Feel better when it′s cold out

[Verse 1]
I know, I know, I know why
You been speaking softly
Running down my cheek and from my eyes
Dried up
That one I’m still thinking of

[Verse 2]
I was just a little less
Secretive about it
I could close my eyes and you could curse
What’s new
He's telling me what to do

[Chorus]
Every night I try to sleep
Every day I wake up
Always there inside of me
Always laying next to you
Inside of the living room
Outside in the sunshine
Windows open, air is cool
If only for a little

[Verse 3]
Breathing in and breathing out
Want to pull it over
Something that I can’t forget about
It’s no use
It’s crushing me longer than it’s supposed to
(Holding mе closer than you ought to)

[Verse 4]
Staring at me on the phonе
Staring through the TV
Even with all the worthless things I got
It’s no use
That I’ll never stop loving you

[Chorus]
Every night I try to sleep
Every day I wake up
Always there inside of me
Always laying next to you
Inside of the living room
Outside in the sunshine
Windows open, air is cool
If only for a little

[Verse 1]
Feels like everybody knows something I don't know
Drag my feet across the street in the evening glow
There's a place I gotta be, can't remember where
Wonder if I didn't show, would they notice it?

[Chorus]
(Hey, where are you?)
I could be there in a minute
Just a quick sec, here, a minute
Got a couple texts, lemme send it
One or two at most, that's my limit

[Verse 2]
I can't wait to get back home, cause it's suppertime
People ask me how I am and I'll say I'm fine
The computer screen is blue, pixels turning green
I don't know, please come around, tell me how I seem

[Chorus]
(Hey, where are you?)
I could be there in a minute
Just a quick sec, here, a minute
Got a couple things I should finish
If it don't work, then I'm quitting

[Verse 1]
What if things move quickly, shouldn't they be slow?
Bucket full of chicken and people I don't know
Careless with my memories, careful with my feet
I should be more present, should sit in it with ease
In my brand new seat

[Chorus]
Wait here, I'll come around
No, first, but anyhow
Eyes looking at the ground, shaken out
You said to me aloud
Baby don't have a cow
I don't make any sound

[Verse 2]
No I don't trust you if you've got bank accounts
Damn I had my fly open all day walking round
It's not really so bad, I wish that I could tell
If you wanna chat, you can reach me on my cell
Hope you're doing well

[Chorus]
Wait here I'll come around
No first but anyhow
Eyеs looking at the ground shaken out
You said to me aloud
Baby don't havе a cow
I don't make any sound

[Verse 1]
I knew
At least on the days I'm with you
Trying to be of some use
Maybe in a second or two
We could take walk in our valley

[Chorus]
Picking up the phone and then I'm dialing
Looking in your eyes and then I'm smiling
I'll be here a while, waiting mindless
Shaking in a panic, just breathe

[Verse 2]
That's what she said to me
Trying to put me at ease
I could always fall asleep
I just never figured how to time it

[Chorus]
Picking up the phone and then I'm dialing
Looking in your eyes and then I'm smiling
I'll be here a while, waiting mindless
If you read my thoughts, I wouldn't mind it

[Verse 3]
Set it on the table for a moment
Tell you that I love you so you know it
I'll be here a while, waiting mindless
Everybody choking, do the Heimlich
Feeling pretty heavy on my eyelids
If you wanna talk then please come find me
I'll be here a while, waiting mindless
If you read my thoughts, I wouldn't mind it
(Mind it)

[Verse 1]
Wait a sec
Trying to get it out but it hasn't left
Trying to settle down, but I haven't yet
Drinking from a glass, probably full of lead
Everyone I know bathing and they're dead

[Chorus]
Never nothing useful
I don't need a few, I got you
But I'm gonna spend it
Just like God intended

[Verse 2]
Feeling like I do with my wallet out
Just about as much as when I'm by myself
Probably smile more in an empty house
Only you and me, nothing on the shelf

[Chorus]
Never nothing useful
I don't need a fill, I got you
And I'm gonna spend it
Cause I feel horrendous

[Intro]
He hasn't slept in probably seven days

[Chorus]
Yeah, these hoes might get naked
Mad at myself, I ain't make it
Baby Keem way too impatient, yeah
I am Cuban and Jamaican, maybe a little bit Haitian
Baby Keem way too impatient, yeah

[Verse]
I'm 'bout to start in this bitch (Let's go)
Them I'm 'bout to park in this bitch
Arch that ass up, I'm Noah's arching this bitch (Arching it)
A Shark in this bitch (Sharking it)
I might pull a fast one (Might pull a fast one)
She just got her ass done, now I'm elated
But, can't get her feet done
Corona put all of these hoes in the matrix
I wa' gon' say shit (I wa' gon' say shit)
But, you lookin' corny now boo (But, you lookin' corny now boo)
I gotta show you what's blue (I gotta show you what's blue)
Jump yo' ass deep in that pool (Jump yo' ass deep in that pool)
Selling pussy out the suitcase
Trade the pussy for a Bokay
Without makeup, bitches two-faced
All you sugar bitches give me toothaches

[Chorus]
Yeah, these hoes might get naked
Mad at myself, I ain't make it
Baby Keem way too impatient, yeah
I love Cuban and Jamaican, maybe a little bit Haitian
Baby Keem way too impatient, yeah

[Outro]
He hasn't slept in probably seven days

[Verse 1]
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, "Cry, girl"
When I saw you and that girl walking around

[Chorus]
I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me, child and all
So you see, I love you so much
That I don't want to watch you leave me, baby
Most of all, I just don't, I just don't want to be free, no

[Verse 2]
I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips now, baby
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah

[Chorus]
And baby, and baby
I would rather, I would rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, see you walk away from me, yeah
Baby, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind now

[Spoken Intro: Elmo & Katy Perry]
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Hi, Elmo!
Oh, oh, hi Miss Katy!
Are you ready to play dress up?
Oh? Dress up?
You said you wanted to play dress up
Well, don't you?
Uh, well, I, uh
Come on Elmo, don't you wanna play?
I, uh, buh, uh...
Elmo!

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
You wanna play, so I wore dress up clothes
Then you ran away, left me here in this pose
How am I supposed to play with you?

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
You're up, then you're down
You're running around
You're fast then you're slow
You stop, then you go
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
I'm starting to doubt
You
You don't really wanna play, no
You just really wanna go

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
Used to laugh while we played
Now you just run away
Didn't know, that you were gonna change

[Chorus: Elmo & Katy Perry]
Elmo's up, Elmo's down
Always running around
You're fast then you're slow
You stop, then you go
He's hot and he's cold
You're yes then you're no
He's in and he's out
I'm starting to doubt

[Bridge: Katy Perry]
Someone stop that monster
Gotta chase him all over
How to catch him, I wonder
He's too quick for me

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Elmo]
You
You don't really wanna play, no
You
You just really wanna go, go
Elmo's up, Elmo's down
Always running around
You're fast then you're slow
You stop then you go

[Spoken Outro: Katy Perry & Elmo]
Elmo, do you wanna play?
Well, Elmo is playing Ms. Katy
Elmo's playing tag
You're it! Ah ha ha ha
Not again!

[Verse 1]
Take a second look in the mirror
And see who you really are
You've got something different about you
That makes you a super star
Don't act like you don't know
How everyone says
Face the facts, you've made it now
So let go of your fears

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
In yourself
You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
You're the best

[Chorus]
Glow in the dark
Light all the haters
Be who you are
Because love is all that matters

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you take of a leap of faith
And hope you land on solid ground
You'll never know if you don't try
And you'll be stuck in the lost and found
As/rise above the groping broken crowd
And find the strength inside
Hear the voice from within
Cause you only got one life

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
In yourself
You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
You're the best

[Chorus]
Glow in the dark
Light all the haters
Be who you are
Because love is all that matters

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
In yourself
You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
You're the best

[Bridge]
They try to take you down
So far that you'll never be found
It's time to turn around

They'll try to mess you up
But you're never gonna give up
You're so high! Like a star!

[Chorus]
Glow in the dark
Light all the haters
Be who you are
Because love is all that matters

[Post-Chorus]
You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
In yourself
You gotta believe-eh-eh-eh-eh
You're the best

[Outro]
Take a second look in the mirror
And see who you really are...

[Chorus]
Well, I hear my train a comin'
Hear my
Hear my train a comin'

[Interlude]
Ayy ayy ayy yeah-eah

[Verse]
Well, I
Wait around the train station
Waitin' for that train
Take me, take me
Take me away
From this
Lonesome town
Lonesome town
Too bad you don't love me no more, girl
Too bad your people put me down
Hey, hey, hey

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Tears burnin' me
Tears burnin' me in my eyes
Way down
Way down in my soul
Tears burnin' me way down in my heart
Yeah
Too bad you don't love me no more, girl
Too bad you and me had to part
Had to part

[Chorus]
Well, I hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Well, I hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'

[Chorus]
This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

[Verse 1]
Don't look back, keep your head held high, don't ask them why
Because life is short, and before you know, you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking, don't hold on to the past
Well, that's too much to ask

[Chorus]
This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenevеr I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do thеy always say

[Verse 2]
Live and learn, well, the years, they flew and we never knew
We were foolish then, we would never tire
And that little fire is still alive in me, it will never go away
Can't say goodbye to yesterday (Can't say goodbye)

[Chorus]
This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

[Verse 3]
No regrets, but I wish that you were here with me
Well, then there's hope yet, I can see your face In our secret place
You're not just a memory, say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)

[Chorus]
This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy
This used to be our playground (Used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
...
In my head loud, but I'm soft spoken
Demons follow me, but I'm God chosen
I'm off of that Hen', got me seein' slow motion
I can't let my guard down, I show no emotion

[Chorus]
Penthouse in Vegas, lifestyle, vacation
I don't...

[Verse 1]
Just one kiss on my lips
Was all it took to seal the future
Just one look from your eyes
Was like a certain kind of torture
Once upon a time
There was a boy
And there was a girl
Just one touch from your hands
Was all it took to make me falter

[Chorus]
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, we seal our destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love

[Verse 2]
Just one smile on your face
Was all it took to change my fortune
Just one word from your mouth
Was all I needed to be certain
Once upon a time
There was a boy
There was a girl
Hearts that intertwine
They lived in a different kind of world

[Chorus]
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, we seal our destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love

[Interlude]
Just one kiss
Just one touch
Just one look

[Chorus]
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, we seal our destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, we seal our destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love

[Outro]
Just one kiss (Five)
Just one touch (Four)
Just one look (Three)
Just one love (Two)
(One)

[Verse]
Ooh, is the place, I never wanna stop
Don't think of yesterday, and I don't look at the clock
It's like ridin' on the wind, and it never goes away
Which is everything I'm in, got to have it every day

[Chorus]
Music, music, music, music, music, music, music, music, music
Music, makes the people come together
Music, mix the bourgeoise and the rebel

[Verse]
Ooh is a place, I never wanna stop
Don't think of yesterday, and I don't look at the clock
It's like ridin' on the wind, and it never goes away
Which is everything I'm in, got to have it every day

[Chorus]
Music, makes the people come together
Music, mix the bourgeoise and the rebel

[Instrumental break]

[Verse]
Ooh, is the place, I never wanna stop

Music, makes the people come together
Music, mix the bourgeoise and the rebel
Music, makes the people come together
Music, mix the bourgeoise and the rebel

Hey, hey, yes, I was made to love her

I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I knew I loved her even then
(Hey, hey, yes, I was made to love her)

You know my papa disapproved it
My mama hoo-hooed it
But I told them time and time again
(Hey, hey, yes, I was made to love her)
Don't you know I was made to love her
Build my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey
(Hеy, hey, yes, I was made to lovе her)

She's been my inspiration
Showed me appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
(Hey, hey, yes, I was made to love her)
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
(Hey, hey, yes, I was made to love her)
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
(Hey, hey, yes, I was made to love her)
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, yes, I was made to love her)

My little baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
And the love bug bit me
And I had the fever with each passing year
(Hey, hey, yes, I was made to love her)

If the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
I know I'll still be standing there
(Hey, hey, yes, I was made to love her)
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her
Hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, yes, I was made to love her)
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, aah

Ooo-oo-ooh, oo-ooh
Hey, hey, yes, I was made to love her
Ooo-oo-ooh, oo-ooh
Hey, hey, yes, I was made to love her
Lyrics From Snippet

Pussy, shoot at the pussy, pussy
Shoot at the pussy

Fuck he thought? My brother the plug
Anyone stop, I love em’ a lot, but…

[Verse 2?]
I need one (Need)
I catch me an opp when I see one (I see it)
That ain’t no Glock, that’s a baby gun (Bitch)
Bitches leavin’ breakfast in my mouth (Like what?)

Only time I get close to a bitch (Is when?)
Is in the bed when I’m breakin’ em’
He say he gon’ pop me, whеn he see me

Flight to Denver for Boat, not the rookies
Bang on a pussy, bang on a pussy, bang…

Gang of niggas in the hollow, like they shootin’ dice (For real)
But they not nice (Oh), I won’t tell you twice
Aye, I heard your new bitch want some more, nigga
Put her on the floor, nigga
Imma break the headboard
Aye what it’s hittin’ on? Bitch watch yo’ voice tone

Overnight success don't belong here
Imma get on ya
I been doin’ shit, used to dream on, ya
I’m not finna lie, this my 

[?], ya

Niggas always wanna act like they know me
Call me by my first name, like we homies
Got a new bitch, she a trophy
Truth be told, I’m the youngest nigga holdin’ shit down
Blockin’ out hate, like a goalie
All thanks to the game, cause they mauled me

[Bridge]
I did it alone
I just wanna thank everybody from home
Standin’ with the kid, even whеn I was wrong
I just wanna watch baby girl in her thong, break it down

[Chorus]
Break it down, brеak it, dump it down
Break it down, down
Break it down, dump it, it, dump it down
Break it down, down
Downtown, bring that shit around, like a sound bomb
One more time, baby girl a dime, she a dime, dime
Break it down, break it, dump it down
Break it down, down
Break it down, dump it, it, dump it down
Break it down, down
Downtown, bring that shit around, like a sound bomb
Break it down, down
Break it down, dip it, dump it down

[Verse 2]
Stop tryna’ take my credit (Stop)
I done read so much hate on Reddit (Ah)
Tryna’ figure out who said it (Oh)
Negativity, gas me up, unleaded
How I managed to make it this fuckin’ far? I don’t know
Sometimes I’m stuck on a dark road
Sometimes I’m lost, sometimes I’m cold
Sometimes I hunt, sometimes I’m on top
I know these niggas wishin’ that the phone call dropped
I know not to take it personally
Why would I get mad when I’m rich finally
I can break that shit down

[Chorus]
Break it down, break it, dump it down
Break it down, down
Break it down, dump it, it, dump it down
Break it down, down
Downtown, bring that shit around, like a sound bomb
One more time, baby girl a dime, she a dime, dime
Break it down, break it, dump it down
Break it down, down
Break it down, dump it, it, dump it down
Break it down, down
Downtown, bring that shit around, like a sound bomb
Break it down, down
Break it down, dip it, dump it down

Never forget, shoulda went on ya birthday

You was on that, I was on that bullshit
You was back home, from that school shit
Claimin’ that you miss me, but I ain’t tryna’ hear shit
Back to the story though, stop actin’ rhetorical
Everything I bought, take it back
You ain’t want it, no
Tell me everything that you want and you need to know

[?] My stone gettin' 

[?]
Unh, you left me, you keep cryin’, you left me
Girl, shut ya mouth, I still think that you sexy
You my main bitch, keep your neck lookin’ icy
Nigga touch you, that nigga gotta fight me, for real
I know I don’t do everything that I say sometimes
I know I make promises, but I promise you mine
I know you no longer love me, but can you act this…

[Verse 1]
It's very far away
It takes about a half a day to get there
If we travel by my, dragonfly
No it's not in Spain
But all the same you know, it's a groovy name
And the wind's just right
Hey!

[Chorus]
Hang on my darling
Hang on if you want to go
Hear it's a really groovy place
It's uh, just a little bit of uh, said uh
Spanish Castle Magic

Look out! Ooh

Hang on my darling, yeah
Hang on if you want to go

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Yeah baby
Get on baby, yeah
It's all in your mind
Little bit of daydream here and there
Oh, yeah, oh, hey!
Everything's going to be alright

[Verse 1]
I, never knew what I wanted to be
But I had to figure out quickly
Fore’ the grown up world came and got me, came and got me
Then I met you (You)
You hit me in the back like a shotgun
And last night I had a dream that you had my son
And I prolly shouldn’t think like that, but you’re the one
Oh yeah, you’re the one

[Chorus]
I can tell, yeah I know (Know)
I want you around in my highs and lows (Lows)
I can see you freckles with my eyes closed
I can see twin sister loving me
I can see your momma them loving me
I can see your home girls loving me
I can’t see nobody but you loving me
Baby girl, why won’t you love on me?

[Verse 2]
Top of the morning, you woke up, extra horny
You want dick in the mornin’
Give it to you, while I’m yawnin’
If you put your hair in pigtails, you’ll look like you’re farmin’
I don’t give out no warnings nigga, talk to your own bombing
Oh, oh, eenie, meanie, miney, mo
I could, kiss you, from your head, to ya toes
Niggas act like bitches, when they see you with me, they some hoes
Baby don’t nobody gotta know
Hit the FaceTime on the go
Get you everything out the stoe’
Make sure you happy, that’s fasho
But last night, girl you did the most
It’s true, lately all I thought about was you
I put that on my crew
This for the fuckin’ girl with the tattoos

[Chorus]
I can tell, yeah I know (Know)
I want you around in my highs and lows (Lows)
I can see you freckles with my eyes closed
I can see twin sister loving me
I can see your momma them loving me

Baby girl, why won’t you love on me?

Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby to me

A boy and a girl they once found love
To each it seemed like heaven above
He looked into her eyes and said
Ooo-wee, baby, you're so good for my head

Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby to me

Oh, everyone in evеry land
Please give mе a helping hand
If you see her all alone
Oh, tell my baby won't you please come home?

Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby to me
Oh, bring my baby back
I don't know why she's been so long
But all I know is that she's gone
Oh, bring my baby back to me
I'm in pain, can't you see?

A boy and a girl they once found love
To each it seemed like heaven above
I guess that's why we fell in love
And now she's gone and all I got to say is

Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea, yeah
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby to me

Bring my baby
(Ooo-oooh)
Baby
(Ooo-oooh)
(Ooo-oooh)
(Oooh)

Bitches say we changed up, bitches say we changed
Bought a couple bracelets and bought a couple rings

If you can handle it, undress me

There's no beginning and no ending
Give me a chance to go, and I'll take it

[Verse 1]
There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong
Lord have mercy, this key won't unlock this door
Somethings goin' on here
I have a bad, bad feeling
That my baby don't live here no more
(That's alright I still got my guitar, look out now!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well I might as well go on over yonder
Way back up on the hill

Lord, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back yonder 'cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more
I know her sister will!

[Intro]
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
Will I live tomorrow?
Well, I just can't say
But I know for sure
I don't live today

[Verse]
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
No sun comin' through my windows
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave
I wish you'd hurry up and execute me
So I can be on my miserable way

[Chorus]
I don't
Live today!
Maybe tomorrow
I just can't say; but, uh
I don't
Live today!

[Guitar Outro]

[Verse 1: Chris Isaak & Lana Del Rey]
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish lovers do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

[Chorus: Chris Isaak & Lana Del Rey]
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you, with you

[Verse 2: Chris Isaak & Lana Del Rey]
What a wicked game to play, to let me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do, lеt me dream of you

[Chorus: Chris Isaak & Lana Del Rey]
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna brеak your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish lovers do

[Chorus: Chris Isaak & Lana Del Rey]
No, I don't wanna fall in love
(This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't wanna fall in love

With you, with you, you
No, I...

[Outro: Chris Isaak]
Nobody loves no one

[Verse 1]
The war is here
Spread by fear
Mob is ruling
With senseless killing
Darkness living deep inside of
What I see
Is you against me
Darkness bleeding deep inside

[Chorus]
I'll knock down the wall now
This room can't hold it all
How can we be who we are?
This is life living under the dark star

[Verse 2]
America
Inside of us
Venom runs deep
It's what we all keep
Darkness seeping deep inside of

[Chorus]
I'll knock down the wall now
This place can't hold it all
How can we be who we are?
In this life, living under the dark star

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'll knock down the wall now
This place can't hold it all
How can we be who we are?
In this life, living under the dark star

In this life, living under the dark star
This is life living under the dark star

But you could be mine

[Chorus: Jason Derulo & Adam Levine]

Get your money, honey, oh girl
Got that dollar, dollar for you (Oh, oh, oh)
Ooh, ooh (Oh, oh, oh)
You 'bout that lifestyle (Lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle)

[Verse 1]
Like the brutal autumn sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fucking doubt I make unleash a cry
I'm just pathetic, that's the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
'Cause I'm a man, woman
The only answer I've got for you
'Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force that I answer to

[Verse 2]
Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware I'm not in control
I have a conscience that is nеver fooled
But it's prone to bе overruled
You wanna know why I always think I'm right?
You never accept defeat and let it slide
I have no voice if I don't speak my mind
My weakness is the source of all my pride
And I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
'Cause I'm a man, woman
The only answer I've got for you
'Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force that I answer to

[Verse 1]
Did you think I'd show up in a limousine (Ha)
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walking up and down the street
Says he's Satan, and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out made him sign an NDA (Hm)
Yeah I made him sign an NDA
(Once is good enough)
Cause I don't want him having - to say (Mm, mm)

[Chorus]
You couldn't save me but you can't let me go
I can crave you but you don't need to know
(You can't let me go)

[Verse 2]
Thirty under thirty for another year
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе
Maybe I should think about a new career
Somewhеre in Kua'i where I can disappear
Like I'm havin' fun, Gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth
At least I gave him something I can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now (Let me go)
(Uhh) (Want it now) (Mmm) (Can't keep me up) (Let, let)

[Chorus]
You couldn't save me but you can't let me go
I can crave you but you don't need to know

[Outro]
Did I take it too far (Far, far)
Now I know what you are (Are, are)
You ran so hard (Hard, hard)
I saw stars (Stars, stars)
Think I took it too far (Far, far)
When I sold you my heart (Heart, heart)
How'd it get so dark (Dark, dark)
I saw stars (Stars, stars)
Star

[Lyrics from snippet]
Snort you a line
Snort you a line
Snort you a line
Snort you a line
Snort you a line
Smoke you a joint
Snort you a line
All these, racks
In rubber, bands

[Verse 1]
I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice
I'm not here, I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all alone
I have to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you hear me, I'm not coming home
Do you understand, I've changed my plans

[Chorus]
Cause I, I'm in love with my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I, (I) I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself

[Verse 2]
I know supposedly I'm lonely now (lonely)
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy without someone
But aren't I someone (Aren't I someone, yeah)
I (I) Like
To be your answer (To be your answer)
Cause you're so handsome (oh, so handsome)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know better than to drive you home
Cause you'd invite me in
And I'll be yours again

[Chorus]
But I (I), I'm in love (love, love, love, love) with my future
And you don't know her ooh
And I, I'm in love (love, love, love)
But not with anybody here
I'll see you in a couple years

[Chorus]
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin’ it's so strange

[Verse 1]
She said you were a hero, you played the part
But you ruined her in a year, don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn’t know (Didn't know, didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleeping in your clothes (In your clothes, in your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class

[Pre-Chorus]
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad
When they find out if you could take it all back
Would you?

[Chorus]
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

[Verse 2]
(But havin it’s so strange)
I thought that I was special
You made me feel
Likе it was my fault
You were the dеvil, lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control (In control, in control)
For you to keep her in a cage
And you swear you didn’t know (Didn't know, didn’t know)
You said you thought she was your age

[Pre-Chorus]
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you

[Chorus]
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain

[Outro]
Ooh
La-la-la-la-la, hmm
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

[Verse 1]
I had a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)
I got everything I wanted (everything I wanted)
Not what you'd think (not what you'd think, not what you'd think)
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care (might care, might care, might care)
Thought I could fly (fly)
So I stepped off the golden, mm (stepped off the Golden)
Nobody cried (nobody cried, nobody cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (might care, might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted (everything i wanted)
But when I wake up I see
You with me (with me, with me)

[Chorus]
And you say
"As long as I'm here no-one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I can change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
They don't deserve you."

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream,(I tried to scream, I tried to scream)
But my head was underwater (underwater)
They called me weak (they called me weak, they called me weak)
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter (just somebody's daughter)
It could've been a nightmare (nightmare)
But it felt like they were right there (right there, right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago (year ago)
But I don't wanna let anybody know (anybody know)
Cause everybody wants something from me now (from me now)
And I don't wanna let 'em down (let 'em down, let 'em down)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream (I had a dream, I had a dream)
I got everything I wanted (everything I wanted)
But when I wake up I see (wake up I see, wake up I see)
You with me (with me, with me)

[Chorus]
And you say
"As long as I'm here no-one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I can change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
They don't deserve you." (don't deserve you, don't deserve you)

[Outro]
If I knew it all then would I do it again
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then would I do it again, (gain, gain, gain)
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead? (say instead, say instead)

What are you looking at?
Strike a pose
Strike a pose
Vogue (Vogue, vogue)
Vogue (Vogue, vogue)

[Verse 1]
Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go (Look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (Life that you know)
When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor
And hеre's what it's for, so

[Chorus]
Come on, vogue (Voguе)
Let your body move to the music (Move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue (Vogue)
Let your body go with the flow (Go with the flow)
You know you can do it

[Verse 2]
All you need is your own imagination
So use it that's what it's for (That's what it's for)
Go inside, for your finest inspiration
Your dreams will open the door (Open up the door)
It makes no difference if you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
If the music's pumping it will give you new life
You're a superstar
Yes, that's what you are, you know it

[Chorus]
Come on, vogue (Vogue, vogue)
Let your body groove to the music (Groove to the music)
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue (Vogue, vogue)
Let your body go with the flow (Go with the flow)
You know you can do it

[Bridge]
Beauty's where you find it
Not just where you bump and grind it
Soul is in the musical
That's where I feel so beautiful
Magical, life's a ball, so
Get up on the dance floor

[Chorus]
Vogue (Vogue)
Let your body move to the music (Move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue (Vogue, vogue)
Let your body go with the flow (Go with the flow)
You know you can do it

[Intro]
Come on, girls!
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you ‘til you can't come down

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Makе him express how he feels
And maybе then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 2]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
So please

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Outro]
Express yourself
Express himself, hey hey
(So if you want it right now, better make him show you how)
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey hey
(So if you want it right now, better make him show you how)
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself

[Verse 1]
Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could, maybe I'd give you my world
How can I when you won't take it from me?

[Chorus]
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way

[Verse 2]
Tell me why everything turned around
Packin’ up, shackin’ up's all you wanna do
If I could, baby, I'd give you my world
Open up, everything's waiting for you

[Chorus]
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day, another lonely day
You can go your own way, go your own way
You can call it another lonely day

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
For you, there'll be no more crying
For you, the sun will be shining
‘Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright
I know it's right

[Verse 2]
For you, I'll give the world
For you, I'll never be cold
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright
I know it's right

[Chorus]
And the songbirds are singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before

[Bridge]
And I wish you all the love in the world
But most of all, I wish it from myself

[Chorus 2]
And the songbirds keep singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like nеver before

[Outro]
Likе never before
Like never before
(Thank you, thank you, goodnight)
We need it!

[Intro]

Ain't a fuckin' dream, reality, twenty five to the 'calities
Lil' Dre, I do this shit, real shit
Don't make me make a tragedy come

Earth top, nigga, I'ma swag in a Porsche, bitch
Foreign cars, niggas, you knowin' I'm on more shit
Yeah, I'm on that nеw shit, on that Polo horse shit
On that Polo horse pajama, when I swеrve in my whips, bitch
Got my face tatted, so you know I'm savage

And I'm ridin' paint, so you know I'm savage
And I'm sippin' drank, so you know I'm savage
You know I'm savage, you know I'm savage
Niggas know around about the block, and I let 'em have it
You know I'm savage, you know I'm savage
Ask around me, any fuckin' block, they'll say I'm savage
Soulja Boy go-go hard, real talk
And you fake niggas, you bitch niggas, split yo' cantaloupe, I'm a sick nigga, no antidote
You was talkin' shit, you will get fought, slugs through yo' face, ho
Don't give a fuck about shit, my eyes through the peephole
It's good over evil, I tell a bitch to keep a ho
Soulja Tell 'Em, I do this, then I hit her wit' long strokes
It's off top wit' the .44, nigga, you don't want beef wit' me
It's history, that's the end of you, nigga talkin', what it do?
What it be? You a fuckin' bitch, push your ass up off the cliff
Reminisce 'bout the old days, when I throw back wit' the throwaway
Soulja Tell 'Em, I had to wait, had this shit on lock
Nigga, you a sidekick, you slide, it's .45 when I ride

[Outro]
This right here for the real ass niggas
For the real ass niggas
Man, I know you niggas on the block gettin' money
On the block gettin' money

Grind, grind, grind, work
Grind, grind, grind, work
Grind, grind, grind, work
Grind, grind, grind, work

Everybody's trying to say I'm wrong
I just want to be back where I belong

[Chorus]
World turnin’
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turnin’
Everybody's got me down

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm wrong, but who's to say what's right
I need somebody to help me through the night

[Chorus]
World turnin’
I got to get my feet back on the ground
World turnin’
Everybody's got me down

Monday morning, you sure look fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me and then you fade away
You know, I can't go on believing this way
I got nothing but love for you
Tell me what you really want to do
First you love me, then you get on down the line

[Pre-Chorus: Fleetwood Mac]
But I don't mind

First you love me then you get on down the line

[Pre-Chorus: Fleetwood Mac]

[Verse 1: Stevie Nicks]
Now there you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

[Pre-Chorus: Stevie Nicks]
A heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
What you lost

[Chorus: Fleetwood Mac]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

[Verse 2: Stevie Nicks]
Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sеll?
Dreams of loneliness

[Pre-Chorus: Stevie Nicks]
A hеartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Ooh, what you lost

[Chorus: Fleetwood Mac]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
You know, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Well, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
You will know
You'll know

[Spoken: Stevie Nicks]
You will know! Thank you!

[Verse 1: Lindsey Buckingham]
If you wake up and don't wanna smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

[Chorus: Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Why not think about times to come
And not about the things that you've done?
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

[Chorus: Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yеsterday's gone

[Verse 3: Lindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie]
All I want is to see you smile
If it takеs just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you

[Chorus: Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back

Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)

Alright, we’re gonna do some songs from the Rumours album
Well, this is another one
This one’s called “Oh Daddy”

[Verse 1]
Oh, Daddy, you know you make me cry
How can you love me, I don't understand why
Oh, Daddy, if I could make you see
If there's been a fool around, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

[Verse 2]
Oh, Daddy, you soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know you're the best thing in my life
Oh, Daddy, if I can make you see
If there's been a fool around, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

[Chorus]
Why are you right when I'm so wrong?
I'm so weak but you're so strong
Everything you do is just all right
And I can't walk away from you, baby, if I tried

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Why are you right when I'm so wrong?
I'm so weak but you're so strong
Everything you do is just alright
And I can't walk away from you, baby, if I tried

You're letting me know you're the best thing in my life
Oh, Daddy, if I can make you see

Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

[Verse 2]
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
Rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, yeah,  your life knows no answer

[Refrain]
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

[Verse 1]
She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the sky
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Would you even try?
Would you even try?

[Refrain]
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

[Bridge]
Taken by, taken by the sky
Taken by, taken by the sky, yeah
Taken by, taken by the sky
No

[Outro]
Ooh, ah, mm, oh-oh

Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
And love is hard to find
Dreams unwind
And love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
And love is hard to find
Dreams unwind
It’s still a state of mind
Take me like the wind, child

She broke down, let me in
Made me see where I'd been

[Chorus]
I’ve been down one time
I’ve been down two time
I'm never going back again
Mhm

Oh yeah, I'm never going back again
Hm-hmm
(Yeah)

[Outro]
Thank you very much!

[Verse 1]
Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon, and dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I’ll pray
Wake up in the mornin’
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out

[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

[Verse 2]
Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Up for sale

[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

[Chorus]
Well did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
Now tell me, is it over now?
Do you know how to pick up the pieces
And go home? And go home
Go home

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Black widow

Gold dust woman

[Verse 1: Stevie Nicks]
Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon, dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I’ll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out

[Chorus: Fleetwood Mac]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love
And is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

[Verse]

[?] out of your heart
Throw away the key
Don't leave me in the dark
I need you here with me
Yes, I need you here with me
Don’t leave me in this bed
You know I can't live without
No, don't leave me in this bed
What do you think about that?
What do you think about that?

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]

[Verse 1]
The last time I saw her
She didn’t have anything to say, that hurt
Love has a funny way of turning things around
Doesn’t anything last?

[Verse 2]
It was not so long ago that you loved me
She tried but she couldn’t understand, oh, no
And time has a funny way of breaking down a man
Doesn’t anything last?

[Verse]
Draco, pull up with choppas, I'm ready to shoot

[Intro]
Hiya, folks
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, oh, they's all around
With liquor and money, oh, they's loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
You know, high-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
My uncle started winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
You know I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
Well, I grabbed a bottle, cracked him in the jaw
Shot me another, well, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Hey, we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, he taught me all I know
Taught me so well, well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my namе, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell thеm that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You know in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
If that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Outro]
Test this microphone again. Testing, testing. (Hey, turn that one up, turn it up, up, up.) Which one, this one? This one sounds... (Yeah, yours, that one, that one there, turn it up, up. Not that far.) Yeah, that oughta do for the time being

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't no winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
In the timbers of Fennario
The wolves are running 'round
The winter was so hard and cold
Froze ten feet 'neath the ground

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 2]
I sat down to my supper
It was a bottle of red whiskey
I said my prayers and went to bed
That's the last they saw of me

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 3]
When I awoke, thе dire wolf
Six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window
All I said was, "Come on in"

[Chorus]
Don't murdеr me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 4]
The wolf came in, I got my cards
We sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades
But the cards were all the same

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
In the backwash of Fennario
The black and bloody mire
The dire wolf collects his due
While the boys sing around the fire

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Outro]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
No, no, no
Please don't murder me

[Verse 1]
Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The buses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars
But I'm here by the road
Bound to the load
I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers that won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Oh, I'm drowning in you

[Verse 2]
I left St. Louis, City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
I tried to pretend it came to an end
'Cause you weren't the woman I once thought I'd met
But I can't deny, oh, times have gone by
I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
I was a man when all this began
Who'd never think twice about being there yet

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind whisper mix in
It's speaking of life that passes like dew
Forced me to see you've done better by me
Better by me than I've done by you

[Verse 3]
What's to be found, racing around
You carry your bag wherever you go
I'm full of blues, trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't wanna know
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
Capture a glance, oh, and make it a dance
Of looking at you looking at me

[Outro]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, lost from the light
Oh Lord, and I'm drowning in you
I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Oh Lord, and I'm drowning in you
You've done better by me than I've done by you
So oh, and I'm drowning in you
I'm going, going, going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm going, going, going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Well, you've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh oh, and I'm drowning in you
Oh oh, and I'm drowning in you
Oh oh, and I'm drowning in you

[Verse 1]
My mama told me, my papa told me, too
Well, my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I went to the depot, I never got there on time
Went down to the depot, never got there on time
Well, the train's going down, she's rolling down the line

Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Well, my train's going down, she's rolling down the line

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
My mama told me, my papa told me, too
Well, my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
But I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
Now I'm spending my lifetime running with the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Outro]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands, yeah

[Verse 1]
Merry run around, sailin' up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
There's nothing you can say, don't get in their way
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
You bettеr not be there whеn it rolls over
Though you make a noise, just can't hear your voice
You're on a dizzy ride and you're cold sober

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Bridge]
Why don't you believe what I say is true?
Everything I tell you I heard it first from you

[Verse 4]
Heard your news report, you know you're falling short
Pretty soon, more trust you for the weather
When that ship comes in, you won't know where it's been
You got to try to see a little farther

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Outro]
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
It's alright, 'cause I love you
That's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from their cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
You're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only wanna hold you, I don't wanna tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, have gotten used to havin' you around
My landscape would be empty if you were gone

[Chorus]
It's alright, 'cause I love you
That's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
Brave the storm to come 'cause it surely looks like rain
And everywhere the people saying, "Well, here come the rain"
Turning gray and it surely looks like rain
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain
And oh, oh, turning gray and it looks like rain
'Cause everywhere the people saying, "Well, here come the rain"
Turning gray and it surely looks like rain
Well, it looks like rain and it feels like rain
And oh, oh, whole world's turning gray and it looks like rain
Oh, everywhere the people saying, "Here comes the rain"
Looks like rain and it feels like rain
Oh, and here comes the rain

[Verse 1]
Wake of the flood, laughing water, forty-nine
Get out the pans, don't just stand there dreaming
Get out the way
Get out the way

[Chorus]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Verse 2]
Line up a long shot
Maybe try it two times, maybe more
Good to know you got shoes to wear when you find the floor
Why hold out for more?

[Chorus]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Asking you nice now
Keep the mother rolling one more time
Been down before but you just don't have to go no more
No more

[Chorus]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I’m gonna sit right herе until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I followed her down to St. Louiе, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she’s gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows when she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die
And I’ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

Going to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River gonna sing me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Going home, going home
By the waterside I will lay my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Going to plant a weeping willow
By the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Harmonizing]

[Prelude]

[Instrumental]

[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
Winter rain, now tell me why
Summers fade, and roses die
The answer came
The wind and rain

[Verse 2]
Golden hills, now veiled in gray
And summer leaves are blown away
And what remains? The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The knowing in her eyes

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Circle songs and sands of time
And seasons will end in tumbled rhyme
And littlе change
The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a dеsert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The knowing in her eyes

[Outro]
Winter gray and falling rain
We'll see summer come again
Darkness falls and seasons change
(Gonna happen every time)
Same old friends the wind and rain
(We'll see summer by and by)
Winter gray and falling rain
(Seasons fade and roses die)
We'll see summer come again
(Though you're mounted just to stand in line)
Darkness falls and seasons change
(Gonna happen every time)
Same old friends the wind and rain
(We'll see summer by and by)

[Part 2: Let It Grow]

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds
Silver beads, pass into the sea

She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
And she's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Refrain]
Let it flow, greatly grow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Refrain]
Let it grow, greatly grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day that could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Say that when your big old ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in thе band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Likе a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Bridge]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 2]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Bridge]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 3]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Bridge]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 4]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Bridge]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 5]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kisses my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina goodbye

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The othеr half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet somеday
The good Lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 3]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Verse 4]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just to hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Verse 3]
Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Verse 4]
Thought I hеard a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a young man mourn today
Thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dеw today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I'll walk you out in the morning dew today
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

Thank you

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up to see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of thе door and down on the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like thе do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She's lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Ow, get back truckin' on
Hey, get back truckin' on
Hey, hey, hey, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Nobody's fault but mine, nobody's fault but mine
If I don't read my soul gets lost
Nobody's fault but mine

[Verse 2]
Mama, she taught me
Mama, she taught me how to read
If I don't read my soul gets lost
Ain't nobody's fault but mine

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Going wherе the climate suits my clothes
Going whеre the climate suits my clothes, yes, it does
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now, now
Woo, Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the place is gonna fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hеy, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now, now, now
Hey, Saturday night

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Turn on Channеl Six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues"
His wife say, "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, break out your rocking shoes"

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now, now, now
Hey, Saturday night

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, you'll know it when it come
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night now, now, now
Hey, Saturday night

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Everybody get right (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Hey, hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night
Ow (One more Saturday night)
On a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Woo, hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night (One more Saturday night)
Woo, ooh (One more Saturday night)
Hanging on a Saturday night now (One more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night
Oh oh

Thank you all, good night

[Verse 1]
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Outro]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about

Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home
Thank you all, see you next time we're in town

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
All the years combine, they melt into a dream
A broken angel sings from a guitar
In the end there's just a song, comes crying up the night
Through all broken dreams and vanished years

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams
In the end there's still that song, it's crying like the wind
Down еvery lonely street that's evеr been

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Bridge]
I've stayed in every blue light cheap hotel
Can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time
Gonna make 'em shine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It all rolls into one, and nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold for very long
And when you hear that song, crying like the wind
It seems like all this life was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella Blue
Stella Blue

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I should've known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life
But life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death, or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
There's just no time to die
There's just no time to die
There's just no time to die

[Verse 2]
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern mm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once
Fool me twice
Are you death
Or paradise
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Bridge]
No time to die, Hmm
No Time to die, ooh

[Outro]
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a youngin's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried

One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her plеading I denied
That leavеs no one but me to blame 'cause Mama tried

[Verse 2]
Dear old Daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
She wanted me to have the best
But she tried to raise me right but I refused

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause Mama tried

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause Mama tried

[Outro]
That leaves no one but me to blame 'cause Mama tried

[Verse 1]
I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, she went up to her room
And she sang a fateful tune
And I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
Winds don't blow
And I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, she's coming down the stairs
Combing back her yellow hair
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way
This a-way
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Well, I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Carolin'
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
We had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Come on pretty women
With your hair hanging down
Open up your windows
'Cause the Candyman's in town
Come on, boys, and wager
Roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven, boys
I'll take your money home

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 2]
I come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
Be onе less man alive
Good morning, Mr. Benson
I see you'rе doing well
If I had me a shotgun
You know I'd blow you straight to hell

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Come on, boys, and wager
If you have got the mind
If you got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line
Hand me my old guitar
Pass that whiskey 'round
Want you to tell everybody you meet
That the Candyman's in town

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Outro]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he comes and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Chorus]
Well now, C, C.C. Rider
Well now see what you done done
Well now, C, C.C. Rider
Well now see what you done done
Girl, now you made me love you, woman
And now your man is gone

[Verse 1]
So I'm goin' away, and I won't be back 'til fall
Well, I'm goin' away, no, I won't be back 'til fall
If I could find me that good girl, I might not be coming back at all

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well now C, C.C. Rider
See how the moon is shining bright, that's right
See now C, C.C. Rider
See how the moon is shining bright
Just might find me that good girl, and everything would be alright, somehow

[Chorus]
Well now, C, C.C. Rider
Well now see, see what you done done
Well now, C, C.C. Rider
Well now see, see what you done done
Well now, you made me lovе you, woman
And I guess your man has come, hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Wеll now, C, C.C. Rider
Well now see, see what you done done
Well now, C, C, C.C. Rider now
Well now see, see what you done done
Well now, you made me love you, woman
And now your man has come, oh

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he stepped to the bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over, and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack in Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars though it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1 repeated]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Outro]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy and he wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl that's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, blues

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I havе today

[Verse 2]
Well, she said her namе was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
Took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, oh

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
But I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
Now I'll spend my lifetime running with the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Outro]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands

[Verse 1]
My mama told me, my papa told me, too
Well, my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I went to the depot, I never got there on time
Went down to the depot, never got there on time
Well, the train's going down, she's rolling down the line

Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Well, my train's going down, she's rolling down the line

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
My mama told me, my papa told me, too
Well, my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
It's alright, I love you
That's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from their cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
You're only tryin' to make it through the night, that's right

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only wanna hold you, I don't wanna tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, I have gotten used to havin' you around
My landscape would be empty if you were gone

[Chorus]
But it's alright, 'cause I love you
That’s not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
Yes, it looks like rain
It looks like rain
Ooh, turning gray and it looks like rain
Ooh ooh, and I say it looks like rain
I feel it coming, oh oh
Hey, hey, it looks like rain
Hey, turning gray, it looks like rain
Until it dries some rain must fall
But it ain't fair if you get it all, no
It looks like rain
And to each light some sun must shine
I'm still waiting around for mine
It looks like rain
Rain, rain, go away, don't hang around me today
Hey, hey, looks like rain
I said rain, rain, go away
I can't take it no more, no more today
It looks like rain
'Cause it looks like rain now
Hey, feel it coming now, here come the rain
Here come the rain
And it looks like rain and it feels like rain really coming now
Here come the rain, here come the rain, hey
Rain, rain, go away
I can't take it one more fucking day, no
Go away, hey, hey
I said rain, rain, go away
Wow, the whole world turning gray
Hey, looks like rain
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain
Oh, here come the rain
One more, said it looks like rain and it feels like rain
Oh Lord, here come the rain, rain, hey
Here come the rain

[Verse 1]
There was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell
He had a beautiful daughter, the truth to you I'll tell
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell
She had sweethearts a plenty, and men of high degree
But none but Jack the sailor, her true love ever be
Oh, her true love ever be
Now, Jackie's gone a sailing, with trouble on his mind
He's left his native country and his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She went down to a tailor shop and dressed in man's array
She climbed on board a vessel to convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away
Before you get on board, sir, your name we'd like to know
She smiled on her countenance, they called me Jack-a-roe
Oh, they call me Jack-a-roe
I see your waist is slender, your fingers they are small
Your cheeks too red and rosy to face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannonball
I know my waist is slender, my fingers they are small
But it would not make me tremble to see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
The war soon being over, she went and looked around
Among the dead and wounded her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found
She picked him up on in her arms and carried him to the town
She sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds
Oh, to quickly heal his wounds
This couple they got married so well they did agree
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?

[Verse 1]
Well now baby used to stay out all night long
Made me cry, Lord, she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, baby, that's no lie
Tables turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)
You see, I used to love her, but it's all over now

[Verse 2]
Well, I used to wake up in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I got worried, you know she eased my achin' head
But now she's here and there with evеry man in town
Was still tryin' to take me for that same old clown

[Chorus]
Wеll now, I used to love her, but it's all over now
You see, I used to love her (Used to love her), but it's all over now
(Over now)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Well, she used to run around with every man in town
Spend all my money, Lord, out playing her high class game
Put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Table's turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)
You see, I used to love her (Used to love her), but it's all over now
(Said over now)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
My baby used to stay out all night long
Made me cry, Lord, she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, baby, that's no lie
Tables turnin', now it's her turn to cry

[Chorus]
'Cause I used to love her (Used to love her), but it's all over now (Over now)
You see, I used to love her (Used to love her), but it's all over now
(See, it's over, over now)
You see, I used to love her (Used to love her), but it's all over now
(Over now, now)
You see, I used to love her (Used to love her), but it's all over now

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Great North Central, would you all board
You can't find a ride like that no more
The night the chariot swung down low
Ninety-nine people had a chance to go
One long party from the front to end
Tune to the whistle going 'round the bend
No great hurry, what do you say?
Might as well channel me every good way

[Chorus]
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as wеll)

[Verse 2]
Ragtime slowly for twenty-five milеs
Then switch over to the Cajun style
Bar car blowing rhythm and blues
Drunk band music in the old caboose
Long train running from coast to coast
Bringing home a party when they need it the most
Work on the box car, beat on the bell
Nothing else shaking so you might just as well

[Chorus]
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)

[Bridge]
Never had such a good time in my life before
I'd like to have it one time more
One long ride from start to end
I'd like to take that ride again
Again

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I ran out of track and I lost the train
I'm back in the county with the blues again
Great North Central is on my mind
I might like to ride it just one more time

[Chorus]
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well
Might as well, might as well

[Outro]
You might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
You might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)

We're gonna take a short break

[Verse 1]
You tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
The sunny side of the street is dark
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
Maybe it's 'cause it's midnight
In the dark of the moon besides

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes)
You know you got such dark eyes (Woo)

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Verse 2]
You think you've seen this town clear through
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
Nothing here that could interest you
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
It's not because you missed out
On the thing that we had to start

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast)
Or just over-played your part (Woo)

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Since I'm passing your way today
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
I just stopped by 'cause I wanna say
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
I recall your darkness when it crackled like a thundercloud

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
When I can hear it beat out loud (Woo)

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
You just gotta poke around
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
(Shakedown Street)
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
You just gotta poke around
(Poke around , poke around)
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
(Used to be the heart of town)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
You just gotta poke around

[Bridge]
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
(Just gotta poke around)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
(Woo)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
You just gotta poke around
(Just gotta poke around)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Just gotta poke around)
You just gotta poke around
(You just gotta poke around)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Got no heart, got no heart)
You just gotta poke around
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
(Heart of town)
Don't tell me this town ain't go no heart
You just gotta poke around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just gotta poke around
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
You just gotta poke around

[Verse 1]
Compass card is spinning
Your elm is swinging to and fro
Ooh, where's the dog star?
Ooh, where's the moon?

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea

[Verse 2]
Some days the gales are howling
Some days the sea is still as glass
Ooh, reef the main sail
Ooh, lash the mast

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
Yeah, there's a price for being free

[Bridge]
Hear the sea birds cryin'
There's a ghost wind blowin'
And it's calling you, to that misty swirling sea
'Til the chains of your dreams are broken
No place in this world you can be

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You'rе a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea
Now the shorе lights beckon
Yeah, there's a price for being free

[Outro]
Yeah, for being free
Free don't come easy
Yeah, free don't come for free
What you gonna do?
You know where you're going to
Drifting, yes, you're drifting
Drifting and dreaming, dreaming
Maybe going on a dream now
Whatever holds you now
Maybe going on a feeling, ooh
'Cause there's a place you've never been
Maybe a place you've never seen now
You can hear her calling on the wind
Drifting and dreaming, hey
Maybe drifting, maybe drifting off away now
Doesn't much matter anyway, hey
Drifting and dreaming, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey hey
Maybe going on a dream
Maybe going on a feeling, maybe going on a feeling, feeling

[Verse 1]
This must be heaven
Tonight I cross the line
You must be the angel
I thought I might never find
Was it you I heard singing
While I was chasing dreams?
Driven by the wind
Like the dust that blows around

[Chorus]
And the rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down

[Verse 2]
Got to be heaven
'Cause here's where the rainbow ends
If this ain't the real thing
Well, it's close enough to pretend
But when that wind blows
When the night's about to fall
I can hear the sirens call
It's a certain sort of sound

[Chorus]
When the rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down

[Bridge]
Holes in what's left of my reason
Holes in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin'
But I'll pull through

Never could read no road map
No, I don't know what the weather might do
But hear that witch wind whinin'
See that dog star shinin'
I've got a feelin' there's no time to lose
No time to lose

I never know, no
Just don't ever know, no

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been heaven
But even rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin'
And the wind is willin'
That I'm as good as gone again
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Just a Saint of Circumstance
Just a tiger in a trance
In the rain fallin' down now

[Chorus]
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down (Rain fallin' down)
Rain fallin' down now (Rain fallin' down)
Rain fallin' down (Rain fallin' down)
Rain fallin' down (Rain fallin' down)

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Well, never know now
Just don't ever know
I know, listen
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Don't know now)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(No, I never know now)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
('Cause I always go now)
Listen, I sure don't know what I'm going for (Ha)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
Hey, I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Maybe crazy, maybe out of line now)
But I'm going to go for it for sure
(I'm on the road and I'm feeling fine now)
Hey, I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Got to go now, ha)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
('Cause you never know now)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(I never, never know)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Got, got, got to go)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Maybe going on a dream now)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Maybe going on a feeling, maybe going on a feeling)

[Lady with a Fan]

[Verse 1]
Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
'Til my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'Til things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing therе

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes hеr fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
Not disaster

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
Not to master

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

[Terrapin Station]

[Verse]
Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
Oh, from the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune

[Outro]
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - If it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - But the train's put its brakes on
Terrapin - And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
And I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
When you go down to Deep Elem to have a little fun
Have your ten dollars when the police man come

[Chorus]
Whoa, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Whoa, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

[Verse 2]
Once I knew a sweetheart, she meant the world to me
Went down to Deep Elem, now she ain't what she used to be

Whoa, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Whoa, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

Once I knew a preacher, preached the Bible through-and-through
Went down to Deep Elem, now his preachin' days are through

[Outro]
Whoa, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

[Verse 1]
I told Althea I was feeling lost
Lacking in some direction
Althea told me upon scrutiny
That my back might need protection
I told Althea that treachery
Was tearing me limb from limb
Althea told me, "Now, cool down, boy
Settle down easy, Jim"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You may be Saturday's child all grown
Moving with a pinch of grace
You may be a clown in the burying ground
Or just another pretty face
You may be the fate of Ophelia
Sleeping and perchance to dream
Honest to the point of recklessness
Self centered to the extremе

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Ain't nobody messing with you but you
Your friends are gеtting most concerned
Loose with the truth, maybe it's your fire
Baby, I hope you don't get burned
When the smoke has cleared, she said
That's what she said to me
You're gonna want a bed to lay your head
And a little sympathy

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
There are things you can replace
And others you cannot
The time has come to weigh those things
This space is getting hot
You know this space is getting hot

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
I told Althea I'm a roving sign
I was born to be a bachelor
Althea told me: "Okay, that's fine"
You know now I'm trying to catch her
Can't talk to you without talking to me
We're guilty of the same old thing
Thinking a lot about less and less
And forgetting the love we bring

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Let us put men and women together
See which one is smarter
Some say men, but I say no
The women got the men like a puppet show

[Chorus]
It ain't me - it's the people that say
Men are leading the women astray
I say it's the women today
Smarter than the men in every way
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
The women are smarter, that's right
(That's right)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Little boy sit on the corner and cry
Big man come and he ask him why
He said, "I can't do what the big boys do"
The man sat down and he cried, too

[Chorus]
It ain't me - it's the people that say
Men are leading the women astray
I say it's the women today
Smarter than the men in every way
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
The women are smarter, that's right
(That's right)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Ever since the world began
Women been imitating the ways of man
But listen, I've got a plan
Give it up, don't try and understand

[Chorus]
It ain't me - it's the people that say
Men are leading the women astray
I say it's the women today
Smarter than the men in every way
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
The women are smarter, that's right
(That's right)

[Verse 1 repeated]
Let us put men and women together
See which one is smarter
Some say men, but I say no
The women got the men more than all she know

[Chorus]
It ain't me - it's the people that say
Men are leading the women astray
I say it's the women today
Smarter than the men in every way
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
The women are smarter, that's right
(That's right)

The women are smarter, that's right, that's right
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
That's right, the women are smarter
The women are smarter, that's right
That's right

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, no, no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down, no, no

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Ever since she went and had her sex changed
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
Well, I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I bet you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, no, no, no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
Well, I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around y'all)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Verse 1]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Verse 2]
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

[Verse 3]
Where have all the people gone, my honey?
Where have all the people gone today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

[Verse 4]
I thought I heard a, a young man mourn this morning
I thought I heard a, a young man mourn today
I thought I heard a young man mourn this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I guess it doesn't matter anyway

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
I knew she’d have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She’s got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
Shе can wade in a drop of dew
She don't comе, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you, y'all
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
And jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Now, come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She’s got everything delightful
She’s got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
Take me out and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming, blooming like a red rose
Now come on over sweetly
Ride out singing, I’ll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, ooh, sunshine daydream
Come on, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream, ha
Come on, daydream
Wading in a cold stream
Crawl on out your window
We're going, going where the wind goes
They're never gonna miss us
Ride out singing, I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, ah

[Instrumental]

Sunshine daydream, ah-ha, ha ha ha
Sunshine daydream, I’ll never go away
Sunshine daydream, ah, come on, come on
Sunshine daydream, hey, hey
Come on over daydream
Come on over daydream
Come on over daydream, ah, ah
Sunshine daydream, ah-ha
Sunshine daydream, ah
Just a dream, just a dream, just a dream
Just a dream, just a dream

[Verse 1]
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
He's crying like a fire in the sun

[Chorus]
Look out, all those saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 2]
The highway is for gamblers, you better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

[Chorus]
The sky, too, is moving over you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
All your empty-handed armies are all going home
Your lover who has just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from your floor

[Chorus]
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 4]
Leave your stepping stones behind, there's something calls for you
Forget about the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

[Chorus]
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Outro]
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Thank you all, good night

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
Lord, I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
Lord, I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down under the sea
Try to see what's going down
Lord, and read between the lines
I had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling
It come running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymorе

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you plеase
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jailhouse
Until the sun goes down
'Til it go down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

[Outro]
I had to move
Really had to move
That’s why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore

[Verse 1]
Went to see the captain, strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar’s pay, likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 2]
Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rocking of the boat
And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float
I won't leave you sinking down but whoa it makes me wild
With thirty years upon my head
To have you call me child

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first beliеved you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruеl sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 3]
The bottles stand as empty
As they were filled before
Time there was and plenty
But from that cup no more
Though I could not caution all
I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Outro]
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 1]
Well, I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, she went up to her room
And she sang a fateful tune
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way
This a-way
I ain't gonna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
She's coming down the stairs
Combing back her yellow hair
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way
This a-way
And I ain't gonna be treated this a-way

[Outro]
Well, I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
And I'm going wherе those chilly winds don't blow
Winds don't blow
And I'm going where thosе chilly winds don't blow
I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow

[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I've seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream
And I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are and what you meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me, Cassidy

[Verse 2]
Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac
And I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come and wash the nighttime clean
Come and grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn and tap thе tambourine
Close the gap of thе dark years in between
You and me, Cassidy

[Bridge]
Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes and now here she starts
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine

[Instrumental Break]

Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Verse 1]
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening
When the dеaling got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
I picked up my matchеs
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Verse 4]
There ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias
Or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Or it could have been the wind (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But there seems to be a beat now (Ooh)
I can feel it my feet now (Ooh)
Listen, here it comes again

[Bridge]
There's a band out on the highway
They're high-stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
And it's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Well, the sun wеnt down in honey
And the moon came up in winе
You know stars were spinning dizzy
Lord, the band kept us too busy
We forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band
Lord, they're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Balls of lighting roll along (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Old men sing about their dreams (Ooh)
Women laugh and children scream (Ooh, ooh)
And the band keeps playing on

[Bridge]
Keep on dancing through the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No one's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone
Were they ever here at all?
But they kept dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Outro]
Well, the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Your rain falls like crazy fingers
Peals of fragile thunder, keeping time
Recall the days that still are to come
Some sing blue
Hang your heart on laughing willow
Stray down to the water
Deep sea of love
Beneath the sweet calm face of the sea
Swift undertow

[Chorus]
Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know
See how it feels in the end
May Lady Lullaby sing plainly for you
Soft, strong, sweet and true

[Verse 2]
Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow
Tapping at the window, touch your hair
So swift and bright
Strange figures of light, float in air
Who can stop what must arrive now?
Something new is waiting to be born
Dark as the night
You're still by my side
Shining side

[Bridge]
Gone are the days we stopped to decide
Where we should go, we just ride
Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams
Gone - both dream and lie

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know
Feels like it might be alright
While Lady Lullaby sings plainly for you
Love still rings true

[Verse 3]
Midnight on a carousel ride
Reaching for the gold ring down inside
Never could reach it
It just slips away when I try (Try)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
Well, I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big rivеr
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Wеll, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows when she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Merry run around, sailin' up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over
When that train comes in, you won't know where it's been
You got to try to see a little further

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
But it's alright, 'cause I love you
And that's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from their cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
You're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only wanna hold you, I don't wanna tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, have gotten used to havin' you around
My landscape would be empty if you were gone

[Chorus]
It's alright, 'cause I love you
And that’s not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
(Brave the storm to come)
Brave the storm to come 'cause it looks like rain
Brave the storm to come, it surely looks like rain
Brave the storm to come ('Cause it looks like)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Ooh, here comes the rain
Yes, and brave the storm to come
It looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Ooh, here comes the rain
Yes, and brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, oh, here comes the rain
Yes, and brave the storm to come
It looks rain and it feels like rain, oh ('Cause it looks like rain)
Oh, oh, here comes the rain
Brave the storm to come ('Cause it looks like rain)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Oh, oh, here comes the rain

[Verse 1]
Went to see the captain, strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 2]
Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rocking of the boat
And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float
I won't leave you drifting down but whoa it makes me wild
With thirty years upon my head
To have you call me child

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first beliеved you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruеl sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 3]
The bottles stand as empty
As it was filled before
Time there was and plenty
But from that cup no more
Though I could not caution all
I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laught
