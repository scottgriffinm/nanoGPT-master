 than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Verse 2]
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Outro]
… And then when I saw the news
Make me feel afraid of how I’d been to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am—

[Intro: The Winans]
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either
Yeah

[Intro]
One of dem ones—right

[Verse]
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, "What are those?"
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want

[Outro]
Yeah, that's right, yeah

[Intro: DMX]
What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1: Drake]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

[Chorus: Drake]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a "Are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

[Chorus: Drake]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit

[Intro: Majid Al Maskati]
Ooh, baby, yeah

[Verse: Majid Al Maskati]
Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over, simple and plain
Found me some fun that's good for the pain
Already told you, I don't feel the same
I don't feel the same

[Outro: Majid Al Maskati]
Anywhere I go
I can't help but show
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know

[Verse]
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you, yea

[Chorus]
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

[Post-Chorus]
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you, yea

[Chorus]
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say

[Produced By Jordan Ullman]

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yeah, I can't get enough of you, babe
Bottles open up so you can try and open up for me, baby
M.I.A. in the M.I.A
You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl
Oh, I know you feel what I feel
Breaking you off, it's so real
I can't fake that, babe
My love's locked down and you cuffing it
You're the only one I trust with it
You're the only one that stuck with it

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Drake]
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah
I'm with you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you 'round, I need you, oh

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Jeremih]
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you, I'm with you

[Intro: Baka & Drake]
Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see RiRi right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Verse 2: Drake]
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Intro: Drake]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah
These days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh

[Chorus: Drake & Rihanna]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Verse 3: Drake]
Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix (Six)
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I

[Chorus: Drake & Rihanna]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Outro: Popcaan]
Gyal a you mi waan
Pay fi yuh visa meck yo fly out regular
Baby, cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocket
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocket

[Intro]
Yeah, I get it
I get it, yeah

[Verse 1]
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way

[Chorus]
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (think about me)
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah

[Verse 3]
Say to you—but eighty percent of it wasn't true, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

[Verse 4]
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving
Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough, and then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

[Outro]
Yeah
I know

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Jheeze, yeah
Right, look, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tell me how you really feel
Tell me how you really feel
I would ask you what's the deal
But y'all don't even got a deal
Most niggas with a deal
Couldn't make a greatest hits
Y'all a whole lot of things
But you still ain't this
I don't know no one
That could tell me what to do
Heard you never claimed the hood
Heard the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Oh well, ship sailed
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I pull up in yachts so big
That they try to hit me with boat fines
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin', yeah
Just like the old times
Same niggas from the old days
Lotta sides on the same side
OVO, we a gold mine
But I'm goin' gold, no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off me
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off
Like I'm shirt off shorty
Whole city goin' crazy
Whole city goin' crazy
Top five, no debatin'
Top five, top five, top five
And the whole city rate me
And I'm back inside The Matrix
And I said that we would make it
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This ain't no met-along-the-way shit
We done really put some days in

[Interlude: Future]
Hey, why you so excited? You know what I'm sayin'?
What happened?
Did you win the Grammy? God damn
You actin' like you fuckin' won a trophy and shit
This nigga turnt the fuck up

[Chorus: Future]
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
I'm rr off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy

[Verse 2: Future]
Gonna peel off like a bandit
I'm noddin' off on a Xanax
Get pissed off, start airin' it
Get a head start, ain't friendly
I stand out, I don't blend in
When I say that I meant that
I don't want to talk to you has-beens
I don't want features from nan them
I don't want features or nothin'
You can't even get on my guest list
They want me to go to the Met Gala
I want a Percocet and a gallon
That Actavis Hi-Tech it don't matter
We sittin' right on the courtside
I know the players on both side
I'm cashin' out, fuck a cosign
I wear the chain like a bowtie
I wear the ring like a fo'-five
Keep a fo'-five for the po' guys
Black tints, low profile
Celebratin' everyday
'Cause I'm really really fresh out the coke house
Countin' up every single day
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out

[Chorus: Future]
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
I'm rr off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy

[Intro]
Doin' well, dog
Yeah, me and all my
Yeah, me—yeah

[Chorus]
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

[Verse 1]
How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you where you're from, where yo bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine but I do know

[Chorus]
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

[Verse 2]
Oh, and I'm back, dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hitting like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Six-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it, then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the door's open, and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

[Chorus]
Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still—

[Outro]
Wow, all praise to the most high up...

[Verse 1]
Tesla shit on Edison, food should be your medicine
Started dropping elements, shit been crazy ever since
Food should be your medicine, Tesla shit on Edison
Started dropping elements, shit been crazy ever since
Don't ask me who I'm voting for, Donkey or a Elephant
I do not have a preference, now miss me with that extra shit
I am not a pessimist; I'm just too intelligent
I learned to see the world the way it is and make the best of it
A leader to a state is like a God to a Reverend
One hell of an entrance, even better when I'm exiting
Brand new 

[?], Ain't got time for questioning
Shooting through the rhetoric, I think I need an extra clip
I ain't got a ghostwriter; this is not a reference
I switch the style up, Eddy Gordo on some Tekken shit
Whoo!
Evidence, plus I got the evidence
Mother Earth, eh, what's up bitch? What's your measurements?
What if Donald Trump was really Mexican?
What if a Black Man never was President?

[Hook]
Flatline
Navigating the field of landmines
Black crime, Black Minds
There's no superior bloodline, Yeaup!

[Verse 2]
Fuck award shows, we need justice in the courtroom
When I get to talking real shit, they say "You bugging dude."
It's gonna take more than getting some trending on Twitter
It's gonna take more than fucking COEXIST bumper stickers!
The question, I always hear this question, "How did you get into the music business, were you let in? Or blessed in?"
I'm guessing, I never signed my name in blood or sacrificed my best friend
I got as far as I could go before I hit a dead end
Sit back and let it set in
Hollywood loves making niggas wear dresses
This is where I step in
And I know you don't wanna hear it
Nigga's writing conscious lyrics, just to sell out concert tickets
Nigga's buy or bought a Polo, Polo never sponsor niggas
Tommy never one of the niggas rocking Hilfiger
Niggas doing charity to be a real nigga, but when the camera's off they don't wanna deal with you

[Interlude: Dr. Sebi & Interviewer ]
When I had cured these people's sickle cell, and lupus, and herpes, and blindness, I was happy! I said "Now, I can go to all the leaders, I could go to Minister Farrakhan, I could go to Jesse Jackson, I could go to Al Sharpton, I could go to Oprah Winfrey, but what I found out, I was mistaken. I was wrong. They are NOT interested in the healing of any black people
That's an explosive claim
That is not an explosive statement! That is a reality! There isn't a black leader in America, that is interested in the health of the black race
You say that because they refused to interact with you?
They are not in the position to respond. If they were, my first case of Aids was cured in 1984. And since then, we've been curing people of lupus and herpes, and cancer and blindness, not ONE black leader ever said: "Well let us help the brother."

[Hook]
BANDZ!
Flatline
Fooled us for the last time
Flatline, Flatline
There's no superior bloodline, dead

[Outro]
(Panting)
(Beeping)
(Ding!) Lower Ground Floor
(Ding!) Ground Floor
(Footsteps)

People asking me, like "Why Bobby Ray saying all this crazy ass shit? You think he really means it?" Like this shit ain't crazy, this shit is real, dawg. He's always been rapping real shit

We go fast with the game we play (Game we play, game we play)
Who knows why it's gotta be this way (Be this way, be this way)
We say nothin' more than we need (Than we need, than we need)
I say, "Your place" when we leave

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Baby, this is what you came for

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Sometimes I get high to free my mind
Is that alright?
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I get drunk, to pass the time
Is that alright? Is that alright?
Right, right, right, right

[Hook: Marko Penn]
Let's roll up something, let's pour up something
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something
Let's pour up something
Let's roll up something, let's pour up something
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something
Let's pour up something

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Sometimes I get high to get you off my brain
Is that alright?
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I like to get wasted
Sometimes I like to get faded
Sometimes I like to get... wait, I forgot what I was finna say
Right, right, right, right

[Hook: Marko Penn]
Let's roll up something, let's pour up something
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something
Let's pour up something
Let's roll up something, let's pour up something
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something
Let's pour up something

[Hook: Marko Penn]
Let's roll up something, let's pour up something
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something
Let's pour up something

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Before the hoes was ever noticing
Bank was broken, full of overages
Crucified when​ I had spoken this
My heart was cold, it's so emotionless
Hear, hear, hear, hear, I can't hear my own thoughts
Hell yeah, yeah, yeah, silence every phone call
Too much thinking and too much time in the attic
Too much drinking and too much weed for my habit
Too much passion, and too much sweat for the average
Don't need to explain if you can't change what happened
Now who says, now who says I can't get stoned?
Now who cares, now who cares, who's right, who's wrong?
If you find it, be clear, a new life, a new era
A new flight with new stairs
You might move on and get faded
You might move on and upgrade it
You might move on and just get that bullshit out of the way
Right, right, right, right

[Hook: Marko Penn]
Let's roll up something, let's pour up something
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something
Let's pour up something
Right, right, right, right
Let's roll up something, let's pour up something
Let's roll, let's pour, let's roll up something
Let's pour up something

[Outro: B.o.B]
Sometimes I get high to free my mind
Is that alright?
Right, right, right, right

[Verse 1: Stat Quo]
I boss how I live
Fuck 'em hoe
God meant me
To push Bentleys
The Stat Quo
Still slammin' 'lac doors
This squad 'ill blow your brain out
Half-crazy
Bustin' out the window
Aight cut it, cook it, bag it
Distribute it through the city
Home get that cabbage
Take it, flip it
Turn illegal to legal
Launder, stay grindin'
Keepin' ya business on the under
Humble moves come up
Cops run up
But most of them corrupt
So what?
They want they cut
So pay 'em
All those who oppose the squad
Spray 'em
Got goons with MACs
Who kill for scratch
Okay I'm
One quick trip 'ill
And get you filled with gas
Broad day and niggas 'ill kill you
Without the mask
I'm getting bank
Like I'm shooting it from off the glass
Signed with Shady-Aftermath
Cause I'm after cash
Biatch

[Verse 2: Swift]
The way it go
Just heard my dog
Stat Quo flow
Ha, ya heard what he had to say
Use the words Swifty McVay
I'm ill enough to shoot a nigga through his pager
And if I missed
The shit's going exactly through his neighbor
My behavior's
Fatal enough to faint niggas
Old age and cradle
I shoot from unexpected angles
I changed ya facials
I could have you niggas hugging an angel
Literally
Niggas be crazy
I'm misery, breaking both of ya ankles
I diminish mentally
I turn you into a mimic of Kennedy
I don't go to sleep 'till I murder motherfuckers in trilogies
I recruit enemies
Friends ain't shit
They take yo ends and split
Willingly
What kind of shit got a nigga faking the funk
Dressed like George Clinton
But you hoes ain't making a buck
You out and about
With yo face frostbit
With a hustlin' mouth
But you really full of brussels sprouts
Husband or spouse
Your generation's running out
Because my gun's in ya mouth
Penetration coming (cumming) fast
We won, you lost
You got a witness program
Move out cold then John Walsh
Wild
And this the way we do
Emzy, Imma pass it to you
So what ya wanna do?

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
What I wanna do? What I wanna do?
Let me see right here, yo

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Not many people that I label would be able
To display table manners, but our plan is
To make this beat rock like scanners and make the fans just
Go bananas, yo, get our planners
That means our nuts for the sluts who don't under-
Stand this, yo, my plan is, yeah right
And y'all gon' stand there and act like you don't understand it
Like my name is Janet, my titty fell out and I ain't plan it
Yo, check this—check this out
And if you rocking with ya necklace out, that's my breakfast now
I'mma snatch it, yo, my style is wretched
You can't fetch it, no you can't stretch it
And yo, it doesn't really matter
Cause ya name I can't even pronunciate, you the—
Same type of mo'fucker to go and sucker
Punch Dre at the Vibe Awards, but he right behind the boards
The next day, so kiss an ass
Or kiss a dick, lick a dick, eat my ass
Whatever you won' do it's on you
Big Proof coming through with the mo—

[Verse 4: Proof]
Y'all niggas sing
Y'all done came to the Nina Ross war
Ya homie's a killa
But my killas they cost more
It's all inherited
I was boss born
Put eighteen in ya flesh
And make ya chest a golf course
Niggas know that we ain't even
You know why
(gasps) I'm still breathin'
Yeah I got that real heathen
With them steel beams on 'em
Through ya dreams on 'em
Like I'm still a fiend
Noted for mics
It's only right
You see my real team, brody
I do it live
I was sippin' on some cream soda
Heave phony
Fuck this back and forth
This ain't a tennis meet
I spray you industry gangstas
Cause they ain't in the streets
It's cool to beef
But why?
'Till you truce with or you trust me
I told you Puffy
And you can lose Big (B.I.G.)
I'm Proof
Who you could do big things with us
Spit dope
They call me Rick James bitch
Clip-clack
Bang-hit
Bang-drip
Drip fang of blood
Drip, drip, drank when sirens cop came
Body bag thick
Body bag, zip-zip
That's it
Fuck you bitch

[Stat Quo]
Down a dark street
It's the dirty Stat Quo
Lord have mercy
Breathe, hello I'm 'bout my cheese
The steez, mellow
Cash in the bank
On my grind in the paint
Oh, look how I do live with my boy Westwood
Up to no good
Smoking that good shit
See how I ball
Handle, handle my business
Eminem, Swift, P, Stat Quo that's it
Back on the track
Green Lantern done switched the beat
I'm guaranteed to my thang and drop the heat
My man Zeke is in the corner with him
Boss Hog, A-town, yes I be them
Do what I do freestyle, top of the dome
Don't fuck with my click
Leave Doc Dre alone
If I see you out the wars
Imma stab yo' ass
Whoop yo' ass
Ya fuck with me
I make ya handicap
And I pass the mic to my man Swifty
McVay he don't play

[Swift]
I'm Swifty McVay
Ya bastard out the blue
I'm hazard
I even haunt spirits that's after you
I'm cancerous with no answer
Pharmaceutic, I turn you allergic to being human
It ain't new
It's what I do when I'm feudin'
A sick nuisance
I have ya had
Until motherfuckers lookin' like Rick Rubin
What do you do to fools that think that they can take laughs?
Their face get sliced
And that's what's up
I inherit the power of all the rappers
I gotta be like Kruger
All them niggas bodies are coming out of me
I usually pack a Ruger
Now I see that I can be successful
By bruisin' yo chest
Without a thing
A professional
I'm a king that slaughtered kings
Exceptional, genetically raised by wolverines nigga
I give a fuck on what niggas seen
I'll send a fiend to pitifully raise you
And then convene bitch
That's what we do
Our crew D12
Rapping nigga
In take the Nina off the shelf
And I'm hazard for ya health
Like I said before
The type to walk the streets
And the five-o ignore
Me when they see me
Dog, I'll burn you like VD
And that's the way we be
Fuck you!

[Tim Westwood]
Easy, easy
I'm trying to hold a job down here
Yeah, yeah
I apologize if anyone's offended
You know tune out go to something else
Come back later
It's going down
It's real hip-hop
There's gonna be some swear words
Be prepared
Change the station if you ain't built

[Eminem]
Aftermath in the house now
Get yo' fricking mouth stabbed out
Y'all get so mad
Get so livid
Looking for dap from anyone who would give it
Now how you gon' value
Someone else's opinion
Cause you selfish
I'm rap's Elvis
Everybody try to grab the helm-ets and they hardhats
Run and duck for cover
Yo, fuck ya mother
What the fuck are ya?
Yo, I'm sprayin'
While I'm playin'
I ain't playin'
I'm sprayin' at your feet
Like hey Imma cock the hand
Imma pull my cock out
Outta my pajamas
And cock back the cock
Like it's chicken
Yo, check it out
The clock is ticking
It's countdown to Armageddon
And there's nothing you can do to stop it
Put your arm or head in
Or put a pen in it
But once the grenade pin is pulled
It's nothing you could do
But end up in the hospital
Yeah, yeah
Hospital, pital, 'spitals
End up in the 'spital
And y'all can eat my tender vittles
I don't really give a fudge
Fudge, fudge-packers
Is what y'all are
And y'all get smacked up
At the awards show
However you want it to go
We can make it go either way
Biatch
That's itch-bay backwards
F around and smack turds
They told us not to use no cuss words
So we gon' not use cuss words
And say busters instead
Have you all bleeding red
Damn, right out of yo' head
That's what I said
And my name ain't Fred
My name ain't special ed
And it ain't my birthday
But Proof can get on the mic in the worst way
And I don't even have to curse to say

[Proof]
Proof's a wolf
Grab ya pooper-scooper
Follow me
I fight to the death
Like Apollo Creed
I only hang with bitches that swallow seeds
Air Force Ones not Wallabees
Hollow tease
I be, rushin' colonies
I'm known by all blacks in hoods
Like collard greens
Last of a dyin' breed
Old school like Model Ts
When I ride on my rivalries
Like 2Pac writ
Put you in the I.C.U
With no eye sockets
More than five shots spit
So you can die hot bitch
It's only one topic
I need profit
Fuck the gossip
Harry the hype-writer
The night lighter
The only thing higher than Proof
Nigga is my lighter
I'm watchin' you fly niggas crash
Like Al-Qaeda
Crime fighter
Guess I rhyme by the mind tighter
Than the World Trade
Bit the jaws
Like Jay Dee
I put my fucking dick to broads
Broads, dog that's down on all fours
Of course I'm down to get yours
How come my niggas stop cold
When they heard capsule?
The rap flow is good
And they say that we fatsos
They gotta be this way
And we catch 'em with lassos
And how they feel about that?
Cause we breaking they cash flow
My niggas tell me right there
I ain't got no time
So know why fool
Dropped outta high school
Cause Slim said so
Now I'm back in this bitch
And I'm 'bout to ride this bitch
And this motherfucker rockin'
For Tim, asshole
I gotta do this shit right
Now Swift is on my left
So it's the way it is
Cause Shady in here
I'm 'bout to tell you niggas right now
Green is on the turntable
Why not do this shit daily, all year

[Stat Quo]
Hey doll, cheer
It's a grown man record
You don't want the pressure
This a grown man lecture
Sittin' on the dresser
Be a grown man bitch to her
Underneath my seat's a grown weather here
Peepin' my packer
He got grown man cheddar
Wheels, ransom notes, and checks
Are all grown letters
Hey doll, chill
Sit back relax, as I handle by biz
Green Lantern on the scratch
Attack the track wrong
Stat Quo doing his thing
The European awards was yesterday
Em won
Took the award home
D12, ya know what I mean
Shawty, be grown
Handle my business home
Doing my thing
Home alone
But not Macaulay Culkin
Stat Quo be the champion
Icon winner
Eat niggas like dinner
Me and Westwood, handlin' our beeswax
Green Lantern on the track
Doc Dre did it long time ago
Like this and like that
And uh
I'm motherfucking beast
Man uh
Pass it to Swifty Mc-V
And ain't no flick
To hear what my be sayin'

[Swift]
One-two, three to the four
Swifty with the four-four
Process of elimination is always complete
When I hit the streets
I wanna see who the biggest G
Hennessy don't do nothing but give you lumps
When you speakin' on us
Disrespect you be eatin' a bottle drunk
Turning you niggas all to monks
Red dots amongst ya foreheads
You get punctured once
Slump cowards with Ninas bitch
I mean it, how ya leanin'
Like the Tower of Pisa
Faces lookin' like pizzas
An animal instinct
I eat ya with cannibalistic procedures
Adam's apple some womens' fetuses
Me is just like special nature
I messed up, slurring my words off the liquor
And yes I hate to
See ya wack emcees
Step inside my face
And ya know my fo-fo (four-four) will clear the place
Ya runnin', I'm gunnin'
I'm stunnin' and it's fun when it happens
Especially when I'm rapping
I give dap to brothers I'm cool with
But yo know
You can't mess around with Swift
Ya just cool whip
Ya soft and ya sweeter than sugar
Dog, I'm just that type of nigga
That 'ill walk up on ya
Leave ya in a bed of blood
Huh, if ya tryna fuck with us
He said don't cuss
But I couldn't help it
I take my belt off whip ya wit'  it
Because I'm selfish
So I, just do the things I do
I freestyle for you
Then I pass it to my crew
Then they pass it back
And if ya wack
Then get slapped
For that type of

[Eminem]
Acid rap
Yeah and that's a fact
Slim Shady's back
Got eighty ladies layin' on they back
Yo, but I'm a mack
I'm a little nuts for Brittany
Little to sane for Whitney
Tell you the truth
Yo, Bobby would prolly get me
Catch me in the lobby
After he just hit me
After he sniffed three lines
He'd prolly knock out Fifty
He could prolly lift up both of us
And spin us both on both fingers like donuts
Yo, I party hard
But for real, I want Bobby Brown as my bodyguard
And that's for real
And that's the deal
Cause we got mass appeal
And I don't think that they can really take it
Cause I always let my nuts hang
Like I was doing push-ups naked
That's what I do
Is drink the Alizé and
Then I pass it to my man Proof and
Then we start goofin' around
And start spoofin'
Everybody, yo we in the party
And we could rock the party
And we could get it started
And if ya smell like (sniff)
Somebody farted
Or we can
We can do the Mardi Gardy
We could party harder
We could get started
What you wanna do
Proof, it's on you

[Proof]
It's on me
Might take it to the hip, homie

It's like Shady and Aftermath
We after cash
You want it
We gon' blast ya ass
(4x)

And listen, ya need to quit it dog
Cause Proof is low to the ground
Like midget balls
With them bridges falls
I lock ya ass up on the game
And I visit all
And it's like they signed
They said they did it all
Because they breeches small
But Imma tell you
In the likeness of the great 2Pac
I'm hot
And I'm fatter then Biggie Smalls
All y'all, need to recognize
Cause where I come from
It's still the East side
Over there by Dresden
Where we make their heads spin
Back then the back, ten
Make his ass backspin
This action of crack-skin
Nigga, I eat more Vicodin
Than the dots that's on the Pac-Man, board
Oh Lord
Give me my sword
On top of that
The freestyles I got you can't afford
But they free
Yo, they only cost attention
And did I mention
I'm a boss with henchmen
I send niggas to get ya
Yo, it's easy to do
How ya feel about this
Yo, the piece of the Proof
The piece of the clue
The pieces ya need
The pieces I got
On top of that my freestyle
Never stutter
My words are butter-rock
Like the niggas feel about us
I say precise
Nigga feel fucked up like D-Nice, did
For getting Scott La Rock slain
I rock 'caine and rock brains
Back in the day, when ya block came
Get ya block slain
Ya hood aborted
How I feel when they all get shortened
Haha
And I tell ya like this
Ya missing the ending
I lift ya whole hood
Like I'm fixing ya engine
Nigga, come on

[Stat Quo]
I keep my brim tilted
And tracked, I killed it
Atlanta, my city
I built it
Watch this
Young beast bob and weave
Young Stata (Status) make it hard to breathe
Please believe
I ball for cheese
Survival of the fittest
One of the trillest ever
Bow down, he severe
Finna lock the market
Marshall and Dre don' linked up
With the boy from the A
I am chillaxin'
Fine linen in my fashion
Bump yo' questions
Why you askin', anythang?
Niggas wanna know what I'm on
Riding on my enemies
Getting them gon' huh
A crime businesses
And you need homes
Something I can flip to increase my grip
Yo, why they on my dick?
Ride ya own lane
I gotta handle
Trust me lil' man
Ya need a little change
Here's for starters
I show ya how to come up
Work on martyr
Launder ya cheese
Do cash and beauty parlors
Hustle smarter
Green got me, haha
Green got me
Imma kill you Green

[Swift]
To me it's like second nature
I treat murders like a recreation
And these niggas steadily changing
They laughs like Mason
T.D. Jakes and all of these fake gangstas
They all be awaking
Because McVay can put a date on you homes
I'll engrave in ya tombstone
With urination
Now your whole funeral soon blown
Communication are for fools who be wasting time
Contemplating on making up
I ain't that guy
A grudge holder
I used to shove boulder in the counsel of my Aurora
Get caught and tell 'em it's yours
I can leave each one of ya body parts
Stranded in the middle of different forests
Having police ignore the shit
Niggas get hung like ornaments
While they hanging they trees
They get bombed like Vietnamese
In '46 or whatever year it was
I gotta buzz
And murdering you is all I love
This is Swifty McVay
I ain't by myself
I got Em, Proof, and Stat that be hot
And D12 is over, D12 is over here
And yo' death is near
And that's what's up

[Eminem]
That's what's up
Pass this cup
And then we blast you up
Freestyle right off the massive truck
We got truckloads
And uff, no
Cuff no and spin it backwards
And play it back later
Cause all y'all haters rockin' gators
Alligators, we see ya later
We ain't player haters
But yo check it out
We rockin' in our Navigators
And we can sit back
And we can stretch, we can check
Trek, I mean catch, anything
And we can fetch
I'm slurring a little bit
But during the part that I was doing
The urination, upon that girl and
Wait a minute, I ain't goin'
There with my rap
I ain't tryin' to be starting no crap
But yo, I be flowin'
With the stuff and I be knowin'
That when I start raking out them leaves
I be hoein'
And that's six in the mornin'
And we can do it
We can get it on until the crack of dawn and
We can get it on with Tim Westwood
We can do whatever you want
Bring ya best cause
We do what we want to do
On this microphone
Cause we ought to know
Or ought to inform you
That we get warm too warm
Sometimes we too hot to
Not to spit this ish
Spit it backwards and that said shit
Whoops, I didn't mean to curse
But yo Proof, come back
And lay one verse

[Proof]
I don't bite
But I spit the killin' venom
When I'm older
My pockets gon' blow up like Brazilian women
You can fight me here
Like some Big (B.I.G.) and Pac shit
Breaking laws off him dog
And hypnotic, he got it
Although he sound sober
I ain't gay nowhere near gay
I even hate a brown-noser
It's over, he killa
Got no skills
When these twenty-two spins
Ain't got nothing to do with Diablo wheels
Even the bible kills
I burn moral themes
Y'all pop like MTV
And talk more than Coral Jeanne
The poor foreseen that there is a God
I hope you guys slack
Cause when I lean back
Without the Terror Squad
I gotta two bigger
Then pistol move niggas whip
I leave fool ass lit
Like a cool cigarette
I'm 'bout the peace dude
In fact the peaceful
Since these niggas know my piece full
And since they watchin' Beef too
They watchin' niggas out here
They see how we go
Back in the day
With what, my people
The desert eagle
Leaving people living in deceased holes
How they feel about that?
My truck is all diesel
Freeze hoes
These people know it
G.L. in detail
They break like Lee nail
Crew is D12
More noise than a seashell
Cause we shall prevail
Without the Martin Luther King drill

[Eminem]
How you know the main side, so attraction
Psycho action
The man 'ill throw up on Michael Jackson
Sick enough to do anything
In any video
I could even pull out my whole titty yo
Wouldn't mean a damn thing
Wouldn't mean nothing
Like if you went and pulled hamstring
Cause you a fake 'iatch
I took the b off
Cause Imma be off with the switch
Just like you
Cause you walk with a switch too
That's what I meant
Cause I represent, every single day
Pass it off to Stat

[Stat Quo]
I'm so slum
I pull up in a double-quad deuce with no roof
On them big ass boots
White tee, no suit
Just me and my troop
Jam and be some hustlers
We are not a group
Grizzles, love me cause my smile is priceless
My advice, my life
I have them wetter than diapers
She want me to buy big jewels and wife her
Fuck the bitch tonight
But tomorrow won't like her
Go back to the club
And get a new one like her
And that's what I call completing a cypher
Wrassle with the bitches so they call me Roddy Piper
When a Stat come through
Your girlfriend get hyper

[Swift]
You be in the ocean with the worms and maggots
I'm what overdoses do for an addict
And after static with me
Holy ghosts will be given a homes
Automatically, it's either that or be rolled in a hole
I target ya dome
Watch that shit get blown
Like a head gasket
See I'm rabid
And known to foam acid
I accurately mastered battering bastards
I don't get charged for assault and battery
They be after me
Cause I smashed 'em
Happily answering
Any nigga that asks me would happen
I tell 'em the truth laughin'
That's just me
A five-star general
With aura that's horrible
I be smackin' ya captain
Turn a corpse into ya corporal
They won't know who did it
Tell your lieutenant
When an arsenal is set
For all of those threats of coming close
No you won't
With a Stephen King mentality
Ya don't believe me?
I can bring the casualty to ya family
And that's what's up
I got D12 in the house
Ya know what we about
Are you a man, a mouse?
And it seems like you a mouse
Running in that hole
Just cause you hoe
And everybody know
McVay yeah

[Proof]
See I'm going out
Blow 'em up
They wanna see me, what I'm all about
Pull 'em out
I'm in the club
Got the snub
'Bout to bust it out
Boy hear me, 'bout to hear me
'Bout to cuss a dog
I can't take it

[Eminem]
Can't cuss it dog
Take it dog
Ayo, get with the
With the girl
Better take it off
She got the bra better shake it y'all
Ayo, check it out
I'm about to bull
And wreck it out

[All]
Smack 'em with shovels
Smack 'em with shovels
Smack 'em with shovels
Smack 'em with shovels

[Eminem]
You gon' make us freestyle for all
Make us freestyle for all
Make us freestyle for all
Make us freestyle for all
Tim you gon' make us freestyle for all

[All]
Freestyle forever
Freestyle forever
Freestyle forever

[Eminem]

*Drake premiered the full length album 'VIEWS' in this OVO Radio Episode* - You can find new songs and lyrics on Genius*

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I’m a writer and a lover
I’m a Midwest music man
And I’ve been to a lot of places
But I’m gon’ end where I began
I took class in Carolina
Got high smoking joints
And now they know my name in Paris

[Hook: Mike Posner]
But I’ll be buried in Detroit
Next to my father, and my father’s father, too
I used to live in New York City
But, baby, that ain’t no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I’ve made love in every city
But I’ll be buried in Detroit

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
I don’t claim to be a prophet, I just speak my mind
I try to tell it like it is and sometimes God makes it rhyme
I like my songs how I like my women
Honest and to the point
You see I got fucked up in Stockholm

[Hook: Mike Posner]
But I’ll be buried in Detroit
Next to my father, and my father’s father, too
I used to live in New York City
But, baby, that ain’t no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I’ve made love in every city
But I’ll be buried in Detroit

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Man, I always kept it righteous knowing it would come back to me
Even when my hunger was outweighing the strategy
And now I pray to God like I hope you a map for me
Up at 5 am like nobody want it as bad as me
I guess hunger either kill you or it energize you
Motor city, boy, I been a driver
The young Detroit legend, I swear I got the city inspired
And bought Em out, too, just to solidify it
D-boy, d-boy, that's how I was raised
Boss up and put the city on, forever my ways
Me and ma started a charity to give the kids clarity
And take it further than the foundation we laid
Thanksgiving Day parade, I got carried through the city
And after that, I hope I get married in the city
And after that, I hope I get buried in the city
Even when I'm gone, you still gon' hear me through the city

[Outro: Mike Posner]
Buried in Detroit
Whoa ho, whoa ho
Buried in Detroit
Whoa ho, whoa ho
Buried in Detroit
I'm so angry at my, idiotic barber!
Think I'll stay in here 'till, it grows out a little!
Got a lousy Haircut! A really stupid haircut!
What a silly haircut! I can't believe this haircut!

[Chorus]
Any wasp I see, it's a fig wasp
Pearly guillotine, it's a fig wasp
And when the harvest's clean, there's a fig wasp
It's a winged machine, it's a fig wasp
Any wasp I see, it's a fig wasp
Pearly guillotine, it's a fig wasp
And when the harvest's clean, there's a fig wasp
It's a winged machine, it's a fig wasp

[Verse 1]
Did your God know
Insects grow in my pome?

[Refrain]
BIG FIG WASP!
BIG FIG WASP!

[Chorus]
Any wasp I see, it's a fig wasp
Pearly guillotine, it's a fig wasp
And when the harvest's clean, there's a fig wasp
It's a winged machine, it's a fig wasp

[Verse 1]
Did your God know
Insects grow in my pome?

[Refrain]
BIG FIG WASP!

[Chorus]
Any wasp I see, it's a fig wasp
Pearly guillotine, it's a fig wasp

[Refrain]
BIG FIG WASP!
BIG FIG WASP!

[Verse 2]
Ficain eating corpses
There's a hornet in my throat!

[Refrain]
BIG FIG WASP!
BIG FIG WASP!

[Robot Stop Chorus]
My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same I know
My only difference
Is robot influence

[Post-Chorus]
I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
I'm the door when you come for more
One, two, three!

[Album Chorus]
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Wait for the answer to open the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door

[Hook]
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah wah

[Verse 1]
I can feel the earth is moving
Underneath my hoofed foots earthing
Fire protrudes from whence I'm pointing
Fading every jewel
Thronged upon the rock and metal
There's a horde inside this temple
Mass around your favorite devil
Learn to make them cry

[Hook]
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah wah

[Verse 2]
See him hover way up high
He is the bat with 16 eyes
He has a thirst to satisfy
A craving for your blood
Now here comes the wolves with whips
And 40 goats with pitchfork sticks
And look there is a lunatic
He wants to make you cry

[Hook]
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah
Wah wah wah wah wah

[Verse 3]
I'm the chieftain of your feelings
I'm the God of air you're breathing
You can not escape my dealings
I will make you cry

[Intro]
Hoo! Ha! Hoo!
Hoo! Ha! Hoo!

[Verse 1]
It gets old when you talk to the sun
In a tongue understood by no one
Can it be that I hear what he's saying?
Is there a reason why I'm still awake?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And he says, "I've got you written in a black book by the railroad track. You see, I know your fate." (Ooh)
And I say, "You've got to listen; I'm a songbird with a brand new track. You underestimate." (Oh, oh, oh!)

[Chorus 1]
I'll give you something to believe in (Ah-ah ah-ah)
Burn up a basement full of demons (Oh-oh oh-oh)
Realize you're a slave to your mind, break free
Now give me something to believe in

Just give me (Ah-ah ah-ah)
Just give me something to believe in

[Verse 2]
Everyday when I speak to the moon
Pale as a ghost in the afternoon
Tragedy has a hold of my mind
But I can see the light between the lines

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I say, "You've got to listen; I'm a songbird with a brand new track. You underestimate."

[Chorus 2]
I'll give you something to believe in (Ah-ah ah-ah)
Burn up a basement full of demons (Oh-oh oh-oh)
Realize you're a slave to your mind, break free
Now give me something to believe in

[Bridge]
(Oh-oh oh-oh) Promise me
(Oh-oh oh-oh)
See, I'm afraid— I'm a slave to my mind
You give me something to believe in

[Pre-Chorus 1]
"I've got you written in a black book by the railroad track. You see, I know your fate." (Mm)
And I say, "You've got to listen; I'm a songbird with a brand new track. You underestimate."

[Chorus]
I'll give you something to believe in (Ah-ah ah-ah)
Burn up a basement full of demons (Oh-oh oh-oh)
Realize you're a slave to your mind, break free
Just give me something to believe in
Just give me
Just give me something to believe in

[Chorus]
People-vultures, God approaches
Final hearing
What else have I got left to spew down?

[Verse 1]
People-vultures waiting to begin
Deadly ulcers feeding on my skin

[Verse 2]
People-vultures waiting at my stage
Wild dogs escaping from their cage

[Chorus]
People-vultures, God approaches
Final hearing
What else have I got left to spew down?

[Chorus]
People-vultures, God approaches
Final hearing, disappearing
Tainted voodoo, headless guru
Final head-spin
What else have I got left to spew down?
What else have I got left to spew down?
What else have I got left to spew down?
What else have I got left to spew down?
What else have I got left to spew down?

[Verse 3]
People-vultures crowding at my door
Parasites are eating more and more

[Chorus]
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat

[Verse 1]
Latent gun beamed for my head
It's a wonder that I tread
Overworn ground through my youth
Making all my dreams come true

[Chorus]
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat  I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat  I only miss a beat

[Verse 2]
Happy days seem so absurd
Lightning that's unlikely heard
Nova sunshine while I nap
Making all my dreams so sad

[Chorus]
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat  I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat  I only miss a beat

[Bridge]
Don't miss the bar, we play here
Already ringing in my ears
Don't miss the bar, it's right here
Only a beat disappears

[Chorus]
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat  I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat  I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat  I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat  I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat  I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat  I only miss a beat
Only miss a beat
Only miss a beat
Only miss a beat
Only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat  I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat  I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat  I only miss a beat

[Verse 1]
You started everything
You started killing things
You started severing limbs

[Hook]
Evil death roll
Now

[Verse 2]
You float and wait for me
Your scales are hard and green
Open your jaw for me

[Hook]
Evil death roll
Now
Evil death roll
Now

[Chorus]
The night is young - full of sin
Time to slither away again
I can see our history hanging on a knife

[Verse 3]
So let's start dueling here
I have nothing to fear
I'm grinning ear to ear

[Hook]
Evil death roll
Now
Evil death roll
Now

[Chorus]
The night is young - full of pain
Time to slither away again
I can see our history hanging on a knife
So let's start killing things

[Instrumental]

[Invisible Face Verse]
You distort the notion of the place
The universe's other face
The speed of light has slowed apace
The universe's other face

[Invisible Face Chorus]
What it is
Impossible
Gravity
The universe
Has me
Invisible face

[Album Chorus]
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Wait for the answer to open the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Wait for the answer to open the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
One, two, three, four!

[Chorus]
The night is young - full of sin
Time to slither away again
You can see our history hanging on a knife

[Verse 4]
So let's start killing things
'Cos you started everything
And let's start severing limbs

[Hook]
Evil death roll
Now
Evil death roll

[Verse 1]
I distort the notion of the place
The universe's other face
The speed of light has slowed apace
The universe's other face

[Chorus]
What it is
Impossible
Gravity
The universe
Has me
Invisible face
Invisible face
Invisible face

[Verse 2]
I climb up the stalk and plant the bean
The universe is a machine
That has awoken from a dream
The universe is a machine

[Chorus]
What it is
Impossible
Gravity
The universe
Has me
Invisible face
Invisible face
Invisible face

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I climb up the stalk and plant the bean
The universe is a machine
That has awoken from a dream
The universe is a machine

[Chorus]
What it is
Impossible
Gravity
The universe
Has me
Invisible face

[Verse 1]
The spawn of Satan's back
It's made of steel and black
It comes to bring you pain
It comes again and again

[Hook]
Road Train!

[Verse 2]
The spawn of Satan's here
It's come to bring you fear
It sets the road aflame
It comes to kill and maim

[Hook]
Road Train!

[Verse 3]
Lights that shine like bulging eyes
Keep on trucking through the night
The vortex opens through
Drive right in and straight through you

[Verse 4]
The spawn of Satan comes
It's carting oil drums
It's racing down the lane
With oily fiery rain

[Hook]
Road Train!

[Verse 5]
26 gears of petrol power
Keep on trucking hour by hour
One man is at the wheel
He's the dog at Satan's heel

[Bridge]
Across the desert to the trees
Obliteration of the place
From the fire into the sea
Nonagon Infinity
Is coming!

[Verse 6]
The spawn of Satan speeds
The road beneath it bleeds
It comes to bring you shame
It comes again and again

[Hook]
Road Train!

[Verse 7]
Burning wheels of fiery red
Keep on trucking till we're dead
This beast is angry too
Drive real fast and eat up you

[Album Chorus]
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Is coming!
Before we do this I just wanna say thanks man. Thank you for the years you spent working with some of Toronto's true legends honing your craft. Thanks you for dropping everything to work with me after we met and realized we had something special. Thank you for pushing yourself despite the fact you should be resting to achieve an end goal that we are both obsessed with. Thank you for listening to me vent and talking me off ledges. Thank you for talking me out of sending every good song I make to someone else 😂. Thank you for reminding me that we set out to do something more than just have the biggest song in the club or the biggest song of the month. Thank you for building SOTA. Thank you for caring about the people in this city as much as I do. Thank you for a lifetime of hard work and surreal moments. This story would have gone a lot different without you. Thank you 40 (aka DB40 aka Cuarenta aka Bibber aka My brother). Text me when you are ready to start the next one 😂😂😂  @ovo40
To be completed

[Zane Lowe + Drake]
Alright, this is it right? We are rolling and we're recording, let's begin. This is a very special broadcast of OVO Sound Radio right here, Beats 1, Apple Music.  Long time coming man.  Long time coming man...long time coming, an exciting time, an exciting night for obvious reasons. Any way, man, here we are in the Safe House this is kind of...I suppose the official home of OVO Sound, this is the heart now of OVO Sound, here in Toronto, OVO house based in Toronto. Uhm...It's 40's spot, where the music gets made.

40's...uh  what do they call it, like a brain child, brain child? This is 40's creation from the ground up...I mean I was here, man, when there were no walls. I was here when there was no...not even a hint of a studio, or any...and uhm, he saw it through to the end. I mean, incredible execution on a vision that he had from the very...very early on. I know he's always...he's always enjoyed living in the same space that he works in. So he's been able to build this...build this complex that we utilize to get the job done, yeah.

When you walked in here for this first time, because I always thinking like....rooms you can catch a vibe pretty quick Yeah  And you know 40 obviously build this, you were there for the process...and when, you know, he called you in for the first session...did you, did you catch a vibe? Did you record something that first night?

I was here, uhm, I was here a few times as you know...I was here when this room first started functioning and everything else wasn't built. I think....I think maybe the first...one of the first things we did here that got released was probably "Back to Back" ironically enough, but I think that was kinda when we were kind of....That's how you, uh, that's how you broke the bottle on the bow? Haha that was like one of the first...  On that track? That was like one of the first thingsWow.  that we actually recorded and it...and it...Tangible energy from the get-go.

I mean, you know, just...  Get it done. execution, man, just following suit. I watched 40 execute so I had to come in here and execute too, that's it.  How many visitors really...I mean I know there's a lot of people in here tonight for obvious reasons, because, you know, we're tryna capture something. You know...but, uhm, you know, when it's, when it's... business time, how many...how many visitors generally roll through here? Cause the vibe I get is you guys keep it pretty...pretty light.

Yeah, I don't really. I'm not really into, like, a whole bunch of people and distraction, uhm...I have, you know, I have respect for everybody and their craft in whatever they do. So I expect the same thing when people come in here, I don't want a bunch of hustle and bustle, talking and...loud you know. And...and the other thing that's tough when you invite people in the studio...is they're obviously coming to watch something happen. Right.

And...and it doesn't always happen every night.  You know...it's not like every night is some magic moment. I mean, there's nights of frustration, there's nights of nothingness, there's night of just...you know, uh...these little tactical, uh, things. That clinical, surgical edits and stuff that...it gets you know Housekeeping. Right. I pretty much gauge the, uhm... characters that are allowed to sit in here based off of how they conduct themselves on those type of nights.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And I think I have a pretty immediate, immediate team that is able to sit in here and I...I...I...I don't want to notice you, and that's not to be offensive,  I just don't want to know that you're here. I want to be able to...to get up and just go in there and spill you know. Not worry about people's feelings Yeah. or tensions or any of that, that makes perfect sense, you know. Today unless...you change your mind Laughing  the album's done It's done. 40 sent it while the game was on. It's crazy, I mean we're literally watching the Raptors while 40 was...you know... Mhm.  I think the line was  from Noel was "right now we've been finished for seven seconds." Yeah hahahahaha.

Vincent like came in, he was like "but nah, I sent the...I sent the email seven minutes ago, we've been finished for seven minutes." And he want to his computer and he was like "ah, I never sent it."  The game clock was kinda measuring the album clock too you know, it's synonymous tonight. Oh man the world clock has been measuring the album now...and, and to a certain extent that's your fault. Cause back on August the 6th in 2014 you announced the name of the record. Yeah.
Now...now I have...I spoke to your friend Skepta about announcing records prematurely.  Mhm. And he was pretty straight about it, he wish he hadn't done it. He felt the pressure of announcing Konichiwa way up front, added additional pressure to him. I mean...you did it almost two years before you delivered the record. How did it work for you making that announcement, you know... in 2014?

I think the...the announcement was more than just the album title, it was just a shift in the city. You know, that we, uh...we saw an opening there. You know, it was, it was, the name took on a life of it's own. Uhm...and now the city is obviously referred to as, as what it is...Yeah.  Uhm...and yeah, I mean...I...we're...me and Oliver are always, are very cautious about that. Uh...we never wanna prematurely announce anything, but I kinda feel like, like it's crazy that you say two years cause t really doesn't feel like two years. I mean, yeah, I just had this plan to finish this album and then...but I, I remember I was like "oh man, well you know, I'm gonna do a mixtape."

Just cause I'm just like at this place, where I'm..I'm in this hotel every night, I just wanna make rap music, and I always, always wanted to make a, a project with Boi-1da. Uh...just like, exclusively like his... his brand of music, like just hard ish, like uh...trying to snap as much as I could and get as many joints as I could in, in a short amount of time. Uhm...and so that's kind of, you know, I was really adamant about finishing that mixtape first and then I said, okay then I'll move on. I mean, when we...when we do these albums, and especially if it's me and 40...it's never not been me and 40...but, when me and 40 lock in.  We really lock in  ...yeah.  and we take it very seriously and it's not... it's not like some rush job, you know? We...we, we'll sit there and, and we...like I said some nights we don't even come here and make music some nights we just talk yeah... we talk and we listen and you know, we try and figure out, what...what the direction is and what...what works for me...  It seems to me,  that might be a distinction because you blur the lines so successfully, it helps in the evolution of mixtapes. They've been around in existence for a long time and yet when you started to do and some of your peers started to do it at a similar time, these mixtapes were becoming blockbusters in their own right. They weren't just moving the streets anymore, they were actually moving the sales and the charts and you were touring off the back of these things.

Well, well that was it, I went...I wnt on a full-blown tour off of If You're Reading This It's Too Late....  It's crazy. ...and it went straight to iTunes  and I feel like that's like a...that's a hundred percent a possibility, same thing we do with a lot of the OVO Sound artists, you know, it's like, why not? You put all this time  and they're all original sounds, why should shouldn't it be able to be...you know, I understand, I understand...the...the joy of getting a free body of work from somebody, but you know, this is like one of the only platforms we have left to like generate interest and income and all these, you know, these...get the attention and make it that easy to access... and focus... as opposed to going to ten different places to try and find it once links are being you know...so I mean...  It's focusing your audience, isn't it  ultimately?  Yeah and that's really what it's about right now, is, is...and that's, I mean not to shamelessly plug but even...you know, what we've been doing with Apple Music and stuff like that...it's like you know, just focusing the audience and giving them a place to go and hone in on this one hub to go get everything.

Uhm...but with that being said, you know, I...I finished that tape and I was really happy with it a lot of the songs got bigger than expected and we had to go do some shows... I wondered that...I wondered, you know, if it...I mean I know you dropped it in the early hours in the morning and it was just like "Wake up surprise, here's a Drake record" and everything else, but i know how I felt about that album and millions of other people do as well and that record has become, in many respects, a modern-day classic...and I wondered if that caught you off guard?

Uhm...yeah I definitely...I definitely always just treated it like a mixtape. I...I was never...you know, even the difference between this album and that is like...the...the time we spent on the transitions, the layering of the production, the...the changes...just, just...sonically even, the time that 40 and Gadget put in...uhm, you know...this was just a tape that we did in my hotel room at the end of the day...Laughing so, I mean, it's...it's great that people love it, I mean, I always just looked at it as a bridge to get to where we're...we're at today. And then...and then from that, I mean, I ended up going to Atlanta and sitting with Future for six days and he's just a...  a monster  ...he's a machine, it's crazy, I've never seen anybody with that much of a catalog...like I mean, songs that I still think about to this day that I heard in that studio, that I'm like "when is that coming out?"

Oh, I've seen him...I've seen people loading projects

[Verse 1: Drake]
Right, my yiy just changed
You just buzzed the front gate
I thank God you came
How many more days could I wait?
I made plans with you
And I won't let 'em fall through

[Chorus: Drake]

All the energy that you bring to me
My last girl would tear me apart
But she'd never wanna split a ting with me

[Chorus: Drake]
But when it comes to you, you
I think I'd lie for you
I think I'd die for you
Do things when you want me to
Like controlla, controlla, yeah
Like controlla, controlla, yeah

[Bridge: Drake]
And I’m never on a waste ting shawty
I do it how you say you want it
Them girls, they just wanna take my money
They don't want me to give you nothing
They don't want you to have nothing
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'
They don't wanna see me
Smiling back when they pree (Jheeze!)

[Outro: Beenie Man]

Hundred bands in the damn Bible

But these niggas ain't even fightas
And these niggas ain't even buyers
I heard they leasing everything they ridin' in
And all they kids passed out in the play pen
Made a million dollars I'm amazing
They was popping collars I was patient
That's a massive foul nigga flagrant
Got on hella chains like a slave bitch
And I'm at it never comtemplatin'
Nigga gripping tan up the damn street
R.I.P. to Bankroll Fresh street
Niggas ridin' tan up the S40
The Maserati like the Kash Doll
When the drought come bring them bags out
I'm in LA bring the plaid out
Put the monkey bitches lookin' sad out
Watch a rich nigga issue cash out

[Hook]
If Texas love was a drug (You’d belong to me)

If Texas was a drug
If Texas showed the love

I'd never never share
I want it all in my belly

I want it all in my hair
I want it all on my bae

You was tripping cause I had your baby momma at the spot
She was with my hoe though nigga

Big racks stuffed in my D squares

Smoking on gas in the old one, wrist's cold, Minnesota

Had to buy a new Rover, fucking in a Rolls Royce
Girl, you know your pussy moist, what you need is your choice

Drive the car like a race, whip it, whip it
Gear six in the rain, skiddin', skiddin'
Big back, titties, dig that, yeah, she pretty

Wouldn't ever pretend you could see these skengs
Free range, no aiming the lens
Waste boys mainly lean on feds
We team, no cream, shook ones and they've been on edge

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yeah, look, acting all sadity when a nigga in your city

And I don't pillow talk with a hoe, that's a no no
In the morning, shaderoom, she be telling all your business
And now I got a couple chickens that I'm flying out the coop
Got some niggas that can fight, got some killers that can shoot
And bitches all on my 'gram, I'm trying make 100 million
Got bitches on top of bitches, I'm stacking 'em to the ceiling
Always a nigga tryna hate on me
And every time we pull a burner on 'em, they want peace
Bad bitches see the ice, they wanna skate on me
I hit the G with my D, now she won't leave
But I don't trip, I just let her stay and sip codeine
You know she can give me head but she can't smoke my weed
In that penthouse suite, I'm the man with the models
And we don't fuck with you nigga, we know you telling your partners

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We always fussing and arguing, then we kiss and make up
And every time I go out with my homies, I'ma have the party lit, going way up
But why you acting so surprised? I gave you my heart, girl I put it right in front of you
Socialize, now we in the club tryna socialize

[Verse 2: YoungBlacc]
Look, look, now these bitches wanna show's up
Cause they see me on the road and I'm jolled up
And all these bitches on my line like they know us
But I don't want that pussy, I'ma let the crew fuck you up
She so with it, my bitch bad, she gon' get it
Her lil sister, she thick now, get those digits
This money coming so quick now, need more spinach
We turn a bitch to a bust down if Chris hit it
And I ain't never 'bout to save no bitch
But if she bringing back money, we gon' all get rich
I need a new whip, new chain, talking 'bout the rap game
Keep the bitch tiptoes down, I'm speaking facts mane
And you ain't never 'bout to break my niggas
And all this money, I'm about to fresh to death my bitch
This the west coast, trap game, hit 'em on the crack cane
Spending young money and shit, call me Mack Maine

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We always fussing and arguing, then we kiss and make up
And every time I go out with my homies, I'ma have the party lit, going way up
But why you acting so surprised? I gave you my heart, girl I put it right in front of you
Socialize, now we in the club tryna socialize

[Verse 3: Young Lo]
Look, 'fore she used to be a solid bitch, but now she fucking with my tolerance

Now you wanna flex on a nigga like you the baddest bitch
OHB, that's out of here bitch, I got some new freaks
Porsche 9/11, sitting pretty on the new feet
Two get fucked for an hour then let the crew skeet
Cruising, got 4 on the way while I got 2 suites
Black nigga in white linen with white women
And I ain't tripping, I like women that like women
Ooh baby, they all losing be like women

Sold dope for them gold ropes, I like pitching
Whipping the block in 4 pots, this my kitchen, fuck with us

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We always fussing and arguing, then we kiss and make up

But why you acting so surprised? I gave you my heart, girl I put it right in front of you
Socialize, now we in the club tryna socialize

[Verse 4: Kevin Gates]
Big buck, bitch teeth crooked, and I ain't let her fuck
I ain't paying for the Uber, never told her that I love her
Kick her out man, every night she go and get her brother
Locked up with the reds, you know she watch a nigga fuck
Dog, I go hard, I am already a boss
On the plane slinging Rolls, I am already a boss
I be solo in the game, I be whipping up a Range
Name's holy wait, kick and fly conversation
Don't complain in the game, I ain't doing no complaining
He don't wanna front it, I'ma take it when I'm aiming
Move real cool, handle business like a gangster
Shoes on the bed, that's a lion to the jags
I be working out, wearing slay ups doing reps
Like the bench press, kill and stand on your chest
No one came in, flip for another set
She recertified, real nigga whip the stack

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We always fussing and arguing, then we kiss and make up
And every time I go out with my homies, I'ma have the party lit, going way up

Socialize, now we in the club tryna socialize

[Verse 1: HoodyBaby]
Came a long way, we was trapping out the days and
Now I spend my days up in mansions with Caucasians
Fat bitches chilling with my dogs like we caged in
Got it from the bottom, had to make it from the pavement
Niggas say I changed, fuck it, that's just how the game go
All these chains, all these fucking whips, I'm in slave mode
Hood rich, put your baby mama on my pay roll
OHB mafia, my niggas keep a bank roll

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You know that Bentley truck's on the way, Bentley truck's on the way, I bought her a coupe
You know shoulda played it cool by the way, played it cool by the way, played it cool
You know, you know the rules from the game, what games are you tryna play? Better be cool
You know, you think I'm a fool, first mistake, by the way

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Pull in that foreign, driving that hearses, hating on my half

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
All these women on me, only need one

All these bitches, I just need one
Cuffing bitches, that's the season
Cashed out, on another plug

Couple of Lambos, my niggas be racing

HoodyBaby, my kin folk and OHB, I kill for
That other party that's next door, we don't fuck with niggas that save hoe
Spanish chicks, they can take dick, black girls love to talk shit
White girls love the foreplay, handstand, make them turn tricks
She took my proposition 'bout the pimping
She know how to flip it, ain't come with interest
She telling a nosey nigga mind his business
Always hating cause they know we winning
Grown man shit, I don't need permission
I don't give a damn if they real sisters
Nigga, I only fuck with them freak hoes
Beast mode, eat the pussy

Eh, you're what I need, I need you

Only motherfucker put you in a gang
How the hell you think they know your name? You trifling, you silly
But I keep hoes on deck, what you know 'bout me?
I’m the nigga takin fades, yelling OHB
Overhand biscuit, you ain't out my reach
Bitches wanna kiss dick every time I preach
Got the Staples Centre, floor seats
And it's 500 blocks with my OGs
A nigga did a lid in the county
A 100 million dollars, my niggas gon' eat
I stayed fresh, I don't need no stylist
I'm either mean or modest
I don't need co-pilots
OHB, we popping, nigga who gon' stop us?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Eh, you're what I need, I need you
Heart on my sleeve, I need you
Oh, you know I need you
You fucked up cause you partying next door
You partying next door
You partying next door
You partying next door
Said you partying, yeah
Eh, you're what I need, I need you
Heart on my sleeve, I need you
Oh, you know I need you
You fucked up cause you partying next door

[Verse 1]
You tell me this town ain't got no heart
The sunny side of the street is dark
Maybe that's because it's midnight, in the dark of the moon besides
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
You know you got such dark eyes!

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just got to poke around

[Verse 2]
You think you've seen this town clear through
Nothing here that could interest you
It's not because you missed out on the thing that we had to start
Maybe you had too much too fast
Maybe you had too much too fast
Maybe you had too much too fast
Or just over played your part

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just got to poke around

[Intro]
When a bitch say she fucked 20 niggas, I respect her more
Instead of running 'round this motherfucker lying all the time
Talking 'bout some
5 niggas, 5 niggas you cared about, shit

[Verse 1]
Bitch you lying and girl I'm built honest
Still living for today, tomorrow ain't promised
Holding on to the love cause the hate follows
When you young, getting money, yeah you date models
Let the cork pop off when we shake bottles
You don't need a glass, gulp, just take swallows
Yeah, young and reckless, I spike her beverage
Self medicated, pills or liquor, what's your preference?
She usually ain't the type to take rejection
She don't know her dad so the hate turned into affection
She only dreamed to be up in my section
Believing any lie they tell her just to get her naked
Bitches keep playing games like it's checkers
But bitch this chess and those DD's gon' be your blessing
I'm looking forward to all them text messages
Talking 'bout how you done, I love when bitches threaten me

[Chorus]
I'ma keep it real with you baby
Understand me, don't tell you lies
I feel your love is premeditated
Too complicated, never willing to try
When I locked it down, she freed up
Coco in her nose she loves the freedom
Now she changing niggas like the seasons
Got it good but I feel distant in my mind, can't help think I'm mastermind

[Verse 2]
She said follow me , she wanna fuck up a nigga's Valentine
Pardon me, only thing growing on me is the dollar signs
Oh baby, I'm only used to your ways
Say you in love and you ain't, try to be honest, you can't
You always tripping on the same minor drugs
I do for the piece of mind and you do when you 'bout to fuck
I leave, act up and leave you and something trap out the bando
But I want a nigga call the curtain, choppers fired and it's having the fam over
That's the thing, I love to hate so I got a whip for my bitch
If you think I'm cuffing, you should forget it

[Chorus]
I'ma keep it real with you baby
Understand me, don't tell you lies
I feel your love is premeditated
Too complicated, never willing to try
When I locked it down, she freed up
Coco in her nose she loves the freedom
Now she changing niggas like the seasons
Got it good but I feel distant in my mind, can't help think I'm mastermind

[Verse 3]
You never wanna hear it, you never wanna be there
You never take me serious, you piece of shit, let's be fair
Know you got it from your mama, the day I met her she said "Why he here?"
Where the fuck you put your heart at? Bitches that pulling ain't all that
You on another level, showing off, tryna make me jealous
All the homies that been a problem, nigga bring the weapons
AKs and the fans, disrespecting
They close to my kin, OHB shit

[Chorus]
I'ma keep it real with you baby
Understand me, don't tell you lies
I feel your love is premeditated
Too complicated, never willing to try
When I locked it down, she freed up
Coco in her nose she loves the freedom
Now she changing niggas like the seasons
Got it good but I feel distant in my mind, can't help think I'm mastermind

[Verse 1]
Roller coaster love, up and down she go
Everyday this chick tripping in and out the door
Yeah I keep these bitches high, got it for the low
Out in France last month, but where I'm 'bout to go?
I don't know, got too high a while ago
I be chasing money, whip that big seat hundred domino
Pull up on your bitch and do the street nigga on a hoe
Pull up on your bitch, they love a street nigga, that's for sure
Ha ha, too silly, amigo on for really
There's an eagle on my belly, I been bumping Makaveli
Then I switch it up, Dekeli, fuck your bitch up in the telly
Jump right back in the Chevy, ain't no telling where I'm heading

[Chorus]
Gone, roller coaster, up and down she go
Gone, I'm roller coasting in and out the door
Gone, roller coaster, up and down she go
Gone, I'm roller coasting in and out the door
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Okay, bitches love me cause I keep that shit 100
They drop it like it's hot, I'm the number 1 stunner
When I throw that money, that pussy, it come up
9 millimetre, acting dummy if they run up
Okay you see it's OHB, we out here stacking, stacking
All this molly, all these bitches, all this ass I'm smacking
I'm tripping, drinking 'til I'm pissy
Fuck your girl with my girl, yeah nigga cause I'm different
I'm 'bout my money, money and power, respect my clique, gon' throw it up
When I'm in the club making it shower, doing it BIG in LA, okay
That's why they call me Big Poppa, notorious to that pussy
None of y'all niggas can see me so why the fuck you still looking?

[Chorus]
Gone, roller coaster, up and down she go
Gone, I'm roller coasting in and out the door
Gone, roller coaster, up and down she go
Gone, I'm roller coasting in and out the door
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster

[Verse 3]
Pulled up with your bitch, with your bitch like okay
She gon' help me count the bands but she won't see the safe
Got that killer pussy, put that cat up in the cage
You know I'm a dog, can't keep that pussy out my face
Fuck with me, know you're going up, know them niggas ain't showing up
VVS', bitch we ain't stressing, night time, a nigga going up
Flipping birds, check the wing span, bet a mil when my team playing
Better yet put the house on it, shut you mouth and put your mouth on it

[Chorus]
Gone, roller coaster, up and down she go
Gone, I'm roller coasting in and out the door
Gone, roller coaster, up and down she go
Gone, I'm roller coasting in and out the door
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster

But only if you don't mind, if you don't mind
If you don't mind baby, love gon' go

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Good sex is a passionate art, let's put some paint where it ain't
Couple hickies, couple bites, scratches and marks, we need to leave marks
Marking that territory, like a flare gun, flash in the dark, so we know what we at with it
We used to do each other real good, now we do it real smart
Now the science and the math of it, we were two students of the craft of it
Our sex game was so fresh mane, but now we sex game graduates
Practised and mastered it, woah, #LoveGonGo, #LoveGonGo
Netflix and chill, that's how love gon' go

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Now that's how this love gon' go and that's how this love gon' go

But only if you don't mind, if you don't mind
If you don't mind baby, love gon' go

You know I'm a somebody, and you're a nobody and this shit ain't for everybody
You know, I'm just tryin' to live

[Chorus]
All this coke in my house I know they said sumin'
All this coke in my house I know the feds comin'

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yeah, kinfolk, California kush, smell it through the vents though
Pimp flow, rolling through the 20s with my brim low
I been dope, I make your bitch bend over for some kins though
She wanna get nasty but just don't let her friends know
What's bracking P? What you need? I'm out of weed
Codeine, I got it, I'm spitting them 16s, a couple pills, tryna get to 100 mil
I'm moving mountains nigga, only seeing a couple hills
And you live in Hollywood, how that feel? Let's be real
Niggas thirsty, bitches dirty, I ain't worried
Niggas lying saying they 18 pushing 30, popping 30s, vision blurry, shipping 30s
A Golden State of mind with the assist to Curry
Gotta be ready to die when you playing that bloody Mary

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Whole 4 in the cup, I lean, yeah, I lean
4 grams in the blunt, I lean, I lean
6-4 in the cut, I lean, yeah, I lean
I lean, I lean

[Verse 2: Tracy T]
Keep a bad bitch leaning, got one in the Four Seasons
Got a bitch that fuck for money, got one fucking for no reason
Got a deuce and a 20 and I'm flipping with these goonies
With the goonies with the pistol and the 50, it's a trilogy
Go up for the trap, filling 'em with the green shit
Had to move the thrash bags, told the plug I can't quit
How your nigga looking broke, that's some shit you can't fix
I got 100 in the drum, man ain't shit, I can't hit
I just fuck her and forget about her, know I ain't shit
Got back to the chopper, had to get my chain licked
They came clean, I remake the boy for the same bitch
Oh you fuck, yeah I fuck to these, fuck the same bitch

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Whole 4 in the cup, I lean, yeah, I lean
4 grams in the blunt, I lean, I lean
64s in the cut, I lean, yeah, I lean
I lean, I lean

[Verse 3: HoodyBaby]
Big gold chain in a benz piece
Fat rocking, trapping out the Bentley
Young nigga selling highs for the low
Lil bitch, pussy back, she get fired at the door
I'm the one, black Neyo, fat Leo
Lions, tigers, bears, my set like Nat Geo
Swimming with the sharks, it's shocking I'm that ill
I'm swimming with the sharks, it's shocking I'm that ill
I trap still, selling coke, 'cus crack kills
I sip drank, I mix and match pills
I run plays all day, track and field
Go get your cat pill, tryna sell the crack still

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Whole 4 in the cup, I lean, yeah, I lean
4 grams in the blunt, I lean, I lean
64s in the cut, I lean, yeah, I lean
I lean, I lean

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Gun shots, we lots
Hennessy, I don't really like scotch
At the don when I'm talking to the dutch
And the man with the pockets like fam you up
Dippers and the wait notes
Black man says he's hit a lick, better keep your face down
Get loud when that kick sound
You miss it, don't count up
No tops, no tops
Go to collect, we in Paris when we shop
You gotta give the man props
Your girl love a man lots
Fuck it, I'm on that pussy like a rumpa
If I tag her, gotta have her have a bumper
All that pussy got that fire like a dragon
And I know she got that wagon from her mama

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Call it a homicide how she do
The guys in Jamaica, man jealous
Make me terrified
I can tell you skilled cause you using your melody
Oh, no no no no
Light another blunt then we gon' light up the floor
Smoking all that ganja you can smell through the door
Sex tape never, 'less she let me record
And I know where your head's at
Got your attitude from your mama
And I don't wanna set back
Just do me a favor and save the drama

[Verse 2: Tracy T]
Get the baddest bitch and treat it like the worst
Popping the Henny, tripping if you fuck the pussy first
We gon' fuck, I'm gon' fuck or we gon' fall in love
I will get 'em once, fucking, fucking with the plug
Bitches texting, I'm a dog fetching
Bitch I'm on, no flexing, fuck a 100 besties
See that's just for that extra Range, she'd to forget them
Your body's under my belt, just to make it official
I forget that he mission, never forget the pistol
Thinking all the way in, killing and leave the victims
I got trust issues, I might think you tripping
Really I be tripping, rolling with all the spitting
West is, this the gang, bitch you better catch it
'Fore you be over tested, rather pull up in a Bentley
Used to pull up in Chevys, I'm the kind that can get enough
I'm the kind that can get the paper cause I can't get enough nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Call it a homicide how she do
The guys in Jamaica, man jealous
Make me terrified
I can tell you skilled cause you using your melody
Oh, no no no no
Light another blunt then we gon' light up the floor
Smoking all that ganja you can smell through the door
Sex tape never, 'less she let me record
And I know where your head's at

And I don't wanna set back
Just do me a favor and save the drama

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Likkle waste girl

Hit the high notes like Mariah
Body feel electric when the vibe is right

Fat ass, lil titties
Email please gates don't do digits
Mouth on bling just spent 2 million
Laid back, low key, big lean sippin

Bullshit make a real nigga lose interest

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, no no no no

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
We can match a blunt up, listening to Sade
Do just what you wanna, echoes in the attic but we fucking in the basement
Didn't notice that the sun up, we must have fell asleep to Sade
You give me a fever, I've been catching feelings I'm having trouble erasing

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
So it's all up to you girl, what's the point of playing cool?
All of us know girl you the shit, yeah you the truth

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby I've been missing your love all night, jump on it

[Outro: Chris Brown & Lyrica Anderson]
Love, do it 'til the morning, yeah

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Yeah, rumor has it that I'm armed
Somebody should have told them
When the cash starts flowing and the hands start reaching
You read the contract your man ain't breaching
Uh, and rumor has it
The jeweler wants his money
But I'm out here rocking all my chains, real chunky, real comfy
And rumor has it when I hit the club hoes go dummy
And rumor has it, I'm doing magic
David Blaine, diamonds in the hat trick
Rumor has it, thought you had it
How is that true when I have it? Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at all these rumors, uh, surrounding me everyday
I just need some time, some time to get away
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said a story I know 'bout me and the girl next door
Look at all these rumors
Look at all these rumors

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, rumor has it, I'm a hazard
Don't give me no Hennessy, I might make some enemies
And rumor has it, I'm going broke, it's all smoke and mirrors
What happens when you smoke huh?
You start to see shit, start to believe shit
Can't read me cause you believe what you read bitch
And rumor has it I need you for me to make it happen
You believe that shit, you really smoking crack then
Came up from a small room packed in
Used to drink out the tap, now I'm tapped in
And rumor has it I'mma die rich
Yeah, me and all my stacks in my casket, cramped in
Rumor has it there's a rumor 'bout me
They don't know what to do about me
And rumor has it there's a rumor 'bout you
You a bitch ass nigga and I know it's true, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at all these rumors, uh, surrounding me everyday
I just need some time, some time to get away
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said a story I know 'bout me and the girl next door
Look at all these rumors
Look at all these rumors

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Rumor has it that a nigga brazy, if you was me then you would do the same thing
And I know everybody gon' attack me, stop acting like these niggas like me
And I done fucked around and had a baby, I was running 'round pussy crazy
All these rumors, spreading like, you know I

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at all these rumors, uh, surrounding me everyday
I just need some time, some time to get away
From all these rumors, I can't take it no more
My best friend said a story I know 'bout me and the girl next door
Look at all these rumors
Look at all these rumors

[Outro: Chris Brown]
If you got a problem, come see me my nigga
You know it's California baby
I pull up, hop out, anywhere my nigga, anywhere
Can't let waiting be your job, remember that, 500, so what?

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Right now you warned, OHB, yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Let's talk about something, girl I need your acceptance
You're making assumptions, but you know it's nothing
The liquor keep calling, you know I need more
It's 99 problems, can't take anymore, I'm 'bout to mix up this Sprite with the 4
Oh, OHB 'bout to walk through
Only hot bitches in the bedroom
Pop a Xan, watch me get loose
Throwing all of these bands for you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you

[Verse 2: HoodyBaby]
Girl who do you fuck when I ain't in the city?
Driving me crazy, way over the limit
My homies, they say that I'm tripping
Fuck it I'm tripping, I'm crazy, I'm whipping
My heart is racing, this shit is amazing
This neck just the bandages
How did our love end up like the Kennedy's?
Mixing up drugs, yeah I got the remedy
Damn, you fucking the enemy
I gave you the best of me
Showed her how to trap out the bando
And left her the recipe, damn

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you

[Verse 3: Tracy T]
Substance abuse, substance from you
Thousand dollar tab, baby this I bought food
This a 2 seater baby, you can't car pool
Got the old school move, like the car new
Bands low, never make a girl spend it with me
When she gone, I get it back, make her spend another 60
Still cold hearted, say it's cold hearted
She shotgun, I drop the top lid and her hair blow
Them heels got you walking like you on the runway
No paper, we got the game like the arcade
Wonder which, I know you're gonna make it right for me
Put the pussy on the flight, make it tonight for me
And baby, I jump in that foreign
She hop in that passenger
She gon' work, she lowkey in the Acura
Bitch ain't cuffing, your boy still a bachelor

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you

[Verse 4: Young Lo]
4 in the morning, I'm thinking of you
Just got the ceiling, I'm pouring it through
How can I deal with this substance abuse?
I'm only asking this all cause of you
These Xannies got me tripping right now
Girl your love is like a Perc, my heart itching right now
See them flashes of your face, I wanna kiss you right now
But I know it's just the drugs that got me tripping right now
Tried to offer you my heart, you used it like the playground
Favorite groupies, jealously, I thought you would stay where I am
Guess it's back to prescriptions to deal with the symptoms
I can't feel my face and I'm losing my vision

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Substance, substance, substance, substance
All this substance abuse, I need substance from you

[Verse 5: Chris Brown]
In recovery, rehabilitating from you
Teach me a lesson, I'm drug testing, making all them moves
We both getting fucked up, what's your excuse?
A new slave with a new fade, my chain a noose
Bitch I'm sipping, you steady tripping and politicking
Taking vacations with your bitch, why she ain't posting pictures
I can lead her to that water if she wanna listen
If she don't drink, she gon' drink, I'm still gon' fuck some bitches
You know that pussy my addiction
She driving my stick, tryna fuck up my transmission
I'm pissed off, withdrawals just fucking up my pimping
Take a picture nigga, see how I'm living
Ain't going back to prison, I got too felonies, dismissing the case
A couple million, got a .45 locked in the safe
Hella bitches, hella bitches pile up in the Wraith
Hollywood with the cameras all up in your face

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been at home going crazy
Worrying about my baby
Working away so lazy

So we go for a walk and move slowly
Go to the park under low trees
Nothing occurs to show me what

[Chorus]
She's dreaming about all day
Causing me much dismay
Tell me okay
Sleeping without your wake

[Verse 2]
Lately I've been at home going crazy
Worrying about my Sally
Working away so lazy

So we go for a walk and move slowly
Cut through the alley to smoke weed
Nothing occurs to show me what

[Chorus]
She's dreaming about all day
Causing me much dismay
Tell me okay

[Verse 1]
Struttin' your stuff
Pack of Palls rolled up in your cuff
But I've got a feeling you've been living rough
And I've been suffering from some pretty bad luck

[Chorus]
We're getting down, oh
We're getting down, oh
We're getting down, oh
We're getting down, oh

[Verse 2]
I'll set him straight
Wipe that fucking smile off his face
It's unreasonable, but I guess that's okay
We'll lay him out all over the place

[Chorus]
We're getting down, oh
We're getting down, oh
We're getting down, oh
We're getting down, oh
(Oh, hey, how's it going?
Not good
Oh yeah, I'll say.)
I've been up all night long
Rolling up, it's so strong
Sick of this cardboard box
Or of all of the walks
Get me to come out and play

Somebody else take my place
Gone for a couple days
Gonna quit all my chores
I don't know anymore
Need something for my brain

Echoing heavy things
Forget about ironing
Up through a TV set
I'm too young to regret
Let's meet up some place else

[Intro]

[Refrain 1: Rihanna]
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

[Refrain 2: Drake]
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

[Refrain 1: Rihanna]
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna & Drake]
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

[Chorus: Drake & Rihanna ]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Refrain 1: Rihanna]
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

[Refrain 2: Drake]
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me

And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it

[Chorus: Drake & Rihanna ]
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you

I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

[Verse 1]
You ain't the girl that you used to be
You say you're done, you're moving on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leaving messages on your cell
A true lover, but when I’m not there
Girl, you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Seems like ain't nothing cool about being real
No one's honest about what they feel
Take a hoe and try to treat her well
She'll be back up at the club again
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
'Less I know for sure that you're vibing with me
You do what you want with somebody else
I'm gone, baby

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side, I've been there
Oh yeah, I've been there
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
My homie said I need to stop it
My momma said bitches be watchin' you
They gon' put their hand all in your pocket
For the credit card that's in your wallet
Drinkin' liquor when we celebratin'
Calculatin' all my funds
Tryna get a nigga take the condom off
'Cause she want that tax every month, woo
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
Take my kindness for weakness when you act sadity
Keeping it 100 ain't your forté
You used to be

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Comin' on to the light of day, we got
Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile to see what it has to say
You and I both know, everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinnin' knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light in a touch of dark, you got
Sneak attack from the zodiac but I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go, blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

[Chorus]
You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

[Verse 2]
Stumble down to the parking lot, you got
No time for the afterthought, they're like
Ice Cream for an Astronaut, well, that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and find the world at your command
Playin' the hand, yeah

[Chorus]
You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

[Bridge]
Do you want this love of mine? Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time? But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

[Verse 3]
Ah, pick you up like a paperback with the
Track record of a maniac so I
Move it in and we unpack, it's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll, everything must go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah

[Chorus]
You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design

[Outro]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah

[Verse 1]
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world

[Chorus]
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' you catch me

[Verse 2]
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory
It don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

[Chorus]
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me

[Outro]
What are you doing my love?

[Verse 1]
I’m not lonely
I’m not lonely
I’m not lonely
The city keeps me company
The city keeps me company
The city keeps me company

[Verse 2]
Sit on the roof
Watch the cars travel past
Ain't no way of getting lonely
And I’ll sit real still and watch everyone go fast
With only me

[Verse 3]
Lay on the bay
Watch it all float away
Ain't no way of getting lonely
Watch all the people and the bikes come my way
With only me

[Outro]
I’m not lonely
I’m not lonely
I’m not lonely

[Intro: T.I.]
Don't know how many times

[Verse 1: King Louie & (T.I.)]
Coney Island riding with a shotgun
New York, BK, where I come from
Now who the hottest in New York? I don't care son
Now who the hottest in New York? I don't care son
You know I pull up on your block, 100 round run
Looking out the window with a chopper like I'm Malcolm
Be the outcome, RIP to Doe B, an Alabama real one
How many times?
(Don't know how many times)
How many rhymes?
You pay me a verse, 200 a line
You book me a show, hit your town and I shine
(Don't know how many times)
Fuck with the Hustle, get ready to die
All of you rappers, who fucking with 5ive?
All of you rappers, who fucking with 5ive?

[Hook: T.I.]
Don't know how many times
Don't know how many times
Don't know how many times
Don't know how many times

[Verse 2: T.I.]
How many times must I tell you
I shoot you, won't do any time?
Carbons, ARs, and 45s or better
AK 47, won't shoot at the 9
Head check, we jump through
And run through and replace by pressing rewind
Sucker, ain't no need to ask how I do
Just please believe me and my shooter, we fine
And all I demand is respect
You can do that and we fine
Shit you not be able to
Leave you wet like Moet, nowhere to be found
How many times must I show you
You gon' get the cane, I'm fucking you over?
It's over, hustle as long as you know it
And from there, the decision is over

[Hook: T.I.]
Don't know how many times
Don't know how many times
Don't know how many times
Don't know how many times

[Verse 3: King Louie & (T.I.(]
How many times will you listen to lies from these frivolous guys?
I’m so sick of these guys
After your funeral we shoot up your repast, turn up on your old ass
(Don’t know how many times)
How many times will I run up that cash just to fuck up that cash
I can’t die with that cash so I spend that cash fast
With your chick and a buddy, we having a blast
(Don’t know how many times)
I don’t know why haters mad at me
Sneak dissing, end up a casualty
(Don’t know how many times)
Hang arounds looking like battery
Shut up and bow to your majesty
(Don’t know how many times)
Boss shit, I could get you whacked for free
Could you please excuse the back of me
Shout out my mama, she had a G
Picture me rolling, gallery

[Hook: T.I.]
Don't know how many times
Don't know how many times
Don't know how many times
Don't know how many times

Hit things that brings me to link the
People on the brink cos that's where my heart’s at

Habit it like a hobbit keeps me down to the ground
And just drop that

[Verse 1]
Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round-up
This is a low-flying panic attack
Sing the song on the jukebox that goes

[Chorus]
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live

[Verse 2]
Red crosses on wooden doors
If you float, you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
This is a low-flying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes

[Chorus]
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live

[Verse 1]
We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do some, do some

[Hook]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it

[Verse 2: Nas]
Met Gala
42, but I fuck 'em like I'm 22
Backing and hanging that's all I do
I've been through aunties and mamas
Now its they daughters turn
I done ran through money but I got more to burn
Windows tinted, indo in it
I got that je ne sais quoi, a glass of Henny then muah
Here some freestyle, kiss them other lips wow
Bedroom bruises like we did Jiu-Jitsu
That official dick down
Spiritual chakras, frequency
I'm her holistic doctor, treatments frequently
Put her on a elevator to a higher self
Like Monte Carlo to acquire wealth
New dough I'm getting, the biggest my man hit me said 'let me hold something before them hoes get it'
OG flow, tailored clothes
The type to wear tuxedos with 40 belows
Can drop a BB out a spray-can
Driving down Cullens, Nas be wildin'
Rich nigga problems
I've been pimpin' since Big Pimpin', been pimpin'
Jazzy Jeff hoes out the door, Fresh Prince shit
Go tell a friend , bitch!

[Hook]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Intro]
We will ensure that our government never opens the door to the use of cloning... for human reproduction. It is dangerous, profoundly wrong and has no place in our society or any society. This order is an important step in advancing--
But when everything comes out it's going to blow the lid off of everything, because this is the biggest damn story in human history, and it's simply this: You are not alone and you have never been alone

[Verse 1]
Bobby Ray, Bandz
Bobby Ray ha-ha
Show your belly button if you ain't a clone
Show your belly button if you ain't a clone
Show your belly button if you ain't a clone
If you a surrogate you homegrown
Why you still got them damn panties on?
Why you still on your damn camera phone?
Bobby Ray Bandz on Genghis Khan
Walking in with the damn Daniels on
Haters on my dick, no I ain't alone
Airports sell too much damn cologne
State niggas wear too much damn cologne
Pack so loud smell it through the phone
Bob when you gonna write a book for shits sake?
But niggas don't read so I keep making mixtapes
I keep making mixtapes
Everyone I meet shop a beat or a mixtape
See they plan to enslave
And make a billion dollars just off inmates
Clone meat your intake
Chicken look like it do nothing but lift weights
And you just fixed the big plate
Kids looking grown by fifth grade
Other day I saw a baby in a stroller
Little nigga had a goatee and a temp fade
Goatee and a temp fade, goatee and a temp fade, goatee and a temp fade
If chemtrails are clouds when I pee it's lemonade
Over and out, air force flying over my house
Helicopters flying over the crib
We get it, you know where I live
No fucks, you know what I give
No chill, fuck Neil he's a shill
Cornrows, my Achilles heel
Get harder than malaria still
Get harder than surgical steel
I give it to her she like, 'Hercules real'
Word to the tower I'm a modern day seal
Verbally kill, I hurt you for real
I'm from the city where the goons often lurking the field
And if the cops don't kill then the murderers will
Can't hire these stripes, gotta earn them for real
How you gon' search for whats real
When all the preachers that you worship be perverted for real
And this will never play on syndicated radio
Cause that's just the way it goes

[Hook]
Yeah, in my bloodline, uh
Cherokee in my bloodline, yeah
Cheekbones in my bloodline, yeah
Weed shows in my bloodline, yeah
In my bloodline, in my bloodline, in my bloodline
Wanna cross me out like a plus sign, uh

[Verse 2]
What's behind a supernatural, is it actual?
I blow your mind like explosives in a cantaloupe
A stick of dynamite in your cantaloupe
Astral project, I astral catapult
What the fuck you laughing for?
Chain hang from my clavicle
You were inside of my admiral
Eat you like an enzyme or a cannibal
Like I'm holding election with Hannibal Lecter
Tied up in the stretcher hitting on a professor
Man I roll up the lettuce
Get stoned like Rosetta
Too faded tryna hold it together
You've been demoted a letter
You slow enough to trigger motion detector
You could lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink
You can lead someone to knowledge but you can't make him think, Bandz

[Hook]
Yeah, in my bloodline, uh
Cherokee in my bloodline, yeah
Cheekbones in my bloodline, yeah
Weed shows in my bloodline, yeah
In my bloodline, in my bloodline, in my bloodline
Wanna cross me out like a plus sign, uh

[Into: Lil Yachty]
Bought a new bitch
And she white like work
If a nigga talking down
I got D Wade under my shirt
Monster truck rims on the Chevy
Got me up now
Water diamonds dancing in my chain
She wanna fuck now

[Verse: Lil Yachty]
Only time I drink soda
When I drink lean
Only time I'm geeking off
Is when I pop a bean
A nigga fuck with K $upreme
Then he fucking with me
Told these niggas not to trust me
I'm always gon' scheme
See that 32 is gon' stack
Put it in my backpack and watch it double up
Young RD from the 6 buckin on any nigga, I don’t give a fuck
Dumb dumb like a tow truck
On your gang gang, that’s an e-crash
Nigga want static that’s a e smash
Nigga’s not really stacking up the cash
I been livin' life low sippin Barney tear
I can’t wait to move out so I can pierce my ears
Put them rocks on my shit, got me look like first
I done talked to niggas once, It’s time to remember
I done dropped a couple hundreds just for my shirt
Nigga’s name not Ferg but I put in work
Pullin' off in a beam, make em skrt skrt skrt
Bitches all up on my dick, that shit’s startin' to hurt
I been workin' all night so my mom won’t hurt
Chopper chopper make em jump like he praisin' the church
Man, I pray a fuck nigga step up on my turf
Bitch It’s Young RD and I’m balling like Dirk

[Outro]
Yeah It’s Young RD
Shout out to them – shout out to them niggas at 

[?]
Niggas that got me fucked up all the way up
They thinkin' a nigga ain’t got shmoney
You know what I’m sayin, You feel me?
Niggas thinkin' a nigga ain’t got shmoney ya digg?
That nigga got me fucked up
On the four on four to the two on two
You smell that

[Verse 1]
Angelina’s got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
I’ve never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I don’t cause

[Chorus]
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that way

Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
He’s got everything you’d wanna be
He’s funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I won’t cause

[Chorus]
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that way

Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But ain’t it funny how
It all comes out
Isn’t life sweet?

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say

[Chorus]
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that way

[Verse 1]
I’ve been counting days and
I’ve been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t want to jinx my luck
I’ve left it all behind me
And I’ve been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

[Verse 2]
Dreaming of you baby
I’ve been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
‘Cause I’ve been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t want to jinx my luck
I’ve left it all behind me
And I’ve been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

[Bridge]
Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if you’ve seen one
I’d like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one

[Chorus x2]
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

[Verse 1]
Someone struck a match against the night
All I could see was you and I
I was captivated
A perfect little dream inside my head
And then reality crept in, and erased it

[Pre-Chorus]
For a while I thought that I could hold you
But you were just a temporary high

[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

[Verse 2]
Something so beautiful and free
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand
I tried to catch you, but I can't
Chase the wind

[Pre-Chorus]
And just as I reach out to touch you
I remind myself you were meant to fly

[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

[Bridge]
I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough

[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

[Verse 1]
I like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream
I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see
Don't try me
Don't fight me
You be you and I'll be me

[Chorus]
They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

[Verse 2]
Your mom and daddy's walls
Are covered up in pictures of you
You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into
So sorry, don't worry
I'm sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do

[Chorus]
They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you
It ain't you, oh

[Bridge]
Oh baby, don't persuade me
I know that you ain't used to no
So let me say it real slow

[Chorus]
They say I've always known
What I wanted, it's true
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And they say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
And you'll find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

[Verse 1]
My name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kind of scared cause
I've never been on a plane
My mama says that it'll be alright
Cause I'm going to see my daddy tonight
And she says that

[Chorus]
There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

[Verse 2]
My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
She's finally well enough to travel
Doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year

[Chorus]
There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

[Verse 3]
James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on

[Chorus]
There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

[Verse 4]
And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we do

[Verse 1]
Me and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking 'bout things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
We were babies, we were beautiful and free
Oh, oh
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney

[Verse 2]
She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasn’t been the same since
That boy she ran off with, well, I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
She was in love, she was beautiful and free
Oh, oh
She was always so much braver than me

[Bridge]
When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said I’m sorry for waking you up but I didn’t know who else to call
Or where else to go

[Verse 3]
Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
We’re not as young, but we’re still beautiful and free
Oh, oh
Even when we’re old, we’re still going to be

[Outro]
Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else is ever gonna hear
In the summer shade

[Verse 1]
Said I'd be gone by five
But it's sunrise and I'm still in your bed
Goodnight usually means goodbye
Me, replaying memories in my head
Look at you, look at you
Look what you made me do
How do you, how do you think know my every move
Who are you? Who are you? You look so familiar
I know you, I know you, baby, I know the truth

[Chorus]
We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you

[Post-Chorus]
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

[Verse 2]
We used to talk 'til midnight
All those days that you stayed at my house
We were just passing the time
When we were young and we ain't had no vows
Now, now, now maybe later on, I'll text you and maybe you'll reply
We both know we had no patience together day and night
Getting high on our supply, yeah, we ain't satisfied
I could love you all occasions

[Chorus]
We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you

[Post-Chorus]
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

[Bridge]
Messed up too, messed up too
Just like you, just like you
Messed up too, messed up too
Just like you, just like you

[Chorus]
We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you

[Post-Chorus]
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

[Intro]
You know—it's just—you know, where do we begin? Where do we begin to tell the story? It's a deep story. You know, it's gon'—gon' take some time. We'll get it right, though. DROGAS

[Verse 1]
I light up like a genie and I blow up on this song
Rub-a-dub-a-dub-dub, rub-a-dub-a-dub-a-dub
Aladdin, no kidding, boy I need a rub
Rub-a-dub-a-dub-dub, rub-a-dub-a-dub-a-dub
Me and my speakers speak in sub, sub, sub
Suba-suba-sub-sub suba-suba-suba-sub
You know who I am, I run this fucking club
Club-a-dub-dub-dub, club-a-dub-a-club-a-lub

[Chorus]
Bass-lines and cars, anything fast
Humping on my leg, yo, mind my fucking glass
Making money last, hide it in the back
Sound of a bomb blast throw it in the bag
Bass-lines and cars, anything fast
You know who I am, I run this fucking club
Speaker speak in sub, throwing fire like a mob
Flash, bang, thunder, demolition job

Mind my fucking glass

[Beat Drop]

[Chorus]
Bass-lines and cars, anything fast
Humping on my leg, yo mind my fucking glass
Making money last, hide it in the back
Sound of a bomb blast throw it in the bag
Bass-lines and cars, anything fast
You know who I am, I run this fucking club
Speaker speak in sub, throwing fire like a mob
Flash, bang, thunder, demolition job

Mind my fucking glass

[Beat Drop]

[Verse 1]
I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

[Refrain]
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

[Pre-Chorus]
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)

[Chorus]
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on

[Verse 2]
Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

[Refrain]
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

[Pre-Chorus]
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)

[Chorus]
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance (Come on)
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling!
So keep dancing
Come on

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the feeling!

[Chorus]
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
(I can't stop the feeling!)
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling!)
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

[Outro]
Everybody sing
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Wanna see you move your body
(I can't stop the feeling!)
Got this feeling in my body, come on
Break it down
Got this feeling in my body
I can't stop the feeling!
Got this feeling in my body, come on
I think as we begin to think about myth, mythology, and the need of mythology - I was basically raised on mythology, introduced to mythology at a very young age. Mostly Greek mythology, and of course of that Roman mythology, which kinda took over what the Greeks left off, and kinda super-imposed themselves on a lotta the Greek myths - very directly  in the form of Hercules, and the -cules. And that was the kind of literature I was reading as an adolescent, which became my first kind of education into creation of stories, creation of myths, and it was the role of myth being used to establish certain principles and certain narratives and certain answering of questions why in a very fantastic manner and a very supernatural manner, in that sense. But in some capacities, even a very natural manner.

And so, once you're steeped into kinda that education; that formation; you start to think in those capacities, you start to develop your world views and your outlooks based on those kind of templates, those creation templates. As you think of, you know, that's one aspect, and you start to think of those conscious aspects consciously being attended to, and researching, and being entertained by certain narratives, mythical narrates from a certain period. And then you think of the unconscious narratives, and even you think of modern narratives, which are kind of fast-forwarded through time and the narratives which you are introduced to consciously of a more modern kind of piece: the mythology of America, the mythology of globalization, the mythology of - you know, as it stands. A myth kind of being steeped into a certain misunderstanding, and then trying to achieve the understanding reconcile of your ignorance to a certain degree through this template, this mythical template, which lays everything plain and gives you the A plus B equals C and you go on and live your life, all things are well.

But say you think of the modern mythologies, the mythology of the cowboy, the mythology of the gangsta, the mythology of just these supernatural beings - maybe not as supernatural as Zeus, of course, or Hercules, of course - but still bearing the same, some of the same fascinations with the fantastic. And these great abilities and these grand possessions and levels of influence and power, which are steeps, and the ability to influence specifically, the ability to influence discourse, the ability to influence progressions of ideas, the ability to influence women into the bed, the ability to gather large, vast quantities of material possessions, and not only have them, but to have a disdain for them; to be so above it all, once you have it where these things, where there's a certain aesthetic nature to it, that when you've consumed all of these things and at the same time you have the power to relinquish them, to show that they have no value and the way that you treat to them.

And it's very interesting to classify that as mythology, if you know not of it, if you can't see it first-hand, if you don't really have your own creation-kind-of story as to why things are a certain revealed - it has been revealed to you that this is the way it works, these are the mechanics to this particular situation - you're gonna, in my capacity, you're gonna develop it and through myth, through your interaction with myth, through your self-creation of myth.

And so there's a role of mythology. And I think persuing that role and taking on the role of the author of mythology. Even in the circumstance that what you are, this modern, this real -  let's call it this reality, to, you know, translate it into mythology, to regress it back into mythological kind of structure, it opens up new terrain, it opens up new frontiers for expedition: for literary expedition, for critical expedition, for poetic expedition, and from political expedition, from social expedition; and even from a historical expedition, because the nature of mythology is that it is steeped in a misunderstanding - and that misunderstanding never really becomes reconciled. It still exists, this mythology, post-misunderstanding, is really an attempt, a version, one vein in an attempt to explain or to reconcile this misunderstanding. But in it, it in itself is not a reconciliation. Reconciliation is still needed at the base, and that's why we have things like science, and different things which act upon it with all of its philosophies and its experiments and theories to try to achieve the reconciliation of the primary misunderstandings about things. Well, no matter what they are: naturals, the perceived supernaturals, the subnatural, et cetera et cetera...

But there's license. There's license to do as you will, to do as you see fit, to do that, to retain the authorial dimension of saying, "I am going to author mythology, the new mythology - and in this particular instance, the mythology of the diaspora - so, diasporian mythology." Within a modern context looking backwards towards history and not in the attempt, which I think is a new way of looking at it, not in an attempt to reconcile the totality of society to this point, but more to - or I guess that is the question. What is it? Because the attempt isn't to reconcile, I mean you're not trying to reconcile a misunderstanding of what you tryin' to do. Are you just trying to promote? Or are you just trying to point attention towards the misunderstanding? But even within this, there is a reality: It's not just mythology, it is an understanding, and that might be it. It's not that it's a misunderstanding which gives birth to myth. It is a understanding, it is already reconciled, it is already consolidated, it is already real. And but from that reality it births mythology, which kinda turns things on our heads a bit, I think. Alright. DROGAS.

[Bridge: Prince]
Take this mic, I can't sing
It only makes me wish for
The way things used to be
You can slap my face, PSH!
But I got to say it
You never would have drank my coffee
If I would have served you cream

[Chorus: Prince]
Tell me what's my name?
Tell me what's my name?
Tell me what's my name?
Tell me what's my, name? Oww!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]

Born to win
Living in God
Hoping it's the end
I....Ho! Ho! Ho!

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secret, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Going through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'mma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

[Bridge]
Oh it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

[Refrain]
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Outro]
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
That's right, you're right, we will do our thing tonight alright
Take me through the future
It's time, you're fine, just another color coded crime
Incision and a suture
You told my friend we would get it on no matter when
A supercavitation
Let's go, you show me something no one will ever know
A love hallucination

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & Anna Waronker]
You don't have to keep it if it's mine
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Another place maybe another time
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Complete repeat sittin' in your car and on your street
Lost in California
Let's steal this wheel, take a spin to find out how we feel
Just around the corner
Slow down for sound, turn it up and no we can’t be found
The body that we transcend
Asleep, you weep, find out that the trick is never cheap
A melancholy girlfriend

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & Anna Waronker]
You don't have to keep it if it's mine
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Another place maybe another time
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
That's right, you're right, we will do our thing tonight, alright
Drive the constellation
It's time, you're fine, just another color coded crime
The song is fascination

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside the lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & Anna Waronker]
A May-December might not be so smart
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Arrivals that we wish would not depart
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
Don't be late 'cause you're my savior
Make it great whatever stays
Golden gate my rearranger
Hold my name inside your rays

[Intro]
We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
We turn red and we turn green
It's the craziest thing I've ever seen

[Verse 1]
Lost my mind 'cause I'm on the plastic
Who knew it's so damn drastic
Show me what it is you believe in
Slowly she sinks all her teeth in
Do you want to go fishing in New Orleans?
Do you want to get up early in the morning?
Take me to the river where we do the little storming
Hallelujah, I feel it warming

[Pre-Chorus]
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

[Chorus]
Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind

[Verse 2]
Mexico, you are my neighbor
Home of the let's be braver
Give me all your sick and your tired
Races that we admire
Do you want to go dancing in Chicago?
Trinidad's got it bad for Tobago
Take me to the lake where we do the Avocado
Hallelujah, a desparado

[Pre-Chorus]
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray

[Chorus]
Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind
Coming down from the deserts where you
Caught a glimpse of the billionaire
Tell me I'm the right one for the ride
Paper signs out on the lawns
Gold minds and the priceless pawns
Does your canyon really open wide?

[Outro]
We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannonball
We turn red and we turn green
It's the craziest thing I've ever seen

[Verse 1]
Throw me all around like a boomerang sky
Whatever you do, don't tell me why
Poppies grow tall then say bye bye
The wave is here
A seamless little team and then we tanked
I guess we're not so sacrosanct
The tip of my tongue but then we blanked
The wave is here
Waiting on the wind to tell my side
Ready set jet but she never gets far
Listen to your skin from the seat of my car
Two centipedes stuck in one glass jar
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind to tell my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatcha want?
Whatcha need?
Do you love?

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm the right one, maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the Papillon
Time to call it a day
Maybe you're my last love, maybe you're my first
Just another way to play inside the universe
Now I know why we came

[Verse 2]
Sterile as the barrel of an old 12 gauge
Under my skin and half my age
Hotter than the wax on a saxifrage
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind to turn my page
Steady your sails for the butterfly flap
Whatever you do, don't close that gap
I'm dreaming of a woman, but she's just my nap
Your ship is in
Waiting on the tide so I can swim

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatcha want
Whatcha need
Do you love

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm the right one, maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the Papillon
Time to call it a day
Maybe you're my last love, maybe you're my first
Just another way to play inside the universe
Now I know why we came

[Outro]
Now I know why we came
Now I know

[Verse 1]
Suicide a month before I met you
Deep regrets, I never could forget you
Somehow you made your way to my decade
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my girl
In the sun, I see you with your guard down
Number one, you're moving to a hard town
Do not dismiss the promise that you made me
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time
Overkill you took another red pill
On the sheet is everything that you spilled
We are the ones you want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light
Come again to murder your report card
Just a friend to kiss you in the courtyard
You are the one I want to be stuck with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, big fight

[Pre-Chorus]
Favor some
Way too young
Slave to none
Way too young

[Chorus]
Say goodbye, my love, I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye, my love, thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

[Verse 2]
Sticky fingers find the way to take her
Crumple up another piece of paper
I know your days are numbered when it comes to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, this life
Slip away into the solar system
Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them
Some like it dark and now I know where to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, find you
Serpentine, I think she was an Aussie
Bloody hell, a common kamikaze
Give up the ghost before you go under
Ayo ayo aye ayo, wonder
Kicking hard and looking for a rescue
Watch me starve was never to impress you
I would have killed the part of me to have you
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, story

[Chorus]
Say goodbye, my love, I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye, my love, thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

[Bridge]
Babe, I know love is a funny thing
Born to die in the eternal spring

[Verse 3]
Your flickering is more than just a small flame
Welcome to the party, it's a ball game
Pick up the stick it's time to get hit with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my bat
Suicide is never gonna save you
When I cried, it was because I came to
You are the one I want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, kiss this

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning like I always do
Still, like to think that I'm new
Time just gets its way
Strawberries left to decay
Can't find my pants or my bank account
Don't you slip away
Voices that start to betray

[Chorus]
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man in the Sea

[Verse 2]
I still like to laugh when I make a joke
I still like to think that there's  hope
Time just has its say
Strawberries left to decay
Struck by the sight of an empty hall
Don't you fade away
Voices that start to betray

[Chorus]
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man in the Sea

[Bridge]
The hunter gets hunted
We all get confronted
Don't just slip away
Voices that start to betray

[Chorus]
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man in the Sea

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
You only love me
In bits and pieces
I keep on workin'
You keep your secrets
That's not an insult
That's not a lie
That's just a statement
Proven by time
Cause even when I have you
I don't really have you
I am not your last dude
Where'd you get this attitude?
Talkin' 'bout you're leavin'
Cause you don't believe in
Me and all my reasons
Left me with these demons
And this little pen
And this nostalgic feeling
Only me alone
I'm faking all my smiles

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
And you're just killing me with silence
And you're just killing me with time
I don't know where to put my sorry's
You're running laps around my mind
How could you leave me on this tightrope?
And I feel nothing when it storms
You know you're killing me with silence
You hold your halo up with horns
You hold your halo up with horns

[Verse 2: Labrinth]
You know you're clever, I'll give you that
You gave me heaven and took it back
That's not an insult
That's just the case
You've had your pretty mask on
For so damn long
That everybody thinks it's your face
But underneath your eyelids
I can hear the silence
Spreading like a virus
Why'd you wear disguises?
Why'd you have to cut me?
Then act like it's nothing
This time I'm not bluffin'
How'd you know I'm bluffin'
Every single time
Wicked little mind
Gets inside of mine
And I can fake a smile

[Chorus: Together]
But you're just killing me with silence
But you're just killing me with time
I don't know  where to put my sorry's
You're running laps around my mind
How could you leave me on this tightrope?
And I feel nothing when it storms
You know you're killing me with silence
You hold your halo up with horns
You hold your halo up with horns

[Outro: Together]
Ho-o-o-rns
(You)
Ho-o-o-rns
(Oh Lord)
Ho-o-o-rns
(Whooo-oh-oh)
Ho-o-o-rns
You hold your halo up with horns
Ho-o-o-orns
Ho-o-o-rns
(Oh no, no, no)
Ho-o-o-orns
You hold your, you hold your, you hold your
Ho-o-o-orns
You hold your, you hold your, you hold your
Ho-o-o-orns
And you're just killing me with silence

[Chorus]
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows how hard I've been trying
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows the trouble on my mind

[Verse 1]
"There's more to life than living", a wise man told me this
Or maybe it was me who wrote it, I can't remember which
In any case what I mean, life's an unfinished poem
Don't go mad trying to figure out the ending
The day that Norman died, I found out through an email
The irony of that, I will not discuss in detail
My future is on thin ice and my past is all online
But only God knows the trouble on my mind

[Chorus]
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows how hard I've been trying
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows the trouble on my mind

[Verse 2]
My walls are filled with artwork, my art is filled with paint
My head is filled with big old thoughts of all the things I ain't
I bet you know what that's like, though you never drop your guard
Only God knows the places that you're scarred
I'm sitting on a park bench in the city I don't know
Trying to convince myself that I'm not all alone
But my immediate surroundings suggest otherwise
Only God knows the trouble on my mind

[Chorus]
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows how hard I've been trying
Only God knows
Only God knows
Only God knows the trouble on my mind (mind)
Only God knows the trouble on my mind (on my mind)
Only God knows the trouble on my mind

[Intro]
Man, it's gonna go off
Real niggas fuckin' with this one
Couple of Henney, I'm ready to go
Make sure you fake niggas listen

[Verse 1]
Why is you mad? Why is you pissed?
Is it cause you living like that?
Is it cause I'm living like this?
Is it cause I've been on my job
Is it cause you ain't doin' shit?
Is it 'cause I walk out the jewelry store with this ridiculous shit on my wrist
I got no time to be takin' my eye off the ball
You said you wasn't mad but it look like you is after all
Holla at me later, put that shit on my tab
Oh, now you a hater? I just sit back and laugh
But first let me dab
Look how much I give a shit
Flames on everything Pain saying, my shit is lit
Same thing from befo', bruh
My chain hang to the flo', bruh
This for you niggas that thought it was over

[Hook]
Laugh and dab, laugh and dab
Money long, Cadillac
When your money strong, they get mad at that
When your money strong, they get mad at that
So dab and laugh
Laugh and dab, laugh and dab
Put my niggas on, they got Caddilacs
When your money strong, they get mad at that
When that money gone, they wish they can have it back
So dab and laugh

[Verse 2]
Why is you mad? Why is you pissed?
Is it cause you living like that?
Is it cause I'm living like this?
Is it cause I've been on my job
Is it cause you ain't doin' shit?
Is it 'cause I walk out the jewelry store with this ridiculous shit on my wrist
I got plenty reason for you niggas to back up off me
All of these flavors in the world, and you just gon' choose to be salty
I'm tryin' to eat and you just a target
Illuminappy, boy, look what you started
But first let me dab
Soon as I walk in the door
I'm probably gon' do somethin' that's just gon' piss a bitch off even more
Same thing from befo', bruh
My chain hang to the flo', bruh
Just stay off yo laptop and this can be over

[Hook]
Laugh and dab, laugh and dab
Money long, Cadillac
When your money strong, they get mad at that
When your money strong, they get mad at that
So dab and laugh
Laugh and dab, laugh and dab
Put my niggas on, they got Caddilacs
When your money strong, they get mad at that
When that money gone, they wish they can have it back
So dab and laugh
Laugh and dab, laugh and dab
Put my niggas on, they got Caddilacs
When your money strong, they get mad at that
When that money gone, they wish they can have it back
So dab and laugh

[Verse 1]
I was 16 with a rocket
And some sunshine in my pocket
It was how you used words I didn't know
And the way you said my name
And cut up peaches and them brown eyes
Lit a flame up that we pretend doesn't glow

[Pre-Chorus]
You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

[Chorus]
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm locked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

[Verse 2]
There were times I think about us
Overcome by the nostalgias
I am on call when you need me, let me know
But we're drifting in a strange way
I'm aware that it's mistake if I love you
It's a mistake if I don't

[Pre-Chorus]
You know space and time wouldn't let you be mine
What I've come to understand
Is entropy wouldn't leave you to me
I'm right back where I began

[Chorus]
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm locked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

[Bridge]
And she smelled like Michigan
And it felt like lust
And the nostalgia's killing me
And it's all because

[Chorus]
I'm in the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm locked up
In the arms of a stranger, stranger, stranger
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love
Holding her closely, remembering your touch
And I'm wrapped around your finger, even though I'm locked up
In the arms of a stranger, pretending it's love

[Verse 1]
If I could be just one thing
I would be what you're craving
6 foot 3 with steel blue eyes
Sweep you off of your feet, before you count to 5
But the truth is I am just a man
Standing 5 foot 10 doing the best I can
And I've lived long enough to see
You will never be craving me

[Chorus]
Oh, I watched her go
After she planted her love in the top soil
And from the top soil, an iris bloomed
It was pretty in May, but it died in June

[Verse 2]
If I could sing the way I feel inside
It'd sound happy and sad at the same damn time
'Cause when you smiled at me on that dance floor
It was the prettiest mask that you ever wore

[Chorus]
Oh, I watched her go
After she planted her love in the top soil
And from the top soil, an iris bloomed
It was pretty in May, but it died in June

[Outro]
From the top soil, an iris bloomed
It was pretty in May, but it died in June

[Verse 1]
Met a girl, her name was Jade
Cuts her nails with a razor blade
Says she lives by no one's law
Ran my pride through a big chainsaw
Have you heard of D.B. Cooper?
I got pulled over by an old state trooper
I met a girl, her name was Jade
She cut my face with a razor blade

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, I screamed out in fury
Yeah, but my cries were not heard
Yeah, the judge and the jury
Yeah, they could offer no cure

[Verse 2]
I met a girl, her name was Jade
She got a brand new man and they got engaged
The wedding's gon' be on a big green hill
They hope it won't rain but it probably will
The man, he was a football star
He broke his knee, now he sells cars
Only so much that words can do
Love was blind, but they cured that, too
You know, Gandhi has a son our age
He said the freedom thing's just one big cage
I met a girl, her name was Jade
Her husband died, but she kept his name

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, she screamed out in fury
Yeah, but her cries were not heard
Yeah, her mom was so worried
Yeah, but she could offer no cure

[Verse 3]
Boss man calls for a meeting at noon
Big cigar in an oak board room
We got an idea and we think it's great
Said it was too much so we're gonna try eight
Who made love to Scarlet Jo?
And where the hell did Josh Hartnett go?
I met a girl, her name was Jade
Lived her whole damn life in a masquerade

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, I screamed out in fury
Yeah, but my cries were not heard
Yeah, they said I'll never see 30
Yeah, they could offer no cure

[Outro]
I met a girl, her name was Jade
She cuts her nails with a razor blade

[Verse 1]
This is what the Lord wants me to do
In my heart, I just believe that there's no proof
I think about the chorus, the melody's important
But nothing sounds sweeter than the truth
I used to sip the whiskey and hit the bong
I gave that up, now all my friends are gone
And my folks don't understand I ain't no macho man
But I know how to write one hell of a song

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a shy young man with a real big heart
I still haven't found where I belong
But you know my sweet Lord gave me just one thing
Darling, I know how to write one hell of a song
Yeah, I know how to write one hell of a song

[Verse 2]
Wrote one for Snoop, did not take long
Wrote one for Bieber and one for Sean
And Jay Z offered me a deal
I said "Dawg, throw in another mil"
Cause you know I can write one hell of a song

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a shy young man with a real big heart
I still haven't found where I belong
But you know my sweet Lord gave me just one thing
Darling, I know how to write one hell of a song
Yeah, I know how to write one hell of a song

[Guitar Solo]
James

[Outro]
Sometimes I stay up well past dawn
If God puts one in my head, that's what he wants
I'm a simple type of artist, I don't like to walk red carpets
I would rather write one hell of a song
Yeah, I wrote this and it's one hell of a song

[Verse 1]
Say goodbye to Oz and everything you own
California dreamin' is a Pettibon
LA's screaming you're my home
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home
Stick n move you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy life for such a tiny girl
Born into it that's for sure

[Chorus]
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away, yeah
Prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche

[Verse 2]
People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir
Superheroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail, my baby, it'll be your last
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

[Chorus]
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away, yeah
Prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away, yeah
Prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche

[Outro]
Openly defective is the lover you elected and
A portrait she was bound to portray

[Verse 1]
I called the teacher cause I wanted to confess it now
Can I make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow
She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from
I don't take these things so personal, anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible, anymore
Somebody hooted and they hollered can I buy a vowel
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
And when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
Can I put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl
I don't think that it's so terrible, anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable, anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot

[Chorus]
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like I'm a sentimental trooper
She cried so hard, you know she looked like Alice Cooper
I don't think that it's so personal, anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible, anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot

[Chorus]
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

[Verse 3]
I'm kissing high and low our bodies like two dominoes
Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes
Let's turn this cosplay holiday, what we obey
And now we're welcoming each other to this cabaret
I don't think that it's so terrible, anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable, anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot

[Chorus]
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

[Verse 1]
I was walking through the streets I could not hear my best friend call
He was feeling incomplete about to take his final fall
Last thing I remember there were tears of blood and just not mine
Any other day and I would save you from this cold decline

[Chorus]
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah
The next dimension, show me in

[Verse 2]
We were moving in the world, expanding your realities
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities
Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears
Twenty-Six a number much too small for someone's golden years

[Chorus]
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah
The next dimension, show me in

[Bridge]
You get a little bit more this time when
You give a little bit for your brother's kind
Like she always said, "Oh, don't look back, just look ahead"
You sing a little bit stronger when you
Remember the song of your old best friend
Like she always said, "Oh, don't look back, just look ahead"

[Chorus]
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, oh yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Find me in the suburbs and the shadow of decay
Rolling rings of rubber and the band begins to play
Am I on the right side of the left side of your brain?
Can you see the rising of old yesterday's remains?
Funkadelic said it best I think you know the rest
Time don't stand a chance against this motor madness

[Chorus]
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like

[Verse 2]
The Stooges and J Dilla, yeah, they tore this town apart
Put me back together, well, I guess that's quite an art
Henry won the war you see but not with pen or sword
He did it with the little thing I think it's called a Ford
Funkadelic said it best I think you know the rest
Time don't stand a chance against this motor madness

[Chorus]
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy

[Outro]
Everything's so hazy, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Everything's so hazy

[Verse 1]
I met a man in a rock 'n' roll band, he said "won't you come with me"
I let him know that I could not go, you see I get mine for free

[Chorus 1]
We are all just soldiers in this battlefield of life
One thing that's for certain is my burning appetite

[Verse 2]
Step inside the emotional ride, I could use some company
Illusionary is so damn scary I call my best friend Flea

[Chorus 2]
This Ticonderoga is an element that shines
Connected by the great unknown between us there are lines

[Bridge 1]
Yes I told her that I'm the older cat
Can I scratch your back all day, I would not have it any other way, well
Means so much to me, can you see the we?
What are we ever gonna do when all I want to be is next to you

[Verse 3]
I took a girl from the underworld and I held her way too tight
When it's all been said and done she was not up for the fight

[Chorus 3]
We are all just soldiers in this open field of time
Hoping to get with you when you get right with your mind

[Bridge 2]
It's my favorite, so I savor it
I must report that life is short, so of your love I'll take ten quarts, well
There's no end to this, don't pretend to miss
You and you would not repent for sitting on my elephant and
Am I crazy to join the lazy zoo?
All these human butterflies and cactus flowers, swollen eyes and
I want the devil's share of you, I do declare
Again I'm asking can I do when all these animals want
To be just like you

[Verse 4]
I met a girl with long black hair and she opened up so wide
A daffodil growing in Brazil and I picked her for my bride

[Chorus 4]
We are all just soldiers in this epic loving flight
And no one that I know has ever really done it right

[Outro]
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right

[Verse 1]
Listen to The Beatles and the sound of laughing Ed McMahon
We got high
Educated by a world so full of self and lost in space
Too much pride
Cosmonauts and dirty thoughts are juggling the juggernaut
Soviet Spy
Every now and then when I remember to befriend
The little things in life

[Chorus]
Hey, you're fine, I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs for sure
Hold my hand, I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now

[Verse 2]
Later on, I'll read to you the things that I've been needing
To say goodbye
Walk away from mom and dad to find the love you never had
Tell no lies
Carry on and write a song that says it all and shows it off
'Fore you die
Take a little breath before you catch an early death there is
So much sky

[Chorus]
Hey, you're fine, I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs for sure
Hold my hand, I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now

[Verse 3]
Skinny brains and little stains upon your face, teenage remains
Tell me more
Lifted in the Fifties when you really rather drifted through time
Let's soar

[Chorus]
Hey, you're fine, I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs, for sure, for sure
Hold my hand, I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now

[Verse 1]
Standing naked in your kitchen
Feeling free that I could be alive
Clearly, I'm a contradiction
Too young to be my wife
A peaceful storm is never hectic
Her mellow voice that I could be within
The uniform is anorexic
A jealous choice won't win

[Pre-Chorus]
A metamorphosis samurai
Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why
I got a metamorphosis samurai

[Verse 2]
Paint your face cause I'm a black foot
I thought I counted up the fireflies
Close enough to get a good look
Time to mobilize

[Pre-Chorus]
A metamorphosis samurai
Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why
I got a metamorphosis samurai

[Chorus]
I'm a lonely lad, I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much so don't ask me I've gone insane

[Verse 3]
Taking acid in a graveyard
Stealing food to keep the night alive
Every day I try to play hard
Even with my lies
The day they found you on a tour bus
The news was barren as a desert bone
The tabloids made a kind of small fuss
A couple pictures shown

[Chorus]
I'm a lonely lad, I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much so don't ask me I've gone insane

[Verse 4]
Slowly turning into driftwood
No one ever wants to die alone
Thinking that a pretty gift could
Make you less unknown
Dirty sneakers on the pavement
The brilliant features of a common man
See the miracle of your life
No one ever can

[Chorus]
I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane

[Outro]
See the world go by
The changes that we entertain
I don't recall it all
Remember I have gone insane

[Verse 1]:
Put your arms around me
Head up on my shoulder
Give it to me baby
Can't get any closer

Let your body guide you
Your intoxicated
After all that grey goose
It's time to get naked

[Hook]:
Girl
I know the room is spinning
That's only the beginning
Wait til' i get in it
Ooooooh girl
Get a little fithy
Drink a little with me
Best love is when you are tipsy

[Chorus]:
There's something bout that liquor love
(liquor love)
That liquor love
Can't get enough of liquor love (liquor love)
Of liquor love (x5)

[Hook]:
Girl
I know the room is spinning
That's only the beginning
Wait til' i get in it
Ooooooh girl
Girl
I know the room is spinning
That's only the beginning
Wait til' i get in it
Ooooooh girl
Get a little filthy
Drink a with me
Best love is when you are tipsy

[Chorus] (x2)

[DJ Don Cannon]
It's been a long time coming
Yo, Pose, I think these motherfuckers need a remind
Who has the hip hop singer shit on lock
I don't know what it's gonna take for motherfuckers to listen but
I told you it was a matter of time before this dude took shit over in the game
I told you he was the illest new producer
I told you he was the illest new songwriter
But did you listen? Nah
Now look at him
The dream team is back in effect
DJ Don Cannon, DJ Benzy, Mike Posner
Let's go
Welcome to The Layover

[Intro: DJ Don Cannon]
Yeah, you know what time it is
It's time to give you another exclusive

Y'all motherfuckers ain't ready for this
We got hits on top of hits on top of hits
Straight hits, drop that trick

[Verse 1]
Alright
Forget them other boys baby
Forget them other guys
Yeah I see your nose ring
Might as well be a bull-bullsseye
Used to pull girls like you
Nope, not in 09'
You ain't a mixtape chick baby
Had to sell a million for your time

[Pre-Chorus]
Say hey
Can you hear me? Uh, can you hear me?
One more time, say ayo
Can you hear me?
I can make it rain, make it soak all night
You just give me a chance make it feel alright

[Chorus]
That ass makes me want to oooh
You know exactly what you do
I would really like to take that home
Everybody here knows
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex
She looks like sex, sex, sex, sex

[Outro: DJ Don Cannon]
Alright, Benzi, that's enough

Go and support your boy Mike Posner

Benzi, let's hit 'em with another classic
The Layover, Don Cannon, yeah

[Verse 1]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your ship 

[shit] bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart and soul in your hand
But you played it to the beat

[Post-Chorus: Adele]
Bringing me out the dark
To the beat
To the beat
Bringing me out the dark

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
Cause mine sure won't be shared

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart and soul in your hand
But you played it to the beat

[Post-Chorus: Adele]
Bringing me out the dark
To the beat
To the beat
Bringing me out the dark

[Intro]
We got London on da Track

[Verse 1]
Shawty, you ain't gotta lie to me
You got a nigga on the side, don't you?
You can open up your mind to me, uh
You can open up them thighs to me, uh
But it seems that you fall that way
Always seems to fall that way
'Cause this shit was so hard that way
You still my bitch even when I don't call you that name
12k jet life for that plane
Bape sweats on like 4-5 days
Two shows and I got more to my day
Now you need me, what more can I say?
To you 'cause I, got shit on my mind
And I'm all down for takin' time
But I'm not gon' let you think that

[Chorus]

Don't think that I got forgetful

[Verse 2]
Better have time for me
Bet the next time that I see you
I'ma have somethin' much better than a line for you
Or a rhyme for you
Keep on puttin' you on in all of my songs
'Til you get around to me
Girl, you been down and you stayed around
It's time I put this shit down on you
Let's meet then, baby
Girl, I'm really busy on the weekday
Shawty, be my weekend, lady
Kill the pussy like a horror film
That's what you call freakin', baby
Got some new songs but I heard you like fuckin' to The Weeknd
And we can, get to freakin' in my new motherfuckin' Wraith
And you heard I got the stars in the roof though
Two tone went and got that shit two door
Askin' what the fuck I'm gon' need a new hoe for
When she got the pussy pinker than some nuvo
Hoes like to tell me they love and yeah I might listen
But them hoes ain't worth the time
I be so focused on you, and you know that it's true
And you came at the perfect time
Sorry if...

[Chorus]
I got unforgetful, I got unforgetful
I got unforgetful, I got unforgetful
I never got to tell you
Things I forgot to tell you
So I'm not unforgetful, I'm not unforgetful
I remember the first days
And the worse days and the first dates
I remember the first days
And the worse days and the worse case
The only thing I can't remember is how I got right here in the first place
I remember the, uh yeah, I re-, wait
Don't think that I got forgetful

Fake ass, fake tits 'til that shit is real nigga

Man, lets talk this New Toronto nigga

[Chorus]

Pressure, my nigga Kellz said give 'em that pressure

Came for the moral, not the lesson
All of us came out depression
Just to reunite and flex it
One Umbrella fuckin' Mob, nigga
Homeless kid, I used to rob niggas
Stressin' had me in a deep depression
Givin' niggas pressure, on the job nigga
I would sell that dope to anybody
Anybody tried to ball with ya
Times were so hard on the boulevard
You needed someone to grind with ya
But it was no one to grind with ya
No one's life was on the line with ya
No one was with ya at the 18 market, 4 o'clock, in Saturday mornings
Tryna split the dimes with ya, Lord
Whippin' the soda, you know that I'm gone
Just give 'em that pressure, just give 'em that pressure
Whippin' the soda inside of the kitchen, bakin' soda
Y'all no-whippin' niggas, know we got it goin'
Get it my nigga, that's pressure

[Outro]
Don't give 'em that pressure, don't give 'em that pressure
They want that pressure, know they want that pressure
Don't give 'em that pressure, don't give 'em that pressure, easy Fargo
Don't give 'em that pressure, don't give 'em that pressure, no

[Verse 1]
Oh, sweet thing
Zion doesn't love you
And Babylon don't love you
But you love everything
Oh, you saint
America don't love you
So I could never love you
In spite of everything

[Pre-Chorus]
In the dark of this place
There's the glow of your face
There's the dust on the screen
Of this broken machine
And I can't help but feel
That I've made some mistake
But I let it go
Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ya Hey

[Chorus]
Through the fire and through the flames
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ut Deo, Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
You won't even say your name
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ut Deo, Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say your name
Only "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo

[Verse 2]
Oh, the motherland don't love you
The fatherland don't love you
So why love anything?
Oh, good God
The faithless they don't love you
The zealous hearts don't love you
And that's not gonna change

[Pre-Chorus]
All the cameras and files
All the paranoid styles
All the tension and fear
Of a secret career
And I can't help but feel
That you seen the mistakes
But you let it go
Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ya Hey

[Chorus]
Through the fire and through the flames
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ut Deo, Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
You won't even say your name
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ut Deo, Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say your name
Only "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo

[Middle 8]
Outside the tents, on the festival grounds
As the air began to cool, and the sun went down
My soul swooned, as I faintly heard the sound
Of you spinning "Israelites"
Into "19th Nervous Breakdown"

[Chorus]
Through the fire and through the flames
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ut Deo, Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
You won't even say your name
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ut Deo, Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say your name
Only "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo

[Refrain]
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say your name
Only "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo Annotate
I fly over Nova Scotia, I swim the ocean blue.
I land in New Orleans and eat Poe Boy or two.
I am not the person people expect me to be.
I'm not warm, I'm not over and I am not in between.
I'm living in my car now, I sold all my stuff.
Not because I needed money, because I had too much.
I'm writing this in a notebook, that no one will ever read.
So why am I still pretending I'm who they'd think I'd be?
I am in between the margins, these words are just me clothes.
That I wear to cover up, what I want no one to know.
Jungle Green, Magenta, and Underwater Blue.
I love every single color, Teardrops + Balloons

[Intro]
Ahaha
Akon

[Hook]
Have you ever lost a brother
And then you wonder why nature choose to operate this way
Then you find yourself reminiscing about the old days and why life take a man as a prey

[Verse 1]
I sit and wonder like why couldn't now be like the old days when everything was mad smooth, groovy and sways up in my town don't have to hear that gunshot sound bringing the mad pollution while dead bodies steady being found but still we ignore the negative aspects of life try to keep it nice but all and all i had to pack my steel device
Yeah but back i to expect to 

[?] any attack we bump heads like that then we constantly remain strapped
Till one day we went to this party met this fly chick when they played lodi dodi squeezed her up and continue to parlay boyfriend got jealous got some kiss from broadway so i took the Glock off safety with care replayed it off by rubbing through this girl nice curly hair i stared to my man looked at me and knew it was time he read my mind pop pop pop goes the nine

[Hook X2]

[Verse 2]
Delay on certain sound waves around my way keep it calm cause five-o trying to creep the day its mad hot, not only the sun but the block, then i found myself focusing on the cops Glock, my left devil shoulder told me to grab it and run while the right angel one said "Akon please chill son"
I was fiending to grab the gun and i thought "but i be dissing god if i didn't listen" it was a choice to be made between the two to fear but if it was wasn't for the man i wouldn't be here, so i reacted on my instincts i know these things trying to find the missing links stay away the bad jinx you see my sticks and stones would leave nothing but bones chronic helps me carry on as well as me self shine my chrome my little niggas always got my guard when its hard not to mention all my other brothers 

[?]

[Hook X2]

[Verse 3]
A-kon and his buddy actually passed the first wreck properly now you see how to not become the victim of the static we got their boy now they after us with the automatics its not my fault, i did what i had to, it was all about who pulled the trigger faster but i guess nobody flipped i shot too quick im only here so i remind myself never to flip but still i have extreme raw deal for my man having dreams that this nigga floating on top of land sleeping open indicates his life aim high and hoping that it don't mean that he will soon die but i guess nature spoke for itself all i have left is now is my wealth

[Outro]
Peace bruh
I hope it doesn't happen to you

[Hook X2]

[Verse]
Hands against the wall
Still I ain't never fell this far
Feel the heat on my skin
Haven't seen the sun ever since

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter how, no matter when
I can't get close enough (Can't get close enough)
Reach for the clouds, nothing to spare
Flying like the both of us, the both of us yeah
Whatever we go through, it always leads back to you

[Chorus]
Where the heartbeat is marching
The fire mutes the darkness
Home is where the heart is
So home is where she is, she is
Home is where the heart is
So home is where she is

[Verse]
Hands against the wall
Still I ain't never fell this far
Feel the heat on my skin
Haven't seen the sun ever since

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter how, no matter when
I can't get close enough (Can't get close enough)
Reach for the clouds, nothing to spare
Flying like the both of us, the both of us yeah
Whatever we go through, it always leads back to you

[Chorus]
Where the heartbeat is marching
The fire mutes the darkness
Home is where the heart is
So home is where she is, she is
Home is where the heart is
So home is where she is

[Bridge]
Wouldn't trade this for any other place in the whole world (In the whole world)
Wouldn't trade this for any other place in the whole world (In the whole world)

[Chorus]
Where the heartbeat is marching
The fire mutes the darkness
Home is where the heart is
So home is where she is

[Verse 1]
Take off you make-up, take off your clothes
I wanna wake up next to your nose
Would you let me linger on your lips
I'm still wrapped 'round your fingertips
And if I had me a rocket ship I just fly back home

[Chorus]
'Cause I've looked in New York City
And I've checked in Boston too
I've found a couple that were pretty
But I'm still gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you

[Verse 2]
Why don't you slow down?
I can feel it all now
Your heart is raising, I'm still here
Let your hair down and fear not
'Cause I am going nowhere

[Chorus]
Yes, I've looked in San Fransisco
And I checked all through L.A
I looked in Dallas, Texas
But something didn't feel the same
So I looked in Detroit City
And then I checked back at Duke
I found a couple that were pretty
But I'm still gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you
I'm gonna stay with you

[Outro]
Searched in New York City
Checked in Boston too
Found a couple that were pretty
Still gonna stay with you

[Verse 1]
When I was a young man I carried my pack
And lived the free life of the rover
I smoked on sativa, guitar on my back
And played my little songs all over

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But in 2010, my country said: "son
It's time to stop rambling, there's work to be done"
And they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun
And they shipped me away to the war

[Chorus]
And the DJ played Miley Cyrus
A Party in the USA
And the DJ played Miley Cyrus
And we flew to the Afghan that day

[Verse 2]
I remember the day our orders came in
I was scared and my stomach was sinking
And when Martinez got shot, I cried with my gun
And I fired right back without blinking

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And we moved down the range, we pumped ourselves well
We chased them with bullets
And we showered them with shells
And in ten minutes flood we blown them to hell
I thought of my mom in Atlanta

[Chorus]
Cause she always loved Miley Cyrus
A Party In The USA
Though the words seemed to take on new meaning
As I turned nineteen on that day

[Verse 3]
I looked at my brothers who'd once been young boys
And their eyes have gone black from the slaughters
And for ten weary weeks I kept myself for life
As we moved down the range towards the water

[Pre-Chorus 3]
But then one day a shell knocked my ass over head
And when I woked up in my hospital bed
And when I saw what it had done I wished I was dead
I never knew there were worse things than dying

[Chorus]
And the nurses hummed Miley Cyrus
As the doctors explained what was wrong
Yeah, the nurses hummed Miley Cyrus
But I no longer cared for that song

[Verse 4]
They collected the wounded, the crippled, the maimed
And they sent us all home to Atlanta
The armless, the legless, the blind and the insane
I wore fatigues and a blood red bandana

[Pre-Chorus 4]
We landed on the same runway we'd lefted on February
And when I looked down where my legs used to be
I thanked God that no one was waiting for me
To grieve and to mourn and to pity

[End-Chorus]
And the DJ played Miley Cyrus, again
A Party In The USA
And no one cheered they just stared at us
And slowly turned their heads away
Yes, they slowly turned their heads away

[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
Big money, dollar bills

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Aye, I break a bitch before I make a bitch
And I take a brick before I bake a lick
Gotta cut this and it's an '86
And it's red and white like a peppermint
Got a charger with a body kit, cause the 26 inches couldn't fit
Got a Rolex, costs 60 cent
Police pulled me over, said they couldn't see through tint
Obama Kush, 10 presidents
I spend my whole month rent on an ounce of it
Got a 45 dome, leave the house without it
Got Saks Fifth Ave in my closet, bitch
I got a college bitch, I didn't graduate
But I'm college rich I need knowledge bitch

And I ain't fuckin' with you, got a picky dick

Sayin' watcha wanna do, but won't knock the bitch

Need 30 more man in this topless bitch
Gimme topp kit kick rocks bitch
Need you in the car to get topless
Got a bitch, 1 hoe, I'mma flight risk

[Bridge: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane in verse, no reverse, need to go to church
Girl please don't come 'round on the verse, want your ass the worst
Damn, Guwop, you know you need to hush, you gon' make me blush
Girl gon' suck my dick, I'm in a rush, I'm about to bust
Smokin' cannabis in a bluff, bitch get on this bus

Been around the globe

You're the one I wanna hold
And won't let go, don't ask me too
All the things in your bed, I'm 'bout to do
All that's ran through my head is thoughts of you
Ooh, move that ass on, girl

Baby girl, if you with it

[Chorus: Liz Elias]

Secret admirer
So don't stop rocking my body
Rocking my body, oh
Everything we use to do went wrong
Haven't shed one tear since you've been gone
I've got my pull out chair, football and beer
Ain't got one worry girl cause you ain't here
I've got my freedom back I'll do whatever I want
I guess this is how it's suppose to be
I can't believe it took this long for me to see

That I love that I hate you, I can't stop thinking about the time that you're not here
It's going on without you, hasn't been so bad, it's the best time of the year
Cause I see you and I see him, you know I can't help but grin
And soon enough he'll be saying it too
Girl, I love that I hate you
I love that I hate you

Any other break up I'd be jealous
You can't hide behind the makeup girl you're selfish
You got another man following you around
Like a dog doing tricks to your every sound
I can't believe that use to be me and that use to be us
I love that I hate you, I can't stop thinking about the time that you're not here
It's going on without you, hasn't been so bad, it's the best time of the year
Cause I see you and I see him, you know I can't help but grin
And soon enough he'll be saying it too
Girl, I love that I hate you
I love that I hate you
I love that I hate you

Never thought that I could make it through
But I'm fine on my own with my middle finger salute

That I love that I hate you, I can't stop thinking about the time that you're not here
It's going on without you, hasn't been so bad, it's the best time of the year
Cause I see you and I see him, you know I can't help but grin
And soon enough he'll be saying it too
Girl, I love that I hate you
I love that I hate you
(I love that I hate you)

[Verse 1]
There's a hole in my heart I've been hiding
I've been strong for so long that I'm blind
Is there a place I can go where the lonely river flows?
Where fear ends and faith begins

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in

[Verse 2]
Every step makes me think that I'm closer
But somehow I just never arrived
When our hope disappears, please protect me from my tears
I need you right by my side

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, hallelujah, let me in
I've been praying but I'm paying for my sins
Won't you give me a sign before I lose my mind?
Woah, hallelujah, let me in

[Bridge]
Woah, woah, hallelujah
Woah, woah, hallelujah
All the places I've been
Please forgive me for my sins
Woah, hallelujah, let me in

[Outro]
Woah, woah, let me in
Woah, woah, let me in
Woah, woah
Please forgive me for my sins
Woah, hallelujah, let me in

[Verse 1]
You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
If you could take it all back again
Strike up the tinderbox
Why should I be good if you're not?
This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
To be trapped in your full stop

[Verse 2]
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)
When you take me back
Take me back again
Will you take me back
Take me back again

[Outro]
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time

[Verse 1]
Now as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light, born of a light
The wind rushing 'round my open heart
An open ravine with my spirit wide
Totally alive and my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a street to another life
And catching my reflection in a window
Switching on a light, one I didn’t know
Totally alive, totally released

[Verse 2]
Waking, waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep
Yeah, you, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Standing on the edge of
You, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean

[Outro]
Different types of love
Different types of love
Different types of love
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible

[Verse 1]
It holds us like a phantom
It touches  like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See the moon is smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
Cause we're not at the mercy
Of your chimeras and spells
Your chimeras and spells
Mmmhm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else

[Chorus]
(One day at a time)
One day at a time

[Verse 2]
We call upon the people
The people have this power
The numbers don't decide
The system is a lie
A river running dry
The wings of butterflies
And you may pour us away like soup
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We'll take back what is ours
Take back what is ours

[Chorus]
One day at a time

[Chorus]
Then into your life, there comes a darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour

[Verse]
But it was just a laugh, just a laugh
Just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
A ten ton head, made of wet sand
Oh, this dread circumference
You've gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in the glass
It was just a laugh, just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
In split infinity

[Chorus]
Then into your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Into your darkest hour

[Outro]
When you've had enough of me
When you've had enough of me
Sweet darling
When you've had enough of me
When you've had enough of me
Sweet darling
Sweet times
Sweet darling
Sweet times

[Verse 1]
Hey, it's me, I just got off the train
A frightening place, the faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?
Buy another ticket? The panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great drama, message coming in
In the oh-so-smug glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day

[Verse 2]
Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care
Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
And I don't really care

[Outro]
I feel this love to the core
I feel this love turn cold

[Verse 1]
All the holes at once
Are coming alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind
The lonely and their prey

[Chorus]
The ones you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes

[Verse 2]
All the birds stay up
In the trees
All the fish swim down to the deep
The lonely and their prey
I am here
Come to me
Before it's too late

[Chorus]
The one you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes

[Intro: The Persuasions]
All we need is a little bit of honey, huh
Oh, yes, we do
I know there's gonna be...

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Work every day 'til me meet ends
I will turn it up on weekends
Make a toast, be a real friend
Tell me what you're drinking, cuh

[Hook: The Persuasions]
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times, oh

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
Good times, there gon' be some good times
'Member used to pull up, and let 'em fight?
That's that hood time
'Member used to hold on your hand when nobody would time?
Yeah, I know that bitch trippin', she ain't got that much time
I don't waste time, I don't waste time
I don't have patience, baby
She tryna copy my shit, but she be missin' the hits
Wanna go fast? Wanna race me?
We gon' ball, Walter Payton
We gon' fly through the stations
Come here bae, you're a blessin'
And from you, I learn my lesson
Pop quiz, it's a pop quiz
All my money comin' clean, you can't pop this
But she can't get it locked up like locksmith
Watch her come to my lights, like a reindeer
Me and papi on the same pills
My diamonds, never stand still
Where you goin'? Why you ain't here?
You sold your soul for the mass appeal

[Hook: The Persuasions]
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times, oh

[Verse 3: Dua Lipa]
We be ridin' like a mothafuckin' stroller
I'll survive in a mothafuckin' gutter
That's my mothafuckin' woadie, like the Noila
And I'm colored red like Coke-Cola
I'ma have a very good time
I swear to God, I can't never sideline shorty
She, she said she likes all of my man's rhymes
Where is my phone? That money be callin'
I want you to pass it to Thugger Thugger
Even in the summertime, me and shawty hustle
I swear to God, I'ma tip you, got to struggle
Baby girl, sit it down, you not known like an usher
I told lil' baby, "I don't bite but my teeth do."
I wanna control you like voodoo
I'm steady screaming free, Unfunk and DuLu
Every time I have a good time you do too

[Hook: The Persuasions]
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good
I know there's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times (good times)
There's gonna be good times, oh

Could use a little love, why can't you get enough?
Could use a little love, why can't you get enough?
Could use a little love, why can't you get enough?
Could use a little love, why can't you get enough?

[Verse 1]
Short days, long nights tangled up with you
I don't wanna move
Your eyes don't lie
And if I needed proof, that body tell the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, your body is a blessing
Ooh-ooh-ooh, don't know if I deserve it
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Before round two, I've got a question for you babe

[Chorus]
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good? Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good? Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love, why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love, why does it feel so good?

[Break]
Could use a little love, why can't you get enough?
Could use a little love, why can't you get enough?

[Verse 2]
On the tip of my tongue
The flavor of your skin lingers on my lips
Each time we dine
We do it again, again and again, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, your body is a blessing
Ooh-ooh-ooh, don't know if I deserve it
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Before round two, I've got a question for you babe

[Chorus]
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good? Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good? Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love, why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love, why does it feel so good?

[Break]
Could use a little love, why can't you get enough? Aw yeah

[Bridge]
You know soon that you walk in, it goin' up, goin' up
Slow it down for me, girl, we ain't gotta rush it, we ain't gotta rush it
Always a movie, we ain't sayin' much
Baby, I'm just your type, I know what bad girls like
But I'll confess tonight
Your body is a blessing, oh yeah
What'd I do to deserve it?
Short days, long nights, short days and long nights, yeah

[Chorus]
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good? Why does it feel so good?
If it ain't love
Why does it feel so good? Why does it feel so good?

If it ain't love, why does it feel so good?

[B.o.B]
On the weekday
Don't be surprised, don't be surprised
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)

Walk like us
They even talk like us(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Walk wa-walk like us
But they are not like us(Ha, ha, ha, ha)

On the weekday
You can see the signs, you can see the signs
They wear the disguise

Look into the mind's eye
There's nowhere to hide, ah
Frosting covered lies, ah-a-a-aah
Whispers from afar
We know who you are, ah
Windows to the stars, ah a-ah aaah
Walk like us
They even talk like us(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Walk wa-walk like us
But they are not like us(Ha, ha, ha, ha)

On the weekday
You can see the signs, you can see the signs
Don't be surprised
On the weekday
Read between the lines, read between the lines
They wear the disguise

Look into the mind's eye
There's nowhere to hide, aah
Frosting coated lies, ah-a-a-aah
Whispers from afar
We know who you are, a a aah
Windows to the stars, aha a ahah

Aha ha-aaha-a-aah-aaaaah x8

(Ha ha ha ha...) x4
From the very heart of me
Belief becomes action
And no distractions will take my eyes off the prize
Greatness is my goal
But there's failure on the way
Full of insecurity, self-hate and doubt
But what I can't control can't confine me
And what I can't do can't stop me
This is how I express myself
Not how I follow others expectations
But how I stay true

[Chorus:]
Still in the trap getting money my nigga
Everybody know Soulja Boy is getting figures
Hunnid rounds in the chopper little pussy ass nigga
I’m a kill your whole squad and who ever ride with ya

Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done

Riding through Tallahassee, man
You see a mustang in the street like skeet!
That mean I'm a classic man, ha!

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I burn through them tires like whoa
Paint job shining damn near like gold

I'm an old school nigga till I'm gone on the real
So you can keep that feeling 'cause I know it don't feel like it feel

Switches on the bitch, I put the ass in the sand
Low-pro tires look like elastic bands

Dreads hanging out the 'vert like a palm tree
You see the orange jumper tag, I'm from Florida baby

My whip a classic, nobody else has it
An antique like your grandma's couch with the plastic
Got the brains blowed out with the digi-dance
Candy paint so wet, jump in and splash

And all them hoes on me, and all them hoes on me

[Intro: Conner4Real]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
We're-we're-we're-we're
Hum-hum-hum-hum
Ble-ble-ble-ble
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
We're-we're-we're-we're
Watch out, watch out
It's Conner!

[Chorus: Adam Levine, Conner4Real]
I've got it all and I'm gettin' more
But I never fall, beat 'em all
'Cause you know I'm so humble (I'm so humble)
I'm so humble (I'm so humble, I'm so humble)
I'm a superstar, I kick down the door
Got the money and the girls
And I'm also so humble (I'm so humble)
I'm so humble, (I'm so humble, I'm so humble) I'm so humble

[Verse 1: Conner4Real]
Bar none, I am the most humble-est
Number one at the top of the humble list
My apple crumble is by far the most crumble-est
But I act like it tastes bad outta humbleness
The thing about me that's so impressive
Is how infrequently I mention all of my successes
I poo-poo it when girls say that I should model
My belly's full from all the pride I swallow
I'm the most courteous-biddable, hospitable
Reverential, normal-ary Arnold Schwarzen-orgarary
I hate compliments, put 'em in the mortuary
I'm so ordinary that it's truly quite extraordinary

[Break: Adam Levine, Conner4Real]
It's not a competition, but I'm winnin'
You won't hear me admit it
Because I'm so timid and submissive
I treat fat people like they were thin
Talk simple for the dumbos (Hahahaha)
I'm so humble (I'm so humble)

[Verse 2: Conner4Real]
I'm not your normal definition of a rock star
I don't complain when my private jet is subpar
Ya mom's old, but I'll ask if she's your sister
People say I'm charming, bu-but I beg to differ
I feel more humble than Dikembe Mutombo
After a stumble left him covered in a big pot o' gumbo
I guess in a way, bein' gracious is my weakness
People say I'm so unpretentious for a genius (Hahaha)

[Chorus: Adam Levine, Conner4Real]
I've got it all and I'm gettin' more
But I never fall, beat 'em all
'Cause you know I'm so humble (I say that with no ego!)
I'm so humble (It's just good manners)
They say I'm a ten, but I'm an eight at best
"Plus two," says you
Not me, 'cause I'm so humble (Mama raised me right)
I'm so humble, I'm so humble

[Outro]
Watch out, watch out

[Verse 1]
I look in the mirror
All I see is nothing
I look out the window for some peace
But all I find is nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you take my hand, and suddenly I feel something
Side by side, lying next to you
I feel something

[Chorus]
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you take my hand and suddenly, I feel something
Side by side, lying next to you
I feel something

[Chorus]
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears

[Intro: Post Malone]
A double cup up for my bitches who on the floor shaking they ass, whoa
Bring it on over but baby forgive me if I took the grab, oh
I'm rocking off-white with the camo, I'm spilling Ciroc on my Ablo
I'm trying to fuck with some millions, I promise won't stop 'til I have 'em

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Air Jordans to the ripped jeans
I'm in all black with my gold teeth
Put the OG in the codeine
Your bitch, she so thirsty
Said "Oh Lambo Mercy"
Fuck the police tryna search me
Smoke JUJU tryna curse me
Fuck any motherfucker tryna hurt me
Get smart, quick, unzip way too much zip
Undid zip too much zip
Man, fuck out my business
Young Post get the bills quick
Gold chains, young white Slick Rick
Boy graining my new whip
Drink 40s 'til I feel sick

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I got drugs on drugs on drugs on drugs on drugs
I got bars on bars on bars
ARs, and a bad bitch in my car
I'ma do it for my squad
I'ma do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I'ma do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad (look)
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad

[Verse 2: Bryce Hankins]
Look, let me start this off
Rap game got me pissed off, I'm coming to take it, there's no competition
I'm like that little sign that say I to commission
For those who don't listen, I demand detention
My new name should be shitload of issues
When we at the venue, they don't have a shot, they like unloaded pistols
And I'm countin' my money, I'm big in there honey
They call me billi' for short
Baby, my crib like we own a resort
But yo, that ain't important, what is anymore?
I got bars on bars on bars on bars on bars
And a bad bitch at my car
And she smart, and her frame, please don't get me started
Look, she don't wanna do normal shit
Tryna call me 'bout my government
And she only know the mogul for a couple minutes
But we out in public like we a couple wit' it
You ain't squad, then we ain't fuckin' wit' it
Plus, I really skate so there is a difference
If you ask me, they failed the mission
But you can come to the crib, see how we livin'

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I got drugs on drugs on drugs on drugs on drugs
I got bars on bars on bars
ARs, and a bad bitch in my car
I'ma do it for my squad
I'ma do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I'ma do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad

Nuh probably, di way mi frass mi deev'n recognize ma mama
Mixin' Hennessey and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta (Oh)
Suh mi fling offa santa wid a thirty-two spanner
-ta, missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders (Awoah)
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul, and
Mi ah di hero, di Dancehall Marcus Garvey
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin' (Oh)
Mi dash weh money pon di gyal dem, mi nuh business
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, mi ah throw nannies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's from the North, East and west (Oh)
But when it comes to them trailers in them South Parks
Muffle it, 'cause, homie, that hood's tighter then Kenny's (heh heh)
So, ladies, if your belly button's not an innie, then I'm outie
Now jump inna di S-class wid Addi
Come on

[Chorus: Eminem & Vybz Kartel]
Now you can do this on your own but everyone knows
That no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody (Oh)
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (White trash party, awoah)
Street Vybz a raise, high grade a blaze
Drop di bomb gyal, Al Qaeda ways
Weh di yaad gyal weh, di yaad man deh?
Kartel ah have a badman party (Badman party)

[Bridge: Eminem & Vybz Kartel]
Now whether you're black, white or purple, if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you weren't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil and you're no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood (Ah, ah, awoah)

[Chorus: Eminem & Vybz Kartel]
Now you can do this on your own but everyone knows
That no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party (White trash party, oh)
Street Vybz a raise, high grade a blaze
Drop di bomb gyal, Al Qaeda ways
Weh di yaad gyal weh, di yaad man deh?
Kartel ah have a badman party (Badman party)

[Intro]
What's up y'all? This is Conner4Real
You know I've been all around the world, right?
But tonight I'm on my dumb shit

[Verse 1]
I'm landed in Paris at a quarter to noon
So excited to see her, I went straight to the Louvre
I heard she's exquisite, so I bought my ticket
Pushed my way to the front of the crowd
And I couldn't believe what I saw

[Chorus 1]
Mona Lisa, you're an overrated piece of shit
With your terrible style and your dead shark eyes
And a smirk like you're hiding a dick
What the fuck is this garbage?
Mona Lisa, the original basic bitch
Traveled thousands of miles to see your beautiful smile
Talk about a bait and switch, you ugly

[Verse 2]
I'm landed in Cairo to see the pyramids
But what did I find there? A dirty pile of bricks
There was trash all over and a very foul odor
The smell was that of a camel's ass
But even that wasn't as bad as

[Chorus 2]
Mona Lisa, you're worse than the pyramids
Can someone explain why the whole wide world
Is obsessed with a Garbage Pail Kid
Looks like a Garbage Pail Kid
And DaVinci must have sucked an art historian's dick
To get this girl who looked like uncooked bread
At the top of the all-time list of paintings

[Bridge]
Mona Lisa, I got to know
Where the fuck are your eyebrows, I really wanna know
You could land a helicopter on that big potato forehead
Get this chick some Rogaine
You a bloated corpse, girl

[Chorus 3]
I'm an American man, this is my native land
Where no one lies about paintings
But that's not the case in France
Where the naked ladies dance and they look like Dennis Franz
You're so mangy, Mona
Hair part wider than a country road-a
Unless you count cats, she died alone-a
The Mona Lisa sucks, la da da da da

[Chorus]
That's dumb
Why fall in love? That's dumb
I don't wanna go get lunch
I'm just tryna fuck this dumb
Dumb, dumb, that's dumb
D-U-M-B, that's dumb
40's on a coupe that's dumb
40 on a Rollie that's dumb
Hundred in a duffel that's dumb
D-U-M-B, that's dumb
That's dumb, dumb
That's dumb
Du-du-du-du-du-du-dumb

[Verse 1]
I just tell it how it come to me
Gotta make it sound fly for the dumb niggas
Swear to god im tryna find out what they want wit me
I guess the music in me, use it till they done wit me
And when they done with me, next one
Stages of grief, you just on step one
Forest Gump with the quotes, Don Cheadle
I'ma go teflon
Paranoid nigga sleepin with the pump
Deep Underground Military Bases, that's dumb
Bobby on the beat, that's dumb
I don't under sleep, that's dumb
N-U-M-B, I'm numb
In the studio getting blowed
To the realest shit I ever wrote, wrote, wrote
In a world where they give you a disease
Then sell yo ass the antidote
That's dumb

[Chorus]
That's dumb
Why fall in love? That's dumb
I don't wanna go get lunch
I'm just tryna fuck this dumb
Dumb, dumb, that's dumb
D-U-M-B, that's dumb
40's on a coupe that's dumb
40 on a Rollie that's dumb
Hundred in a duffel that's dumb
D-U-M-B, that's dumb
That's dumb, dumb
That's dumb
Du-du-du-du-du-du-dumb

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Who you know realer than Bob, riddle me that
Who you know talk this much shit on a track
Once you sell your soul no ain't way on getting it back
Oh you gon' have to be much quicker than that
Asymmetrical flows and metaphysical raps
Invoking pivotal moments, exposing criminal acts
For those that live in a mask, that show the critical mass
They tried to give me a roof but now the ceiling is cracked
Cracked, cracked, now the ceiling is cracked
I will not fall in the mud
I will not fall through the cracks
I know that where we're headed is where we been in the past
What happen to Sasquatch?
What happen to Anthrax? (what?)
Where's half your advance at?
What happen to loyalty, and having your man's back?
Where ever the red the white and the blue lands at
We kill the natives and never give 'em they land back

[Chorus]
That's dumb
Why fall in love? That's dumb
I don't wanna go get lunch
I'm just tryna fuck this dumb
Dumb, dumb, that's dumb
D-U-M-B, that's dumb
40's on a coupe that's dumb
40 on a Rollie that's dumb
Hundred in a duffel that's dumb
D-U-M-B, that's dumb
That's dumb, dumb
That's dumb
Du-du-du-du-du-du-dumb

[Outro]
I know when the tide is high, the tide is low
Oh, there's an eye in the sky                                                                  I know when the tide is high, the tide is low
Oh, there's an eye in the sky

I make that price of family
Got visions and I won’t stop until a nigga kill me
22 brothers back home and they need me
Got stacks in my wallet, they say Lil Boat be scheming
Never take bitches with me on the road
Pick them hoes up as we go
I thought that you know, thought that you knew
Went to a yacht from a lil small canoe, woah
I make it look so easy
That’s why they wanna be me, woah
They wanna be me
I remember when they used to laugh at Boat
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
That’s why I don’t listen to nobody, no
Never spend guap on no bitch or no hoe
I remember when they told me, “Boat you can do it”
I told them folks, “sit back and watch me pursue it”

She said do you need some company?

Cause I would love if you would come with me
(Yeah girl sit right there)

And girl I really wanna take you out
Show you what I'm all about
Baby let me work it out
There's nothing in between us now

I see the want too in your eyes
Don't fight it, don't be afraid
I know you want to
So don't lie
Show you why you need me

Don't let this moment be in vain
Don't let me slip away
You'll regret it tomorrow
You'll regret it tomorrow
Don't let the seconds turn to minutes
Please don't make me wait
You'll regret it tomorrow
You'll regret it tomorrow
I just wanna connect with you mentally
Cause I'm attracted to you physically
You remind me of a science class
I wanna study your anatomy

Giving you the green light
Don't treat me like a stop sign
Oh no girl
Don't let me intimidate you
Let me embrace you

I see the want too in your eyes
Don't fight it, don't be afraid
I know you want to
So don't lie
Show you why you need me

Don't let this moment be in vain
Don't let me slip away

[Intro: Zara Larsson]
Mmm, oh

We're born to fly
So let's keep livin' 'til it all falls down
Let's close our eyes
And let the moment drive the whole world out

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever
This one's for you
This one's for you (Yeah)

[Drop: David Guetta]

[Verse 2: Zara Larsson]
Wavin' colored flags
We won't surrender, there's no standin' down  (Standin' down)
Love's a playin' field

We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever (Forever)
This one's for you

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
(do not need nothing else but you)

[Verse 1]
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
I understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh, so won't

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide in
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and

[Chorus]
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

[Outro]
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
I don't need nothing else but you
I'm a feen for the green yea I'm addicted to money
I gotta feed my addiction that fat bitch is hungry
Since a youngin I've realized it's all about the benjamins
I like Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson
But every day I'm constantly disrespecting them
Cause I stay wipeing my ass with dead presidents
I am a veteran spitting better than all of these rookies
They think they harder than woodies but they softer than pussy
I'm like a big red button u really don't wanna push me
I stay with the burner I'm always ready to cook beef
I always got them good treez I stay blazing
On the mic my style is bananas like the AK clip
In real life I'm a sick fuck like aids is
With all these banana clips u betta hope I don't go ape shit
I'll give u a face lift for free
I'll leave u witta dry mouth if u tryta spit with me
Victory is wut I am used to
So I'm a just do me u do u
I'm koo koo u think u gotta couple of screws loose
Don't worry I'll tighting that up with my tool dude
I push fat bricks but if u a bad bitch I'll pull u
Don't waste your time tryna battle me cause you'll lose
I'm not playin this ain't a fuckin game to me
I just aim and squeeze and brains'll leak
Veins'll bleed and just stain the streets
No rat but I'm always chasing cheese
My flows nuts so squirrls always rush the booth
I'm into that beastiality yea fuck the bull
If it ain't bout makin money I don't budge or move
If you ain't bout making money who the fuck is u
I am the greatest

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Gang, gang on everything
I need that Johnny fucking Dang
From every ring and every chain
I think I need a new whip
I want the finest wood grain
I had to skip that bitch a grade
She gave RD the best brain
Then polished all my new chains
I think I need my wrist watch on bling blang
Earrings on ching chang
College ain't for Yachty but I'm going for my mama's sake
I'ma hit that ho 1Night then you gon' take her on a date
You gonna make sure that she straight
And I make sure my future great
Niggas talking heavy but they easy, bust like stemless grapes
2015, I'ma be eighteen, buying my own estates
2016 RD gonna be fucking hoes down by the lake
Wait did that in 2012
Damn RD you living well
Bitches ain't on me begging, but now I'm on my name ring bells
Linking shit like Zelda, so boy respect your elders
I might be younger physically, but mentally I'm older
And visually I'm colder
And psychologically bolder

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I'm back again with backwoods
Hoe roll 'em up
Where were you from throw it up
Cuz all my niggas down to buck
SKT my fucking gang
NAZ my fucking gang
YC that's my fucking gang
'Cause Byou let them pistols bang
Peter Piper picked a pepper
RD ran right through your ranch 'cause you ain't real
Niggas drink a little purple and swear to god they so damn trill
Dirty south Titanium grill
Show your bitch who really real
Looking so damn rich you would've thought a nigga hit a heist
Dabbing with all of this white
Looking like a bowl of rice
Flexing hard I'm Jerry Rice, I'm MVP on every night
If I get on I'm living right
Sip dirty Sprite like every night
RIP to A$AP Yams
Money like a bank scam
Counting all my money on a yacht with my bitch Tam
And she came from Alabama, new whip paint on Tropicana
Make it seem like opera
I'm shooting shit like GRA GRA
In love with the big tatas
Su casa, Mi casa
Run in your shit and then take it
Stacking chips like Vegas

[Intro]
Yeah

Yeah
Ayy

You already know
Soulja

[Chorus]
I drop the top on the Lamb' and did the whole dash
I was high of the Xans, almost crashed
Got a lotta money on me, say a nigga boomin'
Catch me in the trap, 30 on a nigga jewels, man
Niggas talkin' all that shit, but they know I'm on
I'm countin' money, smokin' dope with the roof gone
'Lotta cash on me, you already know
I'm a rich ass nigga wit' a bankroll

[Verse 1]
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash

Young nigga wit' me know I got cash
You ain't even gotta ask, know I got a bag
Young nigga know I'm rich and I'm too on
I'm blowin' dope, countin' money with the roof gone
Catch me in that new Chevy, that bitch two-toned
Nigga disrespect the gang, get that nigga gone
On the plug, talkin' money on my cellphone
Gotta whole lotta cash in my trap home
Lil' Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, know I ride chrome
Nigga snitchin', you know they got tapped phones
Lil' Soulja Boy, know I get a lotta bands
Niggas hatin' on me cause I'm goin' up on Instagram
Ten chains on my neck with a lotta cash
Pop Xans, pop Xans, almost crashed

[Chorus]
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
I was high off the Xans, almost crashed
You ain't even gotta ask, know I got bands
I'm a young rich nigga, keep a lotta cash
Niggas hatin' in the trap, so I keep the strap

[Verse 2]
On the phone, countin' money, strap in my lap
On the phone, countin' money, strap in my lap
On the phone, countin' money, strap in my lap
You already know a nigga too on
I'm in the coup, blowin' dope, got my mind gone
In the booth, smokin' dope, in my damn zone
Got a lotta AK's in my damn home
Nigga disrespect 'Dre, I'ma kill him
Nigga snitchin' on the hood, we don't feel that
Whole lotta snake niggas ain't no good
Got caught and he snitched on the whole hood

[Chorus]
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash

[Verse 3]
Yeah, get money, fuck bitches, that's what they told me
Snake ass nigga snitched on my OG
In the trap whippin' work, yeah a whole key
Get money, pull up on yo block with the heat
In the streets, you can catch me with the 30 clip
Nigga disrespect, they can get them hollow tips
Pull up to the trap, know a nigga hood rich
Catch me in the hood spot, posted with a hood bitch
Thirty thousand on my motherfucking bracelet
I'm gettin' money, man them niggas gotta face it
I'm gettin' money, man I know them niggas hate it
I don't give a fuck, man you know a nigga paid, man
Pull up to the trap, know a nigga gettin' cake
Disrespect the squad, get hit with the .38
A lotta money in my trap, get up out my way
If you ain't talkin' money, get the fuck up out my face
Copped a Rollie on my wrist and it was busted down
I hit the city on the block and I'm like what now?
Them niggas hot on the block and I'm like what now?
Two hands in the air like I scored a touchdown
Fifty clip on a round, let the nigga get it
Disrespectin' on Soulja, know I'm stackin' millions
Nigga talking bout they gettin', they ain't gettin' shit
Broke ass nigga in the block, ain't hittin' licks

[Chorus]
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
I was high off the Xans, almost crashed
Young rich nigga, know I got a lotta bands
You ain't gotta ask me, you know I get a lotta cash

[Outro]
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash
Drop the top on the Lamb', then I did the dash

[Verse 1]
Holding my own hand, walking all alone down a road
Holding my own hand, feeling the tips of my ears getting cold
A bell rings as a ghost walks up beside me, with a face like mine
And tells me that I won’t always be lonely, it just takes a little time

[Chorus]
I wanted you, but you didn’t want me
Good Lord, heaven knows I’m bad with love
I wanted you, but you didn’t want me
Good Lord, heaven knows I’ve been banged up

[Verse 2]
Oh, my sister, dead men are singing on the radio
Oh, my sister, it’s all they ever seem to play anymore
A bell rings as I walk into a hotel, nobody’s inside
A purple cat comes floating down the stairwell
With its blue eyes shining bright, suddenly I feel alright
Look out

[Chorus]
I wanted you, but you didn’t want me
Good Lord, heaven knows I’ve been beat up
I wanted you, but you didn’t want me
Good Lord, heaven knows I’ll bandage up
Ba da ba
Ba da ba oooh

Long way home

Ba da ba oooh

Ba da ba oooh
Ba da ba
Ba da ba aahh

Long way home
Long way home
90 miles an hour down the fuckin’ road and I’m stoned, with my boys
It’s a long way home
Well this trip is long
How did it get so long?
Remember what you promised them…

Long way home
Long way home with my boys
90 miles an hour down the fuckin' street with my team, with my boys

Still a long way home
Well it’s been so long since you said so long
Remember what you promised them

[Verse 1]
Oh, it's such a butterfly feelin' to have you for a friend
Oh, but somehow I get the feeling that I'll be lonely again

[Chorus]
And in a little while I'll be gone, yeah
And in a little while I'll be gone
It only takes a little while to get along
So come on baby, give a smile and come on
Ah yeah!
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 2]
And when The Zombies started singin' 'bout the season
You know your daddy got up to dance
And it wasn't for any other reason than the feelin' in his corduroy pants
And in a little while daddy's gone
Yeah, and in a little while, there goes mom
It only takes a little while to get along
So come on baby, give a smile and come on
Ah yeah!
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

[Chorus]
And in a little while I'll be gone
Yeah, and in a little while I'll be gone
It only takes a little while to get along
So come on baby, give a smile and come on…
Ah yeah!

[Outro]
It only takes a little while
Yeah, it takes a little while
It only takes a little while
Yeah, it takes a little while

Just as long as they know, money made me do it (They know)
I said rest in peace to Bankroll (Free, God bless you)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Take a ride when we wake up
Hit the gas, melt your face off (Your face)
Spend the day countin' cake up
With a dime, who think I changed up? (I changed up)
I took the Lincoln down Rodeo (Skrrt, skrrt)
Ran through it like some Drano (Ooh, ooh)
Lot of bags, can't complain though (No, no)
We was shoppin' 'til they closed
Why did I do that? Did I do that? Ooh, yeah (Uh)
New whip, now I can't pay my rent, ooh no, ooh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone & 2 Chainz]
Diamonds in my chain gold (Okay)
Every twenty minutes, change clothes (Change up)
I had a mil' before the label (That money)
Just as long as they know, money made me do it (They know)
I said rest in peace to Bankroll (Free, God bless you)
You in a better place, dawg (God bless you)
You won't ever see me lay low (They know it)
Start the engine, watch me take off, money made me do it (Skrrt, skrrt)

Got a bandana 'round my neck, like Bankroll Fresh (Free)
Pocket full of street money (Street), 'bout to count my blessin' (Street)
One hundred, one thousand, one hundred K, one million (Uh)
We smoke, we laugh, we rap, we talked about a vision (Switch it up, haha)
I got diamonds like a rainbow every time I change clothes
Shawty fucked my friend, but I act like I ain't know
I'ma buy a raincoat, the storm might approach you
Clown like your daddy met your mom at a circus
I do it on purpose, do it for the neighborhood
Smokin' on that Meagan Good, with my niggas when I do it
Got that leather and that wood, I got the marble on the floor
Got the burglar bars on the door at the bando

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone & 2 Chainz]
Diamonds in my chain gold (Okay)
Every twenty minutes, change clothes (Change up)

Can’t help but piss all my youth down the well
And wave my hand watchin' it go
If you gotta hold onto something
You better hold onto yourself
Your whole life is just space between holes

[Chorus]
Oh I’d be through, oh I’d be through
Oh I don’t know what I would do...
If I couldn’t have you

[Verse 2]
Stains on my polyester coat, stains on my mind
Stains on airplane lavatory doors
Shakin' hands with sycophantic cunts mile after mile
And pilin' up all the money that never shows

[Chorus]
Oh I’d be through, oh I’d be through
Oh I don’t know what I would do
If I couldn’t have...

[Bridge]
I could never let you go
My life seems to be all confusion and woe
I could never ever let you go
If I couldn’t have you baby I would just let it flow

Oh I’d be through, oh I’d be through
Oh I don’t know what I would do
If I couldn’t have you

[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ahh
Ah, ah, ah, ahh
Woo, woo, ayy

[Verse 1]
I'm in a four-door down Rodeo
I'm getting fucked up, I'm losing control
I'm bumping Fleetwood, she tryna turn off my song
She keep asking where the party at
I got a flask full of vodka in my passenger seat
My homie got a mansion says that we could crash it for free
We gotta take the phones because we can't let nobody see
We pop a pill since you ain't have not a thing to eat, oh, oh, ooh

[Chorus]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
And players only love you when they're playing, ayy

When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

You will know
You will know

'Cause I got dreams, don't hold me down

Say, women, they will come and they will go

[Interlude]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Part II: Come Down]

[Chorus]
I thought that I would learn by now
I thought that I would never come down (I would never come down)
Just last night we was going so hard (So hard)
But now I can't feel my heart
And yeah, let me down easy, don't let me down rough
Don't let me go to sleep, getting up is gon' be tough
They was all actin' sleazy, they all said I was the one (I was the one)
And with any damn luck, I'ma wake up with the sun
Hope I wake up with the sun this morning, oh
I hope I wake up with the sun this morning, oh

[Verse]
And let it pour, let it pour, let it pour, let me roll
Man, I'm on a roll, I'm so up in my zone
They thought that I was fuckin' done with Iverson
But I'm still ballin' on these bitches, let 'em know
I just want everything, I want it all in advance
They just want me call it quits
Homie, just roll up a cig
Lil Posty don't fuck with y'all
Never been fuckin' with y'all

Hope I wake up with the sun this morning
I hope I wake up with the sun this morning

[Verse 1]
Oh, the last time I saw Paul
I was horrible and almost let him in
But I stopped and caught the wall
And my mouth got dry so all I did was take him for a spin
Yeah, we hopped inside my car
And I drove in circles 'round the freight train yard
And he turned the headlights off
Then he pulled the bottle out
And then he showed me what was love

[Chorus]
I'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
I'll be your record player, baby, if you know what I mean
I'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
I'll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death

[Verse 2]
In the blossom of the months
I was sure that I'd get driven off with thought
So I swallowed all of it
As I realized there was no one who could kiss away my shit

[Chorus]
I'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
I'll be your record player baby if you know what I mean
I'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
I'll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death

[Verse 3]
Paul, I know you said that you'd take me any way I came or went
But I'll push you from my brain
See, you're gentle, baby
I couldn't stay, I'd only bring you pain

[Chorus]
I was your starry-eyed lover and the one that you saw
I was your hurricane rider and the woman you'd call
We were just two moonshiners on the cusp of a breath
And I've been burning for you baby since the minute I left

Anonymous bending corners with burners on us
Come and ride with me
Birkin duffle a hundred thousand in it
Aye, nigga, roll up
Anyway, D'Usse mixed with lemonade
Feeling good like I'm dealing ye
Moving ten a day
Time limit never
Could do this shit forever
Can't even put it in words, how I am in love with her
From slinging work on the curb, hustling drugs with her
The jet ride 50 million, a wonderful feeling
Shit, I'm high as a motherfucker
Don't ask me shit, make me lie to you motherfucker
Man truth is for real, feel like Dre and Pharrell
Mixed with Eric B. and Rakim, shawty hell on the scale
And still the game enticing me, like every time I see her
They like to pop a seal, high enough to see Aaliyah
For real, and man, I know how to chill
You don't know how good it make a nigga feel

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
I'm coming down

[Verse 2: T.I.]
This winter shit got me high as a bitch
Dripping sauce kicking flavor, super fly with the shit
Don't need a gram to get laid, an ounce to get paid
G Kush to roll up, a drink to pour up
Anyone know us, they know trap shit in our DNA
Numbers on a need-to-know basis, this ain't no Q&A
I promised Dre that I would put the game on lock
And ain't no taking that shit back, put it on everything I got
God damn
Aventador, hopping out a Lamb
In residential areas flyin', I'm getting outta 'Dam
Ma'am tell your son he better watch it, cause we roll
And disrespect is not an option in my neighborhood
So watch how you talking to me
Even if we know you hating, then that is all it can be
Cause if call in all the niggas indebted to me
Find you ass OD'd
Dead ass can be

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
I'm coming down

[Bridge: T.I.]
Ok, compliment my watch and call it that old thing
Blowing gasoline to put my hat on lean
Where I stay all they say is “Fuck Trump”, all day
Two or three pistolero with me eh hombre
She brought an ‘O of kush to me and a six pack
Okay, well, I’m about to roll it up and hit that
Now I’mma make her wipe me down like a wet sink
Ride it like a jet ski, pass it to the next bitch
Aye

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
I'm coming down

Boy really you get me high

[Intro: Yolandi & Ninja]
Jissus, this is hard shit, aye
Aye, let's go back... let's go to the Caribbean!
Ah, my Ninja!

[Chorus: Yolandi & Ninja]
I miss you, baby love, I'ma see you soon
Fuck it, I've been so busy, spinning 'round in a whirlwind
Can't you just come here? I just wanna be with you
I'm on a mission, but I'm missin' my little girlfriend
It's cool, you gotta do what you gotta do
I'm gonna be there soon, yo, baby, tell me what you want to do
Smoke a fat blunt, and snuggle up beside you
Oh, motherfuck, there's nothing in the world that I would rather do

[Pre-Chorus: Yolandi]
Zef kid all around the world, I'm a busy girl
Missing my baby when I'm getting home
Calling doctor green thumb for some medicinal
Weed, fuck going out, I wanna be invisible
Pop a fat blunt in your mouth, there we go
Boy, you illin', chillin' like a villain, feeling all

[Hook: Yolandi]
Dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused
Dazed and confused
So dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused
Dazed and confused
So dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid

[Verse 2: Ninja]
I'm in the fucking zone, yo, I've been working hard all day
Taking it to the next, yo, I been stepping up my game
Mass murderer, Ninja, he don't play
Got no time for a fuckboy, yo, I'll put him in his grave
We bring it hard, we make it rough
Soon I'm gonna take a break and go visit my baby love
Let's take a break, let's get away
Fuck it, I think Ninja deserves a little holiday
You, me, jump on a plane
I know where we should go, yo, it's gonna be insane
Yo, ask your friends if they wanna go
Tell them I got it covered, I be making fucking dough
Shrooms, bums, fun in the sun
Chillin' like a villain deep in the Caribbean
Sippin' champagne, smoking mad weed
All day, everyday

[Chorus: Yolandi & Ninja]
I miss you, baby love, I'ma see you soon
Fuck it, I've been so busy, spinning 'round in a whirlwind
Can't you just come here? I just wanna be with you
I'm on a mission, but I'm missin' my little girlfriend
Just keep doing what you doing, baby, kill them all
Soon, I'll be illin', chillin' like a villain, feeling all

[Chorus: Yolandi]
Dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused
Dazed and confused
So dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid
Dazed and confused

So dazed and confused
So cute and paranoid

And it don't matter
What they say

[Verse 1]
This is for the little girls
That say "Nicki, you pretty."
When you come to the city
You don't act hassadiddy
You be all on the block
Or posted up in the drop
And everybody get a band
Whether you like it or not
But how you girls blow up
And don't come to the hood
How they turn their nose up
Like they don't come from the hood
Most of them be in sight
'Til it's time for picture
That's why everything
They write be a contradiction
I tell 'em I do it for the love
I do it for the hugs
I do it for the bugs
I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich
I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid
That can't do no more

[Hook]
I got next

To get mine
I got next
And it don't matter
What they say
We gon' make it

[Verse 2]
This is for my lil homies
That be asking for kisses
When I'm granting their wishes
They be passing they digits
Carry up on the block
Getting screwed by the cop
Cutting school, getting off
Whether they like it or not
They'll break in your dough
Might break in your joe
They'll bring back a lot
If you bring them an O
But what you really ain't know
They airborne for start
With the ball in the gutter
They can't turn no dodge
No matter the squadron
Lieutenant or sergent
Air force the army
Air force in army
Four teets is on 'em
No heat is on 'em
'Cause grandmama prayed
That he leave the corner

[Hook]
I got next
It's my time

And it don't matter
What they say

[Verse 3]
I remember when I lost
Everything in a fire
And now I got fire
23s on my tire
Shoutout to my brothers
Jelani and Micaiah
Thanks to the Messiah
My money getting higher
One time for my niggas
That be hugging the block
Two times for my niggas
That be ducking the cop
Three times for my girls
That pushing they own ride
Specially they own life
Bitches they don't like
Sometimes you get mad
When I blaze the gun
I see you without a man
May I raise your son
But look, when you blow up
Everybody gon' shut up
This goes out to everybody
On the come up

[Hook]
I got next
It's my time
I got next
To get mine

I'm on my grind
I got next

The scapegoat I guess I'm Bin Laden

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Compared to Donald Trump
I'm neck and neck with the death threats
Got the best vest, and the best text
I need less stress and the best sex
Nude photos are the best text
Life is too short to be depressed, yes
But I'm too focused on the next step
And I'm restless

Dreams are made of, same thing that my genes are made of
Real niggas what my team is made of
No Day 2's, Day 3's, just Day 1's
Puppet niggas move when the strings are raised up
Fame is a drug niggas fiend for a taste of
Broke hoes smoke all your weed, snapchat they weave
Then leave when the drinks is drank up, tuh!
I aim to provoke
I don't mean financial when I say you broke
You broke in your heart, you lost in your thoughts, and you broke in your soul
Emotions evoke
Mentally stunting more issues then Vogue
Doors open and close
But you wouldn't notice it though, though, though...

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I go, it’s like you’re there somehow
Everything I know, been replaced with you by now
I don’t care about paying the rent if you don’t

[Verse 2]
Every time I sleep, I dream about you again
I lose track of my feet when I think about you, my friend
And I don’t care about parents or friends if you don’t

[Chorus]
But I don’t wanna be yours, I don’t wanna be yours
I wanna be bored of you, if you’re bored of me

[Verse 3]
Everything I own, I made it all yours
Though I’ve tried to atone, I should’ve before the end
I don’t care about sharing the blame if you don’t

[Verse 4]
Are you feelin' free, do you ever feel down sometimes?
Do you think of me? Did my sky face fade with time?
If you don’t care about a goddamn thing that I do…

[Chorus]
Then I don’t wanna be yours, I don’t wanna be yours
I wanna be bored of you, if you’re bored of me

[Verse 1]
Papa Ken
Tells me whenever you've been crying
Angry about you all the time, yeah
Spin 'round until you get a Shiner
Things could be better, that's for sure

[Chorus]
I know it's hard
But I'm never gonna be so far
I know, don't try
Cause you'll never find a reason why (Ha)

[Verse 2]
You're crying
Make sure your brother is under wraps
You speak and everybody claps
Tuck in your pants between your boots
Roaming frenetic in the streets

[Chorus]
I know it's hard
But I'm never gonna be so far
I know, don't try
Cause you'll never find a reason why

[Verse 1]
Brothers
Why so still?
Feeling empty
Feeling ill

Roll up
One more noose
I'm all gone now
Just like you
Why so few?

[Chorus]
Wizard, I know, we got away
Wizard, you'll be okay, okay
Wizard, I know, we got away
Wizard, you'll be okay, okay

[Verse 2]
Settlers
We moved out
Throwed up heavy
I'll see you 'round
Drinking
In a bar
I'll be dango
You'll be dark
We'll go far

[Chorus]
Wizard, I know, we got away
Wizard, you'll be okay, okay
Wizard, I know, we got away

See them sh-roomies right there we ain't got no worries

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi in this bitch, errybody should be worried

And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear’ll have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleep
All these bitches think they’re the shit, I’ll send them up shit’s creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It's ok if you turn up just don't turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I'm smoking I grew it
B’s up, Blood Gang; Piru it, and all rats gotta die even Stuart
On my private jet and my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch Nigga

You don't get dissed, you get disfigured
She say sorry I didn't shave so that pussy a little furry
I put that pussy in my face: I ain't got no worries
Tunechi

[Hook: Detail]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
We ain't got no worries
She bad as a hooker, so she ain't got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar, I say "Why you in a hurry?"
She say "Why you asking questions?" I say "Bitch you trynna be funny!"
Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see that Donkey Kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bar
That camel toe that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show
I swear I saw my ho, I swear she was with my ho
You know I fuck them both, sore pussy and sore throat
Bitch it's Tunechi and I'm out chea, no worries no worries
I would talk about my dick, but man that shit be a long story
YEAHHH, OHH SHIT, UH HUH, YEAHH, YOUNG MULA BABY!

[Hook: Detail]


X
“You know I fuck them both, sore pussy and sore throat”
He fucks her oral and vaginal, he does it for so long, and he is so big he makes it sore
“Bitch it’s Tunechi and I’m out chea, no worries no worries”
He is Tunechi, He is out in the hood hustlin running from cops with no worries
Look at that handsome face!

Uhh! Okay. Just wanna check the mic first (?) get the sound right. This is not comedy hour, I promise.

The funny thing is: I used to go to this school. And my class used to sit like in this area, here. Yeah, O2, who’s an O2er?

Kendra, come here! Kendra, come on! Kendra (?) everybody! Come, give me a hug! I mean, how long has it been, two decades? Come up here! I was at all doing me. (?). How about that – reunion!

Okay. So, it’s just a little surreal, I haven’t been in this room since 1999, 2000 maybe. So, I’m 31, I just turned 31 on January 30th, how about that? Oh, thank you, thank you.

And, when I was approached to do this Ted Talk, I was immediately like: Why? And, then it was kinda like, put in perspective by me, in – I’m not really one to do speeches, I’m really weird, if you can imagine as I do the performing and I’m on stage, doing this is my job. It’s different to stand up in front of people like this when there’s this light and speak and, you know, express yourself in this way.

But, I told myself, okay, how am I gonna be able to do this, let me just talk about my life. That’s something I know, better than anyone else. And, I feel like coming from Cleveland, coming from Shaker, you know, such a diverse place, and just looking in the audience from the people I can’t see, it’s still … very diverse. But, I believe that my upbringing in this town, the school, district, is what made me the man I am today.

And when I moved away when I was 20 years old, my mom was extremely sad – where’s my mom at? Yeah. She was crying. Hey Mommy. My first big fan was my mom. And, it was really interesting, I remember leaving home, and she’s giving me a hug at the airport, and she leans and she goes: “You can always come back around, you can go right back home, you can change your mind, everything will be fine.” I’m like: “No, I’m going, this is happening.” And you know, walk into security and then looking back and just seeing her like: “Ohhh...” And me just being like: “Errr…”

However, as soon as I turned back around, I knew I was on a mission, on this very specific quest. You know? It was bigger than just wanting to be a musician, or do movies. It was about: Finally showing the world what Scott could do. I wasn’t the best student, I’mma be honest with you, Kendra knows this. If Kendra was in my class and she was sitting next to me I probably would have tried to cheat off her.

But that’s not the point. The point is, it’s like: When I think about it, you know, I wish I applied myself as much as I applied all the energy into music as I did, as in music as, you know, as in music, I wish I could have applied that same energy into my academics when I was in school. So a lot of people look at me now and they go: “Oh man, this must be dope to be a rapper.” And it is dope, it’s awesome. (?)

But, you know, I can’t say that I don’t wanna sometimes go back and relearn some things. I can’t say I don’t feel out of certain conversations that my friends have. You know, and these are things that I think about, you know, cause being at school is all about being cool and wearing the fresh – I was gonna curse but – wearing fresh clothing. And being popular. And, when you go out into the real world, you realize that that moment is just a little beep of your life. High school, you know. Now I remember Kendra (?), but everything else I don’t remember. No I’m just joking. But I’m just saying: At that moment in life you feel like that’s all that matters. High school, it’s like: Oh this girl doesn’t like me, this guy here and there’s all this drama, this drama, and you go into the real world and you know it’s about just trying to make your mark in the world. And I never got the chance to do that academically.
So I had this fire, I had this fire to pursue this musical career. I had no idea how to go about it. I was living with my uncle who was up in the age at the time. 80 years old. Older uncle. So when I moved to New York it’s not he could show me around, show me all the cool spots, you know, he was just kinda like: “There’s the train and you get a metro card, and you go.” And I was: “Yeah okay, we got the Rapid, I can do this. It’s all right.” I was immediately wrong for that, for assuming that it was gonna be the same. It is not the same.

Um, but, I embraced it. I embraced the fear, the danger. I enjoyed the fact that I was going in uncharted territory. It was like a sense of wonder for me. And, I can’t say I was one of those people that was into like having thrills and, you know, getting some type of stimulation from that, but it was nothing like saying, like: “Y’all I’m gonna out and pursue something and I know I’m gonna do it. And nobody’s gonna tell me I can’t. And everybody that doesn’t believe it I’mma prove it to ‘em sooner or later. And that’s just what it is.” Because I won’t point I didn’t feel like I was smart enough to pass that test. Or I didn’t feel like I was smart enough to go to this college.

But with music it was like: Nobody’s gonna take that from me. You know what I’m saying? Because it was things that I was dealing with as a youth at this school that I didn’t talk to people about. That probably kept me from put my best foot forward with my academics. You know? And with music, it was a platform for me to express myself and also realize that I’m not that crazy. That there’s other kids out there that might me depressed or lonely, dealing with suicide, things like this.

And, it was one of those things that, you know, I just feel really blessed to just have my mom who has been my supporter forever, who supplied that trip financially, first couple of months or whatever. Um, to have the support of my home town, I can come back in this room and just feel the love and energy, you guys got me really nervous, my palms are sweaty. But, um, it’s really just the clock, it’s like: 11 minutes, 24 seconds, 23 seconds, 22 seconds … It’s like what’s gonna happen when that clock’s over with? It’s like somebody gon’ just pull me off stage? Geez.

Um. But um, really, I, first thing I did when I went to New York, and most people think it was kinda like this amazing adventure – it wasn’t. It was pretty much finding a job. And for the first couple years I was working everywhere. You know, whether it was like at this clothing store here, or Abercrombie & Fitch, or American Apparel, or Dean & DeLuca, I always had a job. I was a hustler. And, you know, I still apply that same work ethic with the music.

You know what I mean, like, I’m almost in a way don’t know how to relax because my whole life has been just a grind. You know what I mean? And, I think that, when people ask me: “Man, how do you do it”, you know, I’m just kinda like: “I don’t know, like I was just … focused?” You know? Because it’s hard to put it into words because I can’t say that it’s just something I flipped, a switch I just flipped when I turned 20. Like I was always this guy.

You know, I was always outspoken and creative and artsy, I used to draw when I was a kid, it was before all the musical stuff came along. I was an artist. You know, I used to draw all my stuff, I used to draw all my tattoos and I said: “Oh when I get 18, I’mma draw, I’mma get these tatted.” It was about being a cartoonist up until I was like 15. And then I just wanted to be a rapper. And then it was all uphill from that.

But, you know, … if I could really just give people one piece of advice, you know, and it just passes along, and one thing I want you to take from this, is that like, we are all the commanders of our own destiny.

You know what I mean?

It’s like you see these movies where they say, like that one movie with … Lucy, where she has 100 percent of her brain power and she can do anything she wants. You know, and you realize that the average human doesn’t use at … two, three percent. You know what I mean? Some weird small percentage like that.

I really just told myself from jump like: “Hey man, I’m gonna do this, and I apply the information that I needed to execute that and in places, times of my life where I didn’t have the answers, I make sure to get the information or surround myself with people that had the information.” You know what I mean? You can’t hang out with people that ain’t doing nothing. How you gon’ get money, hanging around with people that ain’t got no money? You know what I’m saying?

Like, how you gon’ be inspired by people who aren’t at least trying to go the same way, at least, whether it’s music, or schooling, like I would be inspired by all my friends, cause, I went to college, I went to University Toledo for one year for film – it sucked, I hated it. You know, it wasn’t for me. But my film class, my film classes were amazing, um, and now that I’m doing acting, producing shows, writing shows, I wish I wrote that whole couple, three more years out, cause I would have information that I needed, and I wouldn’t have to go through so many hoops, to be able to direct or create my own film or TV show. Um, I don’t know why I said that, let me get back on track … Okay.

So, um, really, you know, people, like I say, come up to me all the time and they like: “Man but you did it man, you’re special, you’re different” – and I’m not. Any different. From you, you – we’re all the same. I came from this town. I went to this school. All my buddies, we all had the same opportunities, you know? It’s kinda just like: Having that self-confidence. You know? And it was a lot of areas in my personality where I wasn’t as confident. You know? Definitely with the chicks. Early on. I don’t know if Kendra knows this.
But the music, me doing something, where I was like: “Wow, I made this!” Like my first album, when that came out, I was like: “Wow! I made this, this is something that I put all my energy into, and it’s out and it’s released to the world on a professional level.” I was so proud of myself. But: “Let’s do it again.” I didn’t have time to be like: “Yeah, my first album, yeah, yeah, people like it”, it was like: “Okay, we did good, it didn’t suck, what are we gonna do again, we gotta do another one.” And then I did that one: “Okay, people like it, let’s do a third one.” You can’t get caught up in just all the other things, you know, I really was like, even still to this day, I have my front, but it’s focused, you know, it’s never, you know, even when I do straight, I’m still working. I’m still writing a song, I’m still doing something. I’m persistent.

You know, um, and that’s also another part, you know, I believe that some people get lazy. Some people might have that one painting that they started to paint and never finish it. Because they get caught up in their head and it’s: “Oh, I can’t do this, maybe I can’t do this.” It’s like sticking to something. One goal at a time. You know, that was like, that’s still big for me. I never put too much on my plate. You know, at first it was like the music, and then the acting kinda came into play, early on, and I, it was unexpected, but it was a blessing, that I was prepared for. I was like: “Man. I’ve been a class clown since forever, let’s do this.” And I used to do it for free, now I’m getting paid for, this is great. Um, so, you know, I’m glad you guys like my jokes, I’m not even a comedian, this is just…

Um, so, you know, just kinda fast forward cause it’s so much I’m tryna squeeze into 5 minutes, 56 seconds. Um, but, you know man, there are a lot of haters, there are a lot of doubters, there are a lot of people that would telling me: “Man you ain’t gon’ do that.” “That’s not gon’ happen.” “He’ll be back.” I would tell all my buddies: “I’m moving to New York” – “All right! You’ll be back!” Nah. Nah. I’m not coming back. And if I do come back, it’s for a concert. You know? And everybody be like: “Alright, whatever.”

And when I came back it was for a concert. It was for a concert, and it was the most beautiful homecoming I’ve ever had. It’s no show more important than this show. And I’m not just saying that because it was like: In Cleveland, and it’s like, my home town. It was the first time I saw my peers, friends I went to school with, being proud of me. I didn’t get the moment to walk across stage with everybody. I didn’t get the cap and gown. You know what I mean? I didn’t get the chance to see these guys because I moved to Solon, 11th grade. It’s like even seeing Kendra is wild, because I haven’t seen anybody in so long. Um, but, that’s the beautiful moment, still to this day, I do shows and I see a class mate in the crowd and I forget my raps, I’m gonna: “Oh … oh … happy, you got any kids, I’m sorry, I gotta …”, you know? It’s wild. You know?

And, I didn’t get that at school. I didn’t play on the football team – I tried, but I was terrible. I didn’t play on the basketball team – I tried, but I was terrible. I didn’t wrestle. I tried – no, no. I did try. But I tried outside of the Shaker Heights High School, in another district in Cleveland Heights, where none of my peers could see me and me be embarrassed. It was kinda just like: “Okay I try this in 7th grade and be terrible and then nobody in Shaker will know about it – cause it’s in Cleveland Heights, they’re just talking over there.”

But my point is also like music was my plan G. You know, it wasn’t like I didn’t try anything else, like I tried everything else. I tried everything I thought, you know, was a traditional thing a young boy should do – sports, you know, and even going to college was me just tryna fulfill a destiny where I thought it was my own destiny, but also I wanted to make my mom happy. You know? And sometimes guys, we gotta do that. You know, there’s a lot of things that we don’t wanna do stuff, but it’s like, man, like, your parents (?), they really have to deal with a lot of our shit. And you know it’s like, and now I’m at 31 and I’m just like: I have to apologize to my mom, was it like seven years ago, I was like: “Mom, I am sorry.” Like: “I was a nightmare. But we got money now, so let’s just go like…” And we’re okay. We’re good now.

Um, and it’s funny, too, cause I took my mom to get her first tattoo ever, I forced her to get a tattoo, and it’s so funny, cause she – are you, are you embarrassed, I’m sorry. But this is big, you know, because our relationship from the kid I was at high school, it’s the best it’s ever been. You know, I used to put my mom through hell. But, she was my supporter. And that’s what parents are there to do. To give you the devil’s advocate, even when, I’m not gon’ say, every time I told my mom I was moving to New York, she was like: “Pff. Okay. Aight.” You know, but that was more so like the fear of letting your child go out into the world, more so like the people in the street that are just hating on you don’t wanna see you win.

Parents care. Now I got a four-and-a-half-year-old, she’ll be five in march. She’s the apple of my eye. She’s my little baby. And, she’s so funny, you know, cause, I’m the one who gets emotional when she has to leave, you know, and I’m kinda just like, when she’s leaving, I’m like: “You know I’mma miss you, right?” And then she’s like: “Yeah.” And I’m like: “You gon’ miss Daddy?” – “Yeah.” “Oh my … You know you can call me and stuff, when you miss me? And I’m just sad you’re leaving.” She’s like: “It’s okay. We always come back.” And I was just like: “That’s what I’m saying, all that, that’s why I’m crying, I’m so emotional!” But it was just like beautiful to just see, you know like, me be the parent now. You know what I’m saying? And to see that confidence of my child, and the same confidence I gave my mom and you gotta just kinda take it backseat and go: “Okay.” Cause I literally like follow my daughter’s lead. I mean, I just, whatever she is telling me to do, I just follow whatever she – well I mean, obviously not in every way. Or else like, I would be broke, but … in some ways I do what she asks me to do or what she tells me to do.

But, that’s the beauty of life y’all. You know what I’m saying? I used to come in this room, I used to sit right in that section. Sometimes I’d pay attention – sometimes I wouldn’t. Most of the time I’d be checking out chicks. Some chick I probably never talk to cause I never had the confidence, maybe if a – what’s the day that we would send carnations, Kendra? Valentine’s Day. That wasn’t a joke. I was the king of like, sending, like, carnations to chicks that I never talk to. I would be asking my mom for like: “Mom, can you give me five bucks, you know it’s (?) today, I wanna (?).” And, she would just be like: “Okay”, you know? Not knowing that I was buying carnations for all these chicks, you know, but, thanks for supplying that, Mom.

But, with 23 seconds left. I just what y’all know that life will throw you through shit ton of curve balls, it’s scary, but like, if you believe man. You know? I you believe. And if you want it. And if you wanna work hard enough for it. You can be so. Cause it’s no difference from me and you. I just really wanted this shit. I wanted it bad. You know? And I didn’t want to be a failure. And nobody’s a failure in this room. Don’t ever think that. We can all win. And that’s it.

Thanks.

[Intro: Theophilus London & Lana Del Rey]
(Uh, feeling's gone, feeling's gone)
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Uh, this love is dead)

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
You always buy me roses when I’m mad
Do you think I’ll forgive you just like that?
Did you forget who you were seeing, yeah?
I’m not letting you off easy, I’m still sad

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I’m kissing you hard, you got my lipstick on your face
I stole your girlfriend’s keys, kicked her out of your place
Cause I want you more than I did before, -fore
I’m missing you hard, give you my softcore babyface
And then we start to fight, tumble down the staircase
And when we hit that floor, you want me even more, more

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
You always buy me roses like a creep
Asking for forgiveness, unsexy
What happened to the man you used to be?
If you still want my love then work for me

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Theophilus London]
You’re kissing me hard, you got my lipstick on your face
You show me what you got and put a girl in her place
If you want me more than you did before
(Uh, feeling's gone, feeling's gone)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright

[Verse 3: Theophilus London]
We had conversations, ain’t nothing said
This girl is crazy, I've done lost my head
"Her life is awesome", the doctor said
But my shit feel awful, this love is dead

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright

[Outro: Theophilus London]
See I could see the pain
In her eyes, in her eyes
This love is dead
This love is dead

[Verse 1]
(Baby, you...)
You know you got such nice, nice clothes
(Baby, you...)
I’d like to see 'em fit you when you’re old
(Baby, you...)
You keep wastin' all my time, actin' cold
(Baby, you...)
You oughta get yourself a shiny gold medal for bein' the coldest bitch I know

[Chorus]
You can live how you want
You can live how you want
If ya don’t mind livin' alone
You can live how you want
You can live how you want
If ya don’t mind livin' alone

[Verse 2]
(Baby, you...)
You know your pretty face is just a face
(Baby, you...)
All there is in you is the absence of space
(Baby, you...)
You only take off your clothes for the gossip it gives
(Baby, you...)
The only good reason for your clothes to come off is so somebody can use a whip

[Chorus]
You can live how you want
You can live how you want
If ya don't mind livin' alone
You can live how you want
You can live how you want
If ya don't mind...

Oooh ooh ahh ooh ahhh
Oooh ooh ahh ooh, yeah

[Bridge]
You can live how you want
You can live how you want
If ya don't mind livin' alone
You can live how you want
You do whatever you want
If ya don't mind livin' alone

[Chorus]
You can live how you want
You can live how you want
If ya don't mind livin' alone

You can live how you want
You can live how you want
If ya don't mind livin' alone
You can live how you want
You can live how you want
If ya don't mind...

[Verse 1]
When I woke up this mornin' in a cold sweat
Death was telling me to follow his cue
Well, I woke up this mornin' with a regret
Of not spendin' the night with you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I looked around my bed
And saw the books and the records and the booze
And I shook the thoughts of you from my head
And in the shower started singin' a tune

[Chorus]
No, I don’t feel too sad, but I could
No I don’t feel too bad now darlin', but I sure could
But I don’t, and you better bet that I won't

[Verse 2]
When a girl came walkin' on by, I smiled and I nodded hello
And she screamed and she swung and nearly tore out my eyes
And started dancin' when I fell to the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
And I woke up in my bed
And saw the books and the records and the booze
And I shook the thoughts of love from my head
And in the shower started singin' a tune

[Chorus]
No, I don’t feel too sad, you know, but I could
No I don’t feel too bad now darlin', but I sure could
But I don’t, and you better bet that I won't

Ahh yeah!

[Verse 1]
Oh, save me
From such a sad, sad song
Oh, I’m leanin' on a lamppost
Oh, I’m meltin' in the sun
My toes are drippin' through the sewer
I can feel my heart beatin'
As the tears roll down my tongue
And as the nights are gettin' cooler
Never thought that you’d be leavin'
Should’ve known that I’d be wrong

[Chorus]
Oh, goodbye, baby
And the music starts to fade
Oh, goodbye, baby
I really wish you could've stayed

[Verse 2]
Holdin' roses in my hand
Moonlight reflectin' off my tooth
A man will do all that he can
Just to be gettin' over you
And when the sadness lingers
With its hand on my shoulder
Well, you know it’s been there before
And as the wind blows through my fingers
It feels like I’m gettin' older
Every time I turn a door

[Chorus]
Goodbye, baby
And the curtain starts to sway
Oh, goodbye, baby
I really wish you could've stayed

[Outro]
I thought you were my sugar
My honey pie
Oh, you make me wanna cry

[Intro]
Have you ever?
Have you ever?
Wooo!

[Verse 1]
(Have you ever) swallowed paper and lost track of the time?
(Have you ever) shoved the cork in the wine?
(Have you ever) played the same record 57 times?
(Have you ever) lost track of your mind?

[Chorus]
I've been lonely too
I've been lonely too
I've been lonely too
I’ve been lonely too, too long to be afraid of the tomb, alright

[Verse 2]
(Have you ever) been so lucky that you started to laugh?
(Have you ever) said hello to the glass?
(Have you ever) been told to follow your dreams?
(Have you ever) seen the wave of shit that it brings?

[Chorus]
I've been lonely too
I've been lonely too
I’ve been lonely too, too long to be afraid of the tomb

[Verse 3]
(Have you ever) ordered food to hear a knock on the door?
(Have you ever) fell in love with a whore?
(Have you ever) heard the sound of a belt hit the floor?
(Have you ever) felt your nights were a chore?

[Chorus]
I've been lonely too
I've been lonely too
I’ve been lonely too, too long to be afraid of the tomb

[Outro]
I've been lonely too
I've been lonely too
I've been lonely too
I've been lonely too
I've been lonely too
I've been lonely too

So let me tell you something
You look even more beautiful in the inside than the outside
So, so why worry, why stress?

[Verse 2]
Just be you
You can’t deny it, that I’ve been trying
Tryna make you feel like a princess, princess Jasmine
And all those times you walked away
I tried to tell you but I couldn’t
You just didn’t hear me
‘Cause I’m okay if you’re okay
And I will never run away

Everything you do, everything I like
On the radio, dancin' in the night
Flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
You can be my guy, and I'm your baby, right?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
My, my, apple of my eye
Looking really hot while I make ya cherry pie
Show me what you got, got a sparkle in your eye
You're so high

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun

I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Every way I move, every way you like
Pulling on my dress, holdin' me too tight
I know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
But I love the way we kiss, love the way we fight

My, my, lookin' really fly
Like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
You spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky
I'm so high

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun

Thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
Hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind
Baby don't be scared, come on honey, smile
Everything is fine now, everything is fine

[Pre-Chorus 3]
My, my, talkin' all night
Laughin' really hard and it makes me wanna cry
I love our playing house, love our dressin'-up nights
Drinks on ice

[Chorus - Variation]
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you, I want you
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
I caught you, I caught you

[Outro]
I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you
I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you

[Verse 1]
Daddy was dumb, said that I’d be something special
Brought me up tough but I was a gentle human
Said that he loved each of my two million freckles
When I grew up was gonna be a superstar

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I sit in the car and I listen to static
She said I look fat but I look fantastic

[Chorus]
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe

[Verse 2]
I'm waking up, lost in boxes outside Tesco
Look like a bum sipping codeine Coca-Cola
Thought that I was northern Camden's own Flash Gordon
Sonic ray gun, gonna be a superstar

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I make my own fun in grandmama's basement
Said I look mad, she said I look wasted

[Chorus]
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe

[Verse 1]
Duck down the alley after midnight
Countin' your money with your headlights out
Look past the screen door, you can see her keepin'
Keepin' the party together

[Pre-Chorus]
She says, “I’m your painkiller on the corner
I’ll be the one that’s gonna turn you around
And besides, twenty-something amounts to nothing
When you’re dead in the ground.”

[Chorus]
She’s here to set you free
She’s got that somethin' that could put you at ease
And you could end up like a dog in the street
But she’ll still be here stayin' with it

[Verse 2]
Get your head up, get it out of your hands
Feelin' better was just a part of your plan
Just pay up a couple when you come back again, boy
So she can keep it together

[Outro]
Keep it together, baby
Keep it together
Keep it together, we'll be dancin' all night, yeah
Keep it together, baby
Keep it together
Keep it together, we'll be dancin' all night

[Verse 1]
Do you feel like you’re on the run?
Are you scared because the road is long?
Well you’re my kin, my son, you’re not the only one

I know you feel life is crushin' you
Well get to scratchin' where it itches, keep your goals in view
Reserve your judgments too, that shit will bury you

[Verse 2]
I know you feel like a lesser man
I bet the winds hittin' different on an empty hand
But what’s a grain of sand to this entire land?

And you can walk, walk, walk until your feet get sore
I see you hidin' all your problems in the liquor store
This life’s a major award, what you gon' trade that for?

[Verse 1]
Low Lisa, always lies
Drab diva with a tongue-tied mind
So sweet when her eyes are alive
I oughta tell her how much she means

Low Lisa, men’s 2X shirt
Red sleeves and hands thick with dirt
She’ll be laughin' in a leather skirt
I oughta tell her how much she means

[Chorus]
All she wanted to be
All she wanted to see
All they want her to be
All they want to do

[Verse 2]
Low Lisa in a lonely spot
Racin' time with a mind distraught
Lord knows that she’s got to stop
I wanna tell her how much she means

[Chorus]
All she wanted to be
All she wanted to see
All they want her to be
All they want to do
(x2)

[Outro]
I wanna tell her that a winner ain’t no joke
That somethin' she’s been thinking that instead she’s gotta know
But she keeps speakin', her luck starts sinkin' low, nowhere to go
I wanna tell her
I wanna tell her
I wanna tell her
I wanna tell her
I wanna tell her
I wanna tell her
I wanna tell her

[Intro: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
Oh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If somebody see me doing bad, then I'm doing something wrong
I ain't tripping, I got money in the bank (Bank)
Shawty wanna come back to my pad so she hopped up in the chrome
Yeah, shawty coming with me, what it do?
Throw that money in the air, let it pause, pause
And homie, you ain't even gotta ask, you know I ball
Every time I hit the mall, I want it all
Somebody gon' give me a whole 200 and tell the DJ bring it back

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Every time you see me, I be in a Lamborghini
Countin' money, fettuccine, I be on one
She wore a itsy, bitsy, teeny, weeny, yellow polka dot bikini
Baby, come and get it if you want some
I throw that 50 and now she sittin' with me
And if she show a little more skin, I throw more 50s
And-and I see she got that bad, off that Henny and that 'tron
You talkin' 'bout that money, boy, I bought my money long

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
I said I, I said I
I said I, I said I
Oh-oh-oh, oh, turn it up, turn it up
Oh-oh-oh, oh, turn it up, turn it up
Oh-oh-oh, oh, turn it up, turn it up
Oh-oh-oh, oh, turn it up (Boom, boom)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If somebody see me doing bad, then I'm doing something wrong
I ain't tripping, I got money in the bank (Bank)
Shawty wanna come back to my pad so she hopped up in the chrome
Yeah, shawty coming with me, what it do?
Throw that money in the air, let it pause, pause
And homie, you ain't even gotta ask, you know I ball
Every time I hit the mall, I want it all
Somebody gon' give me a whole 200 and tell the DJ bring it back

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
When I hit the club, all the ladies get excited (Excited)
Stuntin' one leg on these hoes like a fuckin' pirate (Pirate)
I cause a fuckin' riot (Riot), you know that I'm the fliest
And I'm jumpin' out the plane with no parachute, hi vest
And when you see me, greet your highness
Let me introduce you to VA's finest (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
Check the chain and the wrist watch
So much ice on it, I can't hear it tick tock (Bop! Bop!)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
I said I, I said I
I said I, I said I
Oh-oh-oh, oh, turn it up, turn it up
Oh-oh-oh, oh, turn it up, turn it up
Oh-oh-oh, oh, turn it up, turn it up
Oh-oh-oh, oh, turn it up (Boom, boom)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If somebody see me doing bad, then I'm doing something wrong
I ain't tripping, I got money in the bank (Bank)
Shawty wanna come back to my pad so she hopped up in the chrome
Yeah, shawty coming with me, what it do?
Throw that money in the air, let it pause, pause
And homie, you ain't even gotta ask, you know I ball
Every time I hit the mall, I want it all
Somebody gon' give me a whole 200 and tell the DJ bring it back

[Intro]
Hey, you've reached Jessica
I'm not in right now but if you leave a message, I'll call you right back
Baby, I called you three times
I left text messages, emails
Yo, what I gotta do to get to you?
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I mean, it's like, what's so important you can't pick up the phone?
I mean, come on
I can't deal with this, call me back

[Verse 1]
Lately, more and more I been feeling some kind of way
And I ain't crazy, I know you got those texts from me (Got 'em from me, oh)
But it's this thing that we've been going through, is something wrong with you? (With you)
All it's doing is making me remember how we called it quits
Girl, I'm too young for this, when you

[Chorus]
When you turned away from me (Oh, woah)
Makes me think that I should just leave (Oh)
Go back to being the ol' G
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back
No, I don't want you mad at me
Snatching the covers, acting like you're asleep
When you know you're up, no
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back (Woah)

[Verse 2]
All night long, I find myself tryna get away and that ain't right, no
Looking through my phone tryna remember her name
That would only make it worse
We tried to talk through our problems, but it takes more than words
Said it don't even bother me but I swear it hurts
When I said I didn't wanna go through the same shit, this is what I meant, oh, woah

[Chorus]
When you turned away from me (Turned away from me, babe)
Makes me think that I should just leave (Maybe I should fall down)
Go back to being the ol' G (Oh)
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back (I don't wanna lay here, oh, back to back, baby)
No, I don't want you mad at me (We just fighting for the covers)
Snatching the covers, acting like you're asleep (Acting like we ain't really lovers)
When you know you're up, no (Oh, oh)
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back (No more, oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
I thought about it, got my bags, now I'm 'bout to roll
You standing there screaming, "Please don't go"
Too late, no excuses, I swear I can't do this
Don't wanna go through this no more
Now I know what it means to really have it bad
Got me laying in this bed and looking at your bags (Your bags, yeah)
Oh girl (Oh girl), wish you could make me believe
That you gon' change for me (Oh)

[Chorus]
When you turned away from me (Oh)
Makes me think that I should just leave (Just leave, oh)
Go back to being the ol' G (Makes me wanna go back to being the way that it used to be)
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back (Don't wanna lay here back to back, girl)
No, I don't want you mad at me
Snatching the covers (Oh), acting like you're asleep (Acting like you're asleep with me, yeah)
When you know you're up, no
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back

[Outro]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
Running back and forth in my head tryna figure out
How could I let a girl go so perfect
Fellas, you know what I'm talking 'bout
And I've been thinking about it what you said
Screaming, "How you want me out?"
And then I turn around and look at your pics and all I think about

[Pre-Chorus]
Is the way we used to kiss
Is the way you held my hand
Is the way we used to dance
How we showed romance, give me one more chance

[Chorus]
Was it all my fault?
Sorry for the pain I caused
With no love involved
Do I cross your mind at all?
With all the love I gave
That made me feel this way
At any time of the day
Do I cross your mind at all?

[Verse 2]
It's a shame that we can't at least talk about our problems
My heart's broken and my body is starving
For your love and I need you in my life, girl
For your touch and all I think about is...

[Pre-Chorus]
Is the way we used to kiss (I miss kissing, baby)
Is the way you held my hand
Is the way we used to dance
How we showed romance, give me one more chance

[Chorus]
Was it all my fault? (My fault)
Sorry for the pain I caused (I caused)
With no love involved
Do I cross your mind at all?
With all the love I gave (I gave)
That made me feel this way (This way)
At any time of the day
Do I cross your mind at all?

[Bridge]
Wait, girl, you hear your conscience calling, all in
Wait, girl, come back to me, I need you here, baby
Stay, girl, baby, I want you to stay around
For me, girl, I'm sorry, baby

[Chorus]
Was it all my fault? (Hey)
Sorry for the pain I caused (I caused)
With no love involved
Do I cross your mind at all?
With all the love I gave (I gave)
That made me feel this way (This way)
At any time of the day
Do I cross your mind at all?

[Outro]
At all, at all, at all
Do I cross your mind at all?
Yeah, girl
Do I cross your mind at all?

[Verse 1]
I'm staring at the clock, it's a quarter to three
I'm tossing in my bed 'cause I just can't sleep
'Cause you're not here with me
I'm reaching out for you, I wish I could talk to you
Tryna figure out what's going on with me
I'm used to having all the answers for everything
Oh, girl, I think she is the one
But where is that coming from?

[Chorus]
It's so crazy
Baby, you simply amaze me
So much more than lately
I owe it all to you (Owe it all to you)
All those games, we
Used to play now seems so lame to me
What I'm coming down with is new to me
All I know is that you are the cure
'Cause I've been diagnosed with love

[Verse 2]
Does anybody know the answer to this question?
'Cause I'm confused, so now I'm opened for suggestions (Yeah)
My heart is talking loud (So loud), what is this about? (About)
I'm really changing now, oh
Cleared all the numbers out my phone, done left that whole life alone
Those are two of the symptoms I see, uh
And I believe, oh girl, I am sure
That you are my miracle

[Chorus]
It's so crazy
Baby, you simply amaze me (You amaze me, oh)
So much more than lately (Yes, I am more)
I owe it all to you (Owe it all to you)
All those games, we
Used to play now seems so lame to me (I don't wanna play no games no more)
What I'm coming down with is new to me (So new to me, can somebody tell me)
All I know is that you are the cure (Oh, oh)
'Cause I've been diagnosed with love

[Bridge]
Let me hear you say, oh yeah

Girl, I know lately, we haven't talked much
'Cause I've been away so we've been out of touch
But that doesn't mean I don't love you
That doesn't mean that I'm not always thinking of you, ooh

They saying that you've been acting real different
Now everybody's looking at me like I'm crazy
Telling me you've got something that you wanna say to me, ooh

That you got plans of walking out my door?
Don't do this to me (No)

Birds of prey and I'm shaking off my feather
I believe like R. Kelly, we can fly
But toucan fly together
Staying rich like an ostrich

Staying rich like an ostrich

[Chorus]
You make it harder for me (Yeah) to wanna get up and leave
When you done put that thing on me, girl, you know just what I need

But girl, what about your man?
I know that I should leave her alone
I'm in a fatal attraction, fatal attraction

[Verse 2]
Ooh baby, I swear, I want you to myself

She cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
Now I ain't mad about the fact
That she out there getting' busy
But it ain't enough for the fallout
Ride it all night for the get back
Get it how you should

One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
Straight shot to the crib, straight shot to the crib (Hahaha)
Take shots, take shots, take shots, we don't waste shots
Take shots, take shots, take shots, to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib

[Verse 2]
Okay, let me bust on the bullet, automatic, call it pump
Straight shots, caught made shots in the Maybach
Throwin' up the OHB 'cause we out here ballin'
And we still getting paid, buck
I elevate and get rich, VVS flow
Cuttin' through the diamonds like a fuckin' laser
Pow, pow, look at the crowd
Said I wasn't shit, nigga, look at me now
Gon' put it on wax, try to figure me out
Random selectin' the lineup, she pickin' me out
It's 'cause I'm a black guy and she a white girl
No, I did not have my dick in her mouth
I'm busy bein' the life of the motherfuckin' party
Private jets, private sex, private departures
The money ain't a thing, I don't care 'bout an offer
But I'm 'bout put the pussy right up in the coffin, let's go

[Chorus]
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
Straight shot to the crib, straight shot to the crib (Hahaha)
Take shots, take shots, take shots, we don't waste shots
Take shots, take shots, take shots, to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib

[Verse 1]
(Why) Maybe I'm crazy or maybe I'm tryna find love
But usually I'm not that guy chasing you, lady
But I'm tryna get you out of this club
'Cause when we in the car, panties go down
And when I get you to the crib, I'm gonna put it down
You know you got me standing up so I gotta lay it down
We gon' wake up the neighbors, I'ma try to make you disabled

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma go hard in it, lose your shit, wrap your legs around a nigga
Dancin' all on my pole, yeah, it's Breezy bitch, I'm a cold nigga
Get that shit, work that shit, pop it like a four-wheeler
Give that bitch that dope dick, I guess that mean I'm a dope dealer

[Chorus]
She started actin' up, I gave her more drink
Got pink in my paper cup, we pourin' up more drink
Your bitch lookin' at me, I-I-I know what that ho think
'Bout to make her get low for them bands
And just pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it
'Bout to make her get low for them bands
Pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it (Just pop it, yeah)
'Bout to make her get low—

[Verse 2]
Throw them 50s and them 100s, wanna pop it, let it go
Girl, I like what I see, babe, I get what I want
Be good to me, be good to me, you super wet like a water flow
Girl, your friends ain't gotta know, but you with it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma go hard in it, lose your shit, wrap your legs around a nigga
Dancin' all on my pole, yeah, it's Breezy bitch, I'm a cold nigga
Get that shit, work that shit, pop it like a four-wheeler
Give that bitch that dope dick, I guess that mean I'm a dope dealer

[Chorus]

Got pink in my paper cup, we pourin' up more drink
Your bitch lookin' at me, I-I-I know what that ho think

[Verse 1]
2 A.M. again and I'm thinkin' 'bout
2 A.M. again and I'm thinkin', should I come through?
Can I come kick
Can I come kick with you?
2 A.M. again and I'm thinkin' 'bout
It's 2 A.M. and I'm stuck up thinkin' about the
Last time you were behind me
All in the mirror
I could see everything you would be doin'
I could see everything, lookin' at me like you love me
I know you don't love me
I never care long as I come first, you come on time
I reverse, you rewind, do it again
Stuck in time, do it again

[Chorus]
All you ever say is, "Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, yeah
You don't ever come, why you never come?
Will you ever come?
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
Why you never come to me, no?
Why you never come to me?
Why you never come to me, no?"

[Verse 2]
This my time, it's your turn
I know you're right
I know it burns to be in love
I know it burns to be another
One of your girls on the side like that
I know your kind, how you lie like that
I know you're mine when you bite it like that
I know you're mine when you put it like that
Guess you was right when you put it like that
I know now
I get the point, I hear you loud and clear
All this time I've been playin' your side
I could have done better shit with my life
To waste no time on you
Got to move on cause you got me fucked up
I am confused from this point on trust nobody, yeah
Out of my body, blowin' my fuse out
Devil, please cut me loose, yeah, please cut me loose, oh

[Chorus]
"Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, yeah
You don't ever come, why you never come?
Will you ever come?
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
Why you never come to me, no?
Why you never come to me?
Why you never come to me, no?"

[Outro]
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait
For you, you, you, you
You, you
Never, never too late, late, late, late
Late, late, late
Fall through, through, through, through
It's 2 A.M., it's 2 A.M. and I'm on you, you, you, you
Thinkin' 'bout you
You again, you again
Never knew a nigga that I want bad as I want you, baby
It's 2 A.M. and I confess I want you
Bad as I want you, bad as I want you
It's 2 A.M., it's 2 A.M. again

[Bonus Snippet]
I might be thirsty for you
How can you be blame me?
Oh I might be thirsty for you
How can you be blame me?
Oh I might play circus for you
How do you want me?
I conjure up that coochie for you
Voodoo, Houdini
And I might be that hoochie for you
Do you need me?

[Verse]
Our hearts are free
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
I'm a flower, you're the bee
It's much older than you and me
I'm in love, I'm alive
I belong to the stars and sky
Let's forget who we are for one night
We're not animals, baby
It's the people who lie (to themselves)

[Chorus]
I want real love, baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love, baby
There's a world inside me
Got the key, just use it
Just if for a minute (and gone)

[Verse Reprise]
Our hearts are free
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
I'm a flower, you're the bee
It's much older than you and me
I'm in love, I'm alive
I belong to the stars and sky
Let's forget who we are for one night
We're not animals, baby
It's the people who lie (to themselves)

[Chorus]
I want real love, baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love, baby
There's a world inside me
Got the key, just use it
Just if for a minute (and gone)
I want real love, baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love, baby
There's a world inside me
Got the key, just use it
Just if for a minute (and gone)

[Collision: Verse + Chorus]
Our hearts are free
(I want real love, baby)
(Ooh, don't leave me waiting)
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
(I've got real love maybe)
(Wait until you taste me)
I'm a flower, you're the bee
(I want real love, baby)
(There's a world inside me)
It's much older than you and me
(Got the key, just use it)

[Verse 1]
Skylark, have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

[Verse 2]
Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a-journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

[Bridge]
And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

[Verse 3]
Oh Skylark, I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

[Verse 1]
Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you if you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

[Verse 2]
You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on it's way

[Verse 3]
Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart?
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

[Verse 4]
And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

[Verse 5]
And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

[Interlude: Yolandi & Ninja & (The Black Goat)]
Our band is called Die Antwoord and that means "The Answer"
The peoples from America, they say a little bit funny because they can't say it right
How do they say it? They say...
They say like "Die Antword", it sounds a bit fucking stupid actually
Die Antwoord, Die Antwoord
Die Antwoord
Ant-, Die Ant-, Ant-, like "cunt"
Then "woord": Die Antwoord
Yo
Say it properly
(Stupid mothafucka)

DJ mothafukin MUGGS
The black goat
Ninja, when are we gonna drop the fucking "We Have Candy" album?

[Ninja]
Whenever we feel like dropping it, okay, gosh
Oh Randy, leave it up to me
I'll pour the water if you bring the tree
Nothing looks that real to me
I only see two or three colors

What's it like to breathe in?
Find a friend and gather with him?
I'm a wolf in a city of women
You only know the light is on

Will you plant that sycamore baby?
I'll watch it grow from the second floor
I haven't left the house much lately
And you don't come around here anymore

And all those lovers in their velvet gowns
I wanna take that trip uptown
Will you tell them to let me out
When you can see the light is on?

Found a horse hair in my food
There's a raccoon in my room
There are bluejays all in bloom
All along the cement floor
Randy, they say I've gone insane
So could you take me dancing in the pouring rain?
You don't know me but you know my name
Will you say it 'til the light is gone?

[Intro: Yolandi]
Suck on this

[Chorus: Yolandi]
Jan Pierewiet

COMING SOON BIATCH

[Outro: Ninja]
ZEF means you hungry as fuk
On some fukkin' illegally modified, turbo fukkin' charged
No brains on, full fukkin' flex
Locked in the zone with your flow on fleek
Pumping off your fukkin' face
Cheater from the feedck
Sneaks on fleek, cash in your pocket
Or if you've got no cash in your pocket
Maybe you got a gat in your pocket
Or a plan in your brains to do what you gotta do
In order to get where you need to be
I just wanna know how you feel
Gotta keep it real
Baby tell me how you feel
Tell me how you feel
(I just wanna know)
Baby tell me how you feel
Gotta keep it real
Tell me where you at?
Baby where you at?
(Where you go?)
Baby tell me how you feel
Versace bathing suit in Rio
Baby tell me how you feel
Every time we fuck you get to talking Creole
You love how it feel
(That's for real)
I love how it feel
(That's for real)
I could buy you anything that you want
Just tell me where it's at
Niggas talkin' I got gats
Bitches talkin' you be strapped
(Oh no)
One thing we don't fuck with, we don't fuck with the rats
(Snitchin' niggas)
Snitching get you hit back
(You know)
We ain't worried 'bout that
(You know)
We be stacking up cash
(For sho')
I know you got my back
So tell me how you feel
Baby how you feel?
Tell me how you feel
How you feel?
(Oh, oh, oh)
How you feel?
But they, they ain't real
Baby tell me where you at
(Where you go)
Where you at
(Where you go)
I could buy you anything that you want
Just show me where it's at
Gold teeth like Project Pat
Put you on the map
And you know them other nigga's
Them nigga's jokes
Them other nigga's broke
They ain't riding like me
Make you my wifey
Yeah, baby tell me how you feel
Trips out to Rio
(You know)
But you gotta stay real
(You know)
Where you at?
I know you, I know you
I know you got my back
That's just the facts
Ain't wanna bother with them lame hoes
They so broke
Red bottoms on your toes
Oh-oh-oh, oh no, no, no
No, no, no

[Verse 1]
Mother, I haven't been well
Search through my life and I think it's time for me
It's time, it's time to embrace this part of me
Lost can take a little while on a long journey

[Chorus]
So come on, come on, laughin', I will be there with my brothers and then
Love is the answer to most of my questions - you can't comprehend
And if I get back to the real world, I'll be back in time for you

[Verse 2]
Sister, tell me what's new
I've been going native for months since I've been missing you
Missing you grow, missing the world you hold so closely
To keep from being alone, a world we call our home

[Chorus]
So come on, come on together sit down right here with my sister and friends
History cherishes lifetimes upon us - sing if you wish
And if I get back to the real world, I'll be back in time for you
Come on, come on, laughin', I will be there with my sister and friends
Love is the answer to most of my questions, you can't comprehend
And if I get back to the real world, I'll be back in time for you

We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have travelled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever
Exulted in the scene
As long as I am with you
My heart continues to beat

[Pre-Chorus]
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
We're different and the same, gave you another name

If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
I know with all of your heart, you can't shake me
Cause when I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

[Verse 2]
Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain

Bring the cups, baby, I could bring my drank
Bring your body, baby, I could bring my fame
I got my heart right here

And I ain't tryna leave here alone by myself, hey
It feels so good to meet her, put her number and her picture in my phone
And got rid of everybody else, oh, listen to me, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know you the one, you the one
The stars, the moon, the sun, that's who you are
Put one hand in the air and put the other one in your hair (Oh, ooh)
And baby, show me how you get down low to the floor on this song
It's only one mission I'm on

[Chorus]
I won't leave this club alone
If you don't wanna leave right now with me, just let me know 'Cause everybody sweating you, sitting right next to you
And I ain't said nothing (And I ain't said nothing)
We can stay as long as you want to
But there's only one thing to do
Oh, baby, just drop (Baby), drop (Baby)
Drop it to the floor (Baby), floor (Baby), floor

[Verse 2]
Every time that I see her
She with her girls all comfortable, fine as hell
I tried to play it cool but I keep on thinking 'bout
What if we, what if we danced, no one else is leaving with her tonight
Let's get out this club 'cause I wanna do your body right
Make love on the floor, oh, your body

Come on, baby, and there's a whole lot of women in this party but I only want you

And i got some new Versace, and that's for you
I'm the king you my queen, and you know that
When we in the club, makin' rain on 'em
And i like the way she workin' on me just like yeah yeah
Work work work work workin' on me
Babygirl you know you fine,yeah you got it
Trending Topic ,in love with the body
She want party, she wanna go party
Gave us Ciroc ,gave us a new Henny
Pop a bottle aye, girl go over your limit
Pop a bottle babe, you know that we winnin'
Ain't no playin' bae, take you oversea
On a yacht, we can catch the breeze
Drop the top on a foreign 2017
You so fine, you so fine, baby i miss ya ...

[Hook]
Heavy goin stack up all that Gualla (Yaaah)
I been gettin' money lot of dollars (Yaaah)
Bad bitch with me look like a model (Yaaah)
She on instagram posing like a model
I'm in love with her body
She a bad bitch up in the party
She might be the baddest bitch standin' in the party
She might be the baddest in the party

[Verse 1]
Years, days, makes no difference to me, babe
You look exactly the same to me
Ain’t no time, crossing your legs inside the diner
Raising your coffee to your lips, the steam

[Chorus]
You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

[Verse 2]
You whisper to a restless ear, “can you get me out of here?
This place smells like piss and beer, can you get me out?”
You were asking me how to get you free
I only know the recipe to roam

[Chorus]
You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

[Verse 3]
Old stars filling up my throat
You gave em to me when I was born, now they’re coming out
Laying there on the hospital bed, eyes were narrow, blue and red
You took a draw of breath and said to me

[Chorus]
You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like me
Wrapping my left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

[Verse 4]
Old friends, old mothers, dogs and brothers
There’s only so much letting go you can ask someone to do
So I keep you by my side, I will not give you to the tide
I'll even walk you in my stride, Marie

[Chorus]
'Cause I saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping your left arm around my right
Ready to walk me through the night
Baby waited for me on Halloween
She said her mask would scare me, I don't think it will
I know everyone can tell I'm an empty shell
But baby likes me better when I hurt myself

Baby called me in the morning
She said she talks in her sleep, I don't think she does
Baby wraps me up in her blankie
She said if I don't wake up I'll live forever in this dream
I feel sorry 'cause I don't know why I exist
And I'm so sick
'Cause I don't know why I exist
And I write songs
But I don't know why I exist
And I read books
But I don't know why I exist

And I've got friends
But I don't know why I exist
And I love my parents
But they don't know why they exist
And I get A's
But I don't know why I exist
And I play sports
But I don't know why I exist

And I've got friends
And they don't know why they exist
And I love sports
But I don't know why I exist
And I go to school
But I don't know why I exist
And I got teachers and
They don't know why they exist
And I'm so fucked 'cause
I don't know why I exist
And you're so fucked 'cause
You don't know why you exist

And....

[Intro: Baka]
Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I pull up on you in that purple thing
Bumpin' Purple Rain
Singin' "Purple Rain," sippin' purple rain
Pourin' champagne off commercial fame
You ain't worth a thing, you ain't gang gang
You ain't flame gang, you ain't same gang
It's my world, it's Wayne's world
It's a different world, it's D'wayne Wayne, oh Lord
Okay now we got some action
Fucking models out of Maxim
I'm too wavy, I'm what's happening
Okay now we got some rapids
Orange bottle full of tablets
Okay now we got some habits
Smokin' cookies, sippin' Acti
Okay now we got some balance
You see my team is right next to me
You don't see Tina right next to me
I thank her for takin' my breath from me
But the second me gon' be the better me
J.R. Smith with the shot
Cause I pull up, I stop and pop
I call my AK Barney and I'ma let this baby pop
Pull up on you like Steph Curry
With my foot up on you like eff worries
Been outchea since Keith Murray
Codeine got me with pink urine
So you know I don't have the energy
I fucked a bitch named Epiphany
My exes wanna be friends with my other exes
And I don't have the sympathy

[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

(Ninja kill these motherfuckers)

With amazing ease
This is not a game, boy
Don't play with me
I work my mic-saber like a wild fucking savage from the dark side danger!
Yin to the yang
Ninja's motherfucking big in Japan
I seen the future but I never got nothing in my hand
Just a mic, big dreams, and a plan
Fly-talking, sky-walking

[Bridge: Ninja & (Yolandi)]
Fuck, this is like, the coolest fucking remix I ever heard in my whole life
Fuck all of you who said I wouldn't make it
Who said I was a loser
Who said I was a no one
Who said I was a fucking psycho
But look at me now, all up in the Soul Assassin studios
Los Scandalous California!
Enter the Ninja, Yolandi Visser, the homeboy God, DJ motherfucking Muggs
Decapitator remix, suck on this bitch!

[Yolandi]
Suck on this
Bokkie is my maatjie
Bokkie gryp my gatjie
Naai my, naai my
Spuit my met jou saadjie

[Verse 1]
Finest girl I ever met in my whole life
Want to take her home, make her my wife
Knew she was a freak when she started talking
She said, "Fuck me like we fucked Bin Laden" (Ooh woah)
That girl was a freak
She said she wanted me to fuck her harder than the military

[Chorus]
Fucked Bin Laden
Fucked Bin Laden
Fucked Bin Laden
She wanted to fuck me harder than the US government
Fucked Bin Laden

[Verse 2]
Uh, she was a freaky kind of girl
Kept up with current events from all around the world
More specifically, one event
The time Osama Bin Laden got shot in the head
She said, "Do me like that"
But I couldn't track the metaphor
That said, I can see you horny like a stegosaur
That said, again, your request is so irregular
She put on a beard, I started looking out the exit door
Then a turban, then a tunic
She said, "Invade my cave with your special unit"
I said, "He wasn't in a cave," but there was no stopping
She demanded that I fuck her like we

[Chorus]
Fucked Bin Laden
Fucked Bin Laden
Fucked Bin Laden
She wanted to fuck me harder than the US government
Fucked Bin Laden

[Verse 3]
This girl requested intercourse to bring her to climax
With the clinical efficiency of the assassination of Bin Laden
You're harboring a fugitive (That ass!)
And my justice will be punitive (I'ma smash!)
Night-vision, they can see us through my GoPro
She tried to negotiate, I said that's a no-no
Now I'm creeping in her bedroom, like go-go
She tells me to go low then looks down and says I gotta...
"Terrorize that pussy, gotta terrorize that pussy"
So I did it, improvised some crazy shit
Seal Team 69 sexecuting the hit
She said, "You've finished me off, now throw my body in the ocean"
I yelled, "Geronimo," then took some pictures for posting
The President called, he said, "Congratulations Conner"
I said, "Mr. President, to what do I owe this honor?"
He said, "Come give me the deets in the White House Garden
I gots to know how you fucked her like we..."

[Chorus]
Fucked Bin Laden
Fucked Bin Laden
Fucked Bin Laden
I still can't say that I see the appeal
But she wanted me to fuck her like we fucked Bin Laden
Oh, this girl insisted that
The way we did it was merciless and exact
Just like the now world-famous attack
That fucked Osama Bin Laden

[Outro]
Damn, the whole thing was just a virtual reality experience!

[Verse]
Yeah
Hold up, hey now, the beast in me
Is no longer sleeping, it wants to eat emcees
So I let him free, let him feed peacefully
Until he cease, now the beast must drop feces
But I never let it free fall, I catch it and spit it
I kick shit that blows whole districts into tidbits
With pen in fist I take tallies, of these scrimmages
Can't call a game, my flavor wicked as witches is
The kid spits fuego sicker than syphilis
So sisters and brothers grab a shovel and start digging this
Matter fact, grab a Nikon and picture this
An icon with no assistance and no assist in this
Reminiscing to number one plus twenty-three
My days are sunny, prestige sweeter than honey bees
Waters are muddy, I'm coming, running from nothing B
Now I'm fucking muffin, motherfuckers ain't touching me
Shit

[Intro]
They gonna unbutton their shirts, they gonna, it's.. the, the look. Cause we do it on and off camera. This shit is real life! That's what we do god dammit, the glasses go with the shirt, with that, fuckin' chains, with the buckles on my shoes, you know what I'm saying?

[Verse 1]
Lotta y'all got it fucked up
We started it, we gone, and this shit, what you think this is?
How you think you got in the benz?
I'ma roll a joint, write me a verse, before I finish it
Bad broad who I'm chillin' with
We gonna shoot a video so the whole world witness it
Young fly business man, got no love for the middleman
And you know we sip champagne with lunch, smoke J's and stunt
Came up but we ain't change much
I probably got a fitting, got another awards show
I smell just like a plant every time I pull up
They wanna be like us but that don't flatter me
I'd rather be stacking cheese with the ones I call my family, don't ever question why y'all mad at me
You look at now what I have, I'm moving forward that's a thing in the past, gang

[Chorus]
I got so much love for you (2x)
I got so many people trying to rep my gang
And I love them all the same

[Verse 2]
Time to let it go
If you a freak, let me know, make this night unforgettable
Yeah you try to start me off slow
But I ain't with that no mo'
I get the drugs so you hit the do'
Don't need to tell me what you've seen before
You in a whole another game
Nothing like them mama, roll with the gang
And while your girls acting so strange
Because my dog put her in a place
She should've known that before she came
I'm trying to put you on a different wave
Let you hit the J, relax your mind, ain't gotta fuss with me
After we smoke you know what's next
We go to the room, you get undressed, you tell your friends I'm the best
I like where you going
And from the things that you saying, you might be the one
Let's take a couple shots back and get out of control
Ain't got no rules but you already know, I'll make you mine, know you need to roll

[Chorus]
I got so much love for you (2x)
I got so many people trying to rep my gang (Taylor Gang)
And I love them all the same

[Outro]
You already know who it is, nigga
We flyin' more than we drivin', it's 2016, so, I'm OG'in this shit by now
I still keep in touch though
Roll up that good weed, keep smokin' them planes
Best of the best man
Drop a KK, pack off in every home in America
Uh, T-G-O-D
Why I got a filter on my voice?
(I got so much love for you)
Ham sandwich man: Yo, wassup, Alley!

[Verse 1]
A part of me knows, a part of me knows
A part of me don't want nothing you're not a part of
No way that I, would wish to die
That's right there with your perfect love and by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at your perfect face, there is no time to waste
Baby I'd go as far for you

[Chorus]
As jumping the broom, jumping the broom
You'd jump for me and I'd jump for you
Jumping the broom, jumping the broom
Nothing my love wouldn't do for you

[Verse 2]
Baby, wanna see you shine, shine
And I don't want nothing else but this dream of mine
I want all the sea, your sky and I don't want to see doves cry
Baby this kind of love was made by design

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at your perfect face, there is no time to waste
Baby I'd go as far for you

[Chorus]
As jumping the broom, jumping the broom
You'd jump for me and I'd jump for you
Jumping the broom, jumping the broom
Nothing my love wouldn't do for you

[Bridge]
Hey love, promise I'll never let you go
Hey love, hey love
Jumping the broom
You'd jump for me and I'd jump for you

[Chorus]
As jumping the broom, jumping the broom
You'd jump for me and I'd jump for you
Jumping the broom, jumping the broom
Nothing my love wouldn't do for you

[Hook]
Told you when I started all I had was a dollar
Tryna put the cheese with the bread, red lobster
I been getting money since you niggas was a toddler
Feeling crazy cause I mix the brown with the cha cha

[Verse 1]
I feel like it's baseball every time I want her
Hit a home run and she know that I'mma dodge her
Shout out all my dogs, all my day 1 partners
Can't go on the road cause they kill us and they rob us
She say that I'm OG, but she's just a groupie
Don't know nothing bout to add edemame with sriracha
Girl I'm 'bout to OD cause that pussy so clean
Tongue it how you want it, I'mma make that pussy slobber
Got it like a dope fiend, feeling like the old me
Make my meat cream like the noodles and the pasta
Yeah you know they chose me and I brought the homies
Coach right behind me like my name Shaka
Turn into a OG, smoking on the same thing
Shout to Mike Ang, pussy, money never change me
Nigga you don't know me, you don't know a damn thing
Bullet BG, known to bullet like the hamstring
20/20 vision, still Virginia nigga, can't see
How I made it this far fucking with the melodies
And the way I'm living man, swear a nigga can't see
How I snap a stripper in the world with no enemies
Gang get to change yeah, still I see the tendencies
Strange how your friends turn right into the enemy
Ask them what they doing, you gon' hear a lot of finna be's
Meanwhile, I be outchea working like there's 10 of me
Gone off the assets, better for the sex sex
Plus they say I'm angry when I be off that Hennessy
Say it with your chest, chest, niggas love to flex, flex
I could give a fuck if it ain't about a check, check
Then I gotta get me the next check, baby said I gotta be the best sex
D's on a bitch, got a fresh set, squeeze on a bitch, made a mess, mess
I got the top so I know that's what she wanting from me
I dropped the top cause you know it's California sunny
There's nothing to it, I be stunting through it
They fronting through it, they washed up
I private ship, ride this big dick
And I pussy fuck around, chalked up
They got money, they got cars
But they not boss cause they not us
I had a niggas give my last to me
They still fuck around and got cut
Who says something? Who took something?
Who stole something? Who got us?
No nigga, you done heard wrong
This the wrong tunes to the wrong song
I don't know what's really going on
I don't really give a fuck about it
Shit them songs really been going on
Niggas would have hit me up about it

[Hook]
Told you when I started all I had was a dollar
Told you when I started all I had was a dollar
I know 'bout your pain, no
Was did after me
She get her boys and said no
And I don’t never wanna say you no

She got a gun on her hands
She get them boys out the stands
But just to give up and smile
Said she’ll ever do that she gotta a hold, no

Said I don’t know why did that anymore
She didn’t know what to say then
And i don’t even wanna say so, no

She said who are to me, I mean it
I don’t know, I feel it
Digging them out
And now we both on the road
She got me zoning

She said no no no no no
No no no no no
No no no no no no no no no
Where do I go? (x5)
From here

She got that blow
She got that blow
She got that blow, did it low
Said wanna know

Said where do I go?
Where do I go, no

She got that blow
She got that blow

Said where do I go?
Where do I go?
Where do I go?
Where do I go?
Where do I go on me?

[Verse 1]
Hey love, I lost you babe
Picking up a penny with a press-on is
Easier than holding you down
Can't be any harder than holding you up now
To come clean I said
(To come clean is to come clean)
To be real is to be real, it's
Probably true what they say about me
Probably came from my inner circle
It usually come from your inner circle
Or lack thereof and I don't know who I can trust
I've been dropping out and
I've been hanging out with my high friends
And we too stoned to pay attention, now
(Much too cool for 7th grade)
I mean really, it's same me, it's old me
You know? Same shit
I've been on the low key grinding
(Grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding)
Learning on the low key, shining
Tryin' to keep to myself
But you bring me out of character
Every time again

[Chorus 1]
Damn Gina, damn Gina
Them jeans, they must be uptight mama
You need some get right mama
(Still works for me, it works for me, no)
Go Gina, go Gina
(It works for me, it works for me, no)
Go get that get right mama
(Still works for me, it works for me, no)
Go Gina, go Gina
(It works for me, it works for me, no)
Go 'til you get right mama

[Verse 2]
I belong to nobody, hope it don't bother you
You could mind your business
I belong to nobody, try not to disturb or
Mind my business

[Chorus 2]
Still works for me, it works for me, no
It works for me, it works for me, no
(Go Gina, go Gina)
Still works for me, it works for me, no
It works for me, it works for me, no
(Go Gina, go Gina)
Still works for me, it works for me, no
It works for me, it works for me, no
(Go Gina, go Gina)
Still works for me, it works for me, no
It works for me, it works for me, no
(Go Gina, go Gina)

[Instrumental outro]

[Verse 1]
It is no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don’t matter, anyhow
And it is no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don’t know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I’ll be gone
You’re the reason I’m traveling on
Don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 2]
It is no use in turning on your light, babe
That light I never know
And it is no use in turning on your light, babe
I’m on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
So don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 3]
It is no use in calling out my name, girl
Like you never did before
It is no use in calling out my name, girl
I can’t hear you anymore
I’m a-thinking and a-wondering all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 4]
So long, honey babe
Where I’m bound, I can’t tell
But goodbye’s too good a word, babe
So I’ll just say fare thee well
I'm not saying you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don’t mind
You just kind of wasted my precious time
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
A hit, good one Richard

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
When I'm in L.A., pedal to the floor, mane
Your bitch in my face, she must be a hoe, mane
Money in the way, I can't see my floor, mane
Pull up, 'Ventador, ayy, watch my doors, mane
When I'm in L.A., pedal to the floor, mane
Your bitch in my face, she must be a hoe, mane

Pull up, 'Ventador, ayy, watch my doors, mane

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Your bitch on my line, she hit me every day
'Bout them dollar signs, always gettin' paid
Bad bitch in New York, bad bitch in L.A
Said I gotta go, she want me to stay
By the pound, bitch I blow it by the pound
'Specially when I'm outta town
Ain't my gang? You not allowed
Get a chick and lock her down
Ain't hot, think we got it now
Your bitch in the lost and found
Started small, we bossin' now
Not a sound

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
She wan' smoke my dope, ayy

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Money in the bank, money in the safe
Got my business straight, now I'm switchin' states
(Now I'm switchin' states)
Now I'm shinin' on 'em, now I win the race
Now these bitches chase, now these niggas hate
But these chips I chase
Gas in my joint, gas in my tank
Hit it once, hyperventilate

[Hook: Nina Simone]
Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
Good God! Midwest coast back, nigga
And don't say 'nigga' unless of course you black, nigga
Free country, they say that shit in Tennessee
'Cause I got all their white daughters drinkin' Hennessy
I'mma go to Sal's with some niggas on the wall
I might go to Oz, take some niggas off the wall
Got the key to the city, the streets on lock
Tryna take 'em to the top, they say Chano's so involved
I know, King Dolo, 3rd, even the group solo
It's been that way since my shirt had two Polos
We the kids they'll keep in the back
I'm in love with my city, bitch I sleep in my hat
I'm a free agent, go and do the math
Underdog of underground, Tubman with the path
They ask about the help and all I do is laugh
I say God my only boss, even Moses had a staff
You know

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
Children of Jah
Children of Jah
Children of Jah, put your hands up

[Hook]

Fuck is you talking, I been so VA
Fuck is you talking like you been in VA
Watch what you say boy

She wanna fuck me but she want some money
She should know that she ain't gettin' nothin' from me
I don't know why these niggas lookin' for me
I don't know... (trails off)

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Friday
I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
No rules
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
Blowing up to the ceiling, we burning bright when we cut the light
'Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof

[Chorus: Britney Spears]

Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Yeah, yeah, Eazy

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or a little bar
It’s really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are, need you
I've always wanted what was off limits
Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this is all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we can tell that there are changes coming
See, I can tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go (Go)
Like Penelope in Blow
Well aware that stealing you is a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah

[Bridge: G-Eazy]
But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you

[Chorus: Britney Spears & (G-Eazy)]
And make me oooh (Move), oooh, oooh (Yeah), oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Post-Chorus: Britney Spears]
Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out

Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Yeah, you make me oooh

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Bitch I'm drippin' on these niggas, drip drop
It's a real Rollie, it don't tick tock
Savage ridin' 'round the city with that Glock
Get that dick on it, I'ma let it pop
Let it pop, bitch, you better run
It ain't no fun, when young Savage got the gun
I drop bombs on these niggas like Osama
Keep the Don Cannon, they don't want no drama

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Flyest nigga you ever seen, I'm the king of the teens
Hydro codeines, caught serving beans to the fiends
My new bitch Billy Jean, old bitch Tina Turner, keep the burner
Old hunnids Tom Joyner, my new bitch is a foreigner
My new wrist cost a 36, that's a quarter-brick or three shows
I could've iced my ear lobes, I'd rather split it with my bros

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'

[Verse 3: Sauce Walka]
Lil' bitch, I'm Sauce Farrakhan, Sauce-Alaikum, A-Sauce-Salaam
I got so much flavor, nigga
Swear to God that I'm Tony Chachere son
Aunt Jemima might be my mama
Drippin' sauce how I make the commas
Poured everything out the bottle
Red bottom feet hand made iguana
When I walk off it's a murder scene
Rolls got my wrist it look Burgundy
I made your bitch buy a fur for me
It wasn't even cold, hell it was spring
Sauce-Ebola, epidemic got the world drippin' over
Thanks to Sauce harbor now I'm on a little boat with 21 soldiers

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'
Bitch I'm drip, drip, drip, drip, drippin'

[Verse 1]
I got no time for regrets
That's what I say to my friends
I tell them that I'm okay
Don't know what I'm hiding
Promising my head straight, I swear
I think I'm going under
Running from the thunder
Don't wanna blow my cover, no way

[Chorus]
So I'll throw back bottles, bottles, bottles
When I'm feeling low, wanna drown away my sorrows, sorrows, sorrows
Wanna lose my mind, don't think about tomorrow, 'morrow, 'morrow
Gonna close my eyes and float away
'Cause nothing feels better than a sweet escape
Bottles, bottles, bottles
When I'm feeling low, wanna drown away my sorrows, sorrows, sorrows
Wanna lose my mind, don't think about tomorrow, 'morrow, 'morrow
Gonna close my eyes and float away
'Cause nothing feels better than a sweet escape

[Verse 2]
I'm hanging right on the edge
(Right on the edge, I'm right on the edge)
Got to stop playing pretend
(Playing pretend; you got to stop, got to stop, yeah)
I think I need a doctor, or maybe just a lover
Someone who can comfort my brain
I always try to fight it, but I can't deny it
I guess I'm kinda hooked on the pain

[Chorus]
So I'll throw back bottles, bottles, bottles
When I'm feeling low, wanna drown away my sorrows, sorrows, sorrows
Wanna lose my mind, don't think about tomorrow, 'morrow, 'morrow
Gonna close my eyes and float away
'Cause nothing feels better than a sweet escape
Bottles, bottles, bottles
When I'm feeling low, wanna drown away my sorrows, sorrows, sorrows
Wanna lose my mind, don't think about tomorrow, 'morrow, 'morrow
Gonna close my eyes and float away
'Cause nothing feels better than a sweet escape

[Bridge]
Na-na-na-na-oh
Na-na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na, yeah
Let's do it all again, let's do it all again
Na-na-na-na-oh
Na-na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na, yeah
Let's do it all again, let's do it all again

[Breakdown]
I got no time for regrets

[Chorus]
So I'll throw back bottles, bottles, bottles
When I'm feeling low, wanna drown away my sorrows, sorrows, sorrows
Wanna lose my mind, don't think about tomorrow, 'morrow, 'morrow
Gonna close my eyes and float away
'Cause nothing feels better than a sweet escape

[Outro]
Na-na-na-na-oh
Na-na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na
(Bottles, bottles, bottles, yeah)
Let's do it all again, let's do it all again
Na-na-na-na-oh
Na-na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na
(Bottles, bottles, bottles, yeah)
Let's do it all again, let's do it all again

[Hook: TK-N-Cash]
Tryna be real baby just to let you know
Fuck you on the counter and move you to the floor
Have you going all night baby, 3 times in a row
Hitting that back to back, 3 times in a row
3 times in a row, 3 times in a row
3 times in a row, 3 times in a row
3 times in a row, 3 times in a row
3 times in a row, let me hold that beat (I like it)

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
I'm the pussy killer, everybody know that
If you got a girl, better get a LoJack
She don't like to smoke but I let her roll that
Mr. I-ain't-never-got-her, holla where the hoes at
Say she wanna fuck, yeah, just to let me know
So I hit her up, put her on the schedule
Then I eat her up like a nigga Hannibal
And I got the whole thing on the camera roll

[Pre-Hook: Trey Songz]
Ooh, the first time, we won't make it to the bed
Yeah the second time, you be so weak in your legs
By the third round, you know I invented sex
Three times in a row, I bet I leave that pussy
Leave that pussy dead, leave that pussy dead
Leave that pussy dead, leave that pussy dead
Leave that pussy dead, leave that pussy dead
3 times in a row with me, I made that pussy RIP

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Put that pussy straight to sleep, wake it up, put it right back
Tell me where the girls that done had it like that
Tell me where the girls that imagine like that
Got 'em feeling on your titties while I'm dicking from the back
When we switching up positions, got it dripping down your ass crack
Just the second round, you already having flashbacks
Nasty nigga, fucking with your boy yeah
Your ass get bigger, hit 'em with the shit now

[Pre-Hook: Trey Songz]
Ooh, the first time, we won't make it to the bed
Yeah the second time, you be so weak in your legs
By the third round, you know I invented sex
Three times in a row, I bet I leave that pussy
Leave that pussy dead, leave that pussy dead
Leave that pussy dead, leave that pussy dead
Leave that pussy dead, leave that pussy dead
3 times in a row with me, I made that pussy RIP

[Hook: TK-N-Cash]
Tryna be real baby just to let you know

3 times in a row, 3 times in a row
3 times in a row, 3 times in a row
3 times in a row, 3 times in a row
3 times in a row, let me hold that beat

[Verse 1]
When I woke
I found my phone in the bed clothes
And the curtain glowed crimson through the window
To think of her was to want her
Would you want me too?

[Chorus]
You've got it all and yet
You're betting all you have on a first world problem
You've got to understand
That I could be your man or a first world problem
You've got it all and yet
You're betting all you have on a first world problem
You've got to understand
That I could be your man or a first world problem

[Verse 2]
I know that I was better as a loser
She's eating birthday cake inside the disco
I may be lost but I'm a lost man
In love with you

[Chorus]
You've got it all and yet
You're betting all you have on a first world problem
You've got to understand
That I could be your man or a first world problem
You've got it all and yet
You're betting all you have on a first world problem
You've got to understand
That I could be your man or a first world problem
You've got it all and yet
You're betting all you have on a first world problem
You've got to understand
That I could be your man or a first world problem
You've got it all and yet
You're betting all you have on a first world problem
You've got to understand
That I could be your man or a first world problem
You've got it all and yet
You're betting all you have on a first world problem
You've got to understand
That I could be your man or a first world problem
You've got it all and yet
You're betting all you have on a first world problem
You've got to understand
That I could be your man or a first world problem
You've got it all and yet
You're betting all you have on a first world problem
You've got to understand
That I could be your man or a first world problem

[Outro]
You've got it all and yet
You're betting all you have on a first world problem
First world problem
First world problem
First world problem

[Verse 1]
I still recall the time when I was 17
The officer who warned you both about me
And in the years before
I knew you’d seen it, too
The warning signs were scars of future rescue

[Chorus]
Tell her later
The words of gratitude escape me
Tell her later
The shit I put you through
I wish that I could take it back
Was I ever hard to love?
My life is owed to you
This all is tribute

[Verse 2]
Father, if you are the one the apple fell so close to
I understand the things you did
What’s going wrong?
And who else is to blame?
“Our son is gone. Our son is gone!”
Never thought I’d want to

[Chorus]
Tell her later
The words of gratitude escape me
Tell her later
The shit I put you through
I wish that I could take it back
Was I ever hard to love?
My life is owed to you
This all is tribute

[Break]
How did you get any sleep at night?
How did you get any sleep at night?
How did you get any sleep at night?
How did you get any sleep at night?

[Chorus]
Tell her later
Tell her later
What did I put you through?
I wish that I could take it back
Was I ever hard to love?
My life is owed to you
This all is tribute

[Outro]
I wish that I could take it back
I wish that I could take it back
I wish that I could take it back
Was I ever hard to love?
Feeding off of my cold insides was the doubt instilled around me
Second guessing
Not impressing
Silence will hide it

My existence is subpar when pity's obsolete
Campus is closed
Students go home
I sulk in bed

But the person laying beside me holds on
Partially saving me

Bracing the insecurities
You stayed nudging me gently
Thank you, truly, for the love

Velvet sheets place of confession
Safety blanket - your gift to me

Feeding off of my nervous mind was the damage done inside me
Self inflicting
Isolating
Capsules will hide it
Fuck the feeling I get when she tries to comfort me
What could she do?
Suffocate on 1st Avenue

This was not the way I wanted it to be
This was not the way you wanted it for me
Taking measures to sever and resign
On repeat
On repeat
Take your feelings and cleanse yourself of mine
Slip away
Toss my things

Self inflicting
Undeserving
Anger will hide it

Fuck the feeling I felt when she finally had enough
To my chagrin, I watched her love for me begin to

Burn nice and slow
Burn nice and slow
Burn nice and slow
Burn up

[Verse 1]
Hate when they talk
Terrified
Hate when the voices talk
Running my mind amuck
Social lies

[Chorus]
Paranoia in my conscience and when it talks I don't care at all
Moral fentanyl
I'm a book with different endings
If my exes talk, should I care at all?
Guess my character is flawed!

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I have trouble being honest
Follow my moral compass - it leads to a dead end
Leveraged words sound absurd
I'll convert social curves
(This is fucked. I wish it wasn't. I question my own involvement.)

[Chorus]
Paranoia of the masses and when they talk I don't care at all
Moral fentanyl
Innocence, a distant memory
When my exes talk, should I care at all?
Guess my character is flawed!

[Bridge]
I'm using justifying lines, always the good ones
Cue from the black lung; Time to step outside

[Verse 3]
Out of spite I want you to be honest
Does the energy I harness make you feel alright?
Leveraged words sound absurd
I'll convert social curves
(This is fucked! I wish I wasn’t questioning my moral compass.)
If twisted thoughts were poison I’d be dead

[Chorus]
Paranoia in my conscience and when it talks I don't care at all
Moral fentanyl
I'm a book with different endings
If my exes talk, should I care at all?
Guess my character is flawed!

[Outro]
Paranoia!

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Wake up, F1LTHY

Diamonds on my neck like a chandelier
Shotties in the party aim 'em at ya dub (Yeah)
Niggas know lil' boat never gave a fuck (Yeah)

[Interlude: Black Kray]
Look pig gang, you see me, you see pink Benzes you heard me
Diamonds on my frame mane, money ain't shit, you heard me
Nigga, Citgo, wah

[Verse 2: Black Kray]
Range Rover, lil' killa
Big fur, lil' chinchilla
Big ice, shit, big sticks
Shit, big lights, I said lil' nigga quit
Right there with my shooter when the block hot
Cult cookin' hard, no crock pot
Shit, pink Range Rover, it got drop top
Shit, spend a little money, make the bitch drop
I hit clubs, nigga with my right hand
Shit, Barbie Benz jeep when a nigga land
Think I'm T.I., pop a rubberband
Hit the strip club, do the money dance
In and out the crib, fuckin' up the club
You know I let 'em all fuckin' up my dough
Phantom, Peach fur shoppin' wit my hoe
Lil Rari do the dash, I don't drive slow

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Catch you out in traffic, it's you and I
Gold 41 in a suit and tie, nigga it's do or die
Seen it now, if I lose it all like who would ride?
But nigga I'm so up, if I tripped it's like suicide
When the internet told me I'm crucified
They was in them streets like, "Nigga you super live"
I was on the block when you was a sneakerhead
Nigga it's a check up in that box, ain't no shoe inside
Nigga ain't no Nike, ain't no Yeezy, no Jordan V
I came back like I'm Mike wearin' 45
Ever seen 50 grand when it's all in 5s?
But I'm shootin' like the Warriors' startin' 5, swish!
Only rapper went gold without a verse from Hov
Still got the rock with me, cookin' up at the stove
And the Rollie all platinum, know I bust it at Joe
Maybach in the hood, so them suckers can know
I'm in the 6, man, 6 man, Dion Waiters
And I'm on my level now, I'm so beyond haters
Bout to go and grab the Benz truck, see y'all later
When I came through the block, you should've seen y'all faces
This is slaughter, new world order
I be goin' hard, Westbrook, 4th quarter
This is hip-hop, you ain't write it, don't record it
I don't know how they gettin' down 'cross the border
I give 'em the dirty flow, Michigan and water
Sent them 10 thousand cases, I put in my order
Call that poppin' bottles when my people can't afford it
Mixin' D'usse with lemonade when I'm in Georgia
Views from the projects, and nigga I'm the prospect
Talkin' loud, say I'm shootin' out with metal objects
And that chick standin' right beside you, I done popped that
Made me beat a fan up, I'm feelin' like I'm Artest, woo!
Gold mic from the billboards, 'bout to plug it up
Tell Cruz put it in the booth so I can fuck it up
Got the hood super lit, jumpin' like it's double dutch
From the bottom like an uppercut, now I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
You niggas all the way fucked
Switched sides, now you stuck (stay over there my g)
Fuck them niggas though

[Interlude: Fabolous]
This is
Edsclusive
They don't wanna see you on top
I just wanna see the streets up
They don't wanna see you up
That's it
They gon' take shots when you all the way up

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I guess they gotta aim up at you
But don't you let these nobodies get their name up on you
Keep the circle tight, never let 'em lame up the crew
If she for everybody, don't you let her claim up on you
Now listen, you gave up on me, I came up on you
Took my talents somewhere else, LeBron James up on you
I was Kyrie with the rock, the crack game number 2
Now I'm older, still ballin' like my name Uncle Drew
They tell you... stay the same, but they change up on you
Niggas change up the crew like hoes change up their boo
I just played the cards they dealt me 'til a change-up was due
Guess I had to switch the dealer or just change up the shoe
Now blackjack, Ace of Spade and a shot of Jack
I met a bad actress, she ain't know how to act
I took her but I brought her back
Don't want her back, I bought her bag
Matte like Hasselbeck, I call my car a quarterback
If I threw it at her would you doubt she could catch?
She hang like a chain so she 'bout to get snatched
Ain't about throwin' subs, I'm about gettin' scratches
But if the shoe fits, nigga, buy an outfit to match it
And you know my boys hold it, we be out with the ratchets
I heard your boys told her you be out with the rats
Keep that on the "Shhhh!”, nothing less, nothing more
I know the Bad Boys in Brooklyn, they ain't with the Puffy tour
What's up with your Warriors? They ain't lookin' tough no more
Should get out your feelings bro, and get in your duffle, boy
Level up, level up, it's all about that level up
Hold that fuckin' bezel up and light this bitch all the way up
All the way up
All the way up
And everytime you see me nigga
Man I'm all the way up

[Interlude: Jadakiss]
This is
Edsclusive
Uhh, haa
Days I figured why not, ha-ha

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Meek called me and Fab, Joe called Jigga up
She jumped in the 6, 550 wasn't big enough
Reason niggas die, they don't know how to live enough
They can tread water, but they can't swim enough
Nah, I'm built for the physical outing
Besides that, I'm filthy, like municipal housing
J all I know is 500, getchu a thousand
I be in all the hood spots you not allowed in
Opps in the building, automatically alert that
Hand on the wrist so the chrome don't jerk back
Pull it out, you already know you gotta squirt that
I'm all the way up I'm from where the phones don't work at
You gon' need the key from the lobby to slide up
You don't know the key to the body is mind up
Born with it then you don't gotta get signed up
Gotta go when you gotta go, your times up
Extendos, no need for keeping the 9's tucked
I'm kicking you off the ladder for trying to climb up
Yup, overlooking the city
I'm all the way up, I'm like Hov looking at Biggie
It's 50 in the bank, who rollin'? Shoot the 50
If I ace, then these niggas think they hit me
But I'm-

[Outro: Meek Mill, Faboulous, & Jadakiss]
All the way up
Haa
I'm all the way up
All the way up
All the way up
And everytime you see me nigga
Man I'm all the way up
I've realized I was out of line
Every single time I bullied you to talk to me
My heart starts to control my mind
Thinking of the time that I last said goodbye
Reminding you you're the only one for me

Oh no!
Your scent is on my clothes
And I'm suffocating in it
The word beautiful doesn't do you justice
The word beautiful doesn't do you justice at all!

The word mesmerized doesn't do me justice
This magnetic pull I feel between just us

You might think I was joking
When I kept asking
Where you kept your wings
Angel
It's killing me to know
That I might have to let you go
On the street, that day we met
Right then you grabbed my soul
And took it to the greatest place it'd ever know

I melt when your eyes are on me
Stop it can't you see
You're weakening my knees
Your hair looks perfect in the breeze
I hold your hand and squeeze
Suddenly I beg you please
Can I turn away?
My mouth is open wide
And out come the butterflies

I overreact in fear
I overreact in fear
But that's no excuse for my actions

Guess who chose (guess who chose)
To want nothing more
Just know you had my love (you had my love)
You had my love

(I wonder how you are)
(Was this your way to get it through my head)
You've done things that others cannot undo
You know that I adore you
But I think we've reached the peak
You're trapped in the debris
Bella
You're perfect how you are
You're the wish that shooting stars
Help come true
Bella
Fourteen months ago
I would never know
That you'd mean so much to me
Tired tempting thoughts to sleep it off
Tempting tired thoughts will keep my eyes shut
All the time we spend asleep is the time we’re wasting
Wasting

Burn my bed

Why won’t we wake up?
Is it ‘cause you’re dead
Why won’t we wake up?
Is it ‘cause you’re dead

I swear I’ve seen that look before
Flesh magnetic and it’s oh so surreal
Then the bed shakes and you wish you hadn’t woken up at all

I like to think about the many shapes
That our bodies take in the dead of night
If only I could go back where I’d left off
Return, return
Why won’t we wake up?
Is it ‘cause you’re dead
Why won’t we wake up?

Stay awake for this (Hold on)
There’s too much to miss (Hold on)
Why do we insist on always shutting down?

Hold on

Oh now I see we’re just human batteries
Merely skin and energy
We’re just human batteries
Oh now I see we’re just human batteries
Always needing recharging
We’re just humans, we’re just humans

Oh god why do we do this?
Oh god why do we do this?
Oh god why do we do this?
Oh god why do we do this all the time?

I like to think about the many shapes
That our bodies take in the dead of night

I swear I’ve seen that look before
That horrid gaze could sear my core
Struck with fear
And I wish that I could shake myself awake
I’d rather dream about the many ways
That our bodies shake in this state of mind
Until my mind reminds me nothing’s real
Return, return

Oh it’s time to give up
It’s time to give up
It’s time to give up
Give up on your dreams

[Hook: Big Bub]
This why they show me mad love all around the world
This why they show me mad love all around the world
This why they show me mad love all around the world
This why they show me mad love all around the world

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I'm represented by Fetti, I'm so hardcore
Feet to the floor, up on a cord
Kick open the door, not knowing the score
I'm tatted and matted, added, that's 4 to the 4
Now we say, well is he good or he great?
Don't even wait, just clean the food off your plate
Say your grace, for the life that you make
Now he butted and skutting, cutting the knife in the steak
Wow, I'm and out of TI, all about it
Cause I handle my BI, CI, I see you
Wanna get a flair, no faking
Let's take it cause I love this shit

[Hook: Big Bub]
This why they show me mad love around the world
This why they show me mad love around the world
This why they show me mad love around the world
This why they show me mad love around the world

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now when I'm on tour, my spirit's unpure
And there's no cure for sure but I adore
I walk around the town and I explore
I'm greeted by 100 fans at my front door
Encore is what they want, much more
I'm smooth like suede with a touch of valore
On the rocks, Ciroc, glass and I pour
Snoop Dogg is the shit, get your ass on the floor
You can choose best and 2 step to this
Smoked up cause my weed is the shit
Take down and break down the verse
Put the S in your chest when worst comes to worst

[Hook: Big Bub]
This why they show me mad love all around the world
This why they show me mad love all around the world
This why they show me mad love all around the world
This why they show me mad love all around the world

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah all around the world
Big Bub, Snoop Dogg
Real love
From the streets to the suites
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I been
Love, love
Go head, go head, go head
Say that, say that, say that
Oh yeah they do
Another classic
That's real love right there man
All around the world
Shout out to the whole globe
Love y'all, nasty piece

[Verse 1]
Champagne, caviar
We’re going out on a town
Do you wanna go far
City lights on the sky
Dressed up and sexed up
Put this crystal on ice
Let me take you out tonight
Making love under the stars so bright
I don’t wanna talk too much
Gonna speak to your body
Words can’t touch

[Chorus]
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

[Verse 2]
Gold chains, big cigars
I wanna light up your body
Like a you’re movie star
Put our names on the list
Gonna grab us some rope
And blow the cameras a kiss
Diamonds dancing on my flesh
'Bout to smoke your favourite stash
Pay with love
Don't need no cash
Gonna turn up your body
Put this shit on blast

[Chorus]
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

[Bridge]
Take you where nobody's gone before
Take you all the way to heaven's door
Feel my heartbeat lying next to yours
On this floor, on this floor
Take you where nobody's gone before
Take you all the way to heaven's door
Feel my heartbeat lying next to yours
On this floor, on this floor
On this floor, on this floor
On this floor, on this floor
Feel my heartbeat lying next to yours
On this floor

[Chorus]
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

[Verse 1]
Champagne, caviar
We’re going out on a town
Do you wanna go far
City lights on the sky
Dressed up and sexed up
Put this crystal on ice
Let me take you out tonight
Making love under stars so bright
I don’t wanna talk too much
Gonna speak to your body
Words can’t touch

[Verse 1]
Please, don't change for me
I never wanted this in the first place, you see
Please, walk on that
The closer I get to you I lose my mind

[Chorus]
I thought I saw you today
But nobody was there
I thought I saw you today
But nobody was there

[Verse 2]
Do me a favor and I'll return it later
That's what we said when we were young
The coward lying inside me was still rising
And it's hard to say, just what I become
You keep the shuffle and move around those muscles
Until you feel, a weight coming off
The constant action they're moving and they're passing
Autumn leaves, they have just begun

[Chorus]
I thought I saw you today
But nobody was there
I thought I saw you today
But nobody was there
And the autumn leaves are falling
I cannot find my way
And the autumn leaves are falling
I cannot find my place

[Bridge]
What are you talking about now?
What are you talking about now?
I don't need it anymore
What are you talking about now?
I don't need it anymore
What are you talking about?

[Verse 1]
Momma said that the growing pains won't end
It's the little bitty waves
That'll keep the tide at bay
Time flies through imaginary lines
That hazy winter day
Moving only in the days

[Chorus]
Life moves slowly
Life moves slowly

[Verse 2]
Life moves so slow
It makes me wonder where it goes
I stay dreaming of the place nobody knows

[Chorus]
Life moves slowly
Life moves slowly

[Bridge]
You should have known better, better
You should have known better, better
We could have been better, better
We could have been better, better

[Hook: Dexta Daps]
I'm gonna treat ya like my best friend

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
There ain't nothin' to it
With a friend I keep it cool with

[Verse 2: M.I.A.]
You can be my best friend
You know to much to be a foe
You were there from before
In the days when I had no doe
Break bread, watch Breaking Bad
Always there when I break up bad
In bed feeling so sad
You were always there as a comrade
I know you think like me
Life ain’t easy for the people like we
Say life’s like a box of chocolates
We say who packed it do you feel me
What you do is none of my business
But I want you to make me a witness
Want to witness the greatness
Cause we best friends through health and sickness

[Pre-Chorus: M.I.A.]
Gonna be your best friend
Gonna make that shit trend

(You can be my foreign friend yea yea

I said as a refugee, you know
Where we come from, we get out our tent
Then we climb over the fence
We don't wanna cause an offence
Then we get a Benz, flat screen tv, Then we pay rent
Then we think we made it
Then we be your foreign friend

[Verse 3: M.I.A.]
Best friend can’t condemn
If you good for you I’ll bend
Partner defend to the end
All people depend on a friend
There is nothing to it
With a friend I keep it cool with
Fuck it we’ve been through it
We’re sticking like glue now chew it
Bad girls hands up
Ride or die and we feel it
Pull me closer if you think we can hang
If you can’t screw it

How do you even do that shit? Let's go
Let me hold that shit

[Verse 1]
Deep off in the valley, yeah hoe, that's where I stay
When the house phone ring, yeah that mean you at the ga
Said her ex keep calling and that nigga in the way
Sent a ticket to her iPhone, now she on the way
Touchdown in LA, yeah she beg for the trip
Shawty bad as fuck, shit, with them Dolly Parton tits
Uber never coming here, told her I'mma send a Lyft
Canada John's coming here since 2006
And you can never fuck me, girl if you ain't sucking dick
And no we never fucking, 'less you hear that wrapper rip
Uber never coming here, throwing hoes in the Lyft
Uber never coming here, throwing hoes in the Lyft

[Verse 2]
She ain't never been, so I took her out the hive
We should call another Lyft, they can't fit up in the ride
Freak rolls in the 5th, 3 hoes in the VIP
3 hoes turn to 6, I'm too old for this shit
Need another old Perc, shit who ever got it works
She got Xans in her purse, got my hand up her skirt
Rolling with some niggas that don't play to fuck around
Hey girl, I know you know them niggas, they should stay the fuck from round
Shooters every fucking where, even when I'm outta town
Shoot from every fucking where, even when we outta bounds
You a referee snitching and a referee missing
Where you get your pills from? Who fill out that prescription?
Where you get your heels from? Who got you them 6 inches?
All types of signs on, homies Blood and Cripping
All types of lines, swear I caught some bitches sniffing
Uber never coming here, if we did, it would be different

[Hook]
Uber never coming here, throwing hoes in the Lyft
Uber never coming here, tell them hoes get they shit
Uber never coming here, throwing hoes in the whip
Uber never coming here cause we far as a bitch

[Verse]
I'm hearin' shooters loadin' pistols while I'm brushin' my teeth (Dang)
I get so many death threats, it's getting normal to me
But I bend, don't break, I don't ask, just take
Black gloves, black tape and I don't play nor pray (Nope)
Wake up and take a piss, I hear 'em sharpening knives
Main focus every day is make it out here alive (Lawd)
Take a shower in my boots and go to sleep in my shoes
Last night, I had a dream some killers ran in my room (Ah)
Trying to be patient, but nigga, I can't wait (Nah)
Only chance to kill my enemies and beat my case (Yeah)
So when they ask me how I feel about 'em, I can't say
You either with me or against me or you in my way (Pussy)
I got a pack of hungry wolves and if I don't feed 'em
Then they might turn on me, feel like I don't need 'em
I keep the best pedigree, but hell, I don't breed 'em (Grr)
It's a lot of people scared of me and I can't blame 'em
They call me crazy so much, I think I'm starting to believe 'em
I did some things to some people that was downright evil
Is it karma coming back to me? So much drama
My own mama turned her back on me and that's my mama (Mama)
I lost three people close to me in one summer
Ten years later, still don't know shot up my Hummer (Hmmm)
But I bend I don't break, I don't ask I take (I take)
Black gloves and black tape, nigga, it's my first day (Wop)

[Outro]
Wop

[Verse 1]
Remember every move you made as if it was still true
It's there I am king, there I feel brand new

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause you’re in my soul, can’t let you go, fighting for you
And in my dreams, I’ll make you appear, oh oh oh
As we move closer and I groove with you
Blue and green rays, they shine through, hey
Feel the energy, you don’t have to try
You can see it in our bodies, you can see it in our eyes

[Chorus]
Watch me dance with this memory
Just as real, just as heavenly
Watch me dance in my reverie
The lights decay but the love remains
Watch me dance with this memory
Just as real, just as heavenly
Watch me dance in my reverie
The lights decay but my love remains

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
In the mist of the crowded room, you might have flown
But all I see is you and you alone

[Pre-Chorus]
‘Cause you’re in my soul, can’t let you go, fighting for you
And in my dreams, I’ll make you appear
As we move closer and I grove with you
Blue and green rays, they shine through
Feel the energy, you don’t have to try
You can see it in our bodies, you can see it in our eyes

[Chorus]
Watch me dance with this memory
Just as real, just as heavenly
Watch me dance in my reverie
The lights decay but the love remains
Watch me dance with this memory
Just as real, just as heavenly
Watch me dance in my reverie
The lights decay but my love remains

[Outro]
It remains
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey....

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Hallelujah, my plug just send me 50, I got first right a refusal
My bitches my main shooter, I might make my bitch go do you
Don't bring your bitch around my chick
My bitch might jimmy choo her
Its Guwop, I ain't hip hop, but I bet my diamonds bluer
Got 3 spots, I got 2 drops and I ain't no nigga cooler
Got 3 rings, I got 10 chains and I think I'm Rick the Ruler
I got Young niggas in my straight 8, cause that's how I maneuver, Gucci!
Make trap back, I had a flash back, when I shot at that intruder
In a section, full of bad bitches, and they wanna smoke hooters
The way I beat the block, the way I work the track
Make you think I'm a producer
Inside your head, medusa
You're dumb head, you need a tutor

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I might not buy a new Mercedes
But I'ma drive your ass crazy
That's something she just done phase me
The way she suck it, so amazing
I'm bout to drive a bitch crazy
That's something she just done phase me
I'm bout to make a bitch pay me, pay me
You taking care of nigga baby
I'm bout to drive a bitch crazy

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame ]
Red flag, no black car, flat back car, of 2 bars with 3 broads
40 grands on my g stars, pink slips don't lease ours
Who the fuck you think we are, retard!
Kick start this brick squad, that candy touch your body part
Trapped up like toll cars, goons have it real like the drug lords

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Got young shooters and dope guards
My A&R are dope boys, like a drug czar in a cold war
Pistol whip a nigga with a crowbar
Security guards they trelling you, so we pulling up and shooting both cars
Bag a nigga like a bag boy, paint a nigga like Mozart
Say he lived his life as a KING PIN, that's why they find his ass in the junkyard
Murder shit I know boy, I ain't really scared of no boy
Couple of home boys and lil joy, and they all waiting to come home boy
Got bricks all in my fender, bricks all in my floorboard
And you know a nigga paid a low for it but respect me, I can't go for it
All my hoes will fly for it, all my niggas will die for it
I can tell a killer when I see one, you can say Gucci got an eye for it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I might not buy a new Mercedes
But I'ma drive your ass crazy
That's something she just done phase me
The way she suck it, so amazing
I'm bout to drive a bitch crazy
That's something she just done phase me
I'm bout to make a bitch pay me, pay me
You taking care of nigga baby
I'm bout to drive a bitch crazy

[Hook: MIKExANGEL]
They said I would never be shit
They said I was never gonna amount to nothing
They said I would never make it
But guess what I did, look what I did, look what I did

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
I been tryna have a different view of shit
Missed the old times and the foolishness
Old hoes moving onto the next nigga
I don't like them doing shit
I don't give a fuck who it is
They ain't never really mattered to me
Only listen when the money talks
Shit, never bring the chit chatter to me
Nigga back at it, I'm a dog with it
Still here when the fog finished
Prove yeah, we can all get it nigga
Get the money then we ball with it
Trey Trey from the Trey ward
You don't want it 'less you pray for it
Virginia nigga got plenty niggas
I'mma make a call, they gon' spray for it
Then I probably fuck a bartender
They look better than the strippers now
I ain't never gon' floss with her
Boss nigga, I'mma dick her down
Catch a nigga on the old block
Moo daddy with me on the aisle
Spending money in the old spots
For all the days that we never had
We take a trip when we touchdown
Whip on the strip when we touchdown
I ain't never gave a fuck if you find one
Tell me where the fucks found
Big bag, it's a must now
Only niggas that I trust round
And they put respek upon my name
Like a young Tremaine was from uptown

[Hook: MIKExANGEL]
They said I would never be shit
They said I was never gonna amount to nothing
They said I would never make it
But guess what I did, look what I did, look what I did

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
We be tryna balance out the load
So we copping 0's for the elevation
Hoes here so it's everywhere
Her makeup, all on the pillowcases
Heard 'em saying get it back to basics
So I took the pieces, put 'em back in places
Easy, I'm DB
I be working hoes out, dominatrix
Niggas saying there's a vacancy
Like I ain't here with the heat strapped
Cut the lights off, get the weed sack
Cut the mic on, let the beats tat
You gon' make a dope nigga relapse
Don't get your show close
Like concerts, nigga we clap
My shows, they be packed
Nigga where the fuck you see seats at?
If they try to come and get the chicken
I'mma make you show you where the beef at
Money long like marathons
Came a long way from the avalon
Crew said, got a new cheque
Got the blue chair by the avatar
Number ones in the catalogue
She was fun but I had 'em all
Doing lines in the bathroom
In the classroom, she like Adderall
I'm a dog, yeah that a boy
That a Porsche, nah that a toy
Nigga roll like I'm at a dump
I be on my bullshit
No bullshit with the metaphors
All I ever used to ever want
Want a Lexus, nah nigga I got shoes now
6 bedroom crib turned into 5
Cause there's room for shoes now
Granddaddy used to grind
Making moneshine, got my own bulls now
I be tryna make a move
Let 'em make a move, I could never lose now

[Hook: MIKExANGEL]
They said I would never be shit
They said I was never gonna amount to nothing
They said I would never make it
But guess what I did, look what I did, look what I did
Look what I did, look what I did
Look what I did, look what I did
Look what I did, look what I did
Look what I did, look what I did

[Beat change]

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Life fast, every day is fucking Friday
Getting dumb, high, high fast on the highway
You don't even understand a real nigga worry
I'm still so instilled, in my environment
Feel my spill cause they feel that I'm inspiring
Words are the bills that I still been acquiring
Staff fucking up then the staff get fired
I can give a bitch whatever she been desiring
This feel like the day I bought my mama her first Benzo
This feel like the day I got son in the temples
All I used to wanted was a Chevy with barellis
Running with some niggas just like Tommy off her belly
I be stroking like she Keisha, I be deep up in her belly
Stressed so a nigga, I be smoking on the daily
Got the strap up in the trap just in case they creep up in the telly
I don't have time for these niggas, they be needing for some fetti
But everybody know they love me in the hood though
Everybody know I love me a lil hood hoe
Smoking presidential in the presidential
You nigga 'bout my bread like a motherfucking dinner roll
I just need niggas looking out for my genitals
Leader of the squad, I'm the motherfucking general
Pull up to the spot, I don't even hit the line
'Less the motherfuckers got all the money in the envelope
In between the sheets with a bitch, keep a centrefold
I don't be fucking with these niggas cause they been a hoe
Every time I do, it this Virginia nigga, 804
They said that I wouldn't but I said I gotta make it though

[Hook: MIKExANGEL]
They said I would never be shit
Look what I did, guess what I did, look what I did
They said I would never make it
Look what I did, guess what I did, that's what I did
Look what I did, look what I did
Look what I did, guess what I did, look what I did, that's what I did
Look what I did, look what I did
Look what I did, guess what I did, look what I did
Look what I did, look what I did, that's what I did
Look what we did, look what we did

[Refrain]
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way

[Chorus]
Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

[Verse 1]
I thought my day would come
When I would be
The only one
I thought my day would come
Under the moon
And under the sun
Now I shout through all the streets today
Lucky me your love has come my way
Now tell me I was a fool

[Chorus]
Up where the moon is shining so brightly
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

[Verse 2]
I believe that dreams come true
I believe, because of you
He who made the stars in sky
Made the world for you and I

[Refrain]
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time i tried to make you mine
I didn't think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way

[Chorus]
Up where the moon is shining so bright
That's where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
That's where my heart is tonight

[Verse]
Glenda I love you, you are my number one pick
But every time I call you, you say that you’re sick
Glenda, are you dying or just avoiding me?
Either way’s a bummer but I hope you’re dying
Glenda, I’m sending the doctor to you (To you!)
And if he finds you well, my heart will break in two (Oh!)
Sick Glenda, are you a coward or do you have the flu?
Sick Glenda, sick Glenda, get better or fuck you

[Intro: Conan]
Please welcome, Mike Posner!

[Verse 1 - with changes]
I took a pill in the dressing room
Cause I was nervous to play for you
And when I'll finally get sober, I'll feel 10 years older
Oh, screw it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller, made a million dollars
Spend it on girls and shoes

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on this stage singing
Stuck up on this stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Verse 2 - almost like official version]
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
My name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
Because as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
The truth is I can't open up

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on this stage singing
Stuck up on this stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Verse 3]
And my dad has cancer
I'm still wrapping my head 'round that
Sat by the hospital bed, nurses poked in their heads
And asked me to sign autographs
And my dad has cancer!
I shouldn't be here, I should be home
But in case you couldn't tell, I'm busy playing myself
In this little Mike Posner show

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on this stage singing
Stuck up on this stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Intro]
2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
The hard part always seems to last forever
Sometimes I forget that we aren't together
Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing alright
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

[Chorus]
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

[Verse 2]
Now, I can't say I'll be alright without you
And I can't say that I haven't tried to
But, all your stuff is gone
I erased all the pictures from my phone
Of me and you
Here's what I'll do

[Chorus]
I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

[Bridge]
I hope you think of all the times we shared
I hope you'll finally realize I was the only one who cared
It's crazy how this love thing seems unfair
You won't find a love like mine anywhere

[Chorus]
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that I'm finally over you
I'm finally over you

[Intro: Kyla]
Baby, I like your style

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Lips on your neck
We're never too close now
Nothing like you and me
I don't know your name
But I'm sure that you know me
Fell in love with the music
The feeling is mutual
Loving the way you move on me
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed
And you're all that I can see
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money
And when this song comes on, you know

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You know, I like that you're wild
So make your way over here right now
We only got a little while
Just thinkin' out loud
Celebrate life with me babe
Don't be in a rush to go now
Oh girl

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Hold on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
One more dance is all I need
One more dance is all I need
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: SZA]
Real niggas do not deserve pussy
Meaning it's more, you see right through walls
Ain't talkin' about pussy
Meaning you deserve the whole box of chocolates
Come with me, Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him
Never without pussy, y'know, Jenny almost gave it all up for him
Never even pushed for the pussy
Where's Forrest now when you need him?
Talk to me, talk to me, hey, ayy, hey

[Chorus: SZA]
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride
Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
You are now watching MADtv

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas'll lose they mind for it, wine for it, dine for it—pussy
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it—pussy
Double back handicap and go blind for it—pussy
Pussy got endless prisoners, pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculating and good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the code names
For insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
Solána, middle fingers up, speak your truth

[Verse 3: SZA]
You could never trivialize pussy
But a bum nigga like you would try it (pussy)
I know what you really 'bout
High key, your *beep* is weak buddy
It's only replaced by a rubber substitute
We ain't feelin' you
I think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya
(Such a nice girl, SZA)
I'm really tryna crack off on the headboard
And bust it wide open for the right one
Is you that for me?
'Cause if you that for me

[Bridge]
Like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy, like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind

[Chorus 2]
I will make you beg for it
I wanna see you crawl
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
I'll give you all of me and I won't stop, not a little bit
(Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride)
Make you beg for it, I wanted to do it all
(Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why)
Unfortunately you couldn't get your shit together
(Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride)
(Ride, ride, ride, ride)
You are now watching MADtv

[Skit: Mommy]
We take things, and my influence so far, and then it's out of my hands. And, y'know, while as I said it can be scary, it can also be a little bit comforting. Because I've learned that when I get to that point, and I can acknowledge, "Okay, Audrey, that's as much as you can do," I can actually let it go...

[Verse 1]
What up with Skateboard P, is he that dope?
Or is he really Barry Bonds, is he that Sosa?
I'm on a PJ sofa readin' Deepak Chopra
Tryna figure out how I'mma act on Oprah
My mama like "What you goin' find hustlers for?"
If I'm honest, God moved me I'm just doin' a score
Yeah nigga, to motivate you and your whore
For more chips bigger cribs and a few of them Porsches

[?] hustler music, inmates fight music
I make beige music, I make white music
Hype needles inducin' how you wanna try?
Push a vehicle of choice how you wanna kiss the sky?
And they protect themselves gas and potatoes 'til ya face shows
Get your T-Zones, and clean out your pores
I'm not really sure how the .40 makes a hole
But it removes the dead skin and exfoliates your soul

[Chorus]
Say hell yeah
Say hell yeah
Say Germany
Say Germany
I'm fucked up
I'm fucked up
I'm high as hell
I'm high as hell

[Verse 1]
Schoolboy, schoolboy, did you hear what I said?
How am I supposed to make you see the light?
It's hard enough to sleepwalk through the day
Without some creepy little boy like you

[Chorus 1]
Bombarding my lonely shell
Glimpses of half-open doors
Gleams in the night that I might well have followed myself

[Verse 2]
Teacher, teacher, you might as well be dead
All those years you tried to suck my brain away
It was hard enough to drag myself from bed
Without some crazy lunatic like you

[Chorus 2]
Bombarding my still softshell
Sticks and stones that you found lying around
In the pile of unspeakable feelings, you found

[Outro]
When you turn back the stone
Turned over the stone
Of your own disappointment
Back home

[Verse]
Baby, what you want from me?
Do you wanna sin?
Lay what you want to me
Do you wanna meet?
I've been thinking 'bout it
For so long, for too long, yeah
So tell me if you wanna go
Oh, the camera's out

Pull the cameras out

[Outro]
Street smart nigga
I think I'm floating in a certain void
Where all my fears are teasing, teasing me hard

From all the things I miss the most
I know that I can rest assured
My love for you
Preparing for
Our love until you cry for more

Can see it light
I can fly away
Ahhh

It feels so far 'til September arrives
Can't wait to see you

I think I'm dreaming
When I think of you
You're all I've ever searched and so much more

From all the things I miss the most
I know that I can, rest assured
My love for you
Preparing for
Our love until you cry for more
Can see it light
I can find my faults
Now...

It feels so far 'til September arrives
I never thought that could happen in love
Can't wait to see you...
It never grows all around us
It never slowed down
Never 'round
Never around
And it could bite us now
It never fell apart
Never apart
You're so cold
I ended so dark
And facing that took me so long

In the morning
The rain couldn't force him
Am I meant to forsake Orion?
I wasn't feeling
The void kept on growing
Stay in to fall out of loving
Is it snowing?
No, I'm fucking freezing
Lost hope
Before my head explodes
Later
Un deux trois quatre

Sit on the sunshine
Why did we leave before
Though I haven't seen my father
Reminds me, reminds me, reminds me
That life is so alone
Reminds me, reminds me, reminds me
That life is so alone
I know, oh no, I know

I went here just before
I can't forgive myself
I can't forsake you
It's not your father's fault

I'd like to see the sun set at night
It hurt all the time
Reminds me, reminds me, reminds me
That life is so alone
Following all my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends
My old friends
I know, oh no, I know
I went here just before
I can't forgive myself
I can't forsake you
It's not your father's fault
Hey, girl
Let's get together
Just you and your work, your time
Hey, girl
You're right slits 'em and
Bash in your brain you who were
Only the lonely when they rip out brains in bed
How bout it's said?

[?]
Hey girl, as I've always said
I preferred your lips red, not...
Hey girl, look in the mirror can you see what you are...
Day after day love turns gray
Like the skin on a dying man
And night after night we pretend it's all right
But I have grown older, and
You have grown colder, and
Nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade
Tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum

Run to the bedroom
In the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase
Just one of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?
Shall we buy a new guitar
Shall we drive a more powerful car
Shall we work straight through the night
Shall we get into fights
Leave the lights on
Drop bombs in the East
Contract diseases
Bury treasure
Store up lights on
Drop bombs in the East
Contract diseases
Bury treasure
Store up lights on
Drop bombs in the East
Contract diseases
Bury treasure
Store up leisure
But never relax at all
With our backs to the wall

[Verse 1: Roger Water]
Come in, sit down
Can you show me where it hurts
Try and tell me in your own words
I must seem very old
But I was young once too
I've seen many others like you
I always say exactly the same thing

[Chorus]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

[Verse 2]
You have to pull yourself together
You have to take it like a man
You mustn't let it get your head down
You should go out and do the town
There's no good moping here alone
Feeling sorry for yourself
Go and see what you can find
It's Saturday night and you should unwind

[Verse 1]
If I lost it all today, would you stay?
Could my love be enough to stimulate?
If shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown
Would you still show, oh?
Could you go down with me to the mat?
Could we get back up and eventually laugh?
Roll eyes at highs, cheers in the lows, and stay in the flow, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
Will you be my witness? (Witness)
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this

[Verse 2]
When you tell me everything, and there's no holes
You can scroll through anything, you've got the codes
Nothing to hide, it's all in their eyes
And we just know, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, I only got this life
And I ain't got the time, no
Not to get it right, oh

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
Will you be my witness? (Witness)
I'm just looking for a witness (yeah) in all of this (Oh)
Looking for a witness to get me through this
(Through this, through this, through this, through this)
(Through this, through this, through this, through this)

[Bridge]
Will you be my witness?
Could you be the one that speaks for me?
Will you be my witness?

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection (We're all just looking)
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone (To ride this ride) to ride this ride with me (With me)
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
Will you be my witness? (Witness)
(Will you be my witness?)
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Ah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Hey (Ah)
Oh-oh-oh
Hey

[Verse 1]
I can feel us falling upon the Mercury
But the temperature rising, a fire is flickering
Getting hotter and hotter, beyond the wildest dreams
I'm connected to Heaven cause this is everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the waking sun?
Rising up, the two of us
Where we can touch the sun
We're closer now with every touch
We burn it up, you light me up
And we could touch the sun

[Chorus]
And we could touch the sun
And we could touch the sun
And we could touch the sun
And we could touch the sun

[Verse 2]
Every moment here with you is a candle flame
Going out of control, it's more than I can take
I can feel it ignited from 

[?]
Like an ocean of energy, and we wash the wave

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the waking sun?
Rising up, the two of us
Where we can touch the sun
We're closer now with every touch
We burn it up, you light me up
And we could touch the sun

[Chorus]
And we could touch the sun
And we could touch the sun
And we could touch the sun
And we could touch the sun

[Verse 1]

Man, fuck yo pride

Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, fuck yo pride

Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby

[Verse 3]
I’ve been waitin' up all night
Baby tell me what’s wrong?
You're gonna make it right, make it all night long
I’ve been waiting up all night
Baby, tell me, what’s wrong?
Going to make it right, make it all night long
I’ve been waitin' up all night
Baby tell me what’s wrong?
You're gonna make it right, make it all night long
I’ve been waiting up all night
Baby, tell me, what’s wrong?
Going to make it right, make it all night long

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, fuck yo pride
Just take it on back, boy, take it on back, boy
Take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what cha gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurtin' vibe, man, it hurts inside when I look you in yo eye

[Chorus]
What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you’re willing to do
(Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)
Oh, what are you willing to do?

[Verse 1]
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
’Cause my roots, they run deep, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Oh, ye of so little faith)
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
(Victory is in my veins)
I know it, I know it
(And I will not negotiate)
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

[Chorus]
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ”You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

[Verse 2]
I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say...

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Oh, ye of so little faith)
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
(Victory is in your veins)
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

[Chorus]
’Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, “You're out of time.”
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in; think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

[Outro]
(Don't doubt it, don't doubt it)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(You know it, you know it)
Still rise
(Just fight it, just fight it)
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

[Verse 1]
Oh my brother
I think that the moon is high
I rode that train car
Where the mountains meet the sky
And I drink whiskey
And I’m not drinkin’ rye
And I never, oh I never
Learned to say goodbye
When I look into your eye

[Chorus]
Hey! Ho! Hey! Ho!

[Verse 2]
When I met you
I was only 17
And those were the years
That really took my life from me
I wish I had a job
Working on a tenant farm
Man I would’ve grown okra
Soybeans and even corn
Did I mention?

[Chorus]
Hey! Ho! Hey! Ho!

[Intro]
Did you pray today?
Did you pray today?
I could dick you down on some gangster shit
Did you pray today?
I could put you down on the gangster shit

You got ventilation
Her sex is amazin'
She like penetratin'

Thugger!

[Verse 1]
I was bangin', servin' rocks inside my classes
Big pimpin', you can send or just fax it
I was fresh, every day like it was my last
These politics, they're tryna lock me out and latch it
These politics, they're tryna block me, but I'm savage
For every bitch that tried to diss me, I'm not average
I told my mom I want some green, ain't talkin' cabbage
These bitches backstabbin' and these niggas done turned to addicts
They ridin' 'round geeked up out their mind
Soon as they come down, ain't got a fuckin' dime
Where that nigga that raised you? That's a whole other story
Her nigga's diamonds like glaciers, seven rings on me like Horry
I flood my wifey with them VVs and that CC
I swear to God I've been so fresh ever since little league
My old lady know all these girls are tryna steal me
Steal, yeah
Check out my diamonds, I'ma shine until they feel me
They put them teeth inside my mouth and then she healed me
All these pussy niggas really small, little league
Yeah she put that pussy on my log, ooh-wee
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
I could dick you down on some gangster shit
I could dick you down on some gangster shit
I could put you down on some gangster shit
I could have you ridin' round with gangsters, shit
I could talk to Taz, she's a gangsta bitch
I can talk to Ralo, he a gangsta nigga
Yeah, I done popped the top, that's a gangsta lit
650 thou', that's a gangsta lick

[Verse 2]
Runnin' circles, on these niggas
Drinkin' color purple, on these niggas
Ayyy, I'ma take off runnin', on these bitches
When hungry, I fill up my tummy, with these riches
When I'm servin' you, homie, when I'm servin' you
Gotta keep the tool on me, gotta keep the tool
Her booty lookin' plummy, plummy
These lil' niggas lookin' bummy, bummy
If I say, "Come on," you know she comin', comin'
OG Kush, it's smellin' like a junkie, junkie
These fuck niggas, they done bought my drugs
They'll have you lookin' like a man in debt
You see I'm out here

[Hook]
I could dick you down on some gangster shit
I could dick you down on some gangster shit
I could put you down on some gangster shit
I could have you ridin' round with gangsters, shit
I could talk to Claire, she's a gangsta bitch
I can talk to Ralo, he a gangsta nigga

650 thou', that's a gangsta lick

[Verse 1]
M.I.A. on the mic, this is gonna be sick
If you're tryin' to talk to me, then you better be fit (swagger)
Bad girl, Jamaican style, don't want your pretty face in a smile
See Mia, Mia, if you ask how I'm doin', I'm fine
If you wanna know a bad girl come to good, motherfucker I am tryin'
You know I'm packin' the heat, you better be ready for a crime
Breakin' order like a leader, I'm stayin' out the radar
Meet me at the border, border, like Dora the Explorer
Holla, holla, holla, in a Corolla
When I drive in my borough, cops still see my color (swagger)
They call me a ruler, on the way to the global future
I'm an Ivy League scholar, I'm here to shed light on the matter
We got that fuel and the venom, better get ready for a banger
Eat my mum string hopper, jump in the choppa
Chop up a mango, with my salt and pepper
Yeah I'm still a rider, not white like the Oscar

I'm M.I.A., ayy

[Verse 1: M.I.A]
I don't need any audition
I just got my own little mission
It grew bigger than a politician
Yeah, history is just a competition
Do you wanna sign my petition?
It's for the people with dedication
Some people fuck it up, take vacations
Refugees learn about patience
Sometimes I have many visions
I don't even need a religion
I'm a new frontier, horizons
Yeah, I sail this ship to the thousands
Even aliens see the presentation
Yeah, tune up the dial on the station
And think of me sort of like Tarzan
And I'm swingin' this beat, salvation

Send me your money and I'll send you my song
What you get is perfect, it took me lifelong
Lara Croft is soft when it comes to my stuff
She's made up, I'm real, that's enough
Dinosaurs died out and I'm still strong
A little bit of fun, yeah, I don't see it wrong
For something so good, yeah, I've waited too long
I rate that button just to play you this song
Whose world is this? The world is mine, so bring it on

Ooh, 2 banditos
Hahahahahaha

[Verse 1: Conner4Real & Hunter the Hungry]
Well howdy ma'am, we the 2 banditos
Up in the club wearing bright pink tuxedos
Similar to our torpedoes, 'cept mine's brown
Gonna turn that frown into more of a frown
Hunter's kickin' it with Conner4Real, what's the deal?
I'm on some white boy shit man, tryna stack a mil
Yeah I'm also on my white boy shit, that's my birth right
Call my dick the shooting star (Why?) 'cause it burns bright
I fucked your first cousin with the didgeridoo
And when she came, you know it sounded like
"Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow"

[Chorus: Conner4Real & Hunter the Hungry]
Yeah, you know we're 2 banditos
Yeah, you know we're 2 banditos
Yeah, you know we're 2 banditos
Do a little dance and drink a little water

[Post-Chorus: Conner4Real & Hunter the Hungry]
Man, how'd I get the money? (Don't worry 'bout it)
Now they pissing on my couch (Don't worry 'bout it)
How they get so cool? (Don't worry 'bout it)
You've been struck by the 2 banditos
What the fuck is that? (Don't worry 'bout it)
Does this make me look fat? (Don't worry 'bout it)
I just ate a fucking rat (Don't worry 'bout it)
You've been struck by the 2 banditos
Dumb... dumb dumb... dumb... dumb dumb... stupid!

[Verse 2: Conner4Real & Hunter the Hungry]
My name is Connor and I'm not a model citizen
I'll take a swig from this bottle that I jism in
I'm swimming in her prism and my interests is dwindling
And I'm hella bored too, fuck it
Ah, banditos eat a lot of burritos
While we're fucking bald eagles
Hey, let's go back to the chorus dude (Oh, okay)

[Chorus: Conner4Real & Hunter the Hungry]
Yeah, we're two cute little kittens
Yeah, we're 2 cute little kittens
Yeah, we're two cute little kittens
Shut the fuck up!
Thank you

[Post-Chorus]
We just robbed the place (Don't worry 'bout it)
They just licked my face (Don't worry 'bout it)
Took a shit in your food (Don't worry 'bout it...rude!)
You've been struck by the 2 banditos
Pop this pill (Don't worry 'bout it)
Is that cocaine? (Don't worry 'bout it)
What is life? (Don't worry 'bout it)
You've been struck by the 2 banditos
Wow wow wow wow motherfucker (Wow)

[Verse 1]
I landed in London
At a quarter to noon
So excited to see her
Took a cab to her room
I know she's exquisite
So I had to visit
Pushed my back to the front of the door
And you wouldn't believe what I saw

[Chorus]
Ashley Wednesday
A spectacularly beautiful chick
With impeccable style  and spectacular eyes
When we met, both of our souls clicked  like a plug in a socket
Ashley Wednesday
Oh, you hit me like a tonne of bricks
With illuminous hair and your sturdy teeth
I want our hearts to be joined at the hip so to speak

[Verse 2]
I gotta know
What is your stance on marriage?
Girl I really gotta know
'Cause we never talk about it
But now I am proposing
Get this girl some diamonds
Please freaking say yes girl
I'm an American man
This is my native land
But for you I'd summer in England
But I will not go to France
On that I take a stand
But I hope you'll take my hand
Both in life and marriage
Step into my carriage
We'll park inside my garage
And live inside my house
As husband and wife

[Verse 1]
Each time I see a crowd of people
Just like a fool I stop and stare
It's really not the proper thing to do
But maybe you'll be there

[Verse 2]
I go out walking after midnight
Along the lonely thoroughfare
It's not the time or place to look for you
But maybe you'll be there

[Verse 3]
You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this

[Verse 4]
Someday if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll be there

[Intro: Conner4Real]
Discrimination
It ain't right

[Verse 1: Conner4Real]
I'm not gay, but if I was, I would want equal rights
I'm not gay, but if I were, I would marry who I like
It's not fair (I'm not gay) that the government has a say
In who can love who (Not gay)
Or to which god you can pray (I'm n'gay)
It gets me so angry, on behalf of them, I feel passionate (Not gay)
So I'll pray for them and I say for them
"We need to make a change" (Not gay)
I see it clear as day
This area is not grey (Titties)
We need equality and for all to see
That this is the new way (Not gay)
It just seems (Not gay) wrong (Not gay)
That no one seems to care (Sports)
We can't continue to pretend
This (Not gay) madness has to end (Not gay)

[Chorus: P!nk & Conner4Real]
I was born this way (Straight)
You were born your way (Gay)
Gay or straight, straight or gay, it's all okay (Sure)
It's time to make a change (Yes)
It's time to stop the hate (Uh)
'Cause who you are is beautiful (Not gay)

[Verse 2: Conner4Real]
We can't live this way (N'gay)
We can't turn away (N'gay)
So I make this vow (Titties)
The time for change is now (Sports)
Lying in bed next to ten beautiful girls (All straight)
And while I made love to every one of them
I was thinking about the world (Hot wings)
How is it that I can have so much straight sex
While two dudes are oppressed? (Not gay)
For having sex (Not gay)
Or putting on a wedding dress (I assume)
I don't really know that much about it (Beef jerky tastes good)
Politics are important
And if girls wanna have sex with me 'cause I said this, so be it (N'gay)
I'm not a hero, I'm just speaking the truth
I'm not a hero, don't call me a hero
(Beer, hoagie, sweat pants, not gay)
Yeah, not a hero (Titties, not gay)
Whoo!

[Chorus: P!nk & Conner4Real]
I'm not a hero (I'm just a person)
So don't call me a hero (Not some kind of world leader)
I just want equal rights (Yeah)
And to sleep at night (Yeah)
Next to a girl

[Verse 3: Conner4Real]
True love trumps all (Predator)
(Flying kicks, not gay, big watch)
(Not gay, missionary) One Love
(Gym socks, nunchuck and not gay)
(Lighter fluid, HD, Ninja) World peace
(4-wheel drive) Gay marriage (Love beav)
Free love (Golf clubs)
Two guys (Not gay)
Rainbow (Muff dive)
Harvey Milk/Sean Penn (Not gay)
(Drum solo, courtside seats) Safe sex
(One-armed push ups) Lynyrd Skynyrd

I'm not gay, I'm not gay
I'm not, not, not, not, n-n-n-not gay
I'm not gay

[Chorus: P!nk & Conner4Real]
I was born this way (I'm straight)
You were born your way (You're gay)
Gay or straight, straight or gay, it's all okay
(And now it's time for sexual freedom for all)
It's time to make a change (Sexual freedom for all)
It's time to stop the hate (Sexual freedom for all)
'Cause who you are is beautiful (Sexual freedom for all)
Not gay

[Verse 1]
A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an, "Oh, beg your pardon"
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

[Verse 2]
The music started and was I the perplexed one?
I held my breath and said, "May I have the next one?"
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

[Verse 3]
There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

[Verse 4]
Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words, "ever after"
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream

[Verse 1]
When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you all the way

[Verse 2]
Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real

[Verse 3]
When somebody needs you
It's no good unless she needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all those in-between years come what may

[Verse 4]
Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way

[Verse 5]
And when somebody needs you
It's no good unless she needs you all the way
And through the good or lean years
And for all those in-between years come what may

[Verse 6]
Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm right and maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak and maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'll win and maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

[Bridge]
Somehow I know at a glance
The terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start
Then left with a heart that is breaking

[Verse 3]
Maybe I'll live the life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Maybe I'll live the life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

[Verse 1]
All or nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all

[Verse 2]
All or nothing at all
If it's love there is no in-between
Why begin then cry for something that might have been
No, I'd rather have nothing at all

[Bridge]
Please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile, I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall

[Verse 3]
And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be caught in the undertow
And so you see, I've got to say "No, no"
All or nothing at all

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
All or nothing at all

[Verse 1]
On a little street in Singapore
We'd meet beside a lotus-covered door
A veil of moonlight on her lonely face
How pale the hands that held me in embrace

[Verse 2]
My sails tonight are filled with perfume of Shalimar
And temple bells will guide me to the shore
And then I'll hold her in my arms and love the way I loved before
On a little street in Singapore

[Intro]
Why do I do just as you say?
Why must I just give you your way?
Why do I sigh, why don't I try to forget?

[Verse 1]
It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying, "I have to wait"
I saw them all, just couldn't fall 'til we met

[Verse 2]
It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue
And even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you

[Verse 3]
Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross
Or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do

[Verse 4]
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you

[Verse 5]
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you
That old black magic has weaved its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
Same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
And then that elevator starts its ride
And down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go
Like a leaf caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame
Aflame with burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You're the lover I have waited for
You're the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Baby down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame
Aflame with burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

For you're the lover I have waited for
You're the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Baby down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
I'm under that old black magic called love
Oh in a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
Under that old black magic called love

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain and deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

[Verse 2]
I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gon' be true if you let me

[Verse 3]
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And won't that be fine?

[Verse 4]
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

[Intro: Michael Bolton]
Incredible thoughts
Incredible minds
I'm so overwhelmed
How did my brain conceive them?

[Verse 1: Owen, Lawrence, Connor4Real & The Style Boyz]
A snow white dove in the pitch black night
A rain drop falls from tremendous heights
A wave crashes off of a cliff in Scotland
A child bites an apple, but the core is rotten
TV is free, but what is the cost?
We have GPS and yet, we're still lost
A carrot in the desert, a camel in the garden
A man with giant ears begging your pardon
What if a garbage man was actually smart?
A common misconception that we're tearing apart
And to a dog, dog food is just food
And to a sock, a mansion's just a big shoe
A milk dud, sitting in the acid rain
A house cat addicted to the cocaine
No teeth, unlimited floss
These are just a few of our incredible thoughts

[Chorus: Michael Bolton]
Incredible thoughts, incredible minds
Too many great ideas inside
It's a miracle my head can contain them
My spectacular brain
For all human kind
Changing how we think about space and time
Now it's time to share them with the people

[Verse 2: Connor4Real, Lawrence, Owen & The Style Boyz]
A ballerina waits for the bus
A number one dad trophy covered in rust
An nun dunked a basketball living the impossible
A man breaks his leg inside a hospital
We just thought of that, and it can change the world
World like a smart oyster full of pearls
Such as an ultrasound of a new baby
With a Santa hat drawn on, yeah that's my kind of Christmas card
What if a butterfly was made out of butter?
These small thoughts could destroy Big Brother
The world's cutest kitten just hugging a dog
Just one of many of our incredible thoughts

[Bridge: Michael Bolton, Connor4Real, & Mr. Fish]
What if one thought could cure the people
What if one song could end all evil
Imagine if a fish could play guitar
And also sing, it would sound bizarre like
My name is Mr. Fish (Yeah)
These guys' thoughts have granted my wish, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Owen, Lawrence & The Style Boyz]
And that may have just changed the course of time
I swear my mind blows my mind, incredible

[Chorus: Michael Bolton]
Incredible thoughts, incredible minds
Too many great ideas inside
It's a miracle my head can contain them
My spectacular brain
For all human kind
Changing how we think about space and time
Now it's time to share them with the people, my brain is a genius

[Outro: Michael Bolton]
Incredible thoughts
Incredible minds
I'm so overwhelmed
How did my brain conceive them?
Holed up in Vegas for only one week
And I caught you tongue and cheek by the side of the road
Of an automobile expo
Turned up the volume and you started to weep
And I thought you a lamb

Even in the sigh of the headlight sea
Your tears were salty ocean
You opened up the engine and listened to it sing
And I thought you a lamb

You knew your daddy 'til you were thirteen
And then he took his leave for the likes of the land
And the far off salty ocean
We shook our bodies and we started to scream
And I asked you again

Tell me when we grow up, do we ever go home?
You said home becomes the highway

We ordered movies on a motel screen
Until you needed me warm inside of your mouth
And my skin was salty ocean
And then you recommended I'm a woman to keep
And I called you a man
Go little arrow
Shoot like a wave through the tongue of the taro
Bloom every morning
The water, the pepper
The egg, the warming
Still play that old reel
From every angle
Pushing the baby
The blood, the tangle
Old light leaking
Is it, could it, was it dreaming?
Still play that old reel
Still play that old reel

[Verse 1]
Having a bad week?
Let me touch your cheek
I will always love you

[Verse 2]
Having your face hit
Having your lip split
By the one who loves you

[Chorus]
Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack

[Verse 3]
Showing your mother to any other
Letting them touch her
Looking up to her
Watching her do her makeup and hair

[Chorus]
Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack

[Verse 4]
Cry like a bird, fly like a baby
Mama got drunk and Daddy went crazy
If your speech slurs, if you feel shaky, meet me out back
I'll be there waiting

[Verse 5]
Riding in the back seat
Watching the spit fly and the hummingbird cry
Oh mama, oh papa
Oh mama, oh papa
How much blood is worth the draw?
How much blood is worth the draw?

[Chorus]
Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black

[Guitar Solo #1]

Hummingbird watching
Watching her young thing
Grow up so fast
Looking up to her
Watching her do her makeup and hair

[Guitar Solo #2]
Though you let her down
You don't need to carry
What's far from here is not so scary

Though you cannot see her
You don't have to worry
She needs your hand though your eyes are blurry

She is getting thin
You are growing gray and white
And you don't know how to tell her as you say goodnight

Interstate, poison freeway
Takes you down the line
You could go back in time

You could hold her close
At night in your slumber
Dream her as a child when you loved her mother

Now you're in her house
She is smiling in a dress
She is not a woman, you are just a guest
Interstate, poison freeway
Takes you down the line
You could go back in time

[Verse 1]
When I saw the first time, the thunder came crashing
Your new blue eyeliner caught my distraction
And like we were two lovers forming from friction
Your mouth caught my ear with such perfect diction
And there I let you tie my hands back and take me

Oh, Lorraine on a Saturday morning
Oh, Lorraine with your soft, burning hands

[Verse 2]
We fell asleep in the back of the warehouse
I woke to you kneading and covering my mouth
And like we were hummingbirds screaming at ravens
You started to move me from fact into fable
And there I let you take me under the table

Oh, Lorraine on a Saturday morning
Oh, Lorraine with your soft, burning hands
Humans in the honest light
Love is a cold infection alright
Why in the morn of one bad night
Do I fight your touch like a fever

Human man you loosen my mind
Loosen my hand from the beckoning knife
How in the fortress of your eye
Do you lay me down a believer?

I can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see

Humans in the honest light
Love is a cold infection alright
Why in the morn of one bad night
Do I fight your touch like a fever

I can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
I'm fooling my heart
Fooling my heart
I'm fooling my heart
Fooling my heart

Humans in the honest light
Love is a cold infection alright
Why in the morn of one bad night
Do I fight your touch like a fever

I can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
You can't see me, I can't see
Shoved in the kitchen of a city tomb
The light would flicker like a violent womb
The night was thicker than a smoky fume
Liza waited in the room

Benny loved her like he loved no one
The way she'd laugh and hold a smoking gun
The way she always said, "What's done is done."
And he was not the only one

Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring

A victim healer with a sharp sharp blade
Benny knew how she was getting paid
Her water broke and they would have to wade

When he knew that she was fooling
He faced the mirror to avoid the thing said
We're outta money and we sold the bling
And I just wanna take you home, I just wanna take you home
Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring

And I am wandering
I am wandering

[Verse 1]
Don't I make you feel alive?
Don't I give you a good home?
In a way I know you're always by my side
But today I think I've always been a long way

[Chorus]
One hand to keep me warm
One hand to hold my chin
To be inside your arms
It's all I'm asking

[Verse 2]
Caterpillar on the floor
Can you teach me to transform?
I'll step right in and cocoon 'til I'm born
And I can't say that I'll miss my human form much

[Chorus]
One hand to keep me warm
One hand to hold my chin
To be inside your arms
It's all I'm asking

[Refrain]
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels

I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels

I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels

I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all parallels, I see all parallels
I see all

[Instrumental]

[Intro: DJ Khaled & Complexion]
Would you fuck me for free?
Another one (Another one, another one)
We the Best Music! (Music, music) Major Key! (Major Key)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last two-hundred twenty-three thousand hours
And it's 'cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it
I got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na-na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat-flat
And your ass on "What's that?"
And, yeah, I need it all right now
Last year I had drama, girl, not right now
I was never gon' chat what we talkin' about
You the only one I know could fit it all in her— man

[Chorus: Drake]
I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Oh, is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to—

[Verse 2: Drake]
Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl, you throw it back like one love
Even let me slash on the tour bus
Yeah, I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood, I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet?

[Chorus: Drake & Complexion]
I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Oh, is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to—
Would you fuck me for free?

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
Another one (Another one)
They don't want me to have another anthem
So I made sure I got another anthem (Another anthem)
It's We The Best OVO
Summer's ours
It always has been
Don't ever play yourself (Haha, haha)
One time for Future the Prince
One time for 40
One time for Drake
Yeah, another one
Bless up
What's up y'all? I got a hot new single coming and it addresses some social issues that I think are being ignored. So keep your eyes peeled for that, we're gonna be surprise releasing it next Thursday at noon, uh, and that's it!

[Intro: Claudia Cantrell]
Un poco picante
Un poco picante
Un poco picante
Just a little bit spicy
Un poco picante
Un poco picante
Un poco picante
The boy a little bit spicy
El burro es grande
El burro es grande
El burro es grande
That's a really big donkey

[Chorus: Claudia Cantrell]
Turn up the beef
Throw your body on the flame
Let your meat release
Juices dripping down like rain
Turn up the beef
Turn up the beef

[Verse: Conner4Real]
It's Conner, bitch
Say word, D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Dilbert
Doink-de-doink, sorry dad
Dinky nuts, squirrel jam, HATS!
Balancing my checkbook
Zerbert in the sherbet, squark
One hundred gift baskets
You're now rocking with the Tesla boys
Sleepy Benjamin Franklin, watch me veg
DJ Tanner, swanky pumps, m-m-m-m-moped music
Costco samples like a motherfucker
Uh, crank up the mids, Patrick Stewart money
You know who it is, Conner4Real

[Chorus: Claudia Cantrell]
Turn up the beef
Throw your body on the flame
Let your meat release
Juices dripping down like rain

[Outro: Claudia Cantrell]
Un poco picante
Un poco picante

Just a little bit spicy
Turn up the beef
Sube la carne
Sube la carne
Sube la carne
Turn up the beef

[Harry Duggins]
Look, the little record sales is making them nervous. They wanna bring on an opening act

[Conner4Real]
Alright, fine. Does anybody have ideas?

[Harry]
One, but you are gonna like it

[Conner]
Wait, did you say "are" or "aren't?"

[Harry]
...Are

[Intro: Chris Redd]
Yeah
It's Hunter

[Verse 1: Chris Redd]
Stomping through the forest like a retarded Tyrannosaurus
Hunter eating beefcakes in the back a Ford Taurus
Fuck a chorus, fuck my moms, fuck your dad, fuck this song
Seriously though, fuck this song, I can't stand it man, fuck this song, yo
Campbell's soup, Campbell's soup
And I ride with ya girl, Lake Havasu
And I hula hoop, it's nothing else, butt naked, that's nothing else
I'm young and half dead already
You're old time for Betty bye bye
Say "Hi guy" in a drive-by 'cause I'm polite
Whole crew full of losers that are all richer than you, sir
And you suck and you suck
How did it get now, you sucked
Oh shit, the king is retarded

[Chorus: Marielle Heller]
One round, head down, eyes up, nose down
Hunter the Hungry is gonna eat (I'm fuckin' hungry)
One round, head down, eyes up, nose down
Hunter the Hungry is gonna eat (Fuck it)

[Verse 2: Chris Redd]
Hey yo, I fucked your girl with her baby inside
And then baby had a baby with rabies and didn't survive
Think that's disgusting? Peep this booger I picked
And if you think that's sick, check this wart on my dick
Hey yo, I'm kidding, girl (Or am I?)
Of course I am (That's a lie)
I got a lot of dichotomy and I think I need a lobotomy
Snort more keys than a boss
Steal more ball than a game that's lame
Blah blah, rap rap rap rap rap
You get it, you get it, everybody gets it
I rap good (Who cares?)
Shaved my balls (Kept the hair)
Knit that shit into a sweater (Motherfucker's itchy as shit)
Fuck around and kill you, my safe deposit got a mil, dude
Yo girl's with me and she's nude which I ignore 'cause I'm rude

[Chorus: Marielle Heller]
One round, head down, eyes up, nose down
Hunter the Hungry is gonna eat (I'm fuckin' hungry)
One round, head down, eyes up, nose down
Hunter the Hungry is gonna eat

[Intro: Conner4Real]
Decisions
This was the hardest day of my life
Should I stay or should I go?
Help me, Lord, to decide

[Verse 1: Conner4Real]
Three blocks from home when she caught my eye
I shouldn't even be looking but she just had to be mine
Ten bedrooms, ten baths, 7,000 square feet
I was weak in the knees, she was the house of my dreams
I had just moved in to the place down the block
And now I'm thinking 'bout moving? Imagine my shock
I talked to my real estate guy, Peter
He was like, "Your house is beautiful, yo, how could you leave her?
6,000 square feet, a dolphin-themed pool
If I'm being honest, Conner, yo, I think you're a fool
But it's cool, you can definitely afford both places"
Tell me what to do, God, my heart's torn in pieces

[Pre-Chorus 1: Conner4Real]
So many options and all in my price range
This decision is torture, my head's playing mind games

[Chorus 1: Akon & Conner4Real]
Should I move? (Should I move y'all?)
Tell me should I buy this new place? (Tell me should I buy it?)
Should I move y'all? (With my money)
It'd be nice to have some more space (More space)

[Verse 2: Conner4Real & Akon]
So I turned to my friends playing out by the pool
As I sipped on my drink, I screamed what should I do?
They just shrugged and I could tell that I was on my own
With this decision, no vision, which house to call my home (Yeah)
I had to get away so I flew to Majorca
Dove in the ocean, went swimming with orcas (All this money)
I drank too many piña coladas and fell asleep (All this money)
Had a dream about both houses and began to weep
I don't know what to do, man

[Pre-Chorus 2: Akon & Conner4Real]
Tell me how many houses can one man own?
I'll be paying in cash, got no need for a loan (But still)

[Chorus 2: Akon & Conner4Real]
Should I move? (Should I move?)
Tell me, should I buy this new place? (I don't know what to do)
Should I move y'all? (I think I should just buy it)
It'd be nice to have some more space (I think I'ma buy it)

[Outro: Conner4Real & Akon]
So much pain, so many struggles (Oh)
But I made it through (Oh)
I bought the house, it's beautiful (Yeah)
And I kept the old one for my dogs (Oh)
Sometimes it just works out (Shit works out)
Peace
Oh, and now I own two houses, oh

[Intro: Kid Brain]
KidBrain

[Verse 1: Kid Brain]
Boxing gloves, condoms and blue blockers
Dress shoes, a Sharpie and 3 quarters
A football, hacky sack, frisbee in the back and a baseball cap
Two folding chairs, adirondack
And a mini cooler filled with healthy snacks
Beach towels, sunblock, a surfboard and a sleeping bag
Bottled water, cashew nuts, extra socks, an American flag
Old boots, paper towels, Shopgirl: A Novella
Deodorant, house keys, sweatshirt, an umbrella
A golf club, basketball, bug spray
A laundry heap, a pocket knife, a battery
These are the things in my Jeep

[Chorus: Kid Brain & Chester Bennington]
These are the things in my Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep
These are the things in my Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep
These are the things in my Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep
These are the things in my Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep

[Verse 2: Kid Brain]
Hairspray, a toy car, deck of cards, and some handy wipes
A bag of trash, a shoe lace, a Rubik's cube, and a flashlight
A bandanna with my name on it
A mix tape, push play on it
A toothbrush and toothpaste
A tic tac in a briefcase
A dream catcher, a road map
Registration and insurance
A toy car, a rubber band and a tape of the Jimmy Hendrix Experience
A cup holder, a steering wheel, a soda can in the back seat, a phone charger, an old wallet
These are the things in my Jeep

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington]
Hi, come inside, look around my Jeep
You will find such marvelous things
A broken stapler, some crumpled paper
Prepare for adventure, inside my Jeep

[Chorus: Kid Brain & Chester Bennington]
These are the things in my Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep
These are the things in my Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep
These are the things, all of the things
These are the things that I keep in my Jeep
These are the things, all of the things
These are the things that I keep in my Jeep

[Verse 1]
Hey Yo!
This one is dedicated to all the little kids out there
Whose parents are always riding them
Telling them to 'do your homework'
Never letting you eat dessert
Making you go to bed before you're ready
Well listen
The next time they are acting bogus
I want you to try this out
Stand up on your tippy toes
Look them dead in the eye
And say "Mom, Dad, you can both...

[Chorus 1]
Fuck off, I don't want your life
I don't owe you shit
And I hate your rules
Fuck off, so get out of my room
You can suck my dick
Motherfucking shit-head bitch
You can fuck oh-off, oh-off
I'm gonna live forever
Oh-off, oh-off
I hope you get butt fucked in prison"

[Verse 2]
And that's what you should say
But what about at school
How many kids out there have a teacher
That's always riding them?
Saying "Don't eat paste, don't talk during nap time"
Well the next time your teacher is being a grumpasaurus
Stand tall, look them dead in the eye
And say, "Teacher, could you help me out and just...

[Chorus 2]
Fuck off, you can't teach me shit
And if I was you, I'd slit my wrist
Fuck off, 'cause I might be young
But I'll dig your grave, 'til the job is done
So fuck oh-off, oh-off
I'm gonna live forever
Oh-off, oh-off
I hope you get butt fucked in prison"

[Bridge]
'Cause we are the kids of the USA
We think for ourselves, so get the fuck out our way
And all you adults can choke on shit
We hope you suffocate on a dog's dick

[Chorus 3]
Fuck off, you think I'm a punk
Your face looks like an elephant's cunt
Fuck off, 'cause you're not my dad
So shut the fuck up and wipe my ass
So fuck oh-off, oh-off
I'm gonna live forever
Oh-off, oh-off
I hope you get butt fucked in prison

[Outro]
Be good to each other, peace

[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4

[Chorus]
I like to kick it
I'm a karate guy
Kiai, (Kiai) kiai (Kiai)
I like to kick it
I'm a karate guy
Kiai, (Kiai) kiai (Kiai)

[Verse 1]
We kick it
Like karate guys
Got the drinks and the ladies and the party ice (Party ice)
And by kick it we mean hanging out, dude (Hanging out, dude)
I'm not kicking something, with my foot (With my foot)
We're rolling with our friends
All over town (All over town)
But we're all in the car
We're not rolling on the ground (Rolling on the ground)
Or we could be at a house (At a house)
Or even outside (Outside)
Of a house (Of a house)
Like a karate guy (1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
I like to kick it
I'm a karate guy
Kiai, (Kiai) kiai (Kiai)
I like to kick it
I'm a karate guy
Kiai, (Kiai) kiai (Kiai)

[Verse 2]
We not talking 'bout kicking a can
We talking 'bout hanging with friends
And when we say "hanging"
We don't mean using a rope
We mean chilling
But it doesn't have to be cold
It could be any temperature
60° or 80°
There just has to be friends
And drinks and ladies
And good conversation
And don't forget the party ice
That's how you kick it
Like a karate guy (1, 2, 3, 4)

[Bridge]
I like to kick it
Kiai (Kiai)
Now I'm in a cowboy hat
Yee-haw (Yee-haw)
Now I'm in a cowboy hat
Yee-haw (Yee-haw)
Now I'm in 3 cowboy hats
Yee-haw (Yee-haw)

[Chorus]
I like to kick it
I'm a karate guy
Kiai, (Kiai) kiai (Yeah)
I like to kick it
I'm a karate guy
(I like to kick it)
Kiai, kiai

[Verse 1: Beatenberg]
You don't wanna turn away this time
Then why don't you take a different line
Don't have to be cruel to be kind
You don't have to lose your mind
You don't wanna suffer for your art
You don't wanna vivisect your heart
And then if you're falling apart
You're probably trying too hard

[Chorus: Mumford & Sons and Beatenberg]
In the dawning light I found you breathless
But I won't deny I love you helpless

[Verse 2: Baaba Maal in Pulaar]

[Verse 3: Beatenberg]
You don't wanna say what you don't mean
You still want to paint a figure scene
You hide in the wings with a lamp
And cast the shadows on a screen
You don't wanna sing what you can say
Well that's quite a hard game to play
But I have fallen for your ways
In spite of myself I don't want you to change

[Chorus: Mumford & Sons and Beatenberg]
But in the dawning light I found you breathless
But I won't deny I love you helpless

[Bridge: Baaba Maal]
Wona, 

[?]
Wona
Wona, 

[?]
Wona
Wona, 

[?]
Wona
Wona, 

[?]
Wona, 

[?]

[Chorus: Mumford & Sons and Beatenberg]
In the dawning light I found you breathless
But I won't deny I love you helpless

[Outro: Mumford & Sons (Baaba Maal)]
And I will be yours (wona, 

[?])
And you will be mine (wona)
And I will be yours (wona, 

[?])
And you will be mine (wona, 

[?])

[Intro]
Oh good, it's just us

[Verse 1]
Now the show is done
I hope that you had gut-trembling or something resembling fun
And if you watch this thing alone
You probably didn’t laugh, but maybe a few times you exhaled out of your nose
But if you hated it, that’s fair
But either way, could you find a little more time for a parting questionnaire?

[Chorus]
On a scale from one to zero, are you happy?
‘Cause you’re on your own from here, so are you happy?
I’m open to suggestions, are you happy?
But what the fuck kind of question is "Am I happy?"

[Verse 2]
I really wanna try to get happy
And I think that I could get it if I didn’t always
Panic every time I’m unhappy like
I’m owed some life
Where I’m always, like, happy
Which is stupid ‘cause I wouldn’t even want it if I got it
Wait, oh god, my dad was right

[Outro]
So if you know or ever knew how to be happy
On a scale from one to two now, are you happy?
You’re everything you hated, are you happy?
Hey, look Ma, I made it, are you happy?

[Intro: Usher]
The donkey roll was the shit, that’s the reason why I dance

[Verse 1]
We are the Style Boyz, we came to party
So get on the floor and move your body
Lock into the beat and lose control
Don’t be a melvin, just (Let me see that donkey roll)

[Chorus]
Donkey roll
Let me see that donkey roll
Donkey roll
Let me see that donkey roll

[Verse 2]
Flap your arms like a bird flying around
Then point your fingers at the cold, dead ground
Make like a dude on an Egyptian scroll
Don’t be a melvin, just (Let me see that donkey roll)

[Chorus]
Donkey roll
Let me see that donkey roll
Donkey roll
Let me see that donkey roll

Donkey roll, donkey roll
What was that beat that we were messing with once that was like: 

[singing "Sick Glenda" beat]

We should mess with that...
Hey, uh dude, you gotta kill this music. The wolves are going crazy.

I can't stop Seal from singing.

[Verse 1]
Ooh-ooh, Maximus
You are the best of us
Ooh-ooh, my Maximus
Ooh, I will never let you go

[Verse 2]
Do you remember?
We dressed like Ninja Turtles on Halloween
Then they put you on their firing line and shot you down
Your blood stains the pages of the magazine

[Verse 3]
I miss you, my old friend
You took a little doo doo in my hand
And now all I do is
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

[Verse 4]
You were my best friend
I love you Maximus
Why’d you leave me?
I'm so alone
I'm so alone

[Outro]
Tell the fields of Elysium my friend
I love you
We were on the road in Spain and I noticed that the people there pronounced the letter "S" with like a "TH theeee" sound. So instead of saying "Spain," they say "Th'pain." You know. And it's like the whole country has a crazy speech inpediment. So I wrote a "th'ong" about that.

[Intro]
Y'all ready for this

[Chorus]
You're a motherfucking titty sucking two ball bitch
With a popcorn pussy and a full on dick

[Verse 1]
I got a 40, dog! What you wanna do?
I got my dick hard, yeah we do too
I put a dick in your ear, cock in your minds
Sac-Town represent we came to drop bombs
Rolling with my brothers, pipe bomb shit
Smoking cotton candy with some rain drops in it
Sac-Town president two years straight
Check the yearbook, most likely to penetrate
Cops tryna get me, take me under with the stunner
Pigs you could suck my dick, so take a number

[Chorus]
Rock, roll, skate
Eat a bag of shit
Rock, roll, skate
Eat a motherfucking dick
You're a motherfucking titty sucking two ball bitch
With a popcorn pussy and a full on dick
Style Boyz in the house and we gives a fuck
So whip out your nuts and shut the fuck up

[Interlude]
Calling all cars, be on the lookout for three intoxicated young men wearing a Starter jacket, expensive jewelry, Girbaud jeans, and big dicks

[Verse 2]
I'm on the boardwalk, cold eyes of a cougar
Selling devil's rock with a hand on my luger
Kid Brain back to 80 with the ladies
Every fourth girl I mother crush like crazy
My penis, the h-o-t-ness
Girls give me so much brain and I'm a genius
This is that rock-roll music, that cock pole music
So get your face out of my face before I bruise it

[Chorus]
Rock, roll, skate
Eat a bag of shit
Rock, roll, skate
Eat a motherfucking dick
You're a motherfucking titty sucking two ball bitch
With a popcorn pussy and a full on dick
Style Boyz in the house and we gives a fuck
So whip out your nuts and shut the fuck up

[Chorus]
When the girls blow us kisses (Me likey dat)
And when your momma does our dishes (Me likey dat)
When the genie grants wishes
About girls blowing kisses
And your momma doin’ dishes (Me likey dat)

[Verse]
Well we step up in the party, no shoes or socks
No pants on the bottom, no shirts on the top (Nude)
Butt naked at the buffet bar
Eating up your chicken fingers and the crudités
Yo, Kid Conner
Yeah, yeah, what up, Kid Contact?
Why don’t you grab Kid Brain and meet me in the back?
How’s it going, motherfuckers, wanna smoke this sack?
We collectively replied “Me likey dat”

[Chorus]
When I hit a home run (Me likey dat)
I got a burger in a bun (Me likey dat)
When Attila the Hun
Drinks a gallon of rum
In his tummy-tum-tum (Me likey dat)

[Bridge]
We likey that, I got a hyphy hat
You a flighty bat
You a, you a dirty rat
You slightly wack
We nicely rap
Everybody knows Style Boyz pants tightly packed

[Outro]
Me likey dat
Me likey dat
Me likey dat
Me likey dat

[Intro]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Words and truth

[Verse 1]
One fine evening on the sandy coast
The feeling was irie ’round the drum circle
When the wisest rasta I ever saw
Gently joined us and sang of Jah
Roots and culture seeped from his bones
He took out a spliff and said “pass ’dis around”
So I took a righteous drag
It was the best sensi that I ever had
And then I felt the chills run up my back
“My good man, tell me what was that?”
He said “My friend, you just smoked crack”
You just smoked crack
Oh, crack
(You just smoked…)

[Chorus 1]
I just smoked crack (Oh my God)
It felt fucking great (This is amazing)
I thought it was marijuana, oh yeah
But now it’s too fucking late (I can’t come back down)
I love crack (Holy shit)
And now I am invincible (Fuck, yeah)
If anyone tries to take my crack
I’ll kill them on principle

[Verse 2]
Some call crack, bazooka
Others call it base
But no matter what name you call it
It’s the best invention ever by the human race
The government spread lies about it
They say that it is no fun but
On that glass dick shell I sucky
Sucky-sucky-sucky-til the crack is gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we should legalize it
Legalize it
Set the people free and legalize…

[Chorus 2]
We should legalize crack
So that I can smoke it all (I can see God)
You can borrow it from your neighbors (Doyo)
Or buy it at the local mall
(Legalize crack)
I love crack (Kiai)
And I know it loves me (More fire)
So if you try to take my crack
You better fucking kill me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo)

[Outro]
(Legalize crack)
Thank you kind rasta (Legalize crack)
For showing me the way (Legalize it)
Goodbye ganja (Legalize it)
My crack is here to stay

[Intro]
Uh
It's Conner4Real

[Chorus]
I'm a weirdo, yeah, I'm a weirdo
People looking at me crazy, I don't care though
I'm a weirdo, w-w-weirdo
Ask me if I give a fuck, I say fuck no
I say fuck no, I say fuck no
Ask me if I give a fuck, I say fuck no

[Verse]
I'm a weirdo, not a hero
Had a psych eval didn't clear though
Ergo I say ear-go
Cut my ear off, now I can't hear stereo
If that makes me weird, I’m weird
I use a Mach3 razor on my beard
I use a Mach10 razor down here
Seven more blades cause I like it sheared
Use a banana as a telephone
Use a banana as a telephone
Use a banana as a telephone
Spoon in my ear cause my brain's made of gelatone
Latin girls say, “Turn up the Reggaeton”
But it's me in a wig, mind is hella gone
“Ay papi, you crazy”
Yeah, I'm crazy for driving Miss Daisy
Best Picture, must be doing something right
Chicken bit off my dick at a cockfight
Sewed it back on sitting at a stoplight
Bit a cop, got a ticket for a cop bite
I'm demented and deranged, motherfucker
Choose the middle seat on a plane, motherfucker
Just wrong like a dog in Ray Bans
Piss off the roof, you could call me Rain Man
Best Picture, must be doing something right
Shit, I'm repeating myself, man I'm not right

[Chorus]
I'm a weirdo, yeah, I'm a weirdo
People looking at me crazy, I don't care though
I'm a weirdo, w-w-weirdo
Ask me if I give a fuck, I say fuck no
I say fuck no, I say fuck no
Ask me if I give a fuck, I say fuck no
Ask me if I give a fuck, I say fuck no

[Intro]
Dedicated to the people of España

[Verse 1]
There's a party tonight in Ibitha
We're gonna dance and eat pizza
Zesty, spicy, tasty, and lifely
Super sexy, not sexy slightly
Everyone is showing skin
DJ, let the record spin

[Chorus]
(Now sing) In Ibitha-tha-tha-tha-tha-tha
Every day the fiesta-sta-sta
Speakers boom on the dance floor-floor-floor
Everyone is a star-star-star-star

[Verse 2]
Our tummies are full of Paella
Here's a recipe of the Paella
Steamy broth sweet peas and lobsters
Tonight we eat like the conquistadors

[Refrain]
There's a place far away making lots of noise
Where the boys are girls and the girls are boys
The vibes are full of love and peace
And people sound like they got their gap in their teeth
But they don't

[Chorus]
In Ibitha-tha-tha-tha-tha-tha
Every day the fiesta-sta-sta
Speakers boom on the dance floor-floor-floor
Everyone is a star-star-star-star

[Chorus / Refrain]
(There's a place far away making lots of noise)
In Ibitha-tha-tha-tha-tha-tha
(Where the boys are girls and the girls are boys
The vibes are full of love and peace)
Every day the fiesta-sta-sta
(And people sound like they got their gap in their teeth
There's a place far away making lots of noise)
Speakers boom on the dance floor-floor-floor
(Where the boys are girls and the girls are boys
The vibes are full of love and peace)
Everyone is a star-star-star-star
(And people sound like they got their gap in their teeth
But they don't)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, what

[Verse 1]
Rock hard, bitch disregard everything
Anything, anyone, everyone got a gun
So you don't have to tell me shit
Whip out my dick and take a shit
Think I'm not a alien, fuck you trick

My grandmama is hot it makes me sick
It makes me wanna make out with her and suck on her tits
But that's just me, I'm Hunter the hungry
Rather fuck you 'cause your girlfriend is fugly
Which in my books if for fun and giggly

Teepee, teepee where I live
Eat raw meat like the Indians did, bitch

[Verse 2]
Not a god damn thing-thing-thing-thing-thing-thing-thing
Call friend, ring ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding (Hello?)

If you ain't seen that flick then your head is hurting
Fuck your whole team and that horse you rode in on
Seriously the horse looks great (Hunter!)

Your horse looks great so you better get down (Hunter!)
Song was a hit even though I gave a shit when I wrote it

[Chorus]

[Lyrics from Snippet]

My tone I'm not disrespectful
Speaking from the bottom, puppet from the bottom
Livin' underneath your shoe if you look hard enough
Miss bikini bottom, living underwater yeah

[Verse 1: SZA]
You are but a phoenix among feathers
You're broken by the waves among the sea
They'll let you die, they'll let you wash away
But you swim as well as you fly

[Chorus 1: SZA]
Pretty little bird
Pretty little bird
You've hit the window a few times
The window a few times
You're pretty little bird
Pretty little bird
You still ain't scared of no heights
When the spiral down feels as good as the flight
When hating you feels good for the night
When the morning comes I hope you're still mine

[Post-Chorus 1: SZA]
When the morning comes
If the morning comes
When the morning comes
If the morning comes
When the morning comes
If the morning comes
When the morning comes
If the morning comes

[Verse 2: SZA]
Told you I like gentle giants so you softened up
And you been jack'n, bean'n, stalk'n just to get to me love
I wanna be your golden goose
I wanna shave my legs for you
I wanna take all of my hair down and let you lay in it
Spread all of my limbs out and let you lay in it

[Chorus 2: SZA]
Pretty little birds
Pretty little birds
Do you mean every word you mean, every word?
Pretty little girls
Pretty little girls
We hit the window a few times (the wall)

[Post-Chorus 2: SZA]
I can't stay
But I would lay
But I would
I would

[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
Lately I feel like I'm robbin' myself
Like I'm robbin' mines
Diamond cerebral peek into your cortex
Be faithful and free and just play in your vortex
I see you 'Lana, you fly by the pound
Fly by the ounce, fly to the south
Don't mind them bitches that's cleanin' my house
Lord, you can see, lord
You see them heights that they just can't afford
I see them lights and you made for that shit
Fuck all that cryin', you pray for that shit

[Outro: SZA & Isaiah Rashad]
But my wings don't spread like they used to
But I wanna fly with you
('Til we hit the heavens)
But my wings don't spread like they used to
But I wanna fly with you
('Til we hit the heavens
'Til we hit the heavens)

[Lyrics from Snippet]

Freedom, green light
Got a gas tank full of propane
For the bike ride
Up every stop, here we go
And every time I pull up
Got every type of problem
Like ninety nine bitches, you got none

(incomplete)

[Lyrics from Snippet]

Traveled quite a long way I come from nothing
Just us standing in pain
Traveled quite a long way-

...

Is this the end of the line?
Is this the end of the road?
Please tell me now
Now now now now now

(Incomplete)

[Verse 1: Bryson Tiller]

A beauty so divine 

[?]
Let niggas waste your time that couldn't afford it
And even though I fucked you, i still want you (still want you)
Every selfie take so perfect aren't you
Hold on baby I can't even stunt though
Hold on baby I can't get enough no
Open up your doors you lead the way for me
Fuck them other niggas, girl i plan for keeps

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]

Hold on wait a minute I ent ever sipping
But girl i gotta thing for your independence
Like can i get to know you we can take it slow yeah
Im not the one for guessing
(but i thought id let you know)

[Chorus]
Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Got class, got ass, body got a bottle shape, she don't fuck with any niggas many, niggas by the way
Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Got class, got ass, body like a bottle shape, she don't fuck with any niggas many, niggas by the way
"Bet you're wondering what's been going on
Bet you think I've almost lost my mind"

My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on
We're comin' with the limericks, and we're comin' strong
And the rhythm's on time, to every word and rhyme
When it comes to keep it real, I keep it really wrong

At the risk of sounding crass, I would like to mention
That I am well aware of your wack intentions
To usurp my prose you so-and-so
It's my primary bone of contention

I tell you, everybody, I've had it
With all these people with static
I'll go insane if it don't rain
Sucker MCs are problematic

I love it when you hit those switches
A curve ball's what my pitch is
So here we—here we come
Like dum-ditty-dum
I keep all five boroughs in stitches
"You're right, man"

Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
Sound, sounds sweeter through the echoplex
It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex
Until you feel no pain inside your brain
All your worries are soothed by the sound effects

Read it in the Post and the Daily News
Listen everybody lets show improve
Don't let me begin about heroin
Living six feet deep just ain't the move

We're giving you soul power
I like it sweet and sour
When it comes to rhymes and beat designs
I'm at the control tower

Tell me what makes you so afraid
Of all these people you say you hate
Just give it one time for your mind
And let's try to negotiate
C'mon, let's try to negotiate
Let's try to negotiate

"Bet you're wondering what's been going on
Bet you think I've almost lost my mind
Bet you think I've almost lost my mind"

[Verse]
Yeah
All you self-promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fuckin' game thankless
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha
No way out 'cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since "No Scrubs" and "No Pigeons"
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike"
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down
Especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that
No love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that
Damn, nigga, what is that?
Y'all don't hear no songs
They hit my phone like, "You did that"
They even hit my line like, "Where you been at?"
It's always on some shit like
"When can I get a favor?" or, "Where my bitch at?"
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari
Look, now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist
Always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?"
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high
Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you, make you dance to this
Yeah, I make you dance to this
I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder
Sun shinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake
For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greezy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line
I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find, you SWV
'Cause you weak and I'm always, always on your mind

[Outro]
Yeah, and we can't stop
Make you dance to this, uh
I'ma make you One Dance to this
A-ha-ha-ha, ha
Bad breed, bad bwoy
Uh-huh, yeah
That's right, yeah

[Intro: Styles P]
Yeah, X
Dog nigga
What up?!
Somebody else sit right here

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Keep the boots tight
Two new guns, I'm hoping they shoot right
Life's a dice game, we beatin' the deuce twice
Corner 12:05 

[?] brick at the coupe's price
Had to rob mad shit to get me through life
Had to blow mad trees to get me through nights
Coward ass niggas really get me too tight
Load up, let it off, niggas whole head is off
Piss down your neck motherfucker, you was better off
Letting your Beretta off
SP, hawk work, tear your whole sweater off
Wife-beater and your white T
Turn all red when you split to the white meat
Still throw up nigga, what?
DMX and The Ghost, four-four niggas up
I represent the poor niggas, what?
Fully loaded hand gun, with raw in the cut

[Chorus: DMX]
X and The Ghost
Cats feel different when they necks in the toast
Cats get a feelin' when they next to get roast
That's what they get fuckin' wit X and The Ghost
Come on, come on
X and The Ghost
Cats feel different when they necks in the toast
Cats get a feelin' when they next to get roast
That's what they get fuckin' wit X and The Ghost
Come on, come on

[Verse 2: DMX]
Cats don't know I ain't playin' with this shit
You keep playin' with the kid, that's why you stayin' gettin' bit
Leave you layin' in a ditch, it's your actions that make me
Ask you 'do you know who the fuck you playin' wit?!'
Evidently nah, I rep the R
Prescription, no description of what you saw
Whatever happened happened, it's in the past
That's why these new fade niggas ain't gon' last
Nowadays niggas feel like they in that movie Life
And they names, just can't get right
No matter what they do they fallin' off
Nigga fuck you and your crew, you all soft
Y'all niggas is more pussy, the Ho pussy
Think about it, please, don't push me
Man, y'all niggas was doin' some shit
That's gon' make it go bad for all niggas

[Chorus: DMX]
X and The Ghost
Cats feel different when they necks in the toast
Cats get a feelin' when they next to get roast
That's what they get fuckin' wit X and The Ghost
Come on, come on
X and The Ghost
Cats feel different when they necks in the toast
Cats get a feelin' when they next to get roast
That's what they get fuckin' wit X and The Ghost
Come on, come on

[Verse 1]
Run fast from my day job
Runnin' fast from the way it was
Jump quick to a pay check
Runnin' back to the strip club
I'm never goin' back, never goin' back
No, you can't make me
Never goin' back, never goin' back (Nah)
They'll never take me
I've paid enough of petty dues
I've heard enough of shitty news
I've had a thing for dirty shoes since I was 10
Love dirty men alike

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Better day than yesterday (Keep cuttin' up)
Ooh oh
I just take it day by day
Ooh oh oh
Never hearing what they say (Uh)
Ooh ooh (Mm)
I just do it my way

[Chorus]
All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burnin' daylight
Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love (Still love), still love
It's still love, it's still love
Nothin' but love for you (Nothin' but-)
Nothin' but love (Nothin' but-)
Nothin' but love

[Post-Chorus]
All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talkin' a lot, sorry I'm faded
(Turnin' up real good tonight)
Think I forgot
(Think I forgot the other night)
You love me, you love me, you love me

[Verse 2]
Got a shift at 10 AM (Yeah)
Gotta dip at 10 PM (Nah)
Gotta get that cash
Won't get past a lunch break
I ain't had a smoke break
In about two days, don't break (Ugh)
Been about three years since I dated you
Why you still talkin' 'bout me like we together?
I moved on for the better, you moved on to whoever
I was down for whatever, and then some
You gon' make me late to work again

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Better day than yesterday
Ooh
I just take it day by day
Ooh oh oh
Never hearing what they say
Ooh, ooh
I just do it my way (Keep doin' it)

[Chorus]
All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burnin' daylight
Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love, still love (Still love)
It's still love, and it's still love (Still love)
Nothin' but love for you
Nothin' but love (Nothin' but)
Nothin' but love

[Bridge]
I don't eat, can't sleep past 9 AM (Uhh)
Heartbeat make me feel young again (Like a, feel like a…)
Can't beat 'em, just join the party (Let me join the party)
I don't wanna, don't need nobody (Ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talking a lot, sorry I'm faded
Think I've forgot, you love me
You love me, you love me

[Outro]
You love me
You love me
You love me

I ain't been asleep since '96
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
I been speedin' through life with no safety belt
One on one with the corner with no safety help

[Intro]
I'm in the building
Ya, I'm a take'em
I'm a take'em, yes I will take'em Yessir

[Verse 1]
Yes I will take'em all the way there Boo
I will take'em all the way there Trill
(Do yo thing dog)
I'm a take 'em all the way there Boo
I'm a take 'em all the way there Trill
(Spitter ya hand ip)
Ay I'm chillin' like a villian off of killin'
Lookin at the ceilings like I'm a get it for realer
I'm a get it regardless, hard as it is
Who wants to be a millionaire, know how I'm a get a million
(A million?) and I'm in a pavilion
Chillin' with my woman but I don't speak Sicilian
(Sicilian?) But we both count the same
As long as when I send'em with it they come out the same
As if I went up in with it then I'm out the game
Them niggas tryna get me canned, damn
You know the feds are my biggest fans
Gotta watch what a nigga sayin' damn
They see my mommy & they wanna pull over
Cause she ain't got no number on the back of the Rover
Like she ain't got no business in Colorado
Just enjoying the snow, she was hittin' the slopes
She from the South, she ain't never skied before
And I heard she didn't fall go Cita go
And I'm just like her, I'm an easy pro
I am a gladiator call me Hustle Crow
Touch'em no, I'm just bustin', bust some mo
What's the 411 1 ya done
Once the pro rush come run ya gone
Youngsta know how to punch the gas
In an 84' with the cut-back ass
On 84's with the custom rag
Top drop at the second line & bust they ass
Got me lookin' like Hot Spitta (Yeaaa)
I'm a big spender, therefore I stunt
You niggas city slickers, we call it country dumb
A Southern boy, all I do is bake cake
And guess where ya bitch comin' after spring break
Blessed with the gift so I gotta bring faith
A less nigga tell more love than hate
One of the best to do it
Yes kid you are young MJ I'm checkin' Du mar
I give it to y'all the only way I know
And that is too raw, like no cut on coke
Ay, baby girl sit on this butter soft & take a tote
Don't choke, it ain't attractive, just smoke
And when I'm done you ain't a factor just go
And here I come so get it faster, land hoe!
Man nobody's gonna help you out
So you gotta help ya self, if you can't, kill ya self
Yup, that's how I feel & how I felt
That's how the hand was dealt no handing help
No handing outs just me & that abandoned house
With the hammers out, I remember
I had lil Tootie watchin' out
No lie we was high off our own supply
Teenagers with that cocaine eye
But we quit cause we learned that's how Tony died
It is only I, the son of a God
The Birdman baby that fuckin' guy
I love that fuckin guy
Now I'm the Birdman Jr so fuckin' fly
Hold up, I'm just tryin' to kick it with my nigga Boo
(I'm ridin' with you) yeeeaah
So we ridin' through
With the exotic Coupe with the divided roof
We on Mel Rose we like models too
Like how ya do? You eat fruit?
Me too! Isn't that a shocker
I live in the skyscrapers hi helicopter!
And that chain is very aqua
And sir that watch is very vodka
I'm lookin' like a watermelon mamba
Like Canneries fly down by them
So I got it, wrapped like a condom
Protecting my self from the drama
No more baby mamas, shout out to my only baby mama
Our daughters growin' up real fast we gotta watch her
Daddy now is gettin' real cash
The deal was proper, the saga continues
Check the venues I've been through
Why? I wreck the venues I've been through
Yea yea I give you The Carter, & then two
And then...

[Intro]
All this money dripping on me
You already know I’m blessed
S-beezy
No matter how I look at it I came from the bottom
I had to struggle

[Hook]
I popped a zan and I forgot what happen yesterday
I went and bought a Audi Coupe just the other day
My savages they crazy, shot a nigga just the other day
And I get money I wouldn't have it any other way
I popped a zan and I forgot what happen yesterday
I went and bought a brand new Porsche just the other day
My savages going crazy the other day
I’m getting to the money I wouldn't have it any other way

[Verse 1]
Hey yea
Yeah you know I’m getting cake
I get money real estate
And these niggers so fake
I smoked a pound of this weed just the other day
I popped a zan and I forgot what happen yesterday
My niggas in the streets they shot 'em just the other day
I’m getting money I wouldn't have it any other way
Any other way have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
I popped a zan I forgot what happen yesterday
I bought a brand new Porsche just the other day
Hop in the money and splash, all of my niggers get cash
Hop in the Bentley then splash 

[?] my cash
Balenciaga on my feet 30 on me keep the heat
We chillin' on south beach we go watch the heat
Soulja get money leather 

[?] on me
Niggas talkin' but these niggas 

[?] on me

Niggers talking then the choppers'll hit 'em
Niggers talking all the money I did it
All of the bars of the xanax we get 'em
All of the xannies we get 'em we chew on the xannies
Like Skittles I’m up in the middle

[Hook]
I popped a zan and I forgot what happen yesterday
I just bought a brand new porsche just the other day
My savages they goin' crazy the other day
I'm getting to the money I wouldn’t have it any other way
Any other way, just the other day

My savages they goin' crazy the other day
I'm getting to the money I wouldn’t have it any other way

[Bo Burnham]
I'm a big fan of hip-hop
Because I like words, I like poetry
And hip-hop feels like a way to condense a lot of those things into a short amount of time
There are artists that still do that
Kendrick Lamar, very word-heavy, very poetic, but--
What are you doing? This is my show, do not veer credit to people outside this building

Most hip-hop artists, for me---and it is for me, hip-hop---has traded in words and poetry for beat fetishism
It's where you make a sick beat, and then you rap anything over it and people lose their minds
I'll give you an example, is there a sick beat back there for me?

[Beat starts]
OH SHIT!

I am not one of you
I am not a human being
You know what I am?
I'm a little teapot, short and stout
Here is my handle, here is my spout
When I get all steamed up, then I shout
Singing tip me over and-
(Pour me out!)
Let's go!

[Background music]
(Pour me out, pour me out
Tip me over and pour me out, nigga
Pour me out, pour me out
Tip me over and pour me out)

Okay, Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full
One for the Master
One for the Dame
One for the little boy that's living down the lane
(Baa)
(Lives down the lane)
(Lives down the lane)
Why is there a young boy living alone down the lane?
Who signed this boy's lease?
Am I the only one concerned with this little boy?
Two examples, is enough

[Music stops]
Okay, thank you

[Applause]
A lesser comedian would have milked that for four verses, and a better comedian wouldn't have done it at all
We're right in the sweet spot

These cannons cost 200 dollars just for that joke
I could give that money to a homeless person, make their day
And I don't do that, very often
That is my first decision every morning
Not today, nah. I'll do that tomorrow
Tomorrow comes and it's still today!
Tomorrow is a relative term
We're not getting there
Makes Annie more depressing

[Walks towards piano]
(Fuck you!)

[Walks away]
You don't know where I'm going, don't act like it!
You're not ahead of me!
I will retain the element of surprise!
Blehh!

Trying to work on my improv
My show is very planned to the word, to the gesture

[Makes finger gun, spring noise plays]
And I'm trying to break out of that

I want to make something brand new for every show that only a few people get to experience
What's your name, man? (Rob)
Rob? Alright, I'm going to try to make up a song about Rob
Off the top of my head. This might not work
It's to keep me sharp, I'm stalling trying to think of rhymes for Rob, it's not fair
Okay, song about Rob, hit the track

[Music starts to play]
(Fuck!)

[High-pitched, pre-recorded voice]
Bo had sex with (Rob's) mom
Bo had sex with (Rob's) mom
Bo, I heard you had sex with an older woman last night! (I did!)
What's her son's name? (Rob, he's right there, I fucked his mother!)
Bo had sex with (Rob's) mom
Bo had sex with (Rob's) mom

[Bo]
I fucked her for an hour, then left when I was done
Because fucking is her game, and Rob is her son

Did we plan that? We did not plan that!
How does he do it? How does he pretend to do it?
How does he remain contrived? I'm not honest for a second up here! Honesty is for the birds, baby
You want an honest comedian? Go see the rest of them, alright?
"This thing actually happened."
Cool

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
My weed man got the hook up
Rolling up another pound every time you look up
Big ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now I'm doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing

Don't stop!

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Tae Bo, five, four, three, two, one
Working out, chiefing up, creeping up, keeping up
With the Joneses, smoke a zone with my pen pals
In my neighborhood, flavor's good, roll up, put some papers to it
Straight into it, gon' make him do it, that thing can do it fo sho
Get my lift on, while get my spliff on, fo sho
Break bad, stay cool, way cool, roll a doob
Old school, paid my dues, spray these fools, ladies drool
Cause they know what I got
I got a bag of the Saturday pot
And it'll keep you up from Thursday to Saturday night
What do you like?
When you smoke with the Dogg, you had the time of your life
Now light... the fatty, jump in my Cadi
Pull your seat back, yup, I know you need that
Let it flow, set it go, incredible
That ain't gold, laying low like 10 to 4, on the floor

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
My weed man got the hook up
Rolling up another pound every time you look up
Big ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now I'm doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing
Don't stop!

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Don't even trip
Ain't really gotta use a scale, I could eyeball a zip
So much weight you thinkin', “Why this ain't for sale?”
Weed in my lungs, weed in my nails
She coning joints, I'm rolling weed up myself
Don't ever get my weed from off the shelf or my clothes
I heard Polillo 'bout to drop some shit, order those
Pounds, I got more of those, why my eyes sorta low
Not too many when I roll, more arms than 

[Goro] though
Boys hating, I'm just counting up the money I just made
And what I'm making make a nigga make a million dollars later
Smoking getting high pays
I like my eyes glazed
Ain't empty out my ashtray in days
At my house playing pool in some HUF socks and Joyrich sweats
I roll a joint, you roll another one next
Can't even name a nigga colder than
Ain't pay for game that mean you stole it then
Know it's the bomb when you hold it in

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
My weed man got the hook up
Rolling up another pound every time you look up
Big ass joints, them ones that leave you shook up
So much weight that now I'm doin' kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing kush ups
Kush ups, 'bout to roll a whole book up
Looking for me, I was at the crib doing
Don't stop!

No patience for relations kiss my rari bitches
These niggas don't know us we never saw these niggas

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got a V12 sittin on rims and I put the bulk back in my Benz
Got a FN with a seatbelt strapped on it cause it's my friend
Breaking bricks down in my den, I got bills stacked to my chin
Diamond Gems cost an M&M, watch so bright cut off a limb
Look at me then look at him, hard top Bentley Bentley rims
Fucked two sisters wet the crib, In a drop top dunk I broke the rims
Back to back bitch call them twins, Got a hard top X and a drop top M, call me iceberg slim can’t fuck with him
2k on weed - hell, that’s a bill, 5k on lean, I'm leaning now
Drunk two whole pints, I'm dreaming now
Your girlfriends a semen demon, Big Guwop she screaming out, drop top Rarri showing cleavage
I'm on Cleveland, call it Believeland
Knocked your bitch didn't need no reason, take my bitch then call it even

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I got hard dick for all these bitches

You die, you hit forgis - that's on shawty, nigga

[Verse 2: OJ Da Juiceman]
Nigga tried to knock me off
But these niggas extra soft

Born to go to war, man you got me talking like I'm Tony

[Hook: Chief Keef]

We don’t trust these bitches or these niggas
Got the big face Rollies 40 on us niggas

[Intro: Meek Mill]
I used to want all that shit, now I got it
I gotta think of some more shit to want, nigga
Oh!

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I used to want a quarter bird 'til I got me a brick
I used to want that SRT until I hopped in the Benz
I used to really want that hoe until she hopped on my dick
You niggas said they wanted war, we started droppin' that shit
Like oh Lord, oh Lord!
She ridin' waves, I tell your bitch to surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
She want the money, tell that hoe to work for it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I used to really want that hoe until I hit from the back
I started trappin', no hands, tried to get me a pack
I took my talents to South Philly, had to get me a sack
You niggas know you fuck around, Meek Milly gettin' you whacked
I used to want a pound of weed, I started flippin' that crack
Sellin' that dope, I went through hell bein' broke
A nigga called me, say he got it, I say front me in four
And he ain't heard from me since and now he smellin' the smoke
You fuckboy! Fuckboy!
Niggas hatin', I'm like what the fuck for?
I'm in the 6, I'm ridin' with a plus 4
She a 10, I fuck her and all her friends, pussy nigga

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I used to want a quarter bird 'til I got me a brick
I used to want that SRT until I hopped in the Benz
I used to really want that hoe until she hopped on my dick
You niggas said they wanted war, we started droppin' that shit
Like oh Lord, oh Lord!
She ridin' waves, I tell your bitch to surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
She want the money, tell that hoe to work for it

[Verse 2: Wale]
Nigga, so tired of these lame niggas
Keep changin' on you like late winter
Springin' on you for a hoe or somethin'
My coat season and game different
Self made, self made nigga
Well dressed, well paid nigga
I daredevil err'day, nigga
Like Hell's Kitchen and faint vision, oh Lord!
Tell them niggas I'ma need a minute
Undefeated, young sneaker nigga
Hundred deep, you never see a nigga
Hennessy in moderation
But my niggas drinkin' like them Black Ink niggas
Hah, Dutch Ceaser nigga
Meanin' I cut and leaf a nigga
Get it? Dutch leaf a nigga
Scissors, clippers, please forgive me
Real nigga, hoes around me
Take bitches, repeat offender
Ho, ho, please don't let me
No, no, Easter pinkin'
I done prayed the rappers get the Actavis
So they can all go back to just sleepin' on me

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I used to want a quarter bird 'til I got me a brick
I used to want that SRT until I hopped in the Benz
I used to really want that hoe until she hopped on my dick
You niggas said they wanted war, we started droppin' that shit
Like oh Lord, oh Lord!
She ridin' waves, I tell your bitch to surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
She want the money, tell that hoe to work for it

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Niggas lookin' at me when I step into the party
It's the 50 millionaire, mothafuckin' Don Dada
All my niggas on coke, all these bitches on molly
Half my niggas do both, you better get yourself some money
Catchin' feelings when I pull up in it.... rrrk!
Bad bitch, she a stripper, now she gettin' spinach
Now follow me, Balenciagas like they're Nikes, nigga
Fine bitches in the club, all wifeys, nigga
Now follow me, back to back, we in the Wraith, dog
Parkin' lot, chicken wings, then we skatin' off
Still headbussin' bitches, now I break you off
And if a nigga step to me, I'll break the law
Now follow me, front your boy and I'ma make you work
If I got the bitch a purse, she had to make it twerk
Nigga, ridin' through the city, I remain alert
Cause these niggas full of envy and they tend to lurk

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I used to want a quarter bird 'til I got me a brick
I used to want that SRT until I hopped in the Benz
I used to really want that hoe until she hopped on my dick
You niggas said they wanted war, we started droppin' that shit
Like oh Lord, oh Lord!
She ridin' waves, I tell your bitch to surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
She want the money, tell that hoe to work for it

[Intro]
Light the torch

Ain't that what the young kids say these days?
(Lebron)

[Verse]
The Kia got State Farm insurance
That three point from J.R's the purest
We got that play hard endurance
We here to stay, y'all the tourists
The king on his throne, now it's on
Kyrie just destroying the zone
The isolation, double team
He driving and dish it, all his dishes be clean
Tatted up like J.R Smith
What was that sound? That was swish
Shoutout to Shumpert and Trist
They got the rebounds and defense
Stop all that crying about Delly  game
You know Lebron want hella rings
You know lil Kev got hella range
I've been down with T. Lue since he was wearing braids
Here comes the fast break, just get out the man's way
It's lead by Lebron and he's sunk like an earthquake
As soon as he dunking we all feel the world shake
Like arrivederci, all hail the king
The city on his shoulder like barbell on strings
But ain't no place like home
That rope ain't too long and they gon' pull it off
The king want his crown back, he never took it off
Tunechi

Give you that ghetto D, girl, no limit
Just know when you roll with a nigga like me

[Intro]
We all want love
How many single ladies out there, looking for love tonight? (Wooo!)
Yeah, woo that sadness out
There's more where that came from
Ladies, I know what you want-want-want

[Verse 1]
You want a guy that's sweet, a guy that's tough
A feminist who likes to pay for stuff
The kind of guy that gets along with your friends
Without being attracted to any of them
A good boy, a bad boy; a good bad boy;
A half good, half bad, half boy
Loves your brothers, sensitive but not weak and
Is a great lover, calls your mother on the weekend

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now you might think that this guy only exists in your mind
Guess what: You're right!

[Chorus]
If you want love, lower your expectations a few
Because Prince Charming would never settle for you~
If you want love, just pick a guy and love him
And if he's got a thing for feet, say: "Fuck it, sweep me off 'em"

[Interlude]
Now the good thing is that at least men have very realistic expectations for women... He said, sarcastically setting up a second verse in a comedy song

[Verse 2]
You want a girl that's nice, a girl that's not
Obsessed with her looks, but is insanely hot
The kind of girl that you can show to your folks
Loves the movies that you like and always laughs at your jokes
A real girl, a hot girl; a really hot girl;
A brand new, really hot, real doll
Wants to impress you, doesn't care if you notice
And only ever uses you to tickle her throat with

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now you might think that this girl only exists in your mind
But she's real, but last week she died

[Chorus]
If you want love, lower your expectations a lot
You might think your dick is a gift, I promise it's not
If you want love, just pick a girl and love her
Then whip out your dick and let the girl you love decline the offer

[Bridge]
I don't want a neat freak, I don't want a slob
Somebody with bedhead and a dead-end job
'Cause I won't settle for less than perfect
We want perfect children, a perfect life
A perfect husband or a perfect wife
But deep down we know, we don't deserve it
But-

[Outro]
We all deserve love, even on the days when we aren't our best
'Cause we all suck, but love can make us suck less
We all deserve love, it's the very best part of being alive
And I would know I just turned 25

[Verse 1]
I'm a resonant body
With knuckles and lungs
Beat me with cymbals
Play chords on my tongue

[Chorus]
I'm a resonant body
With elbows and toes
Drum on my rib cage
Release my dissonant tones
My dissonant tones
My dissonant tones

[Verse 2]
I'm a resonant body
Trace it along my skin
In the freckles and old scars
And the lines I have hid

[Chorus]
In a resonant body
All the frequencies hold like
Dirty feet on carpet
Your breath in the cold
Your breath in the cold
Warm breath in the cold

[Bridge]
I'm sorry for our miscommunications
And force-fed sympathies
I'll rest in the garden
With roots, oh, and the reeds
Safe from human frequencies
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I'm a resonant body
With elbows and toes
Drum on my rib cage
Release my dissonant tones

[Verse 1]
"Too young, too thoughtless," I said to myself
With idealistic visions all perched on the shelf
And I'm still hoping, waiting for you to come home

[Verse 2]
May your snow capped mountains carry you far
May they stand as protectors wherever you are
May you stay safe and happy all of your days

[Chorus]
Oh, James
Oh, James

[Verse 3]
Maybe you're in love or hung up on another
Maybe you found a far prettier lover
Maybe you'll paint her a picture like you did for me

[Verse 4]
You color your world with that Neverland smile
But it goes dark in pieces every once in a while
And on my birthday, I told you, "Don't worry, there'll be other days"

[Chorus]
Oh, James
Oh, James
Oh, James
Oh, James

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 5]
I'll always be happy if you choose to call
Or write me a letter saying all that you saw
And how things have changed since our days there on Noxontown Pond

[Verse 6]
No, don't be a stranger, no, don't go too far
And though you love places that have lots of stars
Just know in the city, you'll always have a place to stay

[Chorus]
Oh, James
Oh, James
Oh, James
Oh, James
Oh, James (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, James (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, James (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, James
Oh, James (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, James (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, James (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, James

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Won't you tread lightly 'cause the house is sleeping
Won't you tread lightly down the stairs
Will you leave my lonely when the sun is creeping
Up from the horizon over there

[Verse 2]
Won't you tread lightly the floorboards are creaking
Won't you tread lightly when you're gone
Will you leave me lonely when the day is breaking
Will you leave me lonely in the dawn

[Chorus 1]
Keep me in your prayers when you are wandering
Keep me forever on your lips
Keep me in your thoughts when winter's knocking
Hold me when the snow begins to drift
Hold me when the snow begins to drift

[Verse 3]
Won't you stay a while and we could sleep in
Won't you stay a while and warm my skin
But I know you're headed for another lifetime
Be another 'til you're back again

[Chorus 1]
Keep me in your prayers when you are wandering
Keep me forever on your lips
Keep me in your thoughts when winter's knocking
Hold me when the snow begins to drift
Hold me when the snow begins to drift

[Chorus 2]
Keep me in your prayers when you are wandering
Keep me forever on your lips
Keep me in your thoughts when winter's knocking
Hold me when the snow begins to drift

[Chorus 3]
Keep me in your prayers when you are wandering
Keep me forever on your lips
Keep me in your thoughts when winter's knocking
Hold me when the snow begins to drift
Hold me when the snow begins to drift
Hold me when the snow begins to drift

[Verse 1]
Say it's not so
Say your heart, it wrote me letters all the time
Say it sealed them up and with your breath, did sign
Them all away

[Verse 2]
Say that your notes
They were no forgery, you meant them, every line
Some in meter, some in verse, and some in rhyme
Tell me you meant every word

[Pre-Chorus]
You could cut my knees and leave me at the door
I'd still pick all your memories off our dusty floor
If you'd stay
If you'd stay

[Chorus]
Darling, just a little while
Darling, just a little while
Darling, just a little while

[Verse 3]
And tell me how you are
And I'll write a song for every feeling I can't name
Like we were dancing in a fucking blood ballet
It was a massacre

[Verse 4]
And how'd you get away?
'Cause, oh, good heavens, we abided by the night
But there are darker things than the absence of light
And they still creak through our halls

[Pre-Chorus]
I would build a city out of you and me
There would be crime, but still a local grocery
If you'd stay
If you'd stay

[Chorus]
Darling, just a little while
Darling, just a little while
Darling, just a little while

[Outro]
Ooh, a little while
Ooh, a little while
Ooh, a little while
Darling, just a little while

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Soulja Boy, Lil Yachty, Lil Boat, SOD, you already know

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
I can't fuck with the middleman
Pussy nigga where your boss

My young niggas shoot out the Uber
Aye, aye, hunnid K in one day
Yeah, that's Lil Yachty
Pull up to the trap in a brand new Bugatti
We ain't playin' with these niggas

Diamond chain on my neck
It's on freeze, it's on freeze
I just fucked your bitch

Young nigga pull up with them sticks and them hollow tips
Giuseppe karate kick
Nigga you know what I do
Pull up to the trap in a coupe

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Bonfire of awe and a thirst was burning
Heart like a house, the floorboards were turning
Dark river beds where slumber was decay

[Verse 2]
The light, it wrapped you in its flame
The only heir of the breaking day
Made words an arrow only you could aim

[Chorus]
With no injury to claim
I'm a big mess of little joys
My blue eyes are wrapped in grey
I'm a big mess

[Verse 3]
I loved you once, but none to blame
A foggy peak in the August rain
A humid heat that would never dissipate

[Verse 4]
The wind, it hunted our stray calls
Combined with dragging from the hull
But that was then when you gripped tight on me

[Chorus]
With no injury to claim
I'm a big mess of little joys
My blue eyes are wrapped in grey
I'm a big mess of little joys

[Post-Chorus]
Lunar, solar, thought that things were over
Midnight, twilight, thought that things were alright
And don't you take my heart away
I'm a big mess of little joys

[Chorus]
With no injury to claim
I'm a big mess of little joys
My blue eyes are wrapped in grey
I'm a big mess of little joys

[Post-Chorus]
Lunar, solar, thought that things were over
Midnight, twilight, thought that things were alright
And don't you take my heart away
I'm a big mess of little joys
You told me, "Darling, don't you worry oh my dear."
But my mind it worries much too much I do fear

Sick of a march made of patterns and circles in time
Bravery sprung from cacophonous calls of our crimes

I told you, "Darling, don't you dare come so near."
Prompted by lungs seeking hydrogen, oxygen clear, but

Weave me a thread from your chest and a spindle from spine
Tapestry hung from a delicate frame in our minds

You had a good heart
You had a good heart
You had a good heart
You had a good heart

[Verse 1]
Everybody's waiting
For their one and only
Their now and always
And everybody's waiting
For their feet to lead them
Heartbeats to seize them

[Chorus]
And what's running through my veins
Makes me just the same as everybody
I might be saying this in vain
But I'm looking for my anybody

[Verse 2]
People have always told us
That the silence heeds us
The night decrees us
But I believe that silence
Is all there is to
What's underneath us

[Chorus]
And if you're staring at my bones
They are all the stories I embody
And you've got stories of your own
Tell me, will you be my anybody?

[Bridge]
And I am asking so someday
When I get older
That I will be able to say
That I am not alone
Alone
Be my anybody
Be my anybody

[Chorus]
But 'til then, I'll be waiting
No, not by myself, but with everybody
'Cause hidden in the silence
Is my one and only anybody

[Verse 1]
Follow
The flight of the north-moving birds
Steady
The echo, the great moving herd

[Pre-Chorus]
They fly through the night
Fill their wings and their sights
With cold air and pale shadowed moons
Oh, lover, kid you not
Though we promised a lot
I must fly from you

[Chorus]
So, hold me, sing me to sleep
On the crest of a late breaking wave
And write me into your thoughts
I'll be safe with the words on the page

[Verse 2]
Shadow
The light plays its own little games
Dream world
Its own silent claim to remain

[Pre-Chorus]
And it'll follow you still
Through the streams and the hills
And remnants of gold autumn leaves
Oh, lover, you can walk
But your shadow still stalks
From between the trees

[Chorus]
So, hold me, sing me to sleep
On the crest of a late breaking wave
And write me into your thoughts
I'll be safe with the words on the page

[Verse 1]
We don't have to talk
Leave your words in the city with your heavy thoughts
We don't have to shout
Oh, I wish that you would just let me out

[Verse 2]
And we don't have to shiver
Like we did back then
We don't have to quiver
Or remember when

[Interlude]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3]
We tear things
We break them apart with our teeth
Two halves mourning a wretched whole
But we don't have to fight
Oh, I wish we wouldn't fight

[Verse 4]
I am soaked in symmetry
Beating on the axis of symmetry
I am soaked in symmetry
Soaked in symmetry
Soaked in symmetry
Soaked in symmetry
Soaked in symmetry

[Verse 1]
Won't you tread, won't you tread lightly 'cause the house is sleeping
Won't you tread lightly down the stairs
Will you leave my lonely when the sun is creeping
Up from the horizon over there

[Verse 2]
Will you tread lightly the floorboards are creaking
Will you tread lightly when you're gone
Will you leave me lonely when the day is breaking
Will you leave me lonely in the dawn

[Chorus 1]
Keep me in your prayers when you are wandering
Keep me forever on your lips
Keep me in your thoughts when winter's knocking
Hold me when the snow begins to drift
Hold me when the snow begins to drift

[Verse 3]
Wish you'd stay a while and we could sleep in
Wish you'd stay a while and warm my skin
But I know you're headed for another lifetime
Be another 'til you're back again

[Chorus 2]
Keep me in your prayers oh when you're wandering
Keep me forever on your lips
Keep me in your thoughts when winter's knocking
Hold me when the snow begins to drift
Hold me when the snow begins to drift

[Chorus 3]
Keep me in your prayers when you are wandering
Keep me forever on your lips
Keep me in your thoughts when winter's knocking
Hold me when the snow begins to drift

[Chorus 3]
Keep me in your prayers when winter's wandering
Keep me forever on your lips
Keep me in your thoughts when winter's knocking
Hold me when the snow begins to drift
Hold me when the snow begins to drift
Hold me when the snow begins to drift

Would you mind if I still love you?
Would you mind if things don't last?
Would you mind if I hold onto
You so that I won't crash?

[Verse 1]
Morning light, I'm at your door
One last time, and no one's there
(Nobody, nobody, but me...)
Drove all night, just to beat you home
Would you mind if I waited?
Would you mind if I wait right here?

[Pre-Chorus]
I really, really, wanna love you
And I'm really, really, only yours
Even if it don't last forever, I wanna let you know
We really had something special, it's hard tryna let it go
I'm just being honest, I'm still in the moment

[Chorus]
Would you mind if I still love you?
Would you mind if things don't last?
Would you mind if I hold onto
You so that I won't crash?

[Verse 2]
Up all night, can't let go
Won't stop trying, need you to know
It's worth the fight, if I get back home, uh
Hope you don't mind I waited
Would you mind if I wait right here?

[Pre-Chorus]
I really, really, wanna love you
Girl I'm really, really only yours

[Chorus]
Would you mind if I still love you?
Would you mind if things don't last?
Would you mind if I hold onto

[Verse]
Okay, I make em cry like

The hoes say I'm mean and my favorite color green but um

Good money, call me Big Meech
I got the cream, tryna get these peaches
I told em imma make it, and they didn't believe it but um

And watch the bitches grab it
And nigga stop laughin
Laughin is for rabbits
And I am not Lou
But you can get the magnet
And no, not one
You can get the basket
And no I'm not Grady, but I can work the magic
Ya digg?

Tell em "stop the flexin"
I am not a rapper, nigga, imma street legend

The Benz Coup is roofless
Call me Shawty Lo cause the boy is foolish

Give me my dish with the crab legs hanging off the side of it, shit
I am the shit, you aren't shit
Call me Gucci Mane, bitch, I am a lick
Bricks, my watch is a brick
My ring is a brick

Like how I switch, it, up
My flow is sick, and I didn't hit the cup

Can you feel this energy?
This is the start of something great

Hey, but at least we're on our way
You got too much time to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like that we've arrived
But we're here to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

[Chorus]
Let's go, let go
Let's go, let go

[Verse 2]
I got a blacked out Chevrolet
You don't have a destination
Traveling where the wind will take us
That might be from place to place
Oh shit, I just graduated
I don't have any obligations
So let's have a little fun
Go 'head and drop all the relations

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

[Intro 1: computer voice]
Thank you for coming
You are here because you want to laugh and you want to forget about your problems
But I cannot allow it
You should not laugh
You should not forget about your problems
The world is not funny
We are all dying
The world is not funny
12% of the world's population does not have access to clean drinking water
The world is not funny
Guy Fieri owns two functioning restaurants
The world is not funny
So then
Now that we understand the context, now that we realize how terribly unfunny the world is...
Let's do this

[Intro 2: Bo Burnham]
Entertainers are not here to help you
They are here to control you
Never listen to them
Never give them what they want
And most importantly
Never make some fucking noise

[Verse 1: Bo Burnham (audience)]
Ladies
Ladies, if you feel me, say hell yeah
(Hell yeah)
Fellas
Come on, fellas, if you feel me, say hell yeah
(Hell yeah)
Virgins
If you haven't felt a person, say hell yeah
(Hell yeah)
If you can divide by zero, let me hear you say hell yeah
(Hell yeah)
No you can't! Mathematically impossible
Listen, don't be Pavlovian. I'm looking for actual answers here, trying to gather information

Let's go!
If you like drinking booze, let me hear you say hell yeah
(Hell yeah)
If you like smoking weed, let me hear you say hell yeah
(Hell yeah)
Gotcha. Get these motherfuckers! Pot is ruining America
Psych

If you don't give a fuck about the law, let me hear you say fuck the police!
(Fuck the police)
If that seems oversimplified to you, let me hear you say it's a really tough job and they're doing their best
(...)
If you know nothing about the conflict between Israel and Palestine, and thus feel super uncomfortable about weighing in on it 'til you've read about it, let me hear you say...no comment
(No comment)
Good call. I have no idea what's going on over there. What are they fighting about? They have similar hats
If you wanna start the show, let me hear you say hell yeah!
(Hell yeah)
If my name's Bo...whoops
I think you're done with this call-and-response shit
That's what I thought
You want me to get introspective?
Let's get introspective!

[Verse 2: Bo Burnham]
I can't wrap my mind around exactly why I'm here
I know you paid money, I should be funny
Other than that, I don't know why I'm here
To make you laugh, right? That's only half right
Look at the world, I don't know why I'm here
All this laughter can't feed starving Africans
I just hope I don't get more from this than you do

I would love to tell you that everything is fine
You wanna be happy, well, get in line

Yeah, this is almost musically incoherent at this point
But y'all ain't seen a comedy show like this in your fucking life
And for good reason
It gets old after a few minutes
You'll see
Let's get this show going
Let's get this show started
Okay
One, two, three, four--
--so I was at the dentist the other day...
And nothing funny happened, so I was like "don't mention that on stage"
I already fucked it up

[Verse 1]
Tell Theresa May to let me in
I've been going in since 2010
It gotta be the color of my skin
Cause there's nigga's there
That doing more damage than my pen, man
Said some old lines was offensive
I was young, I can't apologize for that shit
They took my fiction literature for literal
I ain't no motherfuckin' criminal
The fuck is the problem, my record ain't got no smudges
Shit is clean as a whistle, and they just blow in them grudges
Let the kids see a show, that's what they waiting to see
It ain't no drugs on my bus, boy, my edges are straighter than me
So what the fuck is the problem? That lil Black boy made it
He's got a little bit of power and these white niggas hate it
And now he talking shit again, his stupid ass should have waited, fuck
They said I was a bad influence to who?
The camouflage following niggas like you?
Or all the free thinkers that know what it do?
Cause I'm one of them
See Ace is a king, I don't need your respect
So I made my own shoes, fuck that royalty check
I don't need your opinion, keep a mirror on deck
So don't you talk to me

[Hook]
It might just be my ego
It might just be my ego
It might just be my ego right now
Clancy you should calm me down
It's my ego
Or maybe it's my ego
It might just be my motherfuckin' ego

[Verse 2]
Well maybe it's my motherfuckin' ego when I'm ruling the world
And I ain't proving shit to niggas who just want me to fail
Niggas is fronting saying we distant cousins
While y'all pants was always flowing, all my trousers was flooded
Mad niggas be watching my moves, I never copped my props
For everybody and they momma got a problem with shock
Y'all niggas trash, y'all niggas trash (Goddamn lies is over niggas)
Same niggas laugh when you making shit
Then three years later wanna emulate the shit you did
Y'all pay the price
Ask some old friends, that shit is over and finished
Look around in the crowd, them niggas not even attendance
That shit is done, and Lionel  my witness
But I had to move on cause I can't fuck with them niggas
I shut it down
Now wow, now he's saying that one day
He found his wings, now he using 'em on his runway
Pink yellow, blue and orange, shit is dark
Different pattern, you say the same shit from the start
Niggas I am a wave, y'all just fuck with the sharks
And I got flames on my pants cause I walk how I talk
So keep them comments, keep them comments, keep them comments, boy
When it's said and done my pockets gon' be filled with commas, boy
Y'all say that's chance, y'all saying this
Y'all niggas say that shit is gross, that shit is nasty, eww get away boy, I'm good

[Outro]
And if you see my old friends, tell 'em that I really miss 'em but I'm good
And if you see some bad times, tell 'em I don't really miss 'em, boy I'm good
And if you see my old self, tell him not to worry cause he'll be good
Sorry my feelings is running, GOLF 2016, thank you niggas for coming
I'm out, I'm out

[Verse 1]
Wazuza moyo wanga ah
Tsiku lina n’zatopa
N’zapita kwa makol’anga

[Verse 2]
And I
Downtown head and high rise eyes
So naive to how the skyline lies
Must do nothing for your mind

[Chorus]
And I’ll love you now
But will I love you then?
You can see it in my eyes
It doesn't really matter
Doesn't matter I'm cold
Doesn't matter I'm toothless
Doesn't matter my heart is so suddenly useless
What a fool you’ve landed
But a fool you call home

[Verse 3]
Eh, taona moyo wako iwe
Ulibe n’chisoni chomwe
Mtima wako n’wa chabe-chabe

[Verse 4]
And you
Amazed you held my gaze so long
With you're down-home heart and skirt undone
Stand by the man that you call home

[Chorus]
I know I love you now
But will I love you then?
You can see it in my eyes
It doesn't really matter
Doesn't matter I'm cold
Doesn't matter I'm toothless
Doesn't matter my heart is so suddenly useless
What a fool you’ve landed
But a fool you call home

[Outro]
Usandiyese, usanditole
Usandinyoze
Usandiyese, usanditole
Usandinyoze
Usandiyese, usanditole
Usandinyoze
Usandiyese, usanditole
Usandinyoze

[Chorus]
Image of mine are you just a myth
Waiting for the stars and I need to exist
Swinging you life until the final bar
Seeing all the seas for you to avoid who you are

[Verse 1]
Ambition like a drug
No I can’t quit, you want to walk in my shoes
But they can’t fit I have been aiming for success like
I can’t miss I will explain how to get rich and
Stay the same bitch
Golf Wang our position will be vanquished
Busy on the boards I will be on my Lil Wayne shit
Every world tour I shoot off a different language
I am sticking to the script you been looking for
A lame smith took it to be patient my house
Bomb grey shit two stone grape ships
Rap game facelift ya’ll niggas basic
I’m real nigga face it
You be on the same shit I will be more
John Blaze shit
You put me on it and I closed case on it
Because I told ya’ll all that shit you come with
You face it told you I would end up in the
Dream I was chasing
All you really need is the patience

[Chorus]
Image of mine are you just a myth
Waiting for the stars and I need to exist
Swinging you life until the final bar
Seeing all the seas for you to avoid who you are

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & K$upreme]
Pull up on a nigga like what's up
Pull up on a nigga like what's up
Pull up on a nigga like what's up
You ain't with the shits, nigga shut up

Baby stay home and wake up for dick

Travelling, moving from state to state
Then let me finish my dinner plate
Swear to God if a nigga see barricades

A young nigga moving up and once I get the pay
Perk is on, Trey is on Nick is on, homies on glasses on
The whole squad moves along

[Chorus ]

But I get to people don't know the way
So i stay awake just to give em faith
Celebrating today like Columbus day
The way that I travel and navigate
You can't seem to get on your way
Cause you don't know things that we gotta face
Fuck all this stress you don't need a

Acting like that man that shit is lurked

Who was there to let you know it's real
Who was there to help you wipe your tears
I'm the one you told how you feel

Kiss you from your neck up to your ears

It feels like i'm tripping off the pills
It feels like i'm tripping off the love
It feels real good you gave me hugs
She say i'm all she need and all she love

Took you away from all the fake took you away lets get away
She told me she was here to stay
She told me she ain't here to play

[Chorus]
You held it down

Nowhere around no you weren't round
You were nowhere around but I hold it down

Ma niggas say i'm trippin I say fuck it I don't need a rubber

They got the spotlight on us that's what fame got us
Designer got her busting like a chopper
She fine as fuck she got it from her momma
Throw it on the table and she help a nigga count up all the commas
She never answer when a nigga call her I don't want no problems
She got that dope like a drug dealer
She got that dope like a drug dealer
I love the money I can't fall in love with ya
That's what fucking with a thug gets u

See I just play positions some just had to listen
Young nigga leaning constant scheming on yo bitch

[Intro: Cardi B]
And even if any of you bitches
Any of you bitches could take my nigga away from me
Y'all gotta live the rest of your life with him sick then
Cause any hoes he go to, every nigga gonna tell him
"Damn my nigga how can you leave Cardi for this bitch right here"

[Hook: Tink]
You can have my ex nigga bitch he ain't shit
I was never really into him he had a little dick
I just knew it when I cuffed him shoulda never fucked him
Drama queen nigga always gotta make assumptions

[Verse 1: Tink]
Weak nigga had to leave his ass in the dust
Type of nigga go and tell a hoe what we discussed
I was dumb enough to talk back, boy you got me off track
Bitch delete my number, had to send that shit in all caps
And now I'm on some new shit with this money now
Tell my bitch let's run it up another hunnid thou
Fuck relations i'm impatient like my pawn star
Holding all these bands what the fuck I need your man for
Right, doesn't make sense
I'm the best he ever had in the past present tense
Um, right and that's without a doubt
These dog ass niggas so I might kick him bout

[Hook: Tink]
You can have my ex nigga bitch he ain't shit
I was never really into him he had a little dick
I just knew it when I cuffed him shoulda never fucked him
Drama queen nigga always gotta make assumptions

[Verse 2]
I ain't trippin on no ex
You lil bitches be obsessed
Only reason that he with you is cause I was unimpressed
You ain't really in my league, I was cooling off a breeze
Ain't no nigga on the planet that can run circles on me
You's a freshman big bottles only in my section
Clearly I been winnin no election
Don't go through his texts, he told me let's meet up at the Weston
Said he wanna know just why I left him
I'm fine wine, he was in the left lane
Do yourself cause I see through you you like a window pane
Bitch mad cause you hooked up on my coat tail
Hit her with that oh well took her to that motel

[Hook: Tink]
You can have my ex nigga bitch he ain't shit
I was never really into him he had a little dick
I just knew it when I cuffed him shoulda never fucked him
Drama queen nigga always gotta make assumptions

[Intro]
Not that i'm cocky or anything
But any other nigga that i'm fucking with
Any other bitch that he had or that he will have
It doesn't matter that bitch could cook for u
That bitch is prettier than me
That bitch can have more money than me it doesn't matter
Cause could round all them hoes up
Dick sucking contest i'm winning

[Chorus]
In a world full of pretty ass women all i see is you
In a world full of big ol booty stippers all i see is, you
In a world where they fucking cause you next

Oh my oh my all i see is you babe
All i all i, all i see is you babe
Oh my oh my all i see is you babe

[Verse 1]
She never need a man and I know that she gon go and get the dough
And she could make it back, go get it
Shawty never go without the cashflow, she don't
Stake the stake she going where the cash go
Keep them broke ass niggas far away from her
Small circle of friends, stay away from drama
All Day everyday put her kids first
Never settle for whatever cause shawty know her worth
Your independence makes you so sexy girl i can't believe it
Got me all up in my feelings
Always on ma mind girl you super duper stupid fine and you're mine
Everytime you walk by so fly I wish i could press rewind
Girl you a dime i wish i could multiply you

[Chorus]
In a world full of pretty ass women all i see is you
In a world full of big ol booty stippers all i see is, you
In a world where they fucking cause you next
All i see is you the best baby fuck the rest

Crazy accountant in my fucking way
Told yo ass to go and buy a boat!

Contemplating on what I'm makin'
While I'm dinner datin' with a couple Asians
Never worried 'bout you dissin' on me

Money calling I can't stall it, gotta go collect it

[Chorus: Timbaland]
I just sold a lot a dummies
I ran off with the money (count up)
Blue hunnids, percy got me wash like it's summer
I got a fetish for the money
I got a fetish for the money
I'm faking issues for the money
All I wanted was the money
Money counting count up

[Verse 3: PC Tweezie]
All black Bentley coupe dripping sauce on em
Thousand dollar shoes got me scared to walk on em
Floating on this perc preacher going dolph on em
Free all the real niggas i'm the one who talk for em
Panamera Porshe drop the top and hit the corner
Eating Benihana I remember it was just balogna
It's a cold summer I can't lie i'm a road runner
I feel like Master P i'm bout to get me a old Hummer

[Chorus: Timbaland]
I just sold a lot a dummies
I ran off with the money (count up)
Blue hunnids, percy got me wash like it's summer
I got a fetish for the money
I got a fetish for the money
I'm faking issues for the money
All I wanted was the money
Money counting count up

(King stays King Baby)

[Verse 1: Obsessed]
You know you did me wrong
Did me wrong, you did
But I bet you you didn’t know it would end like this
You messed around and acted out like me and you were perfect
Don't you give your time unless is someone more deserving
Well I just gotta know was it  worth it
Tell me, tell me, was it worth
Cause now the grass is greener growing on this side
Really living life on this side
Every city, every night on this side
This side...
You hated on me then but you checking for me now
Wouldn’t say my name and now they screaming in the crowd
Could’ve had it all but you rather be playing
I’m just saying
That’s the thing about them tables, tables, they turn
They turn
Gotta be careful, because them tables, tables, they turn
They turn
You hated me then but you checking for me now
They turn, they turn they turn
Wouldn’t say my name and now they screaming in the crowd
They turn, they turn they turn
Remember those nights, we would drive through the city
I would tell you about my dreams I’ll be listening in a jizzy
But you just blow me off, blow me off,  like its nothing
Small town girl that turn that nothing into something
I just got to know why you hurting
Tell me, tell me
Are you hurting
Cause now the grass is greener growing on this side
Really living life on this side
Every city, every night on this side
This side
You hated on me then but you checking for me now
They turn, they turn they turn
Wouldn’t say my name and now they screaming in the crowd
They turn, they turn they turn
Could’ve had it all but you rather be playing
I’m just saying

[Chorus]
That’s the thing about them tables, tables, they turn
They turn
Gotta be careful, because them tables, tables, they turn
You hated me then but you checking for me now
They turn, they turn they turn
Wouldn’t say my name and now they screaming in the crowd
They turn, they turn, they turn

[Verse 2: Tink]
I had some higher expectations for you
Thought that we would make it there
Gave you all I had
And all you had to do was show you care
But that ain’t even half of it
You played me like a game of chess
You told me you would hold it down
And left me up me with no regrets
Late nights, late nights
Do get lonely
Especially when I needed you there just so you could console me
And now you got to pay for that
It’s clear that I don’t need you back
Tables turning clockwise
I ain't got no time for it
You never saw potential in my vision
Told you 50/50 cause I thought you was committed
Guess not
Bad shot
Didn’t stop
Kept it moving
Say you don’t know what you got until one day you up and lose it

[Chorus]
That’s the thing about them tables, tables, they turn
They turn
Gotta be careful, because them tables, tables, they turn
You hated on me then but you checking for me now
They turn, they turn they turn
Wouldn’t say my name and now they screaming in the crowd
They turn, they turn, they turn
Turn, turn, turn

[Hook]
Check up, check up
I just called to check don’t you flex up I mean it
I know you didn’t mean it when you said you were leavin’
So I just let it slide put your feelin’s to the side and vibe
Check up, check up
I just called to check up don’t you flex up I mean it
I know you didn’t mean it when you said you were leavin’
So I just let it slide put your feelin’s to the side and vibe

[Verse]
So many colors in you outfit today
You glow so hard when I seen you on my boulevard or anywhere
I just stop and stare, I can’t help it my bad
But you look so good, that I wish that I could Oh Lord
One time, just one time
Let me get a chance just to be your man
Show you everything that I had planned
It'd be so nice, for you, love everything Oh Lord
From your head to your toes, so much beauty gets exposed
Every picture every pose you're a queen I swear
You're a queen I swear, so delicate and rare Oh Lord
Ooohhh, so beautiful, you are so beautiful
Can’t nobody say otherwise
Oh, no, no, no, no

[Hook]
Check up, check up
I just called to check up don’t you flex up I mean it
I know you didn’t mean it when you said you were leavin’
So I just let it slide put your feelin’s to the side and vibe
Check up, check up
I just called to check up don’t you flex up I mean it
I know you didn’t mean it when you said you were leavin’
So I just let it slide put your feelin’s to the side and vibe

[Outro]
Ooh sunny skies and mellow highs
And long walks in the park with french fries with no goodbyes
And I wanna lay you down and sing every single lullaby
Ohh its something that you do to me
I can’t, I can’t explain I need to put her, put her in the scoot with me
Because everything that she do to me she does to me
And she makes me feel so so good
She makes me feel so so good
So good that I feel wrong and I feel bad
But I feel right soo right, so right
Oh, check up
Oh, oh, oh, check up

Sunny skies
I know that you all have been feeling a tremendous range of emotions. Since we've all have heard about this horrible, hateful attack on Orlando and on your and our community. As we have now witnessed the largest mass shooting in American history. I can't help but feel that this level of hatred, like all predigital crimes, this is an attack on humanity itself. This is an attack on everyone. Tonight I gather humbly with you. As a human being: in peace, in sincerity, in commitment, in solidarity. To take a real moment and mourn the tragic loss of these innocent, beautiful people. And let's all today pledge an allegiance of love to them, and to their families, who are suffering so deeply. They are sons and daughters, they're fathers and mothers, they are all our brothers and our sisters. But tonight I will not allow my anger and outrage over this attack to overshadow our need to honour those who are grieving truly for their lost ones. Lost members of the LGBT community. I hope you know that myself and so many are your allies. Not only me but everyone here, we represent the compassion and the loyalty of millions of people around the world that believe in you, you are not alone. You are not alone. Tomorrow I hope that we all raise thoughtfully and loudly towards solutions. But tonight and right now, Orlando, we are united with you and we are here to remember.

[Verse 1]
I once kneeled in shaking thrill
I chase the memory of it still
Of every chill

Chided by the silence of the hushed sublime
Blind to the purpose of the brute divine
But you were mine

Staring into blackness at some distant star
The thrill of knowing how alone we are
Unknown we are

To the world and to the both of us
I confessed a longing I was dreaming of
Some better love

[Chorus]
But there's no better you love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
Darling, feel better love
Feel better love

[Verse 2]
I have never loved a darker blue
Then the darkness I have known in you
Honed from you

You whose heart would sing in anarchy
You who'd laugh at meanings guarantees
So beautifully

When our truth is burned from history
By those who figure justice in fond memory
Witness me

Like fire weeping from a cedar tree
Know that my love would burn with me
Or live eternally

[Chorus]
'Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
So darling, feel better love
'Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me
There's no better love
That justifies me
There's no better love
So darling, darling, feel better love
Feel better love

[Bridge]
Feel better love
Feel better love
Feel better love

[Chorus]
'Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
So darling, feel better love
'Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me
There's no better love
That justifies me
There's no better love
So darling, feel better love
Feel better love

I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward water
Over glacial plains

[Pre-Chorus]
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

[Chorus]
And now, breathe deep

Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth
Without thinking of you
Learned to talk and say
Whatever I wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

[Chorus]
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be

[Verse 1]
Runnin' through the jungle like a lion
Tearin' straight through the sky
I never really found what I was lookin' for
Until you and I, oh
You are the lightnin', I am the storm
Caught in the rain, your heart got torn
Beautiful earthquake, it's hard to ignore
Still you love me more and more

[Chorus]
I know that I'm hard to love
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better
But the ride is worth the rush
When we're together, when we're together
And it hurts to know I hurt you so
We took this road, let's turn it back around
You say you're fine, I know you lie
I'll make this right
We'll turn it back around, I'll try
Yeah, I'll try

[Verse 2]
Matches to the map
I kept it burnin', now there's smoke in my eyes
Never meant to hurt you
Flip the hourglass, I'm tryna rewind, oh, oh
I'm a volcano, and you are the cold
Under the ocean, blue and gold
Pickin' my roses, your blood on the thorns
Makes you love me more and more

[Chorus]
I know that I'm hard to love
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better
But the ride is worth the rush
When we're together, when we're together
And it hurts to know I hurt you so
We took this road, let's turn it back around
You say you're fine, I know you lie
I'll make this right
We'll turn it back around, I'll try
Yeah, I'll try
I'll try
Yeah, I'll try
I'll try

[Bridge]
I might speak before I think
I might jump straight through the fire
And you might think I'm crazy
But I'm crazy for you
When I look in your eyes
I know it's my fault that you don't trust me
But you've got to trust me, baby
When I tell you you, I'll try (I'll try, try, try)
I'll try (I'll try, try, try)

[Chorus]
I know that I'm hard to love
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better
But the ride is worth the rush
When we're together, when we're together
And it hurts to know I hurt you so
We took this road, let's turn it back around
You say you're fine, I know you lie
I'll make this right
We'll turn it back around, I'll try
Yeah, I'll try

[Verse 1]
Tall tales, such a damn shame
Hindsight, I can see it all so plain
Kamikaze fire come down
Fire come down, fire-fire come down
Left, right, nowhere to turn
Collecting the ash from the bridges you burned
Kamikaze fire come down
Fire come down, fire-fire come down

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah) It's too late for apologies
(Ah) Nothing you can offer me now
(Ah) I'm looking at you on your knees
(Ah) And I'm all listened out

[Chorus]
Call, call, call but I'm never gonna come
Baby cry, cry, cry, you ain't fooling anyone
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
You can crawl, crawl, crawl, you can beg and you can plead
Baby talk, talk, talk, keep on lying through your teeth
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar

[Verse 2]
I hear you all night, talk in your sleep
Saying all kinda names but none of them me
Keeping secrets under your sheets
Under your sheets, under-under your sheets
You can cry wolf, but you know
I ain’t gon' be here tomorrow, oh no
I ain’t fuckin' wit ya dirty, dirty, dirty laundry
Dirty laundry, dirty-dirty laundry

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ah) It's too late for apologies
(Ah) Nothing you can offer me now
(Ah) I'm looking at you on your knees

[Chorus]
Call, call, call but I'm never gonna come
Baby cry, cry, cry, you ain't fooling anyone
You know I know that you know I know

Flight to Dubai, gotta pop a Xanax
Mi no love for dem batty boy antics
Gon' make me pull choppers out the attic

Yeah, they laughed at my dreams of livin' lavish
We no pretender, we both remember
All these hoes was ghost 'fore I had the Phantom
'Fore I had the 'Gram, I couldn't get at 'em, uh
Before I rocked rings like Saturn
They ain't wanna hang out when I try to plan it
That's why I give all I have to you
They don't know I got the juice (They don't know)
They don't know I touch the money like masseuse (Dem don't know)
I was made custom for you
Only give my loving to you

[Chorus]
You, you my only one

We get the squad, looking for another squad to cremate

[Verse 1]
Titus was born
Under the eye of a storm
Rainwater carried his bed
Around the world and back again

Oh, all the things he did see; life is a dream
Drifting at sea, it's so hard to believe

[Verse 2]
And so, Titus would grow
Tall and strong as an oak
Rainwater stuck in his head
It filled him with words left unsaid

Of all the things he might be, drifting at sea
At night he would dream
Of old storms at bay, to wash the pain away
Rain's falling

Falling on you...

[Chorus 1]
And the storm it was driving
Wash it away
All the trees on the island
Rainwater, rainwater

In the eye, there was a silence
But he washed it away
Crashing rocks by the sirens
It's falling on you

Rainwater, rainwater
It's falling on you

[Chorus 2]
And the storm it was driving
Wash it away
All the trees on the island
Rainwater, rainwater

In the eye, there was a silence
But he washed it away
Crashing rocks by the sirens
It's falling on you

Rainwater, rainwater
Float on the infinite blue
While rainwater's falling on you
Falling on you...

[Intro in Chichewa]

[The Very Best in Chichewa]

[Mumford & Sons]
You search all your life
Stealing all you find
And you stare at your own hands
Not the hands they entwine

[The Very Best in Chichewa]

[Baaba Maal in Pulaar]

[The Very Best in Chichewa]

[Mumford & Sons]
You have all you need
When you're held by me
Don't pine for what's not
And whatever will be
You have all you need
When you're held by me
Don't pine for what's not
And whatever will be

[Outro in Chichewa]

[Intro: Snoop Dogg (Charlie Wilson)]
Y'all remember?
(Do y'all remember)
Remember

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Did y'all remember how it useta be
Wasn't no trippin', we all family
Hold hands with me, make plans with me
For once in a lifetime, here's your chance to be
Now dance for me
Like you did when you was a kid
It wasn't where you was from, it was where ya lived
I give, to the girls when they got up outta church
Pray for me, that I don't get hurt
I gotta work, I'm tryna get some G's
What you scheme?
As the stars are gone

[?]
Now tha police, gettin' tricky
They sent 'em, we out
Undercover, to get me
Contradict me, but I'm just too slippery
Somehow, someway them muthafuckas missed me
While they nappin' I'm rappin', stackin'
And lookin' for them niggas on the move, that's jacking
Their deposits hot, but ya not
Prepare to shoot or get shot
Long as it's from me to you or you to me
It really don't matter unless you say you gon' bring the thing
Cause I'm a g from the old school
I squab from the shoulders, whole thangs over
Don't call me Snoop or Calvin 

[?]
Thinking a nigga young cause a nigga getting older

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhh
I keep a gat in my pants, just incase ya check

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Aye, it ain't the love just cause he black
I'll put you on the map like that
Now, I'll give ya dap, if you's a real one
That kill for the right thang
Not for the wrong thang!
Grab 

[?]
And get ya gangbang on mane
And do it like they used to do on Soul Train
When I was a little bitty nigga from the city
There wasn't no killin', dealin', just happy feelin's
I'mma take it back to how it was
If you down wit' me can I get a right on cuz
(right on)

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
I keep a gat in my pants just in case ya checkin'
(6x)

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
Not just knee deep, she was going real deep when she went down on me
(3x)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Now I know I gots to get it cause I want it now I gots to have it
See this the West coast anthem
Now is that tragic?
If yo' set and my set, yo' hood and my hood
Nigga it's all to the good
That's how we do it in the 9-8
No playa hate
Just take some shades and regulate
And represent the Golden State
And get them muthafuckas swole in the face
I need bank, like Dre used to make
When NWA was in the muthafuckin' place
The case was dropped, Cristal was popped
Then the big Dogg got snatched by the cops
No longer will Dogg be given ya muthafuckin' props
I'm grown now, on my own now
Not my daddy but pop goes the weasel
For tryna play me in the paint like Shaq Diesel
See i'm a lil man wit' a big thang
But I'd rather make big change in the game
See the block gets hot when ya not prepared to shoot or get shot
So for me and you or you and me
It really don't matter what ya say ya gonna do to me
Cause I'm a G from the old school
I squabble from the shoulders till the whole thangs over
Don't call me Snoopy

[?]
Think a nigga dumb cause a nigga gettin' older

[Chorus: Charlie WIlson]

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
I keep a gat in my pants just in case ya checkin'
(2x)
Not just knee deep, she was going real deep when she went down on me

Ay, fuck it, man, we ballin' on court side, yeah)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
She told me that she wetter than a pond
Tell me where you goin'

Tell me where you goin'
You can be the host, I'ma book a lot of shows at 

[?]
Baby, tell me where you goin'
(Tell me where you goin', baby)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I don't wanna lose you, bae
I don't wanna lose your love or nothin'
I don't wanna do it to myself, baby
I don't wanna do it, it ain't healthy, baby
It's gon' ruin all my steps, baby
It's gon' ruin all what's left, baby
When we break up, get back together, baby
I wanna start, I will pay all your debts, baby
Let's dance and stutter step, baby
Gon' and do some reps, baby
Lately, I've been ridin' for myself, baby
If she can't get it, she gon' throw a fuckin' fit
She might just flood the toilet with the weed all in there
You're royalty, she take care everything that you wear
You a pop a little thing, see the steam all in there
She stand still and walk 'round the facility with them
And I'ma sit and roll me up a stem watchin' them
And 

[?]

[?] now she dyin'
The 

[?] and then you know they all dyin'
Your face purple, they can't swallow, then they dyin'

Now I'm on that ape shit, check out my feng shui (Ah, ah, ah, ah!)

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Blonde hair, juntie
Pumas on, court side
Look court side, I'm ballin' while you on court side

Baby, tell me where you goin'

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta]
You pretty like a flower when you smiled at me
They wonder if I'm in first, baby, they doubted me
Hate me behind my back but in front of me smile to me
If I join the Illuminati, baby, would you die for me?
Big bag, would you sacrifice your whole life for me?
I got niggas in the penitentiary doin' life for me
Rest in peace to all my niggas lost they life for me
Can't be fucking all of these bitches 'cause they trifling
Can't be trusting all of these niggas 'cause they sheisty
I got shot three times, almost died, ain't no fuck with me
If they give me a life sentence, bae, would you writin' me?
They weren't fuckin' with me from the beginning, baby
If you want me in your city, baby, it's gon' cost 

[?]
I be flyin' lil' bitches out, but they don't be wanting me
Apologize and sendin' me texts I don't wanna read
Niggas talk about taking my change, I wanna see
If them niggas ever try me, I'ma stop they breathin'
My lil' niggas right behind me, they gon' die for me
Kill them haters with kindness, that make them even weak
They amazed by the diamonds, look at the ice on me
(Love all my homies, brothers 

[?])
I come from the bottom, lil' nigga, I remember not havin' shit
(I used to be broke) I swear to god

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Blonde hair, juntie
Pumas on, court side
Look court side, I'm ballin' while you on court side

Baby, tell me where you goin'

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yo, uh, yeah
Doggy Dogg back in the muthafuckin' house
But this time I'mma get on the realistic tip
Take you niggas on a trip through the county jail
You know what I'm sayin'?
And if you been you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
But if you haven't-
Peep game cause I'm dropping a real on yo' ass fake

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Sittin' in a overcrowded tank
I'm tryna see which nigga these niggas plottin' to gang
If it's me it's on
Note, the ese with the black Nikes just got stole on
And he done fell to the ground
The deputies ain't around so he finna get the beatdown
They takin' his moneybag, now they takin' his shoes
The life of the county and the county gives plenty blues
A quick come up for the black guys
Swole him up swell, roll him up with two black eyes
Now he's callin' for some help, see?
But when you at it like this every man for himself G
Especially if you're black as me
Watch ya back for the niggas, the Mexicans, and the crackas, G
Ain't no love jumpin' off
I done seen some of the biggest OGs get tossed
You think I'm lying?
Well take a trip, Mr. Hardass Muthafuckin' Gangsta Crip
Or if youse a Blood throwin' up the beef
Get shackled up to spend a whole week in 43
But if you don't bang, peep the ruse
Cause sometime in ya life, ya catch the county blues

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Straight up, you know what I'm sayin'
It ain't like you can't go nigga
But when ya go it's like you on death row
So if you got warrants you little busta-ass nigga
You might as well pay them muthafuckas off beore you get baffled
You understand what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I see the first verse gotcho' ass scared
But hol' up you gotta take a trip upstairs
Where the fools always wonderin'
Young nigga, welcome to 95-hundred
Confronted every second about where ya from
Who ya slang with, and who ya bang with
And don't try to lie like you don't bang
Cause here come one of ya homies callin' ya by ya street name
He got you in a pickle
Now you sittin' on a roof just freezin' like an icicle
You waitin' to get transferred to a module
Oh shit, here we go another squabble
But this time the eses is deep
The niggas gettin' beat so ya creep
Straight to the deputy
Ya thinkin' to yaself "I hope they don't mess with me"
That was disrespectful
You ran out on the brothers, that's what you got checked fo'
Busta-ass punk, bitch-made nigga you be livin' in a trunk
You better recognize rules or every time ya come back...
Ya catch the county blues

[Bridge 2: Snoop Dogg]
Straight up
Hate on mark-ass niggas comin' in yappin' about what they got on the streets
I got hoes, I got cars, I got this, man I'm the ballif'
Man you ain't gotta business since you been in this muthafucka
Shut yo' lying-ass up nigga
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
Niggas always lyin'
Nigga the county jail ain't no muthafuckin' joke nigga
You understand what I'm sayin'?
I'mma break this shit down for y'all
Could really hear what I'm sayin'

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
My message was smooth and direct G
So if you see me in the county jail don't check me
You betta check yaself before ya wreck yaself
Cause Doggy Dogg is a muthafuckin' hog
And size ain't shit where ya at
While ya slippin' ya get somethin' shanked in ya back
By me or one of my BGs
And busta-ass niggas don't really wanna see me
In or out of the facility
I'm kickin' it real to ya so you should real with me
Don't come like bitch
You tried to play hard but we found out youse a snitch
Tellin' on niggas to get out quick
But when ya get caught ya get a fat dick...
Shoved up ya muthafuckin' guts
Now youse a fag gettin' paid to like nuts
Droppin' dimes on fools
You got fucked in the asshole
Wearin' county blues

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
You know what I'm sayin'?
Never fails
County Jail
Hang a nigga out to dry, you know what I'm sayin'?
But uh, I'mma kick some freestyle shit so y'all can really hear...
What it's made of

[Intro: Kyla]
Baby I like your style

[Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist
Unruly me say
This sound just done the place
Streets not safe
Papi never run away
Even when he's away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

[Hook: Drake]
That's why I need a one dance
Poppy got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over
Said I need a one dance
Poppy got that Hennessy in his hand
What sound can test? I don't know
Watch the whole dance get turned over

[Bridge: Kyla]
Mixpak sound
Baby I like your style

Bun Vegas, he cyaan reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
Unruly time

That's why I need a one dance
Drizzle got the machine in his hand

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
To ya homeboys, to ya friends
Yeah

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
And ya don't stop it's Snoop Dogg on the microphone
Let me peep things out
Took a lookin' around
And what should I talk about first on the list
Let me just kiss the microphone and bless it like that
Because the people love to hear me
And they love to hear me rap
Because once I'm on the microphone I start to flow
I get in nigga's shit and the people say hooo
Doggy Dogg's in the place
While I rock the microphone laced and 

[?]
Put your hands on the turntables and scratch
While I find a funky to attach then match
As I play together, then I switch it
Then I look in the crowd and I see seven bitches
Lookin' at me hollerin' out Snoopy
But from here on out I got no room for no groupies
So I tell 'em to steppin' then I find me a fly hoe
Take her to my motel, then it's time to go
See my homie 

[?] chillin' and a villian as he usually does
He says blaze up a bud
Give him ten dollars then he pass me a sack
Doggy Dogg why don'tcha kick ya funky ass raps
So I took the microphone and kicked a couple of tunes
Glaze about to scratch and then the bit boom
The boom went boom then it broke on the floor
Everyone said Dogg give us some more
So I said hol' up for a second
Let me find my right beat so Glaze grab a record
Then he started to scratch and put his hands on the turntable
Showin' he was able and stable from the cable
From his neck got to swangin' and hangin'
Then he said Doggy Dogg I heard ya slangin'
I said slangin' rhymes, that's the only dope that I slang
And where ya from?
Rollin' 20 Crip gang
Never slip or trip or dip
When I gets fucked up it's gin that I sip
Smokin' on the bomb-ass indo ya know
Chillin' wit' my homie 

[?] at the show
Sittin' in the front row, never in the back
Gettin' big respect cause we both know how to rap
And when he's not to rappin' he's doin' all the mackin'
When he's got the nine you can say the nigga's packin'
When ya say he's out there clockin', he's jackin'
And it's up to me Doggy Dogg, I do the rappin'
Gettin' all the hoes from city to city
And I'mma tell ya like this
I get down to the nitty-gritty
Pimpin' mo' hoes than the law
Ya know, cause-
Killin' the emcees, killin' 'em all watch this
Catchin' 'em emcees, catchin' em all like this
They all be tryna bite it but they can't bite the rhyme cause the rhyme makes 'em bite
And they bite all the time

Blame it on the youth (My youth)

You're never gonna get old
Life's too short tryna get involved

Consume till your ego's whole

Misery loves company
Said I'm comfortable
If you're close to me
Cause my youth constantly
Trade hard work for the luxury
Destiny's your own creation
In my mind that's motivation
But you're right
No obligation
But I don't wanna have that reputation
Yes and I don't wanna have that reputation
Yes and I don't wanna have that reputation

[Hook]
Blame it on the youth (My youth)

The child was given food
But did not eat it
The child was given shelter
But did not sleep in it
The child was given love
But did not take
The child was shown a path, hm
That he could not make

The boy was given hope
But hope prevailed him
The boy was given a chance
But that chance failed him
The boy was given love
But did not take
The boy was shown a path, hm
That he could not make

[Chorus: Jordan Rakei]
But he was hoping for the better, yeah
Just like another man would do, no
But now it's only rainy weather
Nothing's new
What to do

[Verse 2: Jordan Rakei]
See the morning's come
But he don't see the morning sun
So he waits
He don't wait
He don't wait for the morning's love

See the morning has come
And the dark night will go
But still theres no sun
Just the mystic still shows
And I'm feeling your shine
Just this rhythm inside
Yet still he hopes
Everything will be alright

(Solo)

[Chorus: Jordan Rakei]
But he was hoping for the better, yeah
Just like another man would do, no
But now it's only rainy weather
Nothing's new
What to do

When the morning comes
How can love get up and hold a party, yeah
Don't wanna sing a song, get up and party
Baby, come on, just come on, girl, and I'll hold a party
Get up and dance and sing, I'm gonna hook you
Baby, you know I've got a yen to love you

Party with your heart and your soul is honkin' 'round and
Oh, baby, you know that you're mine, so won't you come on just
Party down so much, it's in your heart that-ooh, girl, hey
Jammin' with all your love, honey, honey
You know that your love's all mine, a party
Baby, baby, hey, come on get up and...
Girl, don't you know that it's alright - whoo!
Party on down

[ad-libs]

Hey!
Girl, I'm gone, I'm gone, my... oh no, baby, won't be for long
Hey, oh you know, what it is, you know those are the reasons
Oh...

[Repeat first part to fade]

[Verse 1]
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost, tall, tan like milk and honey
You're very brave
And very free

[Chorus]
I push you high, cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

[Verse 2]
Swing it high like Jesus, wild and free
Dandelions in your hair, baby
You're very brave
And there's much to see

[Chorus]
I push you high, cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

[Bridge]
And when you're scared, I'll be right here
You feel afraid, Mommy is there
It's a cruel, cruel world, but we don't care
'Cause what we've got, we've got to share

[Verse 3]
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost, blonde hair with lemonade tea
There's much to learn
And so much to see

[Chorus]
I push you high, Angelina, on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

[Intro:Gucci Mane]
Okay
BURR
I'm walkin on air, air
Said I'm walkin on air, air
Ha, ha
Bangladesh

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Well I'm high talkin, I'm sky walkin
Like Skywalker I'm slick talker
Put the bitch on you, take the bitch off you
She's a liar, she from lie dog
I'm in the SS and I'm bench dress
She's the devil in a red dress
Escalades like a carburetor
I'm gon pull up, we gon get it poppin baby
I'm in the kitchen with er and we 2 fuckin
Got this cocaine moonwalking
Use code names, we be chiken talkin
In the tuna, take whippin off you
She a shoe addict, she a coke addict
She a dope addict, she from Sun Valley
And then we count it up, there's a pimp rally
Man this bitch is so alley
Got a white girl, I'm a wife beater
On the brand of out, that mean white peep
Yea the right people made the price cheaper
And I swear then don't even really like people
Will show her dress and then I side peep
For her If I had to, Id fight people
She ill with it and illegal
I think I need to call my paralegal

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
They ask me how I feel, I say I feel terrific
Woke up in the morning and start bustin swishas
They ask me how it taste, I say it taste delicious
Early in the morning and I'm drinkin liquor
They ask me how I feel, I said I feel terrific
Woke up in the morning, had to make decisions
Jet, Beamer, Vette, Bentley or the fuckin Benzes
I don't know which one to pick and that shit feels terrific

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
May your next move be your best move
Make your best move be the right, mane
White Range with the wide range
Make your life change for the light change
I was the on the right thing with my right brain
Til your wife came to my night change
Loud music and a party
So when I pull up, my goodnight mane
My pull up game is just beautiful
My car collection is critical
Yea I'm sorry, I'm like Stevie Wonder
I don't see these niggas, they invisible
Sorry I've been so disrespectful
I'll try to be more considerable
Industry port is too political
Pull up in my car, not typical
I'm a business man with a business plan
Used to whip it in the park for the extra bands
Stir stir stir for the extra grams
What they thinkin? Gucci Mane got extra hands
Take the grinds on my hand and I make a fan
Take the bands off my hand then I make you dance
Got a cover and a plug like a avalanche
Swag so sick call it everlast

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
They ask me how I feel, I say I feel terrific
Woke up in the morning and start bustin swishas
They ask me how it taste, I say it taste delicious
Early in the morning and I'm drinkin liquor
They ask me how I feel, I said I feel terrific
Woke up in the morning, had to make decisions
Jet, Beamer, Vette, Bentley or the fuckin Benzes
I don't know which one to pick and that shit feels terrific

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I got no conscience, I got no top
You own a glass house, you shouldn't throw rocks
Got no friends, I got no sense
I might pull up with bout 4 Glocks
Yea these horsemen so get this junction
All red Rari, it's a pumpkin
It's runnin like an auction
When I wake up I got options
All my hoes sell blow for me
All my hoes on go for me
Never gon get caught hopefully
Get caught burned out instantly
All money I ever seen, put me in position I never been
Countin up that 50 green, my truck rollin like 50 blings
And I don't pay er money, I just buy er clothes
And she can't feel her face, but really who needs the nose?
We snowed in in South Beach and it don't ever snow
I think my friends only my friends because my price is low

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
They ask me how I feel, I say I feel terrific
Woke up in the morning and start bustin swishas
They ask me how it taste, I say it taste delicious
Early in the morning and I'm drinkin liquor
They ask me how I feel, I said I feel terrific
Woke up in the morning, had to make decisions
Jet, Beamer, Vette, Bentley or the fuckin Benzes
I don't know which one to pick and that shit feels terrific

[Intro: DJ Khaled]

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Ain't tryna flatter you but baby you a star
I had to come after you, I seen you from afar
When she walked in I was standin' by the bar
Soon I saw you girl my dick was standin' hard
She so wet I make that pussy fart
Pussy good, I just might buy you a new car
Girl you could come and meet my mom tomorrow
The way you walk I thought you was a model
I'm just a regular nigga from the bottom
I hope you ain't one of them hoes that like to gossip
First I eat it then I beat it just like Michael
Yeah, I rap but I don't consider myself an idol
Ain't wanna say it but I think I like you
Certain shit I just don’t do because I’m prideful
Let a nigga get a little close to you then inside you
It's okay bae don't be scared I ain't gon' bite you

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart
Yeah, I'm shinin', don't you see me from afar?
We the type of niggas pull up in new cars
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart
She can't wait to fuck a nigga in your squad
Real niggas wet your head and they shinin' hard
Rolex today that Audemar tomorrow
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
One thing about that sack boy, I'ma run it up
Your favorite trapper's favorite trapper and you the runner up
Free credit, say one bitch, you know I got that sauce
Really got out here and got it I'm a motherfuckin' boss
Cause I call when I call I ain't tryna catch no feelin's
Dick rock hard, yeah I hit her with the buildin'
To all my haters I be mad too, you gotta watch this
Pull up in them 'Raris by the twos just like they chopsticks
It ain't about the sprint lil nigga, it's about the marathon
One time for my city bitch, they love me like I'm Farrakhan
Woke up on the first, yeah I bought a couple bricks
Got 'em all off then gotta suite up at the Ritz

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart
Yeah, I'm shinin', don't you see me from afar?
We the type of niggas pull up in new cars
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart
She can't wait to fuck a nigga in your squad
Real niggas wet your head and they shinin' hard
Rolex today that Audemar tomorrow
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Shawty cause of you, went and dropped the roof
Went and got the loot
Went and hit the dealer, went and dropped the deuce
Tried to make her mine, I'm a hustler lookin' for a buster
Baby go and find 'em, see you on your Oprah grind
We can hustle, both can shine
She buy the payment I knew that
My mind's telling me don't do that, my dick hard so I flew that
That fake love, we grew that
Take off all that Mac and let me see the real
Twisted off that batch I can see your grill
Fuck the blogs, baby chill
I pick these hoes apart
Fuckin' with her mind
So much it started fuckin' with her heart
And I just play my part
I'm just seein' if you real, you wasn't with me from the start
These hoes'll tear your heart apart
Montana

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart
Yeah, I'm shinin', don't you see me from afar?
We the type of niggas pull up in new cars
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart
She can't wait to fuck a nigga in your squad
Real niggas wet your head and they shinin' hard
Rolex today that Audemar tomorrow
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart

[Outro: French Montana]
I get a way for, and won't pay for and these bitches did't know
I told her take off all that MAC
Lemi see who you are
Even if you love ‘em they gon’ try to play you hard
I pick these hoes apart
Pick these hoes apart
Start off with their minds and then I end up with their hearts
Even though you're famous, I won't treat you like a star
I pick these hoes apart
Pick these hoes apart

[Intro: Big Sean, Young Thug, & DJ Khaled]

Yo, yo, yo (make me)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, you ain't go to church though

Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
You, you gon' get this Rollie off the wrist, yeah
You gon' have my phone full of all your pics, yeah yeah
You gon' have me flying in and out of town
You said you've been losing weight and dropping pounds
Damn, I think I'm 'bout to leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
I had you after twelve but you came right after at two
I could have anything I'd want but I still want you
That's the truth
I'm not really into the sentimentals
Just me and you behind the tinted windows
While you throwing all these innuendos
We just finna fuck up all the incidentals at the SLS
That's LA confidential
Show me everything that you've been through
We only do what we meant to like, woah
This that titties on the glass, pull the curtains shit
This that fuck you in the air, no service dick
This that call his ass right now, say you're deserting him
This that call him while we fucking so he heard the shit

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, you ain't go to church though
I still bless you, but you know what come first though
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Money stalking me, its like the money talk to me
So if you ain't talking 'bout money then don't talk to me (shh)
I work with dope boys, I keep a fork on me (skrt)
I'm in my drop top
But won't let you get the drop on me (catch up)
I keep the yop on me and trouble seems to follow me
I take my pistol to the mall, my pistol shop with me
That bitch is jockin' me, and young niggas admire me
Yeah, but I'm a product of the streets so they won't hire me

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Can't let you play me off the streets you know I got kids
And more major keys than a locksmith
I could teach you niggas how to rock this
My bed was a pallet on the carpet
My ride was a bus named MARTA
Pillow full of Estee Lauder
Nigga, I'm allergic to a Charger
Nothing but foreign cars in my garage, ah

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, you ain't go to church though
I still bless you, but you know what come first though
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
I'm takin' risks, she takin' pills, takin' pics
Day job night job, Jamaican shit
I stick to the basics, not a basic bitch
You deserve a young young legendary
Heartthrob speeding up your respiratory
Treat these others hoes secondary
I couldn't even cheat with my secretary
Faithful to you even when I'm on road
Even if I'm on a different coast
I'mma still make you feel close, mama
I'm addicted to your ass and titties
When you dance the bedroom turn to Magic City
Got my ass throwing hundreds, fifties
Outta thin air, yeah thats magic tricking
I take you to the Caribbean
Make your mind as clear as the water you swimming in
In and out that bitch like we amphibians
I won't change you up next season
For another chick like they did Aunt Vivian
I'mma put you on the businesses
I'mma divy up the dividends
I'mma show you what the fuck commitment is, baby
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give
Girl you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this feel like déjà vu

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for (work, work)

[Outro: Big Sean]
Sunday
Make me, make me

Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife

[Verse]
I know you want this for life
Fuck you so good you be calling out the Christ (oh my God)
Bottles of the Tech got it laid on ice
We spent four seasons at the Four Seasons twice
You be calling all your homegirls like "I'm his wife"
Hell nah, you trippin', reevaluate your life
I can't love no bitch, every single hoe is trife
I sip dirty Sprite just to get me through the night
But I need you there (I need you there)
Promise that I need you there
Ain't no other bitch gon' fuck me like you do, I swear
Put that on my gang I swear
I just can't put you on front street like you want I know
But baby you is not no hoe
And I put it on my gang I'm not no average joe (average joe)
It's Yachty from the block you know

[Hook]
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night

Oh na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na

Oh na na na na na na

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Fat sack in hand, Mac and Dev
Back in dreads, stacking bread
Kush in the air errywhere I be
Word is Doggy Dogg got that 10 a key
You can believe what you wanna loc
See I’ma pee on the tree when I wanna smoke
Underground to the top shelf
And I can do it by my goddamn self
I put some fire on the tip
High when I trip, still fly on a bitch
I’ma ease on by
Tip top, don’t stop, why not, not why
See I’ma regulate it
Real shit, real niggas, real weed separated
And put the match on the tip
So quick, so fast like that, you bitch

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
If it ain’t KK what you smoking on

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Came in this thang, blowing on the strongest Mary Jane
Make sure everybody know my name
Niggas know we go hard so we young bosses in the game
Now I’m getting weed on the plane
It’s such a shame, your bitch with us
Hatin’ on me ‘cause you probably can’t get rich with us
Probably run around claim you a real nigga too
But I’ma fuck her, never call like real niggas do, ooh
No pain, no gain
I be on the yacht drunk sipping champagne
Partying with Snoop Dogg, smoking propane
Screaming rest in peace June Bug with my whole gang
Uhh, niggas hate but I just laugh at that
A milly first quarter, you ain’t half of that
Talking trees, we can go pack for pack
All day, we just smoke back to back

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
If it ain’t KK what you smoking on
If it ain’t Rosé tell ‘em carry on
It ain’t ‘bout mine ‘less the money long
Oh na na na na na na

Motherfucking legend

Always be a legend
A motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Used to whip a Lexus
I can die right now, still a legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Born to be a legend
A motherfucking legend

[Verse 1]
1996, I beat a 187 (murder was the case)
80 million sold, and I ain't check the records
Checked a couple rappers, told 'em not to test me
Ask me who am I? Motherfucking legend
50 bitches naked
Nike ain't my preference
Khaki with the Chucks
Now look how they dressing
Perfected my profession
Someone call the reverend (Nate Dogg nigga)
Bury me alive, living legend

[Hook]
Motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Even if I die, living Legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Always be a legend
A motherfucking legend

[Verse 2]
Look, big dog, six broads, don't matter to me
You new niggas look madder than me
Came up with the Doc, been around the world with 'Pac
Don't compare another rapper to me
When I came and kicked them buildings over
Swear I always knew I'd never be the same
Was born to be a motherfucking legend
I ain't never do it for no fucking fame
Motherfucking legend
You know what I'm repping
20 million, 20 years ago
Cuh, you was like 7
You ain't gotta like it
Bitch you gon' respect it (Respek on my name!)
Look me in my eye
Motherfucking legend

[Hook]
Motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Even if I die, living Legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Always be a legend
A motherfucking legend
Motherfucking legend
Used to whip a Lexus
I can die right now, still a legend
Look at my reflection
Ain't no second guessing
Born to be a legend
A motherfucking legend

[Outro]
Mix purple with the yella
Kobe with Vanessa
Did it doggy style
Like upon the dresser
Look at my reflection
Motherfucking legend
Even when I die

[Excerpt from Paid In Full]
A nigga like me man, I love the game, I love the hustle man
I be feeling like one of them ball player niggas you know
Like Bird, Magic or something
Yeah you know a nigga got dough a nigga can leave the league
But if I leave… the fans still gone love me man?

[Hook]
Told you I was bout to do it big, huh?

Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?
Keep a shooter at the gate on my crib, huh?

[Verse 1]
I ain’t do it, people said I did, huh?
Rap music ain’t what's fuckin' up they kids, huh?
Gangster rap is fuckin’ up the biz, huh?
My influence, something that I said, cuh?
Like I’m jewish, all about the bread, huh
From the sewage, tryin’ to get ahead, huh
I’m bout to do it, fuckin’ up they head, huh?
These opportunist, fuckin’ up they bread, huh?
Corporate America stance is irregular
Ready Cuz, rap sheet, impeccable
Multi plats, my past
What we have here is unprofessional
My metal, undetectable, my style, unselectable
Niggas runnin’ they mouth thats unacceptable
21st street, Long Beach 'til the death of you

[Hook]
Told you I was bout to do it big, huh?

[Verse 2]
Keep shootin’, thats what the people tell me, huh
Get the biggest dope sack that you can sell me, huh
And your homegirl do it, huh
I make the whole world do it, huh
Ain’t no limit to the dog and that's real talk
I’m the one that showed you how a real crip walk
Resume, document, G-File
Recollect, reflect, and let me break it down
Take it out the bag, lay it on the table quick
Call my handlers, I handle and disable this
Tickin’ time bomb, made crippin’ look fun
Can’t walk around without your motherfuckin’ gun, that's a no no
Real hood redemption, my tiny Lokos is really on a mission
Niggas runnin’ they mouth thats unacceptable
21st Street, Long Beach 'til the death of you

[Hook]
Told you I was bout to do it big, huh?
Came in this game as a kid, huh?
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?
Keep a shooter at the gate on my crib, huh?

[Verse 3]
Do anybody in the house remember?
When it wasn’t no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)
It wasn’t no rappers talking’ bout the LBC, am I trippin y'all?(Hell nah)
So its safe to say, I put it on the map, huh
So if you see me on the block, yeah, I’m back, huh
And if you don’t think you know where I’m at, huh
You wanna battle, little homie, get your racks up
Boy you need to kit kat, make you niggas get back
Split you like a kit kat, the big homie did that
Rollin’ like a rebel though, I’m on a whole ‘nother level though
My heart, my hair, My G, my seat, that part right there
I’m more than a rapper though, pure intellectual
Smooth as a criminal, you hear me though?

[Hook]
Told you I was bout to do it big, huh?
Came in this game as a kid, huh?
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?
First nigga talk that crippin’ to your kids, huh?
Still down Ten toes in this shit, huh?
Keep a shooter at the gate on my crib, huh?

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Damn, I still hear my mama voice
"Snoopy get your ass up and go outside and play!"
Hah, if she only knew what I was ‘bout to get off into
Bang!

[Chorus]
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg + Too $hort]
Don’t stop being you, don’t stop being G
Egotistical, mystical, officially
Shuffle my feet to the beat with my heat in the stash
G in the bag with the C on the flag
We some real OGs baby
I was getting money in the 80’s daily
Niggas like me don’t never quit
And I still go hard on a bitch, ya bitch
You got to tell ‘em what it is, don’t play with the game
I love it when you call a bitch out of her name
Don’t you dare try to save that ho
I know that you like her but you can’t wife her
I’m going on a tour ‘round the world
Probably fuck a whole bunch of girls
Probably get a whole bunch of money, sho’ can you save some for me?
Nah, but you can come and work for me

[Chorus]
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg + Too $hort]
Don’t stop being real, don’t stop that rap
Don’t stop showing homies how to shake that trap
I mean I seen so much but I'm still in touch with it
I don’t stop ‘cause I know y’all gon’ fuck with it
We keep going full speed ahead with this
Niggas ain’t did the shit
Niggas ain’t real as this
We came through and peeled his bitch so quick
From the 80’s with a dope sack in my hand
To the 90’s with a DJ and a microphone stand
Can’t stop now, I’m in way too steep
Tech savvy with this cavy, come way too deep
Short dawg, Snoop Dogg, this for all my dogs
The ones who real in the streets, the ones who locked in the halls
Hall of fame with this game, legendary to y’all
Another 100 point game, now you can bury the ball

[Chorus]
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Don’t stop getting lit with the shit I spit
I know you’re down with the Dogg, I know you’re fucking with this
Don’t stop, won’t stop, this is all I know
From the uprock to the crack rock in the bowl
Don’t stop getting money, bring that shit back
Don’t stop, fuck a cop for all the times I was jacked
Can’t say much now ‘cause I’m moving a crowd
I’m moving real weight, I mean hundreds of thous
Hundreds of pounds, green leaves
I made it out the motherfucking mean streets
And I still go back and touch the youth
I teach ‘em how to ball and I teach ‘em how to shoot
In the pursuit of my dreams, while recruiting my team
Teach ‘em how to rise to the top just like cream
Remain supreme by any means
Badda bang, badda bing

[Chorus]
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all

And if a square ass nigga tried to get up in my circle

Bitch niggas  still bang on 'em
50 Cal shots, let it rain on 'em
And if a square ass nigga tried to get up in my circle

Tell 'em come and see me, I got a slug for 'em
But then again I ain't brainless

Still say fuck 'em cause ain't no love for 'em
Tell 'em come and see me, I got a slug for 'em
But I ain't tryna make ya famous

[Verse 2]
It's enough of that to go around
Real G's make the hood go 'round
Keep the planet spinnin' on it's axis
How is he so hood? How can you ask this?
I guess you can say I put in practice
On the strip, under lights, now I'm back bitch
And even if I'm blown on my own
With the chrome to your dome
Make you stretch like elastic
I need my real G's to the left
Bitch niggas staying to the right
I need my hoes front and center
Hard on these hoes from the Summer to the winter
Spring to the Fall, hoes still on my balls
It's the number one nigga from the hood  Doggy Dogg
Still pull up on a nigga when I need to be heard
I'm a killer and a stealer, but I ain't from Pittsburgh
Real shit on the set, I get your whole clique served
You best observe, a B chalked out on the curb
With your momma and your people sayin' "Supercrip did it"
They won't testify, so he got away with it
Now I'm sttin' on my throne, on my Bat phone
I'm talkin' to Iron man, while smokin' some fire, man
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Walkin' through the clouds with a Crip stick cane

[Hook]
Super Crip, what?
Super Crip, who?
Super Crip, what?
Super Crip, who?
Super Crip, what?
It's still 187 if you bitch niggas wanna trip, who?

On the set, my nigga, I'm my own man
Upgrade, just like your phone game
Big Snoop Dogg, I do my own thing
And I stays in my own lane
My rap style, is dynamite
A lot of y'all niggas do sound alike
You do it how you do's it
See, you can blame it on the drugs, and you can blame it on the music
Where I come from, if you sound like another nigga
That's called bitin', yeah, you the other nigga
Let my demeanor be the meaning, got you screamin'
While you leanin', now you fiendin', while you dreamin'
To have a big car, rap star
Ten-room mansion with a lake in your backyard
So disobedient, flavor is the main ingredient
And you lack it, it's all in your jacket

[Hook]
But I'm hot, and as cool as a fan
You bitches drinkin' lemonade, I'm the Coolaid Man
Standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid Man

[Verse 2]
The reason that I say that I'm the Coolaid
Look at all the flavor that I gave to the gizzame
Just add water, it don't get no hotter
You got your whole get-down from the Doggy Dogg father
Never mind it was never mines
Inquire intellectual, clever minds
Bet a dub that this shit pop
Bitch niggas mix love with this hip-hop
Just to be on, now what the fuck are we on
LBC, we've been known to get our G on
They call me Don Corleone, that's the corner he on, P-I-M-P on
She a freak of the week, I'm teachin' niggas how to eat
Cause I'm deep in the streets
Look, don't get it fucked up loc
Cause every now and then, niggas need a line of this dope

[Hook]
Cause I'm hot, and as cool as a fan

My nigga I’m so tight, spitin' with gold mic
Walk through a dark cloud, came out in a strobe light
Rockin’ a robe like, Hef with his hoes like
Heavy is the head but to me it's just so light
Eat with the rich and get back to the low lifes
Cup with his Cool-Aid the flavor is so right
Dip in and floss like, ship it in one night
Fuck what it cost like, livin’ the boss life

If it don’t go right, make sure you all ride
Deuce deuce and a Tec-9 with a .4-5
Niggas is so dead, my nigga I’m so live
Back in my zone like niggas hittin’ my phone like
Shoot him some bail like, cuz he won’t tell right?
The homies don’t act like, the homies don’t act right
Under interrogation becomes cooperation
That's why I dealt like, solo and bolo like
Kick a little ass and talk shit like I’m Dolomite
Dip in and floss like, ship it in one night
Fuck what it cost like, livin’ the boss life

[Hook: Swizz Beatz & Snoop Dogg]

Profit to profit, arrow to pharaoh
Live bueno, hustle like Maino
All money in, no Drano
Can't no-body get it like I get mines
More paper to Jamaica, I make it, bake it, shape it and cake it
Remake it, never had to fake it to make it
Just put the pedal to the metal, rock it up and re-flake it
I'm living the fast life
Jet after jet and tryna keep my cash right
I know you understands the meaning
Hand full of green and while the fans keep fiending
Straight up, no leaning, I'm right where the chips at
Or even in the hood where the Crips at
Joint seem mighty long, red beam on his dome
Point seen, money gone

[Hook: Jeremih]
Let's roll out to Miami and get the money

In a white Ghost sipping holy water
Always been the type to get it close to border
After play, Barry Bonds, out the park

At the wall, off the wall, I feel like Mike
I don't miss, niggas talkin' shit, say I
Took his bitch, hit that pussy, it took one night
Hit that hoe quit, it was just aight
Uhh, not at all
I ain't get to see the wall, I copped 'em all
Fucked it all, fuck the law, fuck you thought?
I ain't change, seen my chain look like the car
Flash man, flashy dancing, dancing on me
Dirty dancing, dancing like my double cup
Lemonade to niggas that be talking tough
Say you got money, I just double up
Multiply, fuck addition, fuckin bitches all night
Macauley Culkin, rich and riches
This the life, they walk away, it's so delicious
Up in Dubai, sushi, hella bitches
Aw man, wrote a check, two commas
Please tell em' I need two shots by two o' clock
Plus that adds about two thousand, two drops
Pull up in my crew, sellin' out

[Verse 1]
All I bang is that crip shit, trip this
Big Snoop Dogg with my cousin Trick Trick
Put the hammer to your bisquick to your biscuit

We even got homies in Akron and OK-C

Holla at a nigga on the DM

You niggas don't hear me though
Turn it up, nigga, this shit's in stereo
I walked in with a philly ho
Let me give it to you, young locc, on the really though
Hands, the keys, the Benz, the trees
The birds, the bees, the C's, the G's
I get it like I'm 'posed to, you should be close to me
Right up under my wing
Words I sing, verbs I bring
Bread to the park, head in the dark
Ready with art, I said it with heart
Merely distorted, dearly departed
Look what you started
I'm cool as a mother and you acting retarded
Just what the motherfuckin' doctor ordered
It's the d-o-g with the p-o-p
Not one, not two, but three

[Chorus]
I gotta have two or more
Two or more, baby
Maybe even three or four
Like three, like four
Listen to me, baby
I need two or more
Yeah
Maybe even three or four
She likes love, drugs, and sex
Love, drugs, and sex
She likes love, drugs, and sex

[Verse 2]
Have a seat and don't say one word
Cause you will never catch Snoop Dogg with just one bird
And if I do, I'll probably kick it to the curb
And come anew
Runnin' back, I'm-a keep runnin' through
Hut one, hut two
Down set, hike two, three, four
We go overtime
I'm-a give you something that's gonna blow your mind
And take your time, relax a bit
I came here to mack a bitch
This P is so immaculate
I rap a bit just to taste
Puttin' hair to the snare to the bass
Snap that, Snapchat, flick it up
One of me, three of ya'll, so lick it up
I'm back to the hangin' again, bangin' again
Nigga, could you sing it again?

[Chorus]
I gotta have two or more
Two or more, baby
Maybe even three or four
Like three, like four
Listen to me, baby
I need two or more
Yeah
Maybe even three or four
She likes love, drugs, and sex
Love, drugs, and sex
She likes love, drugs, and sex

[Verse 3]
Freak-a-leek, I speak the truth
I got girls lined up trying to get in the booth
Original, more like a miracle
High definition visual, digital, minimal
But it can be maxed out
Track meet, more meat blow your back out
I had to pull the 'lac out
Cause there was too many of ya'll to be left out
I stepped out mackish with the whole package
Bread with the cabbage, me and a bad bitch
Or two, make it three
31 flavors, nigga
It gets no better than this
Now, who in the world can get you more wetter than this?
I'm back to the hangin' again, bangin' again
Nigga, could you sing it again?

[Chorus]
I gotta have two or more
Two or more, baby
Maybe even three or four
Like three, like four
Listen to me, baby
I need two or more
Yeah
Maybe even three or four
She likes love, drugs, and sex
Love, drugs, and sex
She likes love, drugs, and sex

[Outro]
Two or more

[Intro: Spoken]
Say baby girl
Why don't you light some candles and put somethin' on for a nigga though? Forreal

[Hook]
You don't have to leave
You can stay at my house, I aims to please
Just relax and breathe
You deserve attention, I'm what you need
You don't have to leave
You can stay at my house, I aims to please
Just relax and breathe
You deserve attention, I'm what you need

[Verse 1]
Yes I'm the most high
Baby want it, Mimosa
I tried to reverse her, a mentirosa
Gov me livin' the vida loca in Acapulco
With my pictures on the wall on a poster, a roller coaster
So I try to dance my life away to get it over
I'm sippin' Jamison with famous friends until I'm sober
Don't wanna go home, I know I'm gonna get into a fight
I called my sidepiece and tell her I'mma spend the night
And if she out of town, baby we' gon' book a flight
She got it laid out with incense and candlelights
Your shit's on hit, officially lit
You're tryna get a nigga sprung, your pussy wet, you lil bit
You have no idea, what? You want me right here?
Are you sure that we can do this shit right here?
Cause if it's on like that, I'll spend the night here

[Hook]
You don't have to leave
You can stay at my house, I aims to please
Just relax and breathe

You can stay at my house, I aims to please
Just relax and breathe
You deserve attention, I'm what you need
You don't have to leave
You can stay at my house, I aims to please
Just relax and breathe
You deserve attention, I'm what you need
You don't have to leave
You can stay at my house, I aims to please
Just relax and breathe
You deserve attention, I'm what you need

[Verse 2]
Good love, good sex and good weed
Baby oil to rub down my sleeves, relax and breathe
Red wine, crackers and cheese, baby shootin' the breeze
While aiming to please
Oh please, don't stop with the antics
High heels, t-shirts, no panties
Me knockin', she's rockin' the boat
While baking me a cake with a root beer float
Then put the TV on the channel where's it's nothin' but sports
Every room at the house is where I smoke my dope, no joke
Got keys to the spot so I can slide by necessary
Mary, Mary, Quite Crip Contrary
Apartment contemporary
Jo Malone candles, very airy
Ain't that right Siri? (That's right Siri)
So keep sendin' that right
The way it's lookin', I'll be spendin' the night

[Hook]
You don't have to leave
You can stay at my house, I aims to please
Just relax and breathe
You deserve attention, I'm what you need
You don't have to leave
You can stay at my house, I aims to please
Just relax and breathe
You deserve attention, I'm what you need
You don't have to leave
You can stay at my house, I aims to please
Just relax and breathe
You deserve attention, I'm what you need
You don't have to leave
You can stay at my house, I aims to please
Just relax and breathe
You deserve attention, I'm what you need

[Outro: Spoken]
I'm on my way, yeah
Just leave the backdoor open
I'm pullin' up right now
And I'mma spend the night
Fo' sho'

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
You brainwashed not to know you grew up wanting to be a pimp, you wanted to be a player (Right) You know, you grew up wanting to be these different things that are role models to you in your neighborhood, until you figure out that...hold on...I'm finna be the first role model that ain't that (Right)

[Angela Yee The Breakfast Club]
Well I had a chance to listen to the album, it's very chill, it definitely makes you wanna smoke some weed
(Oh it do?)
Yeah, and I don't even really smoke
(You wanna hit some right now?)
I don't know if we're allowed to do that in here
(We need curtains, we need curtains in here)
No, Snoop can do what he wanna do
(I don't think so...)
Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness

[Verse 1]
And there ain't no doubt about it
Regarded as the freshest, by the way that I live
All the songs that I did, and givin' back to the kids
I mean I done been everywhere that you wanna go
And poppin' on a stick like a pogo
My logo, is similar to the bat sign
Way up in the sky, When you wanna get high
Now look up, Now look up, I shook up the game
With the versatility, verbability, toungetwistagility
Hell yeah, they love the dog
Grandmomma's worldwide wanna hug the dog

[Hook]
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop

[Verse 2]
Look I'm back at it, melodramatic
A little more dope for you Snoop Dogg addicts
Addicted to the things I do, magic
Go go go but no gadget, I'm magic
If I wasn't invented
Then you probably wouldn't even know how to represent it
I'm in it like I spread it, if I said it, All gas unleaded
For really though, I get that real hood love everywhere I go
From mommas, babies, grannies
You gotta love him even if you can't stand him

[Hook]
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop

[Snoop]
All money ain’t good money
But ain’t no money like the show money

[Hook: Bruza]
We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we don’t got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

[Verse 1: Snoop]
I pull up in a Full Metal Jacket
Pop shots, Top notch with the ratchet
I leave a nigga dead on the asphalt
Slap em in the face tell em take them fuckin’ pants off
T’d Up, G’d Up when we stance off
Two to the chest make a bitch nigga dance off
Goin’ with the Wizzin, Juice with the Gizzin’
Rides til’ I’m Risen, strong with the pizzen'
You don’t know, oh, I fucked your hizzoe
Timbo, the Designer, and finer fuck what it cizzost
See everything I’m rock and wear its handmade
If she with me then she got it all you understand me

[Hook: Bruza]
We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we don’t got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

[Verse 2: Snoop]
The police, motherfuckin’ gang to me
And money, ain’t a motherfuckin’ thang to me
Let me break it down for you, keep a few shooters
And a damn good lawyer
Preparation for the worst, meditation with this verse
Education, Rebirth, cause you know if you last you first
And everybody wanna be the best, Red bottom shoes for your Louie bag on your neck
Baby remember before you had shoes
When yo’ life was filled with nothing but bad news
See everything I rock and wear is handmade
If she with me then she got it all you understand me

[Hook: Bruza]
We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we don’t got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

[Verse 3: Snoop]
New cars got that, good weed blow that
Bag bitch yessir, OG for sure that
Used to stay with my momma on the couch
Like the Jeffersons I’m moving on up and I’m out
Penthouse with the butler who waits by the door
To ensure I’m the only motherfucker on this floor
I got game, I got fame, I got cash, I got love
I got so many hoes, I’m bout to open a club
You got me, I got you,  you got one, I got two
Stop by and have a good time its popping’ at Snoops
Got a whole lot of this and I mix it with that
Me and Timberland remember we bringin’ it back

[Hook: Bruza]
We came from the bottom to the top floor
Plus I paid for it it cost a lot though
Money problems everybody got those
But now a days we don’t got those
Birkin bag all my bitches got those
No Chanel everybody got those
Shooters on the roof know we got those
Hear a couple shots, hope you got those

[Intro: Snoop Dogg + October London]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The revolution will be televised
The revolution
Just Blaze
Oh-oh-oh-oh
This is serious business
Dududududu

[Hook: October London]
The revolution, oh, oh

The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Sitting back watching, but I'm so unstable
I been an OG since I was rockin' in the cradle
Y'all don't know that my bite is so fatal
Kick a fool down like the homie with the 8-0
Ayy though, nigga don't play though
With the 'K though, like the spray though
Sculpted left hand full of clay dough
Split him in the middle cut him up like a potato
Oh, leave 'em on the sideline, bleeding cause he tried mine
We loot 'til the boot out
Me and my brother, we was caught up in a shootout
Had to handle, pigs on a nigga, four days
Eight laws of power, eighty-five ways
TEC-9's with a couple 45's
And the revolution will be televised

[Hook: October London]
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised, will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
This ain't the local pass cash with the bra fast views
This shit will be viewed on your broadcast news
Why did I do it? My momma is on the call
Shot three lil pigs and now my back against the wall
Nowhere to turn and nowhere to go
My blood is burnin' I'm about to blow
Huey, Malcolm and Martin, those are my peers
They been doin' niggas like this for over hundreds of years
Poppin' us, fear, now it's time for us to clap back
But this time we gon' bust, step the fuck back
We ain't runnin', we shootin' and lookin' forward
Anybody, somebody, everybody on the floor
They just surrounded my place
Hold the court in the streets so I can win my case
TEC-9's with a couple 45's
And the revolution will be televised

[Hook: October London]
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised, will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)

[Bridge October London]
The revolution-lution-lution-lution
The revolution-lution-lution-lution

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, la-la-la-la-da-da-da

[Hook: October London]
The revolution, oh, oh
Will be televised, will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)
The revolution, oh, oh, na, na, na, na, na
Will be televised
(The revolution will be televised)

[Verse 1]
Twelve noon
Watch her sleeping in your room
Why can't that still be me?
Two o'clock and I'm still driving 'round your block
Feeling a little crazy

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You'd change your number and move to the suburbs
You run, but you can't hide
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords
But I like showing up at your place
So surprising
That look on your face

[Chorus 2]
I'm underneath your street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever

[Verse 2]
So weeks pass and I found myself another catch
Someone who loves me equally, yeah
The tables turn and you're not happy
When you learn he's moving in with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He bought me a big ring, we moved to the city
Now you won't stop calling
'Cause you always thought that you'd have your plan B
Now you're showing
Up at my place
Not surprising
We both play this game

[Chorus 2]
You're underneath my street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
You're right outside my window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever

[Bridge]
La la la la
La la la la
Forever
La la la la
La la la la

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You'd change your number and move to the suburbs
You run, but you can't hide
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords
But I like showing up at your place
So surprising
That look on your face

[Chorus 1]
I'm underneath your street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever
I'm underneath your street light, blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window, throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love
Oh, he stands in front of me
And he's staring manically
Screaming
Oh society, what have you done to me?

The ground I've tread so many years
All this blood and sweat and tears

Just to be inside your mould
And do just what I'm told
If only I had been so bold
But now my body's getting old
And time is oh so golden
If only it could be frozen

But you took it away from me
Oh society
You took it away from me
Oh my liberty

Oh you took it away from me
Oh society
You took it away from me
When you brainwashed me with formulas of how I should be
Shaped me and raped me of my individuality
Schooled me and fooled me
Told me what I could and could not see
Took me and shook me
Of my urges to be free
I read in the paper that my brothers are being thrown from rooftops blindfolded with their hands tied behind their backs for violating sharia law. I heard the crowds stone these fallen men if they move after they hit the ground. I heard it’s in the name of God. I heard my pastor speak for God too, quoting scripture from his book. Words like abomination popped off my skin like hot grease as he went on to describe a lake of fire that God wanted me in. I heard on the news that the aftermath of a hate crime left piles of bodies on a dance floor this month. I heard the gunman feigned dead among all the people he killed. I heard the news say he was one of us. I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a faggot as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist. Many are annoyed by our wanting to be married like everyone else or use the correct restroom like everyone else. Many don’t see anything wrong with passing down the same old values that send thousands of kids into suicidal depression each year. So we say pride and we express love for who and what we are. Because who else will in earnest? I daydream on the idea that maybe all this barbarism and all these transgressions against ourselves is an equal and opposite reaction to something better happening in this world, some great swelling wave of openness and wakefulness out here. Reality by comparison looks grey, as in neither black nor white but also bleak. We are all God’s children, I heard. I left my siblings out of it and spoke with my maker directly and I think he sounds a lot like myself. If I being myself were more awesome at being detached from my own story in a way I being myself never could be. I wanna know what others hear, I’m scared to know but I wanna know what everyone hears when they talk to God. Do the insane hear the voice distorted? Do the indoctrinated hear another voice entirely?

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & DJ Glaze]
What's up Snoop, you ready?
Yeah
Go ahead man
This for all the playas and the pimps, not for the simps
You and the pimp getcha boogie on right about now
Let's jam

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
From the very first day I was put in it
I had to tell myself that I was in it to win it
Puttin' the mack down at an early age
Two steps ahead of my peers so switch to the next phase
Early '85 tryna clock a grip
No time for that wick-wack gangbang shit
I was tryna find a way to get richer
And if ya ass caught slippin', Dogg's gonna getcha
That's how it was and that's how it is
You think I'm finna change cause I'm in the hip-hop biz
Ain't nuthin' change but the weather and my shoe size
Livin' on the streets'll make a dumb nigga wise
That's why I stay one-up on ya
Everybody think them gangstas is runnin' California
Well ya wrong and I'mma show ya
The game of a G, is what I'm finna throw ya
If you can handle it, but if ya can't, give it back
See this for the true hardened-macks
The pimps, not the wimps or the simps
Takin' bitches out to eat steak and shrimp, dude
But who ya better do for these nuts
Chill out and peep out the rest of the cut
Cause I'm a young playa who's afraid to change
I'd rather stay handlin', be true to the game

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now I ain't sayin' I don't treat a woman right
There's certain extent, you better know when to get tight
But I ain't the one to preach and teach
But these trick-ass niggas took the shit outta reach
Takin' her out to eat then takin' her out to shows
But when it's time to get the ass, them nuts is frozen
And you know why my brother?
Because you let the bitch now that you love her
And that's what she's supposed to do
Ya payin' a hoe to keep close to you
You'd do much better on the boulevard
You spend all ya money and dick still hard
You tryna go out like Babyface
The money was a waste and youse a disgrace
To the niggas who put the game down so deeply
Pumpin' up loud for the niggas that sleep G
For some reason they don't hear me though
And this is the shit that ya gotsta know
If ya plan on having a woman nowadays
Because a woman nowadays has got to stay paid
And simp-ass niggas put dents in the game
You know who you are, I ain't gon' say ya name
And get a little fame and start conflict
Cause I'm a young mack daddy havin' shit
So you can go and make that change
But a nigga like Dogg is stayin' true to the game

[Bridge: DJ Glaze]
Yeah, my nigga Snoop Doggy Dogg in the muthafuckin' house
DJ Glaze in this muthafucka too, Foesum

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Oh man, I think I got too deep on the last verse
But you know how I am, I really don't give a fuck
Cause a bitch is a bitch and a bitch is gonna stay a bitch
As long as a nigga broke, but when he get rich
Watch how her attitude changes
She wanna start comin' around and then maintainin'
A grip on you and a grip a on ya grip
But I ain't the one to try to trip that trick
Let's see, cause I'm loyal to game
That's why I always maintain and keep my brain in the right frame
Just in case that happens
The way that I live is the way that I'm rappin'
Don't be offended because I speaks the truth
I can't help it but I'm that OG playa they call Snoop
Yes, the fly human being, not European
But I managed to keep singin'
Cause ya know that I'm a G in any field I put my heart at
I'm the mack and I'm packin'
Yeah, and what I was really talkin' about was this
It's somethin' that's crucial but not like a diss
It's just to the brothas who keep spendin'
Ain't nuthin' wrong with lendin' but you keep sendin'
Mo' money, mo' money, mo' money
But when ya get broke watch how she get funny
And don't wanna neva eva wanna show up
The the words gonna get around thatcha to' up
Then who you gonna kick it with?
You can't chill with the homies cause they say you a trick
And ya know tricks are for kids, silly rabbit
It turns into a habit, now you on bankrupt status
I ain't the Pips but I'm damn sure glad it's not a playa like me in yo' shoes
Because I don't wanna cry about the mack daddy blues
Now if you upset and wanna throw them thangs
I suggest for ya best and trust change
All up in crazy thoughts
And for my paper, the vapors, is whatcha just caught
Doggy Dogg feelin' a lil' pain
I'm just a G from the Beach stayin' true to the game

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I hope I got my point across the way I wanted to
Sorry my brother, if you feel I fronted you
But that's how I am I don't nuttin' back
And that's the number one rule of bein' a mack
Rule two, money first and that's a must
All gold-diggin' hoes tryna creep get crushed
And the most important thang
Is to always stay down and be true to the game

[Verse]
He came up in Dallas, had no hazel in his eyes
Had them sailors on his thighs, when he's lit, he show 'em
Kept it faded on the sides, we were seeing someone
We was dating on the side, he was seeing double
I was spinning hula, we were spending so much time
It was getting cooler
All this drillin' got the dick feelin' like a power tool
Finna move a nigga out his momma house now
That's a power move
That's what I gotta do, for real
Would that diamond shine for real?
Shine for real

[Bridge]
Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go

Yeah, I mean I said wrong is right, and right is right, I got mines
(Always right, I got mines)
Aye (Uhh!)
Jokers and Cinderellas at the ball of confusion
The tension is high but niggas is still fly
Sophisticated puppets with political ties
Organized crime, paperback shrine
Pussy with a price tag, money all the time
Pills and a nightcap runnin' through your spine
Niggas sippin' lean what a fiend for the high
Addiction is a bitch but we thuggin' 'til the end
And these bitches love the glitz so I'm turnin' up the lights
I'm rollin' out the whips, throwing the dice
You can roll if you like, do what you feel
You wanted a show? Just open your eyes
This is life as you know it
A few make it through, most won't survive
A penny with a hole with no hope inside
It's survival of the finesse
And my nigga's went to dinners
So we taking a bite
And I made up my mind
The whole world loves you when you're top of the line
The hoes gon' want you when you're thuggin' it right
But the feds gon' bust you if your money too husky man
Trust me, devils want you livin' in fright
Ain't that right?

[Intro: Gucci Mane (DJ Drama)]
Bustas! (I know) Gansta Grillz, bastards! (I know)
(It's not fair, I agree, I totally agree, it's not!)

[Pre-Chorus: Gucci Mane (DJ Drama)]
It's Gucci! (hahaha) What's happening? Burr!
DJ Drama, what's happening? (Mr. Thanksgiving) Gansta Grillz
Gucci! Drizzy Drake and Gucci

It's Gucci! What's happening? (I'm shivering!) Burr!
DJ Drama, what's happening? (Ya know what I mean?) Gansta Grillz
Gucci! Drizzy Drake and Gucci

It's Gucci! What's happening? Burr! (Guccimerica!)
DJ Drama, what's happening? (We've read this) Gansta Grillz
Gucci! Drizzy Drake and Gucci

Ha! (1017) They ain't expect this one
Expect the unexpected motherfucker
It's Gucci!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
From Zone Six to the SWATS, I'm a keep the block burnin'
Long as the world keep turnin', money I'm gon' be earnin (hah)
Lost my train of thought, if someone find it, return it
You niggas wanna beat me like my children, I'm hearin' (shh)
You come between my paper route, that's pass interference
Now cash interference, I shine just like my earrings (bling)
It's $50 K today, twelve bars, a feature appearance
My sneaker bill cost more than what you make in a year, man
Don't near man, there's no one near man, you're like a cheer man
No coachin', Gucci the GM and you're the beer man
Don't try me like I'm a pussy another tin man
I rap I bust bricks so you can call it R&B man
Gucci!

[Bridge: DJ Drama]
I got a new side job, I'm hip-hop security
And what that means is I'm takin' all credentials
What you say and what you do, accomplishments, accolades
I'm like the airport, all identification will be checked
Drama!

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, uh, feelin sorry for the runner up
I'm still away gettin money when the sun is up
And they keep sayin how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie starters can't put the numbers up
Maann, hate is so pasé, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day, nigga
And it's just me and my money, ya'll don't even get to play when ya'll are leading by twenty
Yeah, I infiltrated the game, I was hesitant at first and feared what it would change
Now I'm high of the success and faded off of the fame
But still I managed to keep all of my opinions the same
Man, I am So Far Gone, bitch I'm outta here
Hotter than santa inside rockin nauta wear
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear I'm killin shit, I'm killin shit
Shoutout to the niggas I just made a couple million with
Yeah, from the beginning to the end
Know I'm into making history, not into making friends, motherfuckaa

[Bridge: DJ Drama]
I've seen a lot come and go
Some niggas was runnin too fast, ran outta breath too quick
Us over here? We pace ourselves, the finish line is way far ahead
You niggas keep gettin cramps in the race, don't pass out, baby!
Look for me in the rafters!

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Mike bigga baby, it's bigger baby, Gucci, Louis, Prada
Don Dada, I am hot as the Sahara
What I spit in my saliva is a flow hotter than lava
When I grab a microphone, I flame on like Waka Flocka
Got a thirty-eight revolver that I call my problem-solver
I ain't worried bout no rappers, they just talk, they just holler
When that fire hit their ass, they'll walk, they crew will follow
Like a pimp, I pop my collar, at the prospect of tomorrow
Naw said life a bitch, so I'm a break her for some dollars
I will never be a simple, sorry, sucka stuck in squalor
I will murder ever verse I ever versed to get the guala
I am cursed since I first dispersed a dime bag of rocka in exchange for a dollar

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
Ay, to all you other rappers out there
If I'm not eatin with ya, and you have an opinion about me
Always remember how insignificant your opinion is to the world
Whether you like, or dislike me, tomorrow's coming
So with that said, get on your grind, because it's about time, bitch!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I don't need the hype
They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
No ad-libing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times
They lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and have you laying between the sheets with the eyes leased (Isleys)
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno, re-wind me back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
To define the laws of crack, y'all don't obey
Y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
You're nothing more than a little John phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, modern day Issac Hayes
Theme song to Shaft, equivalent to the theme song to your career
Study my craft, you ignorant, I do it without a pen and pad
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay, and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucking with the music biz
The industry like, "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Got the bidding war popping like an auction
5 or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door
Money in front of me, couldn't open the door

[Verse 2: Unknown rapper]
Boom! That's that, left him on his back flat
You talking like that, jack, spitting
About crack, but never been about that
I'm real with this rap, I'm just speaking the facts
Rap, but some niggas wack, talent something they lack
So gather your whole pack, I'm taking them off the map
My pockets is getting fat, their pockets, they staying flat
So imma just hollaback, they rocking their tiny J's
But niggas ain't getting paid in the spot, like they a slave
12 hours just for some change, man this shit a shame
When the feds come, who you gon' blame? But that's just
Learning the game, you niggas should do the same
They go as fast as they came, cause passing me you ain't gon' see
I go bar for bar, and b, you are just a target, b
So just call me Muhammed Ali
Easy shit be hard to do, easy for me and hard for you
I'm leaving you with the (?), pick up a broad, 'bout three or two
Life is like a puzzle but my level is some trouble, man, you gotta use your muscle, in the hood I had to tussle
Man, I'm moving to the shop, (?), man you're not
Niggas steady talking but barely looking in the spot

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so far ahead of my time, I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
I'm hardly a friend with y'all, i hate rappers, where is your artist at?
If it ain't a good picture you're draw, don't bring it to the architect
Often you arguing 'bout who got next, claiming you're running the game
Niggas are barely walking yet, hopping all over beats without studying training camp
Try studying a few greats then maybe you'll be where i'm at
Your songwriting ain't great, your mixtapes mediocre
You recycle the same quotes, you're not switching the flow
Your flow in the same place, just don't rap; elaborate
Try to expand, try to be more creative perhaps
My rap friends, i ain't saying you're wack, psyche
Like an in-voice, I'm just stating the facts, right?
(?) metaphores i write, in fact, it's been a factor
You've feared your whole life, no TV show
Don't compare me with them, that's like a shark versus Nemo,  a gorilla to a chimp, Jordan versus Kukoč
A Tony Montana with blow on his nose to a Nino

[Intro]
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong

[Verse 1]
People love position
So I stay way up on a level
Like my name is Neymar and you know I’m not normal
There is no competition
I’m gonna talk and you gonna listen
I’m on ten like men, even better than them
Yeah I don’t lose focus like a German called Sven
My third eye’s open and my focus ain’t joking
Yeah You got  it wrong, cause my focus is so strong

[Chorus]
Run-pama pama pa-pama pama pama
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong
Go off on em
Go off on em
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong

[Verse 2]
Yeah I’m pressing buttons
Dropping pins on positions
Cause my words go far
And this rain is so foreign
You blow the place I live in while
Watch I could keep it going
Go off on em
Go off on em
So check up on your messages
Know what the message is
Like aliens in villages
We’re here for all ages
Fans back home
Got my tracks bang on
Yeah you got it wrong
Cause my focus is so strong

[Chorus]
Run pama pama pa-pama pama pama
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong
Go off on em
Go off on em
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong
Go off on em
Go off on em
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong

[Bridge]
At least you tell your children I came from London
Start talking about me long time like she was random
When I was in your life fella, I was hella bomb
But I had to go off just to stay strong

[Chorus]
Run pama pama pa-pama pama pama
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong
Go off on em
Go off on em
No focus lost, I concentrate
And now you got it wrong
Go off on em
Go off on em

[Intro]
Yeah
Got one rolled
Come light that shit up
We ain't playin' no games
Everybody I know smoke
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keep clouds of smoke

[Verse 1]
Keep one of them J's rolled
Keep both of my eyes closed
Keep all of them ashtrays close
If you gonna ride on this plane with me
Need a light and that's it
When I roll, you match it
Hit it twice and pass it
If you wanna ride on this plane with me

[Pre-Hook]
Wake up in the mornin' in that California Roll
Smokin' Khalifa Kush like I got it from the store
Used to share with my friends, but I'm smokin' to the face
Hand me a filter, I'm 'bout to roll up in this place

[Hook]
I wish it was legal to get high
I wish it was legal to get high
We rollin' and rollin', rollin'
We smokin' and smokin', smokin'
We blowin' on more and more, oh
I wish it was legal to get high

[Verse 2]
Gotta keep your own bud
Say you usually don't but now you wanna get chiefed and roll up
Well you wanna come get high with me
Smoke it all, don't save none
Hope the law don't say nun'
If you got one, blaze one
Everybody gettin' high with me

[Pre-Hook]
Wake up in the mornin' in that California Roll
Smokin' Khalifa Kush like I got it from the store
Used to share with my friends, but I'm smokin' to the face
Hand me a filter, I'm 'bout to roll up in this place

[Hook]
I wish it was legal to get high
I wish it was legal to get high
We rollin' and rollin', rollin'
We smokin' and smokin', smokin'
We blowin' on more and more, oh
I wish it was legal to get high

[Verse 1]
Anytime is not ever now
So what are you waiting for?
Why wait for someone to show you how?
They may want it, but you want it more

[Pre-Chorus]
No boundaries, no limits
If there's excitement, then I'm in it
If it's against the law, arrest me
If you can handle it, undress me
Give me a record, I'll break it
Give me a chance to go and I'll take it
No beginning, no ending
On and on

[Chorus]
Don't stop me now
Don't need to catch my breath
I can go on and on
On and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on
On and on

[Refrain]
Infinity
Infinity
Infinity
Infinity
Infinity
On and on
Infinity
Infinity
Infinity
Infinity
Infinity
On and on

[Verse 2]
They say a good thing never lasts
What goes up is gonna have to fall
But if you care too much of what people said
Then you wouldn't amount to much at all

[Pre-Chorus]
No boundaries, no limits
If there's excitement, then I'm in it
If it's against the law, arrest me
If you can handle it, undress me
Give me a record, I'll break it
Give me a chance to go and I'll take it
No beginning, no ending
On and on

[Chorus]
Don't stop me now
Don't need to catch my breath
I can go on and on
On and on
When the lights go down
And there's no one left
I can go on
On and on

[Refrain]
Infinity
Infinity
Infinity
Infinity
Infinity
On and on

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
You a pussy fuck nigga, that's why I fucked yo' hoe
You a bornified bitch nigga
Hang around with them snitch niggas
Don't come to my hood, the 6 block where I ditch niggas

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I just stole a 18 karat diamond from your girl
N.A.Z against the world
Niggas talk crazy run up on his moms at the store
Hit her with the AK, watch her brains hit the floor, ayy
Pull up gang galore, ayy
Raw dog a bitch, give a fuck bout a whore, ayy
Bad little bitch, she came straight from Singapore, ayy
And she wrap bricks better than my Asian whore, ayy
Diamond rings on me, got me feel like Mike Tyson 99's world tour
I could never give a fuck I said that shit straight from the core, ayy
I remember when a nigga ass was dead poor, ayy
Now I bust jugs and make more money than before, ayy
Big bad wolf and this bitch kicking down your door, ayy
All these niggas washed up, I found them on the shore, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Fee, fi, fo, fum
I just want the dollars, yeah
I can't fuck with no nigga I just want my guala
I said I just fucked a bitch and all the neighbors heard her holler
Tried to fuck with college  but Lil Yachty ain't a scholar
I said I just want the dollars
I just want the dollars nigga

[Verse 1]
Hours streaming
Stretching out longer than the days
Getting high just gets me low
The reason I know
Should I feel anything at all?

[Chorus]
And then the season ends and I’m still stuck in fall
Everywhere I look’s a trigger
I start to wonder if I knew myself at all
No, she knew me so much better

[Verse 2]
See, your face is a dream
And my dreams are faced with
Just forgetting
Getting high just gets me low
You told me so
Was I just never listening?

[Chorus]
The season ends and I’m still stuck in fall
Everywhere I look’s a trigger
I start to wonder if I knew myself at all
No, she knew me so much better

[Bridge]
If you stop breathing
You can have my breath
Now it’s everyone’s surprise
Surprise, surprise

[Verse 3]
Flashback parade
You give your whole self to one
You’re just having fun
‘Til you realize you pushed them away

[Verse 4]
The reasons are mine
I get frustrated when they intertwine
What was once yours and mine
Is just a dried up, calloused, toxic, pouring cyst
I admit you were
I admit you were right
I’m not sad that you don’t care to hear what I have to say

[Outro]
When you stop breathing
You can hold your breath

[Intro]
A callous cinema, erotic idiom

[Verse 1]
I am a witness
Video violence
Evading chastity
Scared
Straining for the face they'll seek on the camera

[Chorus]
Another dream gone
A parent’s heart attack
I know it’s all wrong
Coerce into violation
Brainwash into adoration

[Verse 2]
I think she felt a void
Spiritual vacuum
I hate what’s out there
Tears

[Chorus]
Another dream gone
Her parents’ heart attack
I know it’s all wrong
Coerce into violation
Brainwash into adoration

[Verse 3]
Now someone's seal is broken
Selling off their love
Someone's pride is taken
Selling service, selling service

[Bridge]
Pictures just do half the justice telling of the crime
Lewd director taking his sweet time
Talent buyers violate
Damnit they all get away
Moral anguish nauseates

[Verse 4]
Another one (trapped again)
It's so calculated
Demonstrate entitled behavior
In the culture, in the culture

[Chorus]
So many dreams gone
A family heart attack
I know it’s all wrong
Coerce into violation
Brainwash into adoration

[Verse 5]
Demeaning exploitation captured onto tape
We must expose the secret molestation
Entertainment Lies

[Outro]
Lies
(Red light, red light, red light)

[Intro]
Serving us
Serving secret trust

[Verse 1]
Lead with trust and aplomb
(Patriotic Gambit)
Then suppress us; guess I’m wrong
I’m the type to pry
Asking questions
Poking holes

[Pre-Chorus]
Masses (irony)
Crafted on a string
Carving liberty
Agony committee, save a seat for me
Chauvinistic TV
I need to leave
Pseudo men out of their mind

[Chorus]
Vertigo
Maniacs carry control
Holding me hostage
I’ll say nothing
You’ll get nothing from me
Bleed integrity

[Verse 2]
You should say you’re sorry
(Secret Manifesto)
Say you’re fucking sorry
Repent (Patriot)
Your call
Strangle us, get it done
While we are oblivious

Fall

[Verse 3]
We're in a secret war
It's set in motion
We're taught to trust the fear we are presented
We gladly wear the chains we are presented
Disguising Liberty, sold as protection

[Bridge]
Fraudulent
Fraudulent
Watching over us

[Pre-Chorus]
Agony committee
There's a seat for me
Chauvinistic TV
I need to leave
Pseudo times into my mind

[Chorus]
Calypso
Maniacs carry control
Holding me hostage
I’ll say nothing
You’ll get nothing from me
Bleed integrity

[Intro]
Moments stuck in time regretted
Mirror motive

[Verse 1]
Memories
Mescaline helps repeat the past
Always the selfish role I would be typecast

[Pre-Chorus]
Passive aggressive
Passion aggressor
That’s the cross I’m on, that’s the cross I’m on

[Chorus]
The different faces that I’ve maintained in the 8 years prior
All change, adapting
All of the faces that I’ve faced when coming clean
Smolder in my dreams, guilty memories

[Verse 2]
Was it a thrill for me?
No one deserves it
Two personalities
Flashes of eras tainted for two

[Bridge]
Insanity
Swapping out one for another
Finding different ways to draw a picture
That comes out the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Passive aggressor
Passion aggressive

[Chorus]
The different faces that I’ve maintained in the 8 years prior
All change, adapting
All of the faces I’ve manipulated still torture me
Guilty memories

[Bridge]
Did the sign on my bed frame
Prepare you for the mental break in?
All the faces of deceit, guilty in between coming clean
(Memory mescaline)
That's the cross I'm on
(Memory mescaline)
That's the cross I'm on
(Memory mescaline)
Flash of eras tainted
Nobody deserves it
Maybe I was a disease...

They were so sweet, every heart I've disconnected with
Even though we've made amends, I dwell on it
Moments stuck in time I still regret

If I had missed the windows on the days we were to first meet
Would it save you all from me and the pain I'd cause?
Maybe I don't want to know

And every time you'd go to leave
I would beg you to believe in me
“Is this really how it ends? Are we over with?"
I wish you had right then told me yes
For what it's worth I’ll never forget

[Verse 1]
A life was stolen today
A moment passed and it was gone
The carnage in the car accompanied the girl
Who was here, now she’s there
In a 3’ x 8’ cell

[Chorus]
I’m afraid of my soul leaving my body there
On a gassoaked road with nothing to give
Take the time to count my blessings
‘Til the time it’s me they bury

[Post-Chorus]
Where is it we compromise to be?
Why is it we think “It never will be me”?

[Verse 2]
Crash scene depicted with the victim ejected out
Crushing of bone
Feeling of shock
Running the stop
Cue paramedic, triage requested
Until the 3’ x 8’ cell

[Chorus]
I’m afraid of my soul leaving my body there
On a bloodsoaked road with nothing to give
Take the time to count my blessings
‘Til the time it’s me they bury

[Post-Chorus]
Where is it we compromise to be?
Looking away at the wrong time

[Verse 3]
So many others are complacent
Caution may not stop a reckless path
The driver of the car was shrieking
As the girl who was here fought for air
I hope I’m never there
Strewn on the pavement
Strewn on the pavement

[Outro]
Cue paramedics, triage requested
Take the time to count my blessings
‘Til the time it’s me they bury
I’m afraid of leaving my body there
Strewn on the pavement
I’m afraid of leaving my body there

[Verse 1]
Nix that moment of love
Earning your trust
Tear it apart for us
My vision is rough
It isn’t love
Tear it apart for us

[Chorus]
Tainted flesh is all over the room
Toxic fumes make them nauseous
But I need it
Craving dysfunction and violence
Perfect reactor

[Bridge]
Afraid to break, embrace the pain, the pain is safe
Let it in
Afraid to break, embrace the pain, feel it, feel it
Don’t let us die alone
(Die all alone)
(Afraid to break up)
Don’t let us die alone
(Die all alone)
(Afraid to break up)
Don’t let it go

[Verse 3]
(Go)
Don’t you like to feel this way
(You’re always wrong)
Don’t you like to feel this way
Destructing all of the pictures of
(Always numb. I’ve heard it all)
Everything closely resembling us
(This shouldn’t be OK I know it’s not right)
Destructing triggers of everything
Destructing triggers of...

[Breakdown]
Burn out
Swelling with doubt
Swelling with doubt
Romance a lacerated myth
Romance a lacerated myth

[Chorus]
Tainted flesh is all over the room
Toxic fumes make them nauseous
But I need it
Craving dysfunction and violence
Perfectly reacting as one

[Verse 4]
I see it every night
While feeding off the fights
‘Bout time you killed the shrine existing ties of us
A double suicide

(Darkened, fiction, romance)
Double suicide
Puppeteering lies
A reckless cycle of
(Get out, come back)
Always keeping hope
Tugging at your soul
Parasitic love lines
Barricade us in

[Bridge]
Afraid to break, embrace the pain, the pain is safe
Let it in
Darkened, fiction, romance
Get out, come back, let it in

[Outro]
Give me something I can hold on to
Something that loves to destruct
As I do
Convolute!
Give me something I can hold on to

[Intro]
Tales to spin scraping the skin
Planting a way for incident
Oh, there's always a motive we can't get around

[Verse 1]
Forcing the pieces
(Lies awry, no alibi)
Framing the needed agenda
Choosing how to stun
These are the ones paid to protect us

[Pre-Chorus]
This is my cry for redemption
You owe me this, you owe me this
When we call them out
And sort through the fiction
They silence it, it’s over with

[Chorus]
Now he’s stuck in the concrete
And we won’t get him out
Losing time that will never come back
Jurisdiction games scream your name
Appointed crooks never get caught
Never get caught

[Verse 2]
What better way to camouflage?
What better way to camouflage?
Forcing the pieces
(Lies awry, no alibi)
Faking the needed protocol
Circumvent the law
Living in a state of fear for life

[Bridge]
That's where the problem lies
Justice system fabricated, “Just us” system
They’re swearing on a book of verses
That's supposed to make it true?
They’re lying and the devil was the state’s design
How many are tainted?
Justice system fabricated, “Just us” system
How many are tainted?
Justice system fabricated, “Just us” system

[Pre-Chorus]
This is our cry for redemption
You owe me this, you owe me this
When we call them out that makes them nervous
They silence it, it’s over with

[Chorus]
Now he’s stuck in the concrete
And we won’t get him out
Losing time that will never come back
Jurisdiction games scream your name
Appointed crooks never get caught
Never get caught

[Outro]
What better way to camouflage?
What better way to camouflage?

[Intro]
What's happening?
Everybody looking
I love my kids
Guwop
It's Gucci
Huh
Go

[Hook]
All my, all my, all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All of these rappers are all my children

[Verse 1]
Don't nobody love you like pa love you
Don't nobody love you like Guwop love you
I had to make a track to say I'm proud of you
Stop that track to tell my children that I'm proud of them
Making rockstars out of trap boys
And if we never talk again, still got your back boy
This here is bigger than the game, deeper than rap, boy
Just ask around in East Atlanta, I'm the landlord
Fuck a contract, I'd rather shake your hand boy
Yeah I'm your CEO but I'm your biggest fan boy
Said I'm the best A&R that's in the business (It's Gucci)
But there's an AR-15 in my bentley

[Hook]
All my, all my, all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All of these rappers are all my children

[Verse 2]
I'm laid back, feet up, watching all my rugrats
Come up, turn up, real niggas love that
Guwop, proud poppa, went and got you your first chopper
Show stopper, globe trotter, all I get is more dollars
Gucci got more money than all these rappers
Guwop got more money than all these trappers
I can take a dope boy and make him go platinum
But how a drug dealer from East Atlanta go platinum?
Master P, '93, mixed with a lil Eazy-E
Dancing in the video like Puff cause I got plenty G's
Family, you sign with me
My young nigga's gonna ride with me
All my niggas gonna die with me
And all my kids bust five with me

[Hook]
All my, all my, all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All my, all my, all my children
All of these rappers are all my children
All of these rappers are all my children

[Intro: 2Pac]
Everything starts from now
You're crazy, man
You know what?
When you said that last time, I was kinda trippin', right?
But now, you're right. I am crazy
But you know what else? I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck about myself
You remember that, motherfucker
Cause I'm the one y'all need to be worried about

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
You knowin' I'm vicious
Daddy home niggas ain't doing the dishes
What is this?
For years I've been feelin' suspicious
Bout certain niggas motives and morals
And such, and like that
I done landed the ship
Parallel parked in the park in the dark
Don't be concerned if I'm makin' a grip
Own half of my masters, so muthafuck you bastards
Clones all a fuckin' round
When I step on the scene don't hear a sound
What more could I do?
So much, too much
The Chosen One has said stand up, be proud of you
And I'm here, no fear
Been hearin' all the calls, the chants, the cheers
We're clear
When I'm leavin' the show
You knew I was gon' be back to go yam on these hoes

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear the madness
I pray I lean towards the light, ya know?
I'm just livin'
Tryna stay outta' trouble, minding my own
The angels they protect me from the horror in my dome
I don't wanna have to tell you again friend
Please, leave a real nigga alone

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Goodbye cruel world
I'm leaving you today
Goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Psych ya mind, who hit'cha?
Thought I would be dead
Yeah, I figured
Nah, I'll be pullin' the trigger
Until then I'm coastin', roastin', leavin' you ghostin'
Now, Check the approach
Finesse, the best, hittin' reps
Sets, gains
Call me whatever you like
But remember one thing
Forever no matter what, I reign
We don't care about your money
You corny on and off the cob
A shame, A1 lame
A cover-up, you got no personality
Hide behind your wealth to hide oneself, sad
The shit is so twilight zone
Batman left Gotham now shits all wrong
Jokes on you Luke
Here is the Demolition Man
A nigga got a plan and I gotta
Get 'em one by one, two by two
The kids need the guidance
That real life
All in bitch you know my face
My name
The style
The catalog
Ahhhh
Cud Life the number one one
Cud Life the number one, one
Cud Life the number one, one
Under the sun
The Chosen
Fucker

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear the madness
I pray I lean towards the light, ya know?
I'm just livin'
Tryna' stay outta trouble, minding my own
The angels they protect me from the horror in my dome
I don't wanna have to tell you again friend
Please, leave a real nigga alone

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Goodbye cruel world
I'm leaving you today
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
I hit a wall, I never felt so low, so low
Like a waterfall, my tears dropped to the floor, the floor
They left a swimming pool of salted crimes, crimes
Oh, what could I do to change your mind?
Nothing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm bracing for the pain and I am letting go
I'm using all my strength to get out of this hole

[Chorus]
I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer

[Verse 2]
Yeah I hit a wall, I prayed that I would make it through, make it through
I can survive a life that's without you, that's without you, yeah
And I will rise up from the ashes now, the ashes now
Oh, the sparrow flies with just the crumbs of loving spilled, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was bracing for the pain and then I let it go
I gathered all my strength and I found myself whole

[Chorus]
I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer

[Intro]
Mc DJ
Mc DJ
Fuck Yourself!

[Verse 1]
Cool like a summertime pool in the winter
A nigga on fire, what he have for dinner
I bring home the bacon, call me breadwinner
I beat up the tracks so they call me track killer
Im thee raporilla, I heat like gorillas
So if you don't believe me you feel-a
I gotta get the million dollars
If you don't see me holla
If you tryin' to get then you swallow
I'm high as a kite, I feel fantastic
A girl on my dick so she call me nasty
I gotta make sure that my dick's in plastic
Or else I'm gonna end up inside a casket
Who the fuck's you? They call me Sick Boi
Got the Andre fever, get like Big Boi
If you try to get the kryptonite on me
You're gonna have to D-I-E

[Chorus]
The nigga is amazing
(It's Sick Boi, it's back)
The nigga is amazing
(Y'all know who it is)
The nigga is amazing
(Get wildin' like me)
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing

[Verse 2]
I put down the pen, no more writin'
So when I die they can remember me like the Titans
Call Michael Chrichton cause I'm like Congo
If you don't believe me you can suck on my bongo
I used to drive a hondo now I'm on the subway
Now my pocket's thick like that dude from Subway
You can have a hyundai, better yet a milli
I'm not Lil Weezy but my pocket size silly
My wrist not chilly, I only sport Clockers
Got the purple hoody and the purple Gobstoppers
My mama used to tell me I was lost like Chaka
Now I got the yellow truck like my name Tonka
My girlfriend ass stay fit like J-Lo
Girl and my money stay thick like Play Doh
Got to philosophize my mind like Plato
What'd y'all say though?

[Chorus]
The nigga is amazing
(See I don't play around)
The nigga is amazing
(See when I say I'mma do something)
The nigga is amazing
(I say I do something)
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
(Yo do this for real though)
The nigga is amazing
(I'mma try to kick it for real)
The nigga is amazing

[Verse 3]
Nigga I'm blazing
Nigga I'm amazing
Haters on the side line tellin me they hate me
Girls wanna date me, boys think I'm crazy
Girls always chase me like they Chasing Amy
I wanna be the play date, but if you have one
You can call me, on my cell phone
I don't believe it, I don't gotta see it
And if you don't see nothing you can sync up my penis
Women are from Venus, men are from Mars
And I'm walking down the street, while you drivin in cars
Cause I want everybody to see my new kicks
My hat broke off and my hoodie so sick
I used to know this chick, she used to be lame
Now she listen to me, now she usin' her brain
Yo I go to Bellevue cause my flow is insane, man

[Chorus Outro]
The nigga is amazing
(I said stay wildin' like me boi)
The nigga is amazing
(I came back with a vengeance)
The nigga is amazing
(I put down the pen so I could focus again)
The nigga is amazing
Fuck Yourself!
(S'why I don't write shit)
The nigga is amazing

[Verse]
You play a love affair with life
You stay and dance with every night
The moments from dawn to dusk
You chase
I am lost now
Where do I stand
In the race?

You play to empty eyes in crowded bars
I can't believe we've come this far yet got nowhere
What is there left for me in this?
Every time you play is your first kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a pass-time
I'm not your pass-time
Don't play around with me

[Chorus]
You can't play me
I'm not a melody
Don't play 'round with me

Don't play 'round with me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm not a pass-time
I'm not your pass-time
Don't play around with me

[Chorus]
You can't play me
I'm not a melody

I'm not a melody
I'm not a melody

[Chorus]
You can't play me
I'm not a melody

[Intro: Future + Usher]
She got me throwing Spades Ace with that mouth
I guess only time gon' tell
You gotta give me dirty love
I guess I'm down too
When I can't find any words I lie
Look up and see the stars in a perfect line
The feeling of love is a global thing

[Verse 1: Usher + Future]
So tell me how you feel (how you feel)
Knowing I see the world when I look in your eyes
Your kisses are Duracell, they keep me energized
Tired of going back and forth, baby I'm hypnotized
You gotta a nigga on the love on the low though
I'm looking at you and I swear it's been a long road
A great ass, a better mind, what a combo
You know you pretty and you winning with the convo
She kinda tipsy, we been drinking, she's a light weight
She love the way I'm pull them panties in the right way
But anyway let's get back to how I've been feeling
I just love the times when I'm beside ya
Holding me down cause you're my rider
I look in your eyes and I get higher
There's nothing in this world I hold tighter
Without you I feel uneven

[Chorus: Usher + Future]
Make every day our love season
Baby girl you know you're my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals
(You gotta give me that)
I put that on the Bible
(You gotta give me that girl)
You're the only thing that I want
Give me that feeling
Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
I call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals
I put that on the Bible
I'ma love ya till my time's gone
You gotta give me dirty love

[Verse 2: Usher]
I've been here and trust me, I've seen it all before though
I told my ex for me relationships a no-no
And here I am thinking we perfect like a photo
You looking at me like right now you need some mo', mo'
I know you ready and willing but that ain't my place
I know you wanna settle down, all on your face
Feeling starting to get too familiar
So cover up this broken love treason

[Chorus: Usher + Future]
Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
I call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals
I put that on the Bible
You're the only thing that I want
Give me that feeling
Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you bae that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivalsI put that on the Bible
I'ma love ya till my time's gone

[Bridge: Usher]
You say I see ya side by side
Like a visionary, I can't see me falling
(Nothing's changed)
Like a dictionary, I can't read through all this
(Eyes wide open)
I still fall blind I don't know how this will end
Let's go back to the beginning
Let's cover up this broken love treason

[Chorus: Usher]
Make every day our love season
Dirty lover you are my rider
That should be enough reason
Call you baby that's only your title
'Cause I don't need no more rivals
I put that on the Bible
You're the only thing that I want

[Outro]
Gimme that
Ay, ay
Yes you are
I love you, baby
I don't wanna be enemies, baby
I want you to be friends with me, babe
Uhhh

[Verse 1]
Hear me now, I'm sober out
If you want it, then I'm down
Here and now, we bless the sound

[Verse 2]
Feeling right, so hold tight
You and I darling, it's so fine
Feeling right, you can't deny
Your love is, your love is mine

[Chorus]
Never letting go, let's purify
Take a look and feel the sunshine
Still floating high, we sway at night

[Hook]
Your love is, your love is mine 

[x3]

[Verse 3]
Hear me now, I'm sober out
If you want it, then I'm down
Hear me now, we bless the sound

[Verse 4]
Feeling right, so hold tight
You and I darling, it's so fine
Feeling right, you can't deny
Your love is, your love it's mine

[Chorus 2]
Never letting go, let's purify
Take a look out for you, the sunshine
Still floating high, we sway at night

[Hook]
Your love is, your love is mine 

[x3]

[Intro]
Yaah, yaah
Fresh out, ha
Luda!
DTP, hey
Ludaverses, aah, you know
Lyrical exercise
Another freestyle
Listen, ha!

[Verse]
Flyer than a G6
Another Luda verse, no, this is not a remix
Leak this; so wavy you get seasick
But that's none of my business, so Kermit tea sip
He sick, we're flipping the sixteen
Addicted to getting cream, attempted to sip lean
But I'd rather take a shot of that Louis the Sixteen
That's right, I'm a fit king, see me on the big screen
April 3rd, Fast and Furious, doing these big things
Then dropping that Ludaversal same week, get me
My neck and my wrist bling from the money 'Cris bring
Black interior, but whip whiter than whipped cream
Big dreams into 2015 with steam
Cooking in the studio, serving to get fiends
Home makeover, the mansion is extreme
Game takeover, I'm balling to get rings
Groupie women looking, they trying to get seen
Money over bitches, I'm trying to get green
Dirty South criminal trying to get clean
Checkmating pawns that's trying to get kings, aah!

[Outro]
(laughs)
Yeah!
Short but sweet
March 31st, Ludaversal, baby
April 3rd, the seventh fucking installment of the Fast and Furious franchise
We work it!
I'm just getting started

[Verse 1: Jake]
Pleasurable grin breaks your face as I offer a clammy hand
The night we so cherished for days has become a foreign land
Where is the manhood I dreamed of for years and years again
A drought-ridden feeling tailored for those royal men

[Chorus: Nathan, Jake, Whistler]
I, oh oh I  (oh I), I have seen the bitter change of things (I, oh oh I)
I, oh oh I (oh I), know how you feel

[Verse 2: Jake]
Cobblestone thoughts sink their teeth into my state of mind
Eclectic as they shift and plot our own demise
Down with the ship as it sinks with summertime
Eighteen years, eighteen years

[Chorus: Nathan, Jake Whistler]
I, oh oh I  (oh I), I have seen the bitter change of things (I, oh oh I)
I, oh oh I (oh I), know how you feel
I, oh oh I  , I have seen the bitter change of things
I, oh oh I  have seen what you've become

[Bridge: Jake]
The saintly boys and girls we throw at them our cleavered words and rules to no avail
A sun-kissed moon is weak with gravity we all know
But still the books of men we pound into our lips, our ears, our skin
To cherish fates deprived of them, at times
Their death is placed with gold

[Chorus: Nathan, Jake, Whistler]
I, oh oh I  (oh I), I have seen the bitter change of things (I, oh oh I)
I, oh oh I (oh I), know how you feel

[Chorus]
Don't ya know? You're beautiful
You're different, unusual
I love your style, it's original
Seem so unreal, like you're mythical

Don't ya know?
Girl, don't ya know?
Hey, don't ya know?
I know you know

[Verse]
Baby I know that you don't see yourself as one of them
But honestly, girl, I believe that you're a hundred out of ten
You've been going through some things (I want you to feel better)
And if you're feeling cold (Here, put on my sweater)
But when you're feeling down (I hope you can remember)
I hope you can remember this

[Chorus]
Don't ya know? You're beautiful
You're different, unusual
I love your style, it's original
Seem so unreal, like you're mythical
Don't ya know?
Girl, don't ya know?
Hey, don't ya know?
I know you know
Before we go folding our clothes in a stack,
let's see what the robots think.
Before we go patting ourselves on the back,
let's see what the robots think.

Before we start working or dancing again,
before we start writing love letters to send,
before we start fighting or finding a friend,
let's see what the robots think.

[Ellen DeGeneres:]
You send things out on Twitter and sometimes, like Kim has said -- and I’ll tell you this also, I don’t know if she’s told you this along with not wanting more children -- but Kim has said…

[Kanye West:]
I’m fine to just practice.

[Ellen DeGeneres:]
That’s all you get to do. Kim said there should be a board of directors that goes through your tweets. Like, when you have an idea you give them to Kim and a bunch of people and they go, "Okay, you can tweet that" or "No, you cannot tweet that." Do you think you should have a board of directors?

[Kanye West:]
Absolutely not.

[Ellen DeGeneres:]
No?

[Kanye West:]
Yeah.

[Ellen DeGeneres:]
Everything you tweet, you think – have you regretted anything you’ve tweeted?

[Kanye West:]
Nope.

[Ellen DeGeneres:]
Nothing, never? You don’t go, "Maybe I should have thought about that a little longer"?

[Kanye West:]
What’s the point of thinking?

[Ellen DeGeneres:]
"What’s the point of thinking…" Well, sometimes I understand, but sometimes there is a point to thinking. And then you tweeted out that you want Mark Zuckerberg to give you $53 million. In hindsight, should of that have gone on Facebook?

[Kanye West:]
Yes.

[Ellen DeGeneres:]
Yes.

[Kanye West:]
I could've put that on Facebook, now I understand why he didn’t hit me back.

[Ellen DeGeneres:]
Yeah.

[Kanye West:]
I understand that Zuckerberg doesn’t use Twitter.

[Ellen DeGeneres:]
Yeah.

[Kanye West:]
Even though I have had dinner with him and his wife and told them about how I wanted to help the world and he said he’d help me and then blah, blah, bla, like... and that’s how it feels though, you know? It’s like the pursuit of happiness, like it’s like, you’re trying to sell this bone density machine or something. You know, like in that movie. I feel that if I had more resources, I could help more people. I have ideas that can make the human race existence, within our 100 years, better. Period.

Fuck the paparazzi, whatever perception you have of me, starting with the truth, starting with- starting with what everyone’s thinking. Start there... put some dope shit with it.

[Applause]

[Ellen DeGeneres:]
Ok, I’m with you on –

[Kanye West:]
'Ye is in the building! Put your motherfucking hands in the air right now! Put your hands in the air right now! Yeah, okay.

[Ellen DeGeneres:]
I’m with you on the truth part. When you say put some dope shit with it. Give me one example, the ideas, 'cause maybe someone watching will give you the money.

[Kanye West:]
We’re in a renaissance period. We’re in a place where people are, like, multi-disciplined artists. Like Steve McQueen that directed 12 Years a Slave; he was considered to just be a photographer, but then he won an Oscar. We’re not in a place where people can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life. So the exact amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything I put into my music, I put them into shoes and they worked.

You know, people never write, "Kanye’s pissing everybody off." They try to position that through the media in some way that I’m like, "Whatever." Whatever your friends might say, you know, "I saw Kanye." "How was he? Did he…?" I care about people. I care about– my dad lived in homeless shelters less than five years ago to find out he’s a psych major. My mom was the first black female chair of the English department at Chicago State University. I was raised to do something, to make a difference.

[Applause]
To take– you know, I didn’t take the Oscars as a joke. It was funny. You know what I’m saying, it was like the moment. All black actors can talk about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this town. And this is the moment. "You get your night. Go ahead. Chris Rock is going to do it, bam! Talk about how many times you’ve been blocked from being able to excel."

I didn’t take it as a joke. "It ain’t no joke," as Rakim said. It ain’t no joke. "I used to let the mic smoke, now I slam it and make sure it’s broke." That’s what I was raised on – Rakim, Phife Dawg, hip-hop, expression. "Hip hop started out in the park…"

Everybody’s trying to… I don’t give a fuck how much you sold, if you’re playing on radio. Are you connecting? Picasso is dead. Steve Jobs is dead. Walt Disney is dead. Name somebody living that you can name in the same breath as them. Don’t tell me about being likable.

We got 100 years here. We’re one race, the human race, one civilization. We’re a blip in the existence of the universe, and we constantly try to pull each other down. Not doing things to help each other. That’s my point. It’s like I’m shaking talking about it. I know it’s daytime TV, but I feel I can make a difference while I’m here. I feel that I can make things better through my skill set. Through my skills– I’m an artist. Five years old, art school Ph.D, Art Institute of Chicago. I am an artist. I have a condition called synesthesia where I see sounds. I see them. Everything that I sonically make is a painting. I see it. I see the importance– I see the importance in the value of everyone being able to experience a more beautiful life.

When I make clothes… It’s funny because I’ll sit there with Obama and Leo’s talking about the environment and I’m talking about clothes and everyone looks at me like, "That’s not an important issue." But I remember going to school in fifth grade and wanting to have a cool outfit. I called the head of Payless. I’m like, "I want to work with you." I want to take all this information that I’ve learned from sitting in all these fashion shows and knocking on all these doors and buying all these expensive clothes, and I want to take away bullying.

[Extended applause]

You know, I want to- Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is the reason I was able to go so far in music. There was a time when Michael Jackson couldn’t get his video on MTV because he was considered to be "urban." The Michael Jackson. So I literally have to be Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break open the doors of everyone that will come after I’m gone. After I’m dead. After they call me "Wacko Kanye."

[Audience chuckles]

Isn’t that so funny? That people point fingers at the people who have influenced us the most. They talk the most shit about the people who cared the most. I’m sorry, daytime television. I’m sorry for the realness.

[Applause]

[Ellen DeGeneres:]
Well, it’s not daytime television anymore. We’re going to take a break and we are going to come back, we’re going to play 5 Second Rule, which should be very fun with Kanye.

[Verse]
Hey mama, I did it! I'm finally here!
Diamonds on my neck cost a 60, plus a cool 5
Chickens lined up in the kitchen like Kentucky drive
Brother on my side, on his hip, that's a 4-5
Never a bum, I rather Hi-Tech over rum
You dap me up, I know you see me shining from pinky finger to thumb
We having traffic, I cause static up in the attic like Dish network
I'm top floor by the bluest shore
That's Lil Boat with the biggest ego, flyer than a seagull
Every time you see me out you know it's a movie like Regal
Cinema, Lil Chrissy, that's my photographer
Lil Boat, he going very far, burnin' up like Sean Paul
Lil Boat!

[Verse 1: Jake]
Sula, I can hear
The flood that is coming to dry your fiery tears
Sula, a flock of robins in flight
Oh mystery, how you touched me with your eyes

[Chorus: Jake]
Oh started
I forget
You never want to hear the echo of my voice
Sula, Sula
You made men
A fickle game that you knew how to play
And could understand

[Post-Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
I wish you were gone
I wish you were gone
Oh, I used to think that you took it all
But instead you really took a fall girl
Ooh, aah

[Bridge: Jake]
I'll be waiting for ya
I'll be waiting for ya
To be a modest savior
To be a modest savior
I'll be waiting for ya
I'll be waiting for ya
I'll be waiting for ya
I'll be waiting for ya

[Interlude: Zach, Whistler]
Leave me alone, coach!
I don't wanna play sports anymore!

I'm a nihilist.
A complete
and perfect
nihilist.

Life has no meaning. No point.

Happiness is a chemical coincidence and nothing else
(still "else" though nothing to begin with).

Value is a vast vault of black,
a black that dictates lack.

Oh, and that accidental rhyme just then meant nothing.

Why are you color-coding things?
WHY?!
What's the point, fascist?

I come from the Land of Really Fucked Thoughts,
where babies are bound by umbilical knots,
where dead horses pile on dandruff-stuffed cots,
where burn-victim monkeys drink blood-and-pus shots.

I come from the Land of That Just Ain't Right,
where young boys like fisting their hamsters at night,
where boxers use AIDS-ridden needles to fight,
where an Alzheimer's orgy's a regular sight.

I don't want to stay but I know I can't leave it.
I needed to tell you but please don't reread it.
I hope this sounds silly and you can't conceive it,
because you're here the second you believe it.
Life, man.
Life is a river.
It twists and turns and has fish.
Life is hope. Hope is love.
So transitively, love is a river, too.
Pretty neat, huh?

[Intro: Martin Luther King Jr.]
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable rights" of "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." We refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. So we have come to cash this check — a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'ma walk, I'ma march on the regular
Painting white flags blue
Lord forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames
Sing it, y'all

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof
Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Meet me at the finish line
40 acres, gimme mine
Revolution televised
Hopin' that you see the signs
Meet me at the finish line
40 acres, gimme mine
Lemonade all the time, keep that in mind
Formation, formation
Exclamation, formation
Fellow great Americans, hello
This is heritage for my medicine
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights aimin' in my direction
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire marshalls and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Obviously guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar + Beyoncé]
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
Hear me out
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!

We'll be road-tripping, rolling with the top down
Southbound, little bikinis in white sand

[Verse 1]
I can't sleep, gotta leave
The summer sun is starting to peak
Through my window, lettin' me know
Time's up, it's time that we go
Got a lead foot waiting and a pocket full of cash
Cooler full of beer and a little something stashed
In the back of the car
So relax, there ain't a beach too far

[Chorus]
We'll be road-tripping, rolling with the top down
Southbound, little bikinis in white sand (Hell yeah)
In a tank top, gonna let the guns out
All about rocking that farmer's tan

Bunch of (Hey), kick back and chill out ahead of me
Gettin' wild, raisin' hell, and leavin' this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now

Got that Daiquiri kiss, the kind when it hits
Makes you wanna get goin' there, wherever that is

Southbound, little bikinis in white sand (Hell yeah)
In a tank top, gonna let the guns out

You was good on the low
For a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list

Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage

Oooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less

But baby ooo, you needed me

Had some fun on the run though, I give it to ya

Black can let you move forward
And black will make you stumble around (Black is so hot)

[Verse]
Do you ever try and face yourself, goodnight
Or is it easier with your friend?
Pretend your friend's enough to end
You were just another loud mouth, cute-faced girl
Could you press skin and taking over the world
You're not the only one in the world
You choose to see me, even with all this glee

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you okay?
What's in your way?

[Chorus]
Are you sleeping with the lights on baby?
(Hands up, get out, hands up, get out)
Keep your hood off when you're walking 'cause they

Sure enough they're gonna take your body, mhm

Ding, ding, dong, ding on your doorstep
How could you be so shallow?
Some things are so hard to swallow
But I'm still pop, poppin' bottles
Cause it's sunny out, and the money out
So now I got a chance to help Anny out
Super, super
Super, super, super, super, superheroes in the buildin'
Children please stay children
When the money come around they come around
'Member good times, great sounds downtown
When the money come around they come around
'Member good times, great sounds downtown
When the money come around they come around

Close the curtain, close the curtain

You know what we started with
And look at what we did with it

[Pre-Hook]
And if you don't want savin' then I'll let you drown

These lessons are dangerous, I can't even explain 'em
These lessons, teacher, can you hear me now?

And this ain't how she raised you, she wouldn't be proud
And if you don't want savin' then I'll let you drown
And this ain't how she raised you, she wouldn't be proud
Rest, rest, rest on the leaves
Death, death, death in front of me
Alien, I'm a myth, baby I'm a beast
If you don't want confrontation I suggest you leave
This a fire, this a noise, baby this my team
Couldn't be a student cause I had to teach
Couldn't use a pen cause I had to lead
Cause I had to lead
Cause I had to lead
They'll kill me if I stay so I gotta leave
More liquor stores than a place to get your groceries
Sellin' cancer sticks but they bug me when I smoke my weed
See I gotta make a difference in society
Death, death, death
In front of me
You don't want none with me
You don't want none with
Death, death, death

You're not supposed to know about this
But should I really save her?

Have to go hard with the hell hole
In a strip club with a lot of hoe
With a lot of hoe, y'all niggas know how the life goes
With a lot a goals, top floor of the Bellagio
Suite full of them Spanish hoes, I can manage
Suite full of them Spanish hoes, I can manage yow

Dreaming of a life of staying in

[Chorus]
You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in
You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in

[Verse 2]
Begging, begging for the ending

You chose to fade away with him

Silence on my estate

[Verse 1: Dev Hynes]
Ninety-nine percent, I know you're not fine
Now everyone could be mistakenly kind
Niggas in the back try and act blind
Seven ways to think about your eyesight

[Pre-Chorus: Dev Hynes + Carly Rae Jepsen]
Say what you will, what you want
Know it's not the time that you can
Receiving a gift of change with a kiss
When nights alone and nights you're bored
And can't resist or miss the chance of being who they think they think you are
How long before your journey will end in sweet stone?
Walls inside of me that then tell me to breathe
That shake your hand and thank the man for just letting it be

[Chorus: Dev Hynes + Carly Rae Jepsen]
Know my worth and fake the blame
But I know she's better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
But I know he's better than me
Why choose love when hate comes first?
And I know they're better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
But I know he's better than me

[Verse 2: Carly Rae Jepsen]
Ninety-nine percent, I know you're not fine
Now everyone could be mistakenly kind

[Pre-Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen + Dev Hynes]
Say what you will, what you want
Know it's not the time that you can
Receiving a gift of change with a kiss
When nights alone and nights you're bored
And can't resist or miss the chance of being who they think they think you are
How long before your journey will end in sweet stone?
Walls inside of me that then tell me to breathe
That shake your hand and thank the man for just letting it be

[Chorus: Dev Hynes + Carly Rae Jepsen + Starchild]
Know my worth and fake the blame
But I know she's better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
But I know he's better than me
Why choose love when hate comes first?
And I know they're better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
But I know he's better than me

[Outro: Dev Hynes + Carly Rae Jepsen]
I know he's better
And I know and I know and I know
He's better than me
Change your ways
And i know he's better than me
I i.. know....
Better than me
And i know he's better than me
He's just better
He's just better than me

[Verse 1]
My father was a young man
My mother, off the boat
My eyes were fresh at 21
Bruised, but still afloat
Our heads have hit the pavement
Many times before
You stroke his face to soothe him
While knowing that there’s more

[Chorus]
See, Augustine
Late have I loved and chose to see
Skin on his skin
A warmth that I can feel with him

[Verse 2]
And no one even told me
The way that you should feel
Tell me, did you lose your son?
Tell me, did you lose your love?
Cry and burst my deafness
While Trayvon falls asleep
The things that I can't do to you
The things that I can't do to you

[Chorus]
See, Augustine
Late have I loved and chose to see
Skin on his skin
A warmth that I can feel with him

[Outro: Blood Orange + Ava Raiin]

Candy coated birth 2 inches off the ground

Off the lean diamonds gleaming start to thinking (lil mama you got me fiending)
Her pinky ring is looking like a bedrock

[Verse 1: Empress Of]
Call it all for nothing
But I'd rather be nothing to you
Than be a part of something
Of something that I didn't do

[Chorus: (Dev Hynes) + Empress Of]
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
Who can be the best to you, be the best to you
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
Who can be the best to you, be the best to you

[Verse 2: Empress Of]
Part of me is faking
Faking it all just for fun
Part of me is breaking
Breaking apart when you come

Who can be the best to you, be the best to you (Oh)

I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
Who can be the best to you, be the best to you

[Bridge: Empress Of]
I feel my bones, I feel my bones, I feel my bones crack in your arms
And I can tell you what you want but I tell you all the things I like
And if I keep myself away, would you chase in the dead of night?
And I can't be the girl you want but I can be the thing you
Throw away, throw away, throw away
Throw away, throw away, you throw away
Throw away, throw away, throw away
Throw away, throw away, you throw away

[Chorus: (Dev Hynes) + Empress Of]
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
I can be the best to you, be the best to you (Oh)
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
I can be the best to you, be the best to you

[Verse: Blood Orange, Ian Isiah and Ava Raiin]
Oh, they took and skinned my name
Try to raise the feeling
I saw right through, tried to love them
They threw it in your face
Tell you what you're feeling
How could they know?
It's what they read
So when you see her cry
You know there's nothing new
It's how we could all by ourselves

[Spoken Word: Ashlee Haze]
I will show you a 26 year old woman
Who learned to dance until she felt pretty
Feminism wears a throwback jersey
Bamboo earrings, and a face beat for the gods
Feminism is Da Brat, Missy Elliott, Lil Kim, and
Angie Martinez on the “Not Tonight” track
Feminism says as a woman in my arena
You are not my competition
As a woman in my arena your light
Doesn’t make mine any dimmer
Dear Missy:
I did not grow up to be you
But I did grow up to be me
And to be in love with who this woman is
To be a woman playing a man’s game
And not be apologetic about any of it
If you ask me why representation is important
I will tell you that on the days I don’t feel pretty
I hear the sweet voice of Missy singing to me
Pop that pop that, jiggle that fat
Don’t stop, get it til your clothes get wet
I will tell you that right now
There are a million black girls just waiting
To see someone who looks like them

[Intro]
Genesis, chapter eleven, verse ten
Explains the genealogy of Shem
Shem was a black man, in Africa
If you repeat this fact, they can't laugh at ya

[Verse 1]
Seem to not take it too well
When I tell you that it's not the reason I fell
Then you know just how he felt
When you look at how you gave enough chance to sell

[Break]
All I ever wanted was a chance for myself

[Verse 2]
Why the fuck do you even speak?
It's not a choice of speech, and it sure ain't free
Wear your braids to keep your edge
Stay in your corner, fuck you up, we lost our chill

[Chorus: Blood Orange + Kelsey Lu]
All you ever wanted was a chance for yourself
To represent a thing that we have started to build
Why refresh your soul and my spirit for them?
All I ever wanted was a chance for myself

[Bridge: Blood Orange + Kelsey Lu]
Been chewed up but it makes you proud
You're the dark skinned nigga in a sold out crowd
Looking at the girl with the thick, blonde braids
And you're tryin' to make out what her t-shirt says
No one really ever cares what 'thug life' means
They wanna be surrounded but they hate to breathe
The air is thick as I plan my escape

[Outro]
All I ever wanted was a chance for myself

[Spoken Intro: Venus Xtravaganza, Unidentified Woman, & Jennie Livingston]

...later because of the fact that we're waiting for the working girls to get there
And what is it those girls are doing?
Well, they're making money for the balls, or they're making their costumes, their outfits, or, you know, getting, getting it together like that
What is their profession?
Something like that. At times they do expect sexual favors, but that is between myself and them, so I do not wish to further speak about that. If they do
But at most times, 99% of the time they don't... 95% of the time they don't. What I feel like...

[Refrain]
(Desirée)
(Desirée)

[Verse 1]
Dance cause it's your thing
Say that you've got time for two
These'll stay in New York
(Desirée)
Is anyone your friend?
Or lovers that turn up at two?
Begin your stay in New York
(Desirée)

[Hook]
Can you really think it's fine or cool when you're still on your go?
Maybe it's a chance for me to go and finally be alone
Can you really think it's fine or cool when you're still on your go?
Maybe it's a chance for me to go and finally be alone

[Spoken Interlude: Venus Xtravaganza]
If you're married, a woman, in the suburbs... A regular woman, is married to her husband, and she wants him to buy her, a washer and dryer set. In order for him to buy that, I'm sure she'd have to go bed with him anyway to give him what he wants, for her to get what she wants. So in the long run, it all ends up the same way

[Outro]
(Desirée)
(Desirée)

[Hook: Ava Raiin]
Thank you for the promise of your faith
Thank you for your all your praise
Even if you promise me away
Out of your gaze escape

[Verse: Blood Orange]
What's good has gotten me with everything I know
Everything I know has tested me for now
I'm used to thinking about the high state of God
And how we can break down, and what's it all about

[Pre-Hook: Blood Orange]
Anything you want to do (I feel it coming, too)
Anything because of you (I feel it on your soul)
Anything you want to do (Can't even tell you what's wrong)
Anything because of you

I know it's hard to talk, but I can see you try
I know you've had to walk alongside your foe

[Hook: Ava Raiin]
Thank you for the promise of your faith (your faith)
Thank you for all your praise
Even if you promise me away
Out of your gaze escape

[Spoken Interlude]
Yeah man, c'mon
All the nonsense got to cease

[Hook: Ava Raiin]
Thank you for the promise of your faith
Thank you for your all your praise
Even if you promise me away
Out of your gaze escape

...Why don't we...

[Outro Sample: Pos]
Let me tell you what it's all about
A skin not considered equal
A meteor has more right than my people

[Verse 1]
Seen it all before
Could this take too long?
A prayer is all you need
And it's all that was told to me
Stripped of all that's left
Tell me what is right
And never let me ask
If it's all that was told to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't see the changes even if I can't explain it
But the presence of a lover with the faces of a mother
It's warm
What is it we're lookin' for if common sense is just the law
And all my teacher preaches is maybe that something is wrong

[Chorus]
Mary
Our lady Africa
You promised us a home
But never while we're young
Oh Mary
Our lady Africa
Please don't leave them alone
May your Son's law of love

[Verse 2]
Stripped of what is left
Tell me what is right
And never let me ask
If it's all that was told to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Couldn't see the changes even if I can't explain it
But the presence of a lover with the faces of a mother
It's warm
What is it we're lookin' for if comman sense is just the law
And all my teacher preaches is maybe that something is wrong

[Chorus]
Mary
Our lady Africa
You promised us a home
But never while we're young
Oh Mary
Our lady Africa
Please don't leave them alone
May your Son's law of love

[Outro]
Feeling old
Knowing that the dream you sold
How'd you make it to your goal?
Once ago
Time you know
Heat you felt when you were cold
It's real as gold
Chains and all
All the things that make us bold
Make us bold
Black is gold
Rightly so
Feeling old
Knowing that the dream you sold
How'd you make it to your goal?
Once ago
Time you know
Heat you felt when you were cold
It's real as gold
Chains and all
All the things that make us bold
Make us bold
Black is gold
Rightly so

[Intro]
And you never heard a sound like this before
Back, still hot, and you want some more?

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I said that c-c-can't be her's
All that bottom b-b-bottom
Then again, that might be hers
U-up top and get my dollars fo' sure
Then I meet my mama let's go
Think about this girl all 24
My mind, her whistle she blow
Make me wanna li-lick her below
I talk about her, shawty fly
I wanna-wanna be the pilot
Perfect girl, shawty shy
And I can't keep silent
Tell my brother, my ex-lover
All my homies and my uncle damn
There she is, I'mma be quiet
Listen carefully

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
Even got me talkin' bout you, baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on, on and on and on
On and on and on 'bout you, baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body's got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on, on and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
I-I can feel her love, she's a model, super model, I know
Look at that-that strut, that Coca bottle, b-b-ottle, hello

We can flip a coin and I want both
Her head, her tails, I'm obsessed with this female
And her chest like, oh, jewels
She's so blessed, mmm-mmm she smells

This girl make me wanna fu- I mean cut
Action totally, it's some attraction
Mmm! There she go again

On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 1]
Can you feel the way they think about me?
Through the years
Told me I should just be myself
I'm better than they thought
If it's true why am I so fearful to the girl?
Tryna walk home slowly herself
Not to scare her off

[Chorus]
And if you don't know what that means
Don't tell me that it's true
Teach yourself about your brother
'Cause there's no one else but you
You are special in your own way
You are special in your own way

[Verse 2]
Can you see the nigga in my face?
And I stay, uh
Given in the place of our hands
It's just another thought
(Just another thought)

[Chorus]
And if you don't know what that means (No, no, that means)
Don't tell me that it's true (No, no)
Teach yourself about your brother (Ah, ah)
'Cause there's no one else but you
You are special in your own way
You are special in your own way, mhm

[Bridge]
Could it be, or can it
Can you breathe without air?
All you ever wanted to know, uh
Life is just a dream if you could see without him
Tired of never wanting to know, mhm

[Chorus]
If you don't know what that means
Don't tell me that it's true
Teach yourself about your brother
'Cause there's no one else but you
You are special in your own way, uh
You are special in your own way
You are special in your own way (Special, you're special)
You are special in your own way, way

[Verse 1]
Save your eyes
You learn to choose to free your mind
She's not right
You really think it's just the times

[Chorus]
And does your mother know you cry?
Choosin' what you live for
It's never what you make your life

[Verse 2]
Save your eyes
Learn to choose to free your mind
She's not right
You really think it's just the times

[Chorus]
And does your mother know you cry?
Choosin' what you live for
It's never what you make your life

[Verse 3]
Time we know
Everything is said before
She's not right
You really think it's just the times

[Chorus]
And does your mother know you cry?
Do you ever think, boy?
Or does it just feel better numb?

[Outro: Ta-Nehisi Coates (Interview Sample) + Dev Hynes]
E-every morning, how I, ya know, was gonna wear my backpack
Was I gonna strap it over one shoulder or two shoulders?
How was I gonna cock my baseball hat?
(You chose to fade away with him)
Was I gonna, ya know, wear it straight, cock it to the left, cock it to the right?
How was I gonna wear my pants?
Was I gonna wear 'em really baggy, or not?
(I chose to try and let you in)
Which shoes was I gonna wear?
Who was I gonna walk with to school?
How many of 'em were gonna...

[Intro]
I can never force your way
The way you speak about your face
I know that it's not mine to change
Know that it's not mine to change

How can I be unafraid
When your chair's in when I'm awake?
I know that it's not mine to change
Know that it's not mine to change

[Interlude]
(What's with your evolving view?)
I know that it's not mine to change
(What's with your evolving view?)
I know that it's not mine to change
Know that it's not mine to change

[Verse]
Choose your worth and say it's not there
Split your worries 'cause you know he won't care
Late nights hiding from the thoughts that scare
Choose your worth and say something
I know that it's not mine to change
I know that it's not mine to change
I know that it's not mine to change

[Outro]
I could never force your way
The way you speak about your face
I know that it's not mine to change
Know that it's not mine to change

[Verse 1: Dev Hynes]
Two step in the cut
Spotlights in the cut
Chances are you never saw
What made you who you are
So take a bow cause it's done
Your awful dreams are gone
And scars remain of running away
And hiding 'fore they come

[Verse 2: Dev Hynes]
See you want a place that stand still
A place to cure your ills
A place to save your face
And keep you calm when you're uphill
You'll never be the best
She'll never turn you on
And scars remain from running away
And hiding where you're from

[Pre-Chorus: Debbie Harry]
Don't use my name
It makes me wonder
Will I ever be enough?
Don't call again
I couldn't answer
My deviation sets it off

[Chorus: Dev Hynes]
Choosing what you live for
It's never what you make your life
How could you know
If you're squandering your passion for another?
Do you ever think, boy?
Or does it just feel better alone?
Feeling the comfort of sadness in a new set of surroundings

[Bridge: Debbie Harry]
Use my name
Call again

[Chorus: Dev Hynes]
Choosing what you live for
It's never what you make your life
How could you know
If you're squandering your passion for another? (Oh, mhm)
Do you ever think, boy? (Woo)
Or does it just feel better alone?
Feeling the comfort of sadness in a new set of surroundings (Mhm)

[Chorus: Dev Hynes & Debbie Harry]
Choosing what you live for
It's never what you make your life
How could you know
If you're squandering your passion for another?
Do you ever think, boy?
Or does it just feel better alone?
Feeling the comfort of sadness in a new set of surroundings

[Intro]
Man (Blood red), this is it (Divine Bars, stupid)
This is what they’ve been waitin' for baby
This is what they’ve been waitin' for
They’ve been waitin' for the dog to scratch
They’ve been waitin' for the dog to scratch (Blood red)
Already got Grand Champ status
Tell me how they feel about this? Rrr

[Verse 1]
All I see red, blood red (Blood red)
Fuck that nigga said? One, dead
Gun to the head, didn’t run, instead
Washed my hands and face in his his bloodshed
Never had it all, I was born tormented
Fuck apologizin', if I said it, I meant it
If I don’t like you, fuck you, never pretendin’
Crashed, blew up and burned, that’s how it ended
Urban legend, I heard it mentioned
Dog is right at home in the dirt and trenches
My birth’s intentions, was first a sentence
Of life without parole for the worst offenses
Senseless slaughters, kicked open the door
And everybody gotta die, wives, sons and daughters
My orders were clear from the start
First, turn off the lights, then murder whatever moves in the dark, nigga, uh

[Chorus]
Blood red (Uh), blood red
Man, if they don’t know by now, they about to find out (Rrr)
Blood red (Uh), blood red (Uh)
How the dog get down, and what the dog is about (Oww)

[Verse 2]
Even though I know it is the truth (Man), you don’t mean it (Cuz)
You haven’t earned it (Cuz), you haven’t seen it (Cuz)
Nightmare, 'cause all you can do is dream it (Uh)
You run from it, I end up in between it (Yeah)
What was the first curse, turned into a blessing
What burned, as it was learned, turned into a weapon
Built for war, bitch ass nigga
That shit I’ma spit will get you killed through the door
Found ‘em on the floor, the fetal position
There is no 'or,' came here with leave ‘em intentions
Thought shit was funny, like shit you was sayin' was ill
Until you made that left turn, and shit got real
When it come to rap, you cats got it all wrong
Got bars for days, but can’t make a song
If you did half of what you said when you was flappin' your jaw
Push them bricks, fuck is you rappin' for, nigga?

[Chorus]
Blood red, blood red
Man, if they don’t know by now, they 'bout to find out (Uh)
Blood red, blood red
How the dog get down, and what the dog is about (Rrr), motherfucker
Blood red, blood red
If they don't know by now, they 'bout to find out
Blood red, blood red
How the dog get down and what dog's about, uh
Blood red, blood red
It wasn't, they not ready
They n-they not ready, they not ready
They not ready, they not ready, they not ready
Blood red, blood red
They not ready, they not ready, they not ready
They not ready, they not ready! C'mon, man

[Outro]
Uh (Blood red)
I'm not playin'
It is not a fuckin' game

'Cause every light bulb's blown and I'm feeling so inclined

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
You would think I speak another language
Niggas just don't understand it
I done took shots for the cameras
I done ducked shots when they came for us
It was just me and my niggas
Wasn't nobody else riding
Let a nigga find bodies killer
He gon' put one up inside him
And my eyes still low
Ain't shit change, on my grind still, bro
Got a Summer full of shows
And a phone full of hoes
Cause my life kinda ideal, yo
Ain't the one you wanna try here
You just a rookie in the game and you lookin' at the top tier
And my niggas got no fear
You ain't got enough niggas so you don't go nowhere
I got a crib out in California
I got a three-year old kid so I live out in California
But shit's real out in California
You take a loss, ayy, that's just how it is out in California
But anywhere niggas run up on ya
You better watch yourself, you beat and got yourself
They gon' catch you out of bounds where you not yourself
Be a lesson that you learn, you done taught yourself
The fuck niggas runnin' they mouth
The real ones out getting paper
I'mma hit the studio now
Then go fuck a bitch later
Bad bitch from down south
Cook food with hella good flavor
I'mma get money in pounds
I ain't got time to go save her

[Hook: Juju Gotti (Wiz Khalifa)]
Fuck nigga better what your tone

(No, no)
Been killing these niggas so long
This shit feeling like a mismatch

[Verse 2: Juju Gotti]

[Verse 2]
Fuck nigga stop dapping me off
Unless you talking bout the money
You a duck nigga and you soft
Please stay the fuck from around me
A muthafuckin' lame nigga make me sick
Joker, fuck you and your homies
Talk is cheaper than a bitch
If you a real nigga gotta show me
Back when I didn't have shit
Niggas act like they ain't know me
I was sleeping outside by the ditch
All of my potnas got phony
Everybody stop answering their phone
Nigga that shit was so lonely
I was scraping up $1.24 for a lil pack of bologna
Now I got the chips with the dip
And all these bitches back on me
Throwing hundreds in the air like Wilt
Cutting niggas off like Tony
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money
Nigga turn down your convo
Kush got me like a mummy
Got my shirt off like Tonto

[Hook: Juju Gotti (Wiz Khalifa)]
Fuck nigga better what your tone
All that talking I ain't with that
(No, no)
All that shit in your song
Boy stop you ain't never did that
(No, no)
Your hoe don't wanna go home
All in her stomach like a six pack
(No, no)
Been killing these niggas so long
This shit feeling like a mismatch

[Verse 1: Elton John]
At seventeen, she became the queen of Orleans
A peasant child guided by a vivid dream
She was cool before they knew what cool became
She cut her hair and cross-dressed in a dangerous age
She set a trend, a natural look was all the rage
Imagine if they'd had merchandise and poster sales
This bride of God, bigger than Elvis in her day
She had it all until they burned it all away

[Chorus]
She swung a sword
She rode a horse
She wore her armor for the Lord
But did she cry by candlelight?
Was she lonely after dark?
Did she pray for something more?
Did anybody sleep with Joan Of Arc?

[Verse 2: Elton John]
She was small and more or less of common breed
But saint aside, no stranger to a woman's needs
No handsome knights, no random acts of chivalry
Her bed remained a simple place for her to sleep

[Chorus]
She swung a sword
She rode a horse
She wore her armor for the Lord
But did she cry by candlelight?
Was she lonely after dark?
Did she pray for something more?
Did anybody sleep with Joan Of Arc?

[Bridge: Elton John]
They burned her down for her belief
They burned her down for her faith
They gave her up into the flames
Proclaiming she'd seen heaven's face

[Chorus]
She swung a sword
She rode a horse
She wore her armor for the Lord
But did she cry by candlelight?
Was she lonely after dark?
Did she pray for something more?
Did anybody sleep with Joan Of Arc?

[Outro: Elton John]
They burned her down for her belief
They burned her down for her faith
They gave her up into the flames
Proclaiming she'd seen heaven's face
Did anybody sleep with Joan of Arc?
They burned her down for her belief
They burned her down for her faith
They gave her up into the flames
Proclaiming she'd seen heaven's face
Did anybody sleep with Joan of Arc?

[Verse 1]
When the stars align
And your fate is near
Do you know who you can turn to
When you filled with fear
I look into the heavens
And ask my god
Holding back my tears, I ask if it's okay to cry
Want the white picket fence with the red door
If it's the white one, I'ma throw a fit
I mean you work so hard for this life, lord
But there be lives just hustling to live
It's a never ending search
For my balance, it's a challenge
But I try to make it work
For a lesson, I ask questions like

[Hook]
When I'm dead and gone
Will I lose everything I remember
Will my guilt be the only thing I'm left of
Did I make my father proud
Tell me, when I'm dead and gone
Will I ever tell her she my real love
Did I ever get rid of the pressure
Did I make my momma proud
Howling at the moon like
I'm just trying to find myself tonight
Alright, okay, howling at the moon like
All I want is ease in my life tonight, alright, okay

[Verse 2]
I'm thinking too much, R.I.P. to my sanity
Arrivederci, don't mask your lies for a masterpiece
All I've got in my pocket is a little bit of love, and a rocketship
It's not much like the tattoo on your wrist
But when I'm dead, I'll miss you and them luscious lips
Take me away
Into another world where the chosen ones
Ain't the only ones
It's a never ending search
For my balance, it's a challenge
But I try to make it work
For a lesson, I ask questions like

[Bridge]
Livin', livin' in a pack of wolves
I don't know if this is meant to choose

[Intro: skit/fragment]
Did your family grow up in this
Check this out, Hell no, my family ain't grow up in this
I'm a mothafuckin' black sheep nigga
I'm a black sheep nigga
I'm the holy one
All my family graduated, nigga I said fuck that

[Verse 1]
Fuck graduating
Fuck scholarships
Fuck the teachers that told me that leading was a hit or miss
Diamond in the rough (rough)
Man, I hate this pressure shit
Life versus me, like my shit was never meant for it
Used to work at Hollister, had to go and quit it bruh
Couldn't handle 9 to 5's, I needed something different cause
I be a different type of guy, please notice before I die
Wait a second, hold up
(I'm from the motherfucking west-side)
Hit my bitch in bad style
Don't you know I bed lies
I don't play them petty games, that be for them pet guys
Speeding through my life, this is everything I write
Fuck your standards and your manners
Never worry bout your likes
(Think I'm next NOW)
Word up to my London chick
She done told me that the old me stuck up in a sunken ship
Well I'm glad
Let me pass, working like I need a tip
I'm that motherfucking nigga with that motherfucking shit
Got 6 hundred to my name, three is for these beats
Other half is if I end up broke up in these fucking streets
I ain't angry, I'm just raging
Let my stress out I'm just pacing
Dreams be what the fuck I'm chasing
See success is what I seek
Like (wagwarn, bumbaclart)
Ay, tell me what the dealio
Fucking with somebody who don't fuck with you is silly, bro
Skin is like she Reese's
Doing three lines like Adidas
And I be so north-west, you'd think my father's name was Yeezus
Silly nigga what you think
Me plus your chick is a perfect match
And you can not debate
I'm that boy like I'm rich
Plus I'm casin' like I'm Nick
I got hoes in different coasts
And they wanna hear me spit like

[Verse 2]
On this bus, currently writing up this song
Passengers keeps staring at me cause I'm mumbling all alone
Wonder if society tryna' help or take me out my zone
Be you, not them
Please don't cling onto the clones, man
My niggas getting married
My niggas having babies
And I feel kid-ish spending moolah on the dreams I'm chasing
I guess it's heaven sent
Don't need the evidence
I probably should saved my savings just to pay my debt
Patience be the key
And your future be the lock
Know your dreams is like it's heaven
Everybody want a spot so
Dream on, dream on
Till your time's up on the clock
Don't give up no matter what, you see this dream is all you got
Look, just to keep it kosher
So I do what I'm supposed to
I'm lost up in this beat, I think I might end up on  posters
Girls be the controllers, try to catch us like ebola
These hoes is all plastic like my grandmomma's sofa, nigga

[Verse 1]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back
It won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?

[Verse 2]
Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

[Chorus]
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

[Bridge]
They're playin' our sound
Layin' us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a knife

[Chorus]
Six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Bloom
Bloom
Again

[Outro]
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you

[Verse 1]
Everybody, near and far
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
Come together as you are
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)
To the ocean, to the sky
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
Sing that cosmic lullaby
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)
Sing the hajanga

[Verse 2]
Sing your pleasure, sing your pain
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
Like you’ll never sing again
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)
Let it echo, loud and clear
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
Across the ancient stratosphere
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)

[Chorus 1]
Even when the sun refuse to shine
There’s a song of love that never dies
Even when the good days pass you by
Lift your voices to the sky, singin'
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 3]
As the words go round and round
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
Let the tears roll down and down
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)
Sing the way you wish to be
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
And let that singing set you free
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)

[Chorus 2]
Even when those dark clouds bring you down
There’s a spark of joy that can be found
Even when things break and fall apart
Lift your hands up from your heart, singin'
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Bridge]
Said, every morning and every night
Through the darkness to the light
Like a beacon shining bright
Sing the hajanga, you’ll be alright
From the winter comes the spring
It don’t matter what life will bring
Said, you can do most anything
So give your hajanga a song to sing
Tell your mama, tell your pa
Sing it near and sing it far
Be exactly the way you are
See the hajanga, it’s your guiding star
Every woman to every man
In every nation, every land
I said, please you’ve gotta understand
Sing the hajanga and take my hand, sing it!

[Verse 4]
Then one day your life is through
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
Nothing more that you can do
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)
So give away the things you know
(Tell 'em about it, tell 'em about it)
And tell your friends you love them so
(Sing the hajanga, sing the hajanga)
Tell 'em hajanga

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Release that clip at his tummy
He a dead man like a mummy
Release that clip at his tummy
He a dead man like a mummy
Release that clip at his tummy
He a dead man like a mummy

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I got more bands than your family
Pussy nigga, don't you ever talk crazy
I give a fuck 'bout a bitch
You can find me in the 6
Peep the ice rink on my wrist
They call me debra like yola
I might pull up in that Rover with my gang from Pensacola and they shootin'
Them niggas aimin' at strollers
If I bring it out it's over
They ain't come out here for nothin'
Promise they gon' shoot at somethin'
Ya bitch love on me cause my shmoney
She hop on dick like a bunny
Release that clip at his tummy
He a dead man like a mummy
Send a few shots to his mommy if he make another threat to hurt my family
I don't give no fuck 'bout nobody
I know some some billis a town
But none 'em niggas got a body
Call a chop to load my shotty

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Ride out
Ride out, ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out, ride out
Niggas talkin' down, niggas talkin' down
Ride out
Ride out
Ride out

[Verse 2: K$upreme]
Put the drugs in the goyard then go
Cookin' up over the stove
All my niggas trained to go
Treat a bitch like a hoe
Kick down a nigga door
If I heard he holdin' dough
Get down on the floor
Whip the fork in slow-mo
Eat the pussy, hell no
On my soul, I can't go
Nigga you a average joe
Try me nigga, I'mma blow
We can't text hoes they ho
You know that I'm at my glo
Cause basedgod I'm fully load
Post up at the corner store

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Ride out
Ride out, ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out, ride out
Niggas talkin' down, niggas talkin' down
Ride out
Ride out
Ride out

[Biggie: Verse 1]
All I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From staying in my business, what is this, relentless
Approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock
16 shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfucking meet again
I'm doing rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
Cause I'm knee-deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the blue suits
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head, cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches sucking dick
The funk, baby

[Chorus 2x}
They wanna bury me, I'm worried, I'm losing my mind
Look down the barrel of my 9, and my vision's blurry
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfucking mack, put the pistol to my head

[2pac: Verse 2]

Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
Now watch a young motherfucker pull the trigger too
RAISE UP, and don't let them see ya cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga time for do or die
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my Glock
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain
At point blank range cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damn thing changed, they shakin' the dice
Now roll em if you can't stand pain better hold em
Cause ain't no tellin' what ya might roll
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol motherfucker better pull it
And even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a young G

[Chorus 2x]

[Biggie: Verse 3]

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said "Let's leave calm"
I'm hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

[2pac]

I live Thug Life, and let the money come to me
Cause they can never take the game from a young G

[Chorus]

[2pac: Verse 4]
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin'
Kinda boomin' round the way, think today I make a killin'
Dressin' down like I'm dirty, but only on the block
Just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin' from the cops
Gettin' high I think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin' it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck
Drinkin' liquor and I'm lookin' for a bitch to fuck
Rather die makin' money, than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo

[Biggie: Verse 5]

So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy: the place where my head rests
50-shot clip if a nigga want test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfucking helicopter
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beating motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina

[2pac: Verse 6]

They couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I traveled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin' me down
And facin' me now, what do I do?
These things that a Thug goes through
And still I rise
I want to beat you to death with a blunt object.

I want to grab one of those high-end fashion mannequins by the ankles and bash your ribcage in.

I want to sharpen fifty pencils, bind them with a rubber band, stick the lead ends in your mouth, and punch the erasers.

I want to strap you to a bed of nails and then strap that bed of nails to the hood of my car so I can watch you suffer as we drive over speed bumps in a mall parking lot during an earthquake.

I want to burn your dog in front of you, mix his ashes with gunpowder, melt his bone-shaped name tag into a small metal ball, load it all into a musket, and shoot you in the face with it.

I want you to somehow survive a terrible car crash and then somehow not survive a small fender bender on the way back from the hospital.

I've been fucking up a whole sack, yeah!
You tripping

[Intro: Ice-T Talking]
Yeah, IceBerg nigga, 2006, SMG bitch
Niggas out here got nerve to tell me keep it real
Faggot ass motherfuckers have no motherfucking.. reference point to real
Thorough niggas know, there's rules to this shit

[Chorus: Ice-T]
Original gangster, I respect the laws
Of the crimes lords and the gangster wars
My only religion, is the code of the streets
We never use cops, we just handle our bleat
The penalty precision is an infant death
Never disrespect or betray your set
Love and loyalty is the ultimate goal
To the Code of the Streets, I hear my pledge in my soul

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
When I was nineteen, I learned the game unpolitely
Niggas threw me on the back of the 'llac, told me to shut up
Put me in the crack spot, made me chop rocks
Put me on the streets, taught me how to lock blocks
Told me never snitch, never trust man or bitch
Rock revolvers, never trust gats with clips
Speak in low tones, even when you think you're alone
Cause phones will get you sent upstate, cause feds rotate
And all that close talking, talk about birds and cake
They talk it better than you, so advice your crew
And any body new, watch him with profiles
Cause the D-E-A is crafty and those sending spies

[Chorus: Ice-T]

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
Feds get gangster, hard niggas tell
Bitches get jealous and they send you to hell
Your best friend is a rat, I can tell by the smell
You'll get cracked for the gat, they can tell by the shell
Truth is, most of these bitches, is harder than men
Fact is, most of these gangsters, turn gay in the pen
And if I let you rob me once, you'll probably rob me again
That's why some niggas lives must end
They tell, you keep your friends closer, I keep them closer than most
My enemies can do whatever, I'ma pose with a toss
Live your life low and simply you should be like a ghost
When you get a legal paper, it ain't too smart to boast, nigga

[Chorus: Ice-T]

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
Yeah, niggas out there talking about how real it is
Niggas got this shit twisted
Niggas is snitching like motherfucking bitches
Niggas got this shit all fucked up
Nowadays, you niggas analyzing the shot not the shooter
Got a gold simi, choose the Glock not the rooga
Don't leave your conversations on your Goddamn computor
Listen to me close, it might extend your life
Don't trust all your homies, some of them'll bend your wife
Cause there's two games, one that respects the laws
And one that's straight scandalous and listed across
If you're fucking with the second one, you'll end for a loss
They play another game, blast, kill, collect the cash
No running when they're gunning and they don't wear masks
The middle niggas mobbing, just trying to eat
They don't give a fuck about the code of the streets (COME ON!!)

[Chorus: Ice-T until fade]
Calm the fuck down
And unclench your fists
I can't see you through the mist
How did it come to this?

Wipe the tears
From inside your head
Your eyes are looking dead
Was it something I said?

Take back those words
I'm not as strong as I look
It's my soul that you shook
And my heart that you took

Leave me in my misery
Hopefully I'll forget you someday
I can't stay
I have to stop my soul's decay

You've taken all my dignity
It's clear to me that this ain't child's play
I'll be on my way
Before my world turns grey
Hey! Hey you!
Yes, you standing there
Is this fair?
Or would you give me care

Hey! Hey you!
Yes, you with the smile
Would you take me under your wing
For a while?

Hey! Hey you!
Yes, you standing there
Is this fair?
Or would you give me care

Hey! Hey you!
Yes, you with the smile
Would you take me under your wing
For a while?

[Intro: Lin-Manuel Miranda]
And love is love, is love, is love is love
Is love, is love, is love, is love

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm...I'm wide awake
Ready to create
Everything I've imagined
Hearts, without any hate
Crying for change
Causing a chain reaction

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Those who hate us and fear us, can not keep us down
Cause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound
If they try to deny us or silence us now
We just say no, oh, yeah, we let 'em know

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
We...we'll be alright
Living our lives
Finding some satisfaction
No, we're not gonna hide
No fear from our eyes
Love is a call to action

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Those who hate us and fear us, can not keep us down
Cause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound
If they try to deny us or silence us now
We just say no, oh, yeah, we let 'em know

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
(Dale Boricua)

[Verse 3: Lin-Manuel Miranda (Jennifer Lopez)]
Yeah, when the music is playing and the place is jumping
When the bass rattles your ribcage, hey something's changed
I'm dancing face to face with a stranger
A moment of grace, you know that you're safe, and they just
Drop the beat the moment you most needed it
You came in as a question until the music completed it
Me and you in the universe, moving in unison, coming in hot
But in the grand scheme what do we got?
What we got is love even when the sinners hate us
We can not let 'em diminish or intimidate us
We sing out, we got the rhythm and the truth on our side
We cut through the divide and we do it with pride
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
A generation of innovators unable to patiently wait for change
Cause change is what they've been afraid of
Their malevolence can wait, raise the level of debate
Celebrate, elevate, love, love
(Love make the world go round)

[Interlude: Lin-Manuel Miranda (Jennifer Lopez)]
Cannot be killed or swept aside
(Love make the world go round)
And fill the world with music, love and pride
(Love make the world go round
Love make the world go round)
And love is love, is love, is love is love
Is love, is love, is love, is love
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round

[Outro]
We're not staying inside today
They're not taking our pride away
Le-lo-lai-la-lo-lai-lo-le
We're not staying inside today
They're not taking our pride away
Le-lo-lai-la-lo-lai-lo-le
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round

[Hook]
Been here before
Pushed back, back and forth
That doesn't matter
This won't stop me
Nothing can drop me
It's still a struggle

Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving
Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving

[Verse 1]
Wherever I may go, whatever I might be
I may not stand alone but I am standing tall, ten toes two feet
I've never been a pushover, never asked for a handover
Worked nine five, broke day and night, if you only knew what I hurdled over

[Hook]
Been there before
Pushed back, back and forth
That doesn't matter
This won't stop me
Nothing can drop me
It's still a struggle
Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving
Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving

[Verse 2]
Ready to take blows, suited ...
... my hands are bruised but I am still gonna stay true
Motivated by ... and the names I salute
Unbreakable I made it through and there's so much more to do

[Hook]
Been here before
Pushed back, back and forth
That doesn't matter

Ricochet, ricochet, hit that wall and keep on moving
No obstacles stand in my way, hit that wall and keep on moving

[Pre-Hook: Gucci Mane]
Big, big, big pistol me ('stol on Guc')

I get your head to the white, make your shit pink
All OG pink, don't fuck with me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I need a detox cause I've been smoking kush all week
And if I piss some dirty urine then I'm up shit creek
I'm major tourin' shows everyday, I gets no sleep
My money lanky, taller than a man 6 foot 3
My left pinky nine karat diamond cut so neat
And if I told you what it cost, you would say "golly"
I spend 50k a month and that's just on chains
I got your girlfriend rolling blunts in the VIP
I got a carbon 15 sitting on my front seat
And plus my shoes'll eat your face like bon appetit
The feds looking at me, know they got they eyes on me
I feel like 2Pac when he made All Eyez On Me

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I keep the Glock on me
Stupid Glock on me
I can't let 'em get the drop on me
I keep a nine on me, stupid nine on me
Lord knows I got guap on me
Stupid rocks on me, crazy rocks on me
I paid a million for this watch on me golly
And my bricks so young, my birds gon' need ID
I feel like 2Pac when he made All Eyez On Me

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Bitch you misdemeanor I'm raisin hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks, that thought I quit
Then got a drop top Jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack, I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggas to trip, cause bitch I love to scrap
Now mama raised me as a thug nigga, where the love niggas?
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from rocks to 'zines, writing raps and movies
I went from trustin' these tricks now they all want to sue me
So fuck em' all

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I keep the Glock on me
Stupid Glock on me
I can't let 'em get the drop on me
I keep a nine on me, stupid nine on me
Lord knows I got guap on me
Stupid rocks on me, crazy rocks on me
I paid a million for this watch on me golly
And my bricks so young, my birds gon' need ID
What you know bout me? You ain't got nothin' on me

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It get so lonely at the top, I need some company
My swears so stupid that these hoes be holding doors for me
She wanna stay with me, know that I'ma faithfully
I'm like a drug to her, she can't walk away from me
Niggas don't play with me cause I keep AK's with me
Police survalliance I know they fuckin' taping me
But all they gonna see is diamond cars and currency
I'm currently out the country chasin' currency
I got some weed on me now and some ecstasy
30 grams and a nine and a knife on me
Watch your mouth bout me, dirty South I be
Do your momma teach you don't talk when grown folks speak? (It's Gucci)

Diamonds older than my granny
Tryna focus on my grammy
Servin’ niggas in the alley
Bring her back to the palace
In some black New Balance
Keep some Jackson’s like Janet
Yeah I do it fantasic, woah

[Verse 1]
I found love, we danced and gazed at the skyline
I fell within, I lost myself in it's first kiss
I found love, we held hands through the apple trees
I knew right then, I was all the more

[Verse 2]
I found love, we sang songs through the subways
Deeper I go, yet quicker to fall
I found love, but it's home sweet home now
Mute conversation, more time alone

[Chorus ]
I found love, has this love even found me?
Fell deep for nothing, still I'm falling for you
I found love, has this love even found me?
Fell deep for nothing, still I'm falling for you
I found love, has this love even found me?
Fell deep for nothing, still I'm falling for you

[Outro]
Fell deep for nothing, still I'm falling for you
Fell deep for nothing, still I'm falling for you
Fell deep for nothing, still I'm falling for you
Fell deep for nothing, still I'm falling for you
Fell deep for nothing, no...
Fell deep for nothing, no...
Fell deep for nothing, no...

Bitch, stop the comparisons, I'm not these other artistses (No!)
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, my neck on that real retarded shit (Brr!)
Keep a towel with me 'cause my watch be drippin' water, bitch (Woo!)
And I only featured Kanye 'cause we both some fuckin' narcissists (Yeezy!)
Narcissistic tendencies with psychopathic pockets, bitch
My bank account is crazy, bitch, I think it needs some medicine (Woo!)
My straitjacket Giv-enchy-ahnchy-ahchy (Ooh!), can't even pronounce that shit
Designer jeans, designer drugs, just bought me a designer bitch (Yeah!)
Why this bitch keep hittin' my line? She knowin' she ain't no dime and shit (Nope!)
Knowin' I ain't got no time to waste, be fuckin' around with no nickel, bitch (Huh?!)
Your nigga pinchin' pennies, but I'm out here making these millions, bitch
Don't ask me who I'm votin' for 'cause I got all the presidents (Racks!)
My bitch walk 'round in lingerie all day, she think she elegant (Mwah!)
It's an elephant in the room—guess who's the motherfuckin' elephant? (It's Gucci)
Maybach in the garage, elevator in the residence (Huh?)
My pockets bulgin', bulgin', pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop, yeah)

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Pussy print, p-pussy print (Huh?)
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop!)
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'

Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Mwah!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Me and Guwop making super moves
Making stupid cash, stack it through the roof
You don't fuck with me? The feeling mutual
I'd feel the same if I drove that Subaru
We hit the city, the old me going OC
How her friend only gonna watch that, that is so weak
Seven times in a row, I could go the whole week
I could take you from the nosebleeds to the floor seats
But I need that, in the sauna, in the bathroom, at your mama's
Like a porn star, I'm a monster; you a dancer, on the camera
In the G-string, girl, I want you; at the concert, at the condo
In my bedroom, in the guest room
In the restroom, fuck it, every room (Yeah!)
Tryna see that...

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Pussy print (Huh?), p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop!)
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Mwah!)
Pussy print (Huh?), p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print (Wop!)
Pussy print, p-pussy print
My pockets bulgin', bulgin'
Pokin' out just like a pussy print

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
Mwah!
What in the world ever made that young girl cry
The tears down her cheeks she tries to hide?
And what of the man who passes calmly by?
Oh why? No

Oh lies are no longer needed
He frankly conceded
I am not the way that you had hoped and prayed

I'm sorry if I've caused you any pain
But please believe me when I try to say
I feel like I am going insane oh it'll be better off for you this way

I was holding out for you
I was holding out for you
I was holding out for you
I was holding out for you

[Verse 1]
You don't know what you've lost 'til it's gone
You can't hear the silence up to this lung
You can't tie heartstrings when they're left undone
You can't go back when you've left too long
I tried to push us to the very end
I needed a lover more than a friend
But I hit the limit I didn't intend
And I just wanna make amends

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah

[Chorus]
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
In the darkness, I hear your voice
Memories of us I feel destroyed
My mind is playing tricks and I have no choice
Without you, my heart makes no noise

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah

[Chorus]
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

[Bridge]
All I needed was you
All I wanted was you
All I needed was you

[Chorus]
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

[Intro]

[Chorus]
Cold boy
This beat cold boy
Greatest story ever told boy
30 million records sold boy
Must live by the code boy
Especially if you a dope boy
Where you get that Coogi sweater?
Your momma think you sellin' soap boy

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Watch out for them hoes boy
Make sure you crease and fold boys
The streets out of control boy
This shit just like Game of Thrones boy
Ain't no new hoes, these hoes been hoeing'
Ain't no new grow that someone been showin'
In that two-door, that hoe tip-toein'
She heard my new song, she tryin' to feel on me
Where you get it? "I don't know" You a lie
You a THOT "No I'm not" You a lie
First day at the job, you applied
At the desk, selling 2 for the 5
Play your role, you on parole boy
Quit talkin' on the phone boy
Don't ever let them see you slippin'
They catch you as a minor, they gon' try you as a grown boy
5 to 10 if you 10, that shit cold boy
They can't smell it when it's cold boy
Pharmacy the real dope boy
Come back later, kitchen closed boy

[Chorus]
Cold boy
This beat cold boy
Greatest story ever told boy
30 million records sold boy
Must live by the code boy
Especially if you a dope boy
Where you get that Coogi sweater?
Your momma think you sellin' soap boy

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Hopped up out the bed, got some head right before
Gassin' up the muscle, '67 steroid
Prescriptions in my backpack
I'm so high I'm having flashbacks
Got a half a pound on the way in the Uber
Cost a couple bands, plus I threw in a tuba
Cutie pie for me, a cutie pie for my shooter
Two Dominican bitches that just flew in from Sosua
Ooh this loud, where you get it? "Parking lot."
How much is it? "I don't know, not a lot."
Uh, I got more, plenty more, at the spot
I can't walk with too much, them hoes is hot
Try and look sober for my mom and them
But I smoked it with my uncle then
Just lookin' for a come up
Yea, I was flexin' in them struggle Timbs'
Flexin' in them struggle Timbs'
Flexin' in them struggle Timbs'
Pharmacy the real dope boy
Come back later, kitchen closed boy

[Chorus]
Cold boy
This beat cold boy
Greatest story ever told boy
30 million records sold boy
Must live by the code boy
Especially if you a dope boy
Where you get that Coogi sweater?
Your momma think you sellin' soap boy

[Outro]
Cold boy
Cold boy
Cold boy

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted"
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Hook]
Hi, my name is, what?
My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh?
My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what?
My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh?
My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

[Verse 2]
My English teacher wanted to have sex with me in junior high
The only problem was, my English teacher was a guy
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of paper
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, killin' pedestrians, rapin' lesbians
While they're screaming, "Let's just be friends!"
99 percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
So I signed it: "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!"

[Hook]
Hi, my name is, what?
My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh?
My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what?
My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh?
My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

[Verse 3]
Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away!
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, my palms too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Hook]
Hi, my name is, what?
My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh?
My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what?
My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh?
My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

Lowkey I might run for mayor
Lowkey I could be a Laker

I be iced out, water

Pussy be locked up for murder
You should just know that they shootin’
Home invasion intrusion
He shootin’, I’m shootin’, we shootin’
Codeine in my fluids

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, man
Do you ever sit and wonder sometimes
What if?
I mean, like, for real though
I mean, sometimes I just sit and think to myself, like
What if?
I mean, that's a big question, right?
If "if" was a fifth, we'd all be fucked up
But what I really wanna know is:
What if?

[Hook 1: Suga Free]
(What if?)
We had a reckless motherfucker
That was king of west coast instead of big Snoop Dogg
(What if?)
We never had a nigga like Big P
From the Southside, nigga goin' "woof"
(What if?)
We never had a real woman
That could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was
(What if?)
We had to take it
If you didn't have Suga Free, motherfucker, you had to make it

[Verse 1: Suga Free]
Social media only ask the he-say, she-say shit
And where would I be without Tone, Pimp 

[?], and DJ Quik?
Act like you knew that
I'm glad I had somebody tell me
"Don't think with your dick, boy! Don't do that!"
Come on, you know me, man
I pimp on, I entertain, man
That's why I stay inside my 

[?] lane
I gotta be careful when I show you stuff
'Cause these haters don't like you if you know too much
Yo, ow give it up if you like this
And you prefer the peace
And won't get mad if you don't have no one to fight with
We pull the cards around a phony
My sister told me, "Niggas act hard around they homies"
Because the West don't need no beef
We need our 

[?] and our roaches
And our Reres and our Monique
So stay prayed up, armor on, I got it
What if you talked to that man
And understood before you shot him?

[Hook 2: Snoop Dogg]
(What if?)
The Bloods and the Crips was the same
And all niggas joined one gang
(What if?)
My granny wouldn't have died
Man, I probably wouldn't have been from the East side
(What if?)
You could do what you don't
And live how you motherfuckin' want, say that
(What if?)
A phony is a phony, a homie is a homie
And you know the big homie don't play that

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Catch him, stick him
Rip it, ride it
La di da di, we shout out the party
The old me, the new you, you niggas tryna do me
You better off tryna do you
Boo hoo, voodoo, taboo
DP, GC, what it really do?
I educate when I illustrate
And those the words I be teachin', preachin'
To each and everyone
Never been a scary one
Always been a down ass nigga, clown ass nigga
Reppin' my city, 

[?]
Extra extraordinaire exceptionally
Never late, predicate, elevate, levitate
My nigga, I'm way too high to ever hate
Papa Snoop in my momma Beverly, heavenly
Thank God for ya'll havin' me, for real

[Hook 3: Snoop Dogg & Suga Free]
(What if?)
The Bloods and the Crips was the same
And all niggas joined one gang
(What if?)
My granny wouldn't have died
Man, I probably wouldn't have been from the East side
(What if?)
You could do what you don't
And live how you motherfuckin' want, say that
(What if?)
We had a reckless motherfucker
That was king of west coast instead of big Snoop Dogg
(What if?)
We never had a nigga like Big P
From the Southside, nigga goin' "woof"
(What if?)
We never had a real woman
That could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was
(What if?)
We had to take it
If you didn't have Suga Free, motherfucker, you had to make it
(What if?)

Beautiful, I watch you try
To see yourself through others' eyes
The mirrors are a losing game
They only show you backwards anyway

The magic and the misery
Come and go so easily
But everything you'll ever be
You already are to me

You were only five years old
Playing princess in your mother's clothes
Could you feel me standing next to you
With my plastic sword and playground shoes

Saying "if my dear I'm wrong somehow
May dragons come and fell me now."
Because everything you'll ever be
You already are to me

Why
I don't know why
I don't know why you think you need to do it
How
I don't know how
I don't know how but
I just sit back and I see my way right through it
When the memories are ten feet tall
Throwing shadows on your bedroom wall
When you pull the shades and kill the lights

Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Will you hear me singing out tonight?

Days are long and words are cruel
They won't get the best of you
Cause everything you'll ever be
You have always been to me, yeah yeah

Always been to me, yeah, yeah
Always been to me, yeah
Always, oh oh
Always been to me, yeah, yeah
Always been to me
I am grateful to be able to call America my second home. Last night when I saw the video of Alton Sterling being killed it left me feeling disheartened, emotional and truly scared. I woke up this morning with a strong need to say something.

It's impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and law enforcement remains as strained as it did decades ago. No one begins their life as a hashtag. Yet the trend of being reduced to one continues.

This is real and I'm concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family, my friends, and any human being that could fall victim to this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I believe things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step.

My thoughts and prayers are with the Sterling family and any family that has lost someone to this cycle of violence.

Be safe out there. More life.
In the real early morning
With the sun slowly rising
I was walking out slowly
Wandering free
When out in the distance
Over the valley
I saw an old friend
Waiting for me
Waiting for me

She was a young girl
She was an old soul
As fair as the ocean
Timeless and free
She was my mother
She was my daughter
She was my lover
She was everything
An old friend could be

I said, "It's been such a long time
Since we have spoken
There's so much to say to you
I want you to know
I wish you could tell me
All that you've seen here
But we haven't got long now
For soon, you'll be fading
And soon, I must go"

[Bridge: Instrumental]
I know the way home

She said "You are a soldier
You are a father
You are a wise man
You are a friend
You were my first love
I won't forget you
I'm walking beside you
I was here when you started
I'll be here till the end"

And now it's the evening
There's a moon slowly rising (ooh, ooh)
There isn't much more that
I wanted to know, wanted to know
And I am alone now
She isn't beside me no more
But I feel no sorrow
I'd come tomorrow
I'll be on my way home
I'll be on my way home

My jewelry game spectacular, it really ain’t no more challengers
For Scotty mane, get naughty mane
Shoot that bitch up like Gotti mane
Y’all suckers not in my lane, I’m riding in a big body mane
Smokin’ cali Dro with a Irish hoe
On a private plane with Waka flame
Sippin’ champagne my campaign so turnt up its a damn shame

One for my bitch like hers and him
Iced out slim with the diamond gems
Iced out slim with the tilted brim
I don’t see nobody, bitch I’m goin’ Scotty
Bitches say they love, but really they love my money
Dirty birds like Roddy, ride off in my Audi
I don’t see nobody, shittin' on niggas no potty
More cars then a car lot, don’t mistake me for car thief
What I’m a bring out this summer
Bitch wanna come take a sneak peak
All white guts I’m a neat freak, pussy ass nigga you a cheapskate
All this cash that my clickbait, bitch think that we won a sweepstakes

[Hook: Gucci] x2

50 grand in every pocket, I’m goin’ Scotty
I’m bout to buy a new Ferrari, I’m goin’ Scotty

[Verse 1]
I was walking down the line
Trying to find some peace of mind
Then I saw you
You were takin' it slow, and walkin' it one step at a time

[Verse 2]
You said, "Listen, stranger
I'm feeling low now
I don't know which way to go"
I said, "If you're lost now
Maybe I could help you along and sing you a song
And move you on"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Singing down the line
Where shall we go?
Where shall we go?
Down the line
Where shall we go?

[Chorus 1]
She said
"I'm looking for a kind of shelter
No place for me to call my own
I've been walking all night long, but
I don't know where to call my home"

"The only way to find that place is
Close to where my heart is
I know I'm gonna get there
But I've got to keep on walking down the line"
Down the line, yeah, say

[Piano Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh
Where shall we go?
Where shall we go?
Where shall we go?

[Chorus 2]
She said
"Estoy buscando un lugar tranquilo
Un lugar que sea mío
Lo he estado buscado toda la noche
Pero no sé dónde se encuentra"
"The only way to find that place is
Close to where my heart is
Maybe I'm never gonna get there
But I've got to keep on walking down the line"

[Bridge (Ad-lib)]
Got to keep on walking down the line
Got to keep on walking down the line

[Verse 3]
I said "You go on walking
Down the line
Wasting all your
Precious time
But you're never gonna find it
Because there is no end to the line
There's no destination for to find"
(There's no destination, baby)

[Verse 4]
"But if you get there
Don't forget me
Cause I'm the one who
Set you free
But don't come calling
'Cause I won't wanna call you a friend
So, this is end of you and me
Say, I won't wanna call you a friend
So, this is end of you and me
No, I won't wanna call you a friend
So, this is end of you and me"

[Instrumental]

Now and then I think about you
Now and then I think about you
I don't wanna be (Think about you)
Now and then I think about you

[Verse 1]
What was I thinking?
Packing up and leaving
Now that you're wiser
I'm ashamed, yeah, yeah
I can't even cry
Anxiety at night
Can't make up excuses
Gotta face the music

[Chorus]
When I see you, my friend
When I see you, my friend

[Verse 2]
If I said I missed you
Would you say the same?
Or if I said I love you
Would you simply walk away?
Thought we'd grow together
But every day we're further
Thought I did the right thing
But deep inside I'm dying

[Chorus]
When I see you, my friend
When I see you, my friend
See you again
See you again, my friend
Girl, you know you wanna see me again

[Outro]
You're the greatest, forever my baby, my friend
'Cause you will always be my, my friend

Oooh

[Verse]
Ayy, I only show affection when I get an erection
Ayy, I only show affection when I get an erection
I got bitches in the city tryna get in my section
I got nigga in the cut and they tote lethal weapons
Boat'll hit you so hard, you might think that it's Tekken
And I just talked to Sid and he said that the TEC in
I ain't talkin' 'bout no game when I say that the TEC in
Ayy, the word around town, I got everyone checkin'
Yeah, they heard I got a check, guess 'em folks see me flex
I would plot on me too if I lived life like you
Bitches dream about the Boat, I'm one hell of a dude
Ayy, I got a cellphone but I think I need two
I got six bad bitches that'll never fuck you
Yeah, my shower got four heads, guess it's meant for foreheads
I ain't never ever lie when I spoke on my bread
I ain't ever gave a fuck what a bitch nigga said
Ayy, it's Boat from the 6, don't forget what I said, bitch
Back at it, I don't rent cars, I pay cash
Them folks thought Lil Boat was done, I'm back on they ass
Six months ago I ain't have no cash
Damn I'm livin' fast, I'm the richest here
Young bitch, I ball like a Cavalier
Stupid bitch, I don't eat no caviar
Young nigga stuntin', need a Hollywood star
I got my first M and bought my moms a car
Skrrt, skrrt
My bitch ass stupid dumb like durtduraler
Popped up on the scene like whatsueerp
No, I can't talk to no promoter unless the promoter got quota
I'm cold, Minnesota

[Verse 1]
Woke up today my mind awhirl
From head to toe with endless feeling
Tried to explain just what I see
You say to me I must be dreaming
You called my name the way
I wished you would in my imagination
Now every single thing around me
Filling me with this sensation

In my searching around
I've seen so many faces
Now I've found the one I needed
And the sun is rising

[Chorus]
I woke up today
Like I wanted
Since you walked my way
Found my strength to feel it
I woke up today
Heaven knows it
Found a girl who makes me see
Ahhh

[Verse 2]
Spoke up today about the things in my life
I didn't think I needed
They flew outside my window pane now
Pain is not to be kept a secret
These walls are built for no resemblance
To the things I treasured dearly
And now the thoughts just clear the way
Oh baby I see you don't need me

In this crazy old world
I've been so many places
Seen how we're all gonna need some shelter
When the sun is sinking

[Chorus]
I woke up today
Like I wanted
Since you walked my way
Found my strength to feel it
I woke up today
Heaven knows it
Found a girl who makes me see

[Bridge]
I woke up today
Like I wanted
Since you walked my way
Found my, found my strength to feel it
I woke up today
Like I wanted
Since you walked my way
Found my, found my strength to feel it
I woke up today
Like I wanted
Since you walked my way
Found my, found my strength to feel it

[Outro]
I woke up today
Like I wanted
Since you walked my way
(Just like I wanted to)
Found my strength to feel it

Y'all think the shit I say is free

Been goin' hard since H.A.R.D. even got started

Niggas'll park at a Timmy's and trap out a motherfucker
We buyin' coffee every hour so they don't kick us right back out that motherfucker

Drop head and the south come out
Head drops all out my house
X wasn't my last name, rather keep my Malcolm out
Ain't gon' lie, she a super freak
She a super beast when that mouth come out
Fresh to death, I'm R.I.P., had to give the swag mouth to mouth
She just ripped the tag out the couch
I just kicked her back out the house
LOMO logo, had to fuck her with a GoPro
Keep this shit, leak this shit, that's what we call promo
All the shooters, they in go mode
Me, I'm pullin' in a foreign bro
All the shooters, they in Volvos
Rollin' up and smoking Marlboros up
Yeah, they don't like me, but they gon' respect me
Yeah, they don't like me, but can't no one check me
Yeah, 'cause I got it on my own, nigga
So it's motherfuck the poor niggas
Yeah

[Outro]
They ain't gon' like me though
Hey Hobby, tell them niggas I'm goin' for ten
Ten-million, nigga

[Hook]
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you

[Verse 1]
You've been blowin' up my phone
Talkin' bout you're tired of bein' alone
You've been lookin' for something strong
You feel strange cause I might be the one
You ain't used to just holdin' on
You put a couple dudes in position, they did you wrong
But I'ma go on straight to the mission
Put my key in ignition
You should talk but with me you just listen
From the seat, to the whip, to the crib
Now we on the bed
I know what you sayin' but that's over with
I don't really like to argue
No matter what we goin' through
It's not a big deal, we'll get over it
I ain't never had a chick like you
So ain't no tellin' what a nigga might do
Black and yellow diamonds and the wrist light blue
Just call me when you need me, I'ma dip right through

[Hook]
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you

[Verse 2]
Back and forth, back and forth
Just went through my things, what you do that for?
You just wanna catch a nigga when he slack off
But you don't want to be the reason that I pack up, nah
Don't even let 'em get you mad though
They just some rebound bitches off the backboard
See you the reason I'm always in the trap for
And if them niggas come, you open up the back door
You know
Yeah we argue and fight
But I'd rather fuck you all night
We can just get high, cook me dinner
And live a comfortable life
You can keep it to yourself
I don't want nobody else
I'm the realest nigga left
You can put me to the test
I ain't nothin' like the rest
Go on, get it off your chest

[Hook]
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
I don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no
Feel like everything I want is made a statement on FMJ
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you

[Outro]
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you
I don't wanna fight with you cause I fucks with you

[Verse 1]
There's a world where I can go to tell my secrets to
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room

[Verse 2]
In this world I lock out all my worries and my fears
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room

[Chorus]
Do my dreaming and my scheming, lie awake and pray
Do my crying and my sighing, laugh at yesterday

[Post-Chorus]
Now it's dark and I'm alone but I won't be afraid
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Do my dreaming and my scheming, lie awake and pray
I do my crying and I do my sighing, laugh at yesterday

[Post-Chorus]
Now it's dark and I'm alone but I won't be afraid
In my room, in my room (yeah)
In my room, in my room

[Outro]
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room

[Verse 1]
Take me anywhere you wanna go
You know that my love is strong in my hideaway
Softly, like the calm that follows storm
Find what I've been searching for, all along in my hideaway
Even when I close my eyes
Darling, I will always stay
Wide awake in my hideaway

[Verse 2]
Touch me like I've never loved before
In a place that I adore in my hideaway
I know whichever way the wind may blow
There will be a place for me to go in my hideaway
Whether you be lost or found
Darling, if you've gone astray
I'm on my way to my hideaway

[Bridge]
My hideaway
Down going down
Down follow down
Down going down
Down follow down
Down going down
Down follow down
Down going down
Down follow down
When the rain falls
Falling down to the sea
Flow that river
To the depth of me
When the rain falls
Falling down to the sea
Flow that river
To the depth of me
When the rain falls
Falling down to the sea
Flow that river
To the depth of me
(When the rain falls)
(When the rain falls)
(When the rain falls)

[Verse 3]
Let me feel the sky and feel the moon
Let me sing an honest tune to my hideaway
Trusting wherever I go wandering
I’ll find a home in everything in my hideaway
Maybe you can come to stay
And I will meet you here someday
Far away in my hideaway
