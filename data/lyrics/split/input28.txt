cholars of war
Who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull
Who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall
Who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York
Who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night
With dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares

[Robbery]

And so, from being created in his likeness, to being banished for wanting to be too much like him, we were cast out, and the garden of Eden transformed in to the garden of Evil
Los Angeles, The city of Angels, A land of Gods and Monsters, The in-between realm where only the choices made from your free will, will decide your souls final fate
Some poets called it the entrance to the Underworld, but on some summer nights, it could feel like Paradise, Paradise Lost

[Interlude 1 - Variation: Lana Del Rey]
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Master of the Universe, creator of all forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John

[Spoken 2: John Wayne]
You ask me why I love her? Well give me time, I'll explain
Have you ever seen a Kansas sunset or an Arizona rain?
Have you ever drifted on a bayou down Louisiana way?
Or watched a cold fog come drifting in over San Francisco Bay?
Have you heard a bobwhite calling in the Carolina pines
Or heard the bellow of a diesel at the Appalachia mines?
Does the call of Niagara thrill you when you hear her waters roar?
Or do you look with awe and wonder, Massachusetts shore
Brave new men who stepped on Plymounth's rock?
And do you think of them when you stroll along a New York City dock?
Have you seen a snowflake drifting in the Rockies, way up high?
Or seen the sun come blazing down from a bright Nevada sky?
Do you hail to the Columbia as she rushes to the sea
Or bow your head at Gettysburg at our struggle to be free?
You ask me why I love her? I've got a million reasons why:
It's my beautiful America, beneath God's wide, wide sky

[Bel Air]

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro (spoken)]
Good evening

[Intro]
My urb man
Hey, Bei Maejor, you got your urban on?
Cyeah, in my urb man
In my urb man

[Verse 1]
It's so unusual to me how I can see
That thing you got from the the back from your front
It's o beautiful to me, girl you see this dream I got
You'd be walking all through with the way you do it

[Chorus]
Shawty I want you so, so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind

[Verse 2]
And all I see is you on top of me
Watching you ride, looking into my eyes
All I need is to be inside
I'll be sliding in the front going to the behind

[Chorus]
Shawty I want you so, so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind

[Verse 3]
Aye that girl so big, aye that girl so phat
Aye the girl so big, aye that girl so phat
Why is your back bone bigger than the usual?
Lil mama why you so phat?
How long did it take that thang to grow?
I'd love to hit that front the back
Me and my cut cuts, you and your gut guts
Girl move your butt butt, diggin' your gut guts
And you already
Sit it down, put some pounds on the D

[Chorus]
Shawty I want you so, so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind
Shawty I want you so, so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind

[Verse 1]
Tell me why when you put a camera on a thug
The first thing out of his mouth is I wanna thank my mama?
And some say that causes drama
But it's subliminal, there's no efforts needed
It's like pouring water on the ground that's seeded
And you know it happens all the time, so I need to ask this question

[Chorus]
Why oh why is it hard for dudes to always be around?
Tell me how can a boy be a man only getting fed from a woman's hands?
Tell me what do you think will happen when you don't come around?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be a man only getting fed from a woman's hand

[Verse 2]
Now tell me what turns a boy into a thug just as soon as he leave the house
See he don't have a man to give him little rules, so he don't be running in and out
But it's okay 'cause mama's there
And mama's doing the best she could ever do
But the funny thing is when it's all said and done
She probably did it better than you could ever do

[Chorus]
Why is it hard for dudes to always be around?
Tell me how can a boy be a man only getting fed from a woman's hands?
Tell me what do you think will happen when you don't come around?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be a man only getting fed from a woman's hand

[Bridge]
Tell me how will a boy learn to stand on his own?
How can he make it all alone? How can he be responsible?
If he don't have his daddy to show him how to be there
Not to minimize what his mama does for him
I'm just saying he gon' need ya'll both
Can you tell me why why why
Does it gotta be so hard to do a daddy's job?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be man

[Chorus]
Why is it hard for dudes to always be around?
Tell me how can a boy be a man only getting fed from a woman's hands?
Tell me what do you think will happen when you don't come around?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be a man only getting fed from a woman's hand
Why is it hard for dudes to always be around?
Tell me how can a boy be a man only getting fed from a woman's hands?
Tell me what do you think will happen when you don't come around?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be a man only getting fed from a woman's hand

[Outro]
When you missing his first game, don't even know the boy's nickname
That's a damn shame 'cause you suppose to be the man
The daddy, the father, the boy's role model
That's supposed to be you, that's supposed to be you

[Intro]
Ladadadadada, mm
Whoa

[Verse 1]
Let me explain the way your love has got me feeling
I'm wanting to throw it away and hang up all the pimping
I'm ready to let go of my heart and give it all to you
For the rest of my life
It's like I can't roll or go with no one else but you babe
Nobody else can make me feel this way but you may
Be the only one I trust and baby that's what's up

[Verse 2]
If you were music then you know I'd be the speaker
And if I was smoking then you know you'd be the reefer
And if I was standing on the block, I'd keep you in my sock
And that's for real
Girl, I can't see myself with no one else but you babe
Nobody else can make me feel this way but you may
Be the only one I love and baby that's what's up
I tell the world about it, I'ma scream and shout it

[Chorus]
Girl you got that good kinda, good kinda
Sweet kinda, deep kinda loving
And girl you got that yeah baby, ooh baby

[Bridge]
And I'll love you 'til ain't no loving better

And you can take my heart right out my hands
Got forever planned, got to be your man
So you ain't gotta worry 'bout this here
Girl I'll make it clear, long as love is near
You gon' be alright
With your kind of loving so right

[Chorus]
'Cause girl you got that good kinda, good kinda
Sweet kinda, deep kinda loving

Oh the phone just started ringing and my boys think I been fighting

Then rain began to fall, then Grandma start going off

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

Ooh baby, this ain't fair 'cause I was almost there
So just keep holding on, sleet, hail or snow, I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm coming for you, I'm coming back, girl, I'm coming

Believe in your dreams, don't let no
Body tell you what you can't do
You gonna make it, yeah

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
This song is for my shawty
That's going through it, you gotta know you can do it
And this song is for my homies
Just hold it down 'cause get it from the ground up

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
'Cause I tried suit with a smile, it ain't fit me
And I played the blocked for a while, them people tried to kill me
No matter what you go through
I know one thing is true, keep believing and you'll

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
'Cause when it's feeling like you just can't take it
And no matter what you do, ooh they keep hating
Lift your head up to the sky, tell yourself I
Just gotta make it, I just gotta make it
'Cause when it's feeling like you just can't take it
And no matter what you do, ooh they keep hating
Lift your head up to the sky, tell yourself I
Just gotta make it, I just gotta make it

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Shawty I know you 'bout to have your baby
Before you give up just take a second lady
Look in the mirror, your reflection baby
It's perfection baby, don't neglect it baby
Now homie, I know you been nickling and diming
Can't get enough hours at your job to put your time in
I know them streets looking good and that money looking long
Gon' and get how you live, who am I to say you wrong?

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
'Cause I tried suit with a smile, it ain't fit me
And I played the blocked for a while, them people tried to kill me
No matter what you go through
I know one thing is true, keep believing and you'll

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
'Cause when it's feeling like you just can't take it
And no matter what you do, ooh they keep hating
Lift your head up to the sky, tell yourself I
Just gotta make it, I just gotta make it
'Cause when it's feeling like you just can't take it
And no matter what you do, ooh they keep hating
Lift your head up to the sky, tell yourself I
Just gotta make it, I just gotta make it

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
Man I done slept in the hallways but I didn't cry through
Was advanced for my learning but was all caught in the cycle
What I wore in the daytim iIs what I wore for my night-clothes
Concern about a mil when I should have been shuttin' my eyes closed
Know about the stones, whack old wheels and the pot holes
Wanna call 'em Barry Bus, eatin' good with the nachos
If I ain't got nothin', I got flow, small carryin' a block glow
Just keep on grindin', don't pay atention to these pot holes
And you can make a come up, makin' moves in the Hummer
And you bring the children down to DisneyWorld this summer
I done been to hell and back, that's why I changed my life
Been caught up and convicted for the same thing twice
Mama preachin' to me to get my mindframe right
They found two on my partners' bodies on the same night
If I was with them then I would be on the same plane
I was livin' in this dump so I changed my life

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Looking at you day after day, I know I
Just gotta make it, I just gotta make it
Just to see that smile up on your face, I know I
Just gotta make it, I just gotta make it
Everything I do, I do for you and we
Just gotta make it, we just gotta make it
To the top of the world me and my girl we
Just gotta make it, just gotta make it, just gotta make it

[Outro: Aretha Franklin & Trey Songz]
Just as long as you ain't stepping on nobody
That's the Queen of soul
Tryna get where you going
She paved the way from me
Hang in there, hang tough when you have to
You're gonna make it
Can I make it?
You're gonna make it, yeah
I know, yeah yeah, I'm gonna make it
I know I'm gonna make it 'retha

DJ Drama
Talk to 'em Trey

[Verse 1]
So here we go with this again, running at them lips again
Yelling in my ear and shit, all I hear is whispering
No matter what it is, she always start to bitching and
Tripping and I almost start to call that girl a bitch again
So I blaze out the house, in a rage out the house
Shawty got a sharp tongue, she spit blades out her mouth
I throw my stunnas on, I chop blades out the house
She get to growling and I'm out, it's like a cage in the house
Phone on silent and I'm wilding 'cause I'm 'bout
Five shots of Henny in, man, I'm making plenty friends
Black, White, Dominican, back right, I break it in
This is the act right, I need to take it in, let's go
I been drinking tryna take my mind up off all the yelling and all the screaming
But all that it's doing is taking me far from your loving
Got this girl in my ear, telling me what I don't need to hear
Sipping what I'm sipping and she 'bout to catch me slipping

[Chorus]
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home

[Verse 2]
Now she's grinding and the way she popping that thang
Dropping that thang, reminds me, it ain't a girl in this world like mines
Wish she come find me, it's gettin heated up, if she keep it up, we gon' be leaving here
Sipping what I'm sipping and she 'bout to catch me slipping

[Chorus]
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home

[Bridge]
Now I look around and all I see is cuties, booties bouncing all around
I'm tryna keep myself from going down
With all the love I give you, all you ever do is frown
Sipping what I'm sipping and she 'bout to catch me slipping

[Chorus]
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home
I'm long gone missing, long gone missing
And I'm up in this club with all of these women
This one she said she wanna get me alone
You bad as hell, but girl, I gotta go home

[Verse 1]
When you see me in the videos babe
Do I make your body go crazy?
Or when you catch me in a magazine baby
Do you rip me out and save my page?
If my voice comes through your speakers
And you legs suddenly get weaker
This is for you, yeah
I'm hoping it's gon' get you through
So I can get to you
Tell me what you see when you think of me
I want this to be just like your fantasy
Oh, girl, girl I'm coming over
Got some things to show ya, turn your stereo up

[Chorus]
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl, you wanna bump it
Turn it up, don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it
Now put your hands on the radio
Don't be scared to touch it
Imagine I was there
Baby, pulling on your hair
Got some sex for your stereo
Show me how you take it
My words move like hands
And I'm singing to you naked
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl, you wanna bump it
Turn it up don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it

[Verse 2]
Now can my ladies in the back make some noise? I see you
It don't matter where you are in the crib, at your job, or in the car
It's for you, this is for you
Wherever you can stick me in, just let the record spin
Baby it's on you, what you gonna do?
Choice is all yours, you can put me in fast-forward or
We can start the record over
Can you feel my words creeping up your legs taking off your clothes?

[Chorus]
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl, you wanna bump it
Turn it up, don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it
Now put your hands on the radio
Don't be scared to touch it
Imagine I was there
Baby, pulling on your hair
Got some sex for your stereo
Show me how you take it
My words move like hands
And I'm singing to you naked
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl, you wanna bump it
Turn it up don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it

[Bridge]
Now you need a little bass
So let me give you a taste
I want you to feel my sub-woofer
Baby when I give it to ya
Now you need some highs
So I'ma make you touch the sky
Ooh girl, now slide your body near
Girl take them headphones
Come a little closer
So I can hear you when you moan
Now let me just adjust your knob
Turn it 'til I get you hot
Get you hot, get you hot
I won't stop, oh

[Chorus]
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl, you wanna bump it
Turn it up, don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it
Now put your hands on the radio
Don't be scared to touch it
Imagine I was there
Baby, pulling on your hair
Got some sex for your stereo
Show me how you take it
My words move like hands
And I'm singing to you naked
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl, you wanna bump it
Turn it up don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it

[Intro]
Damn, I'm so hungry
Plus I'm laying
What time is it?
I'll tell you what

[Verse 1]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning and the club is over
Shawty let's go get our grub on
I had way too much to drink and I need to get sober
So, let's go get our grub on
Baby, let's get out of here, I know a place not far from here
That I can get that grub on
Said my stomach's growling so crazy, would you please feed me baby?
Girl, let me get my grub on
No cheese steak or grits, I don't have a taste for that
I don't want pancakes or bacon, I don't have a taste for that
Girl, I want something fulfilling, that's gon' fill my appetite
Girl, you're the only one that can make it alright

[Chorus]
Will you be my IHOP baby? Can I place my order?
The food in here is crazy, twenty-four hours
'Round the clock you open, baby, here's a tip
You hop on top of me, I hop on top of you

[Verse 2]
I'm thinking 'bout going for seconds, maybe some dessert, Yeah
I'm still tryna get my grub on
And when I taste ya coffee with sugar and cream
This spot is where I belong oh
Cake and whip cream so divine, I could eat here all the time
Is there a doggy bag I could take home?
Telling you if you ain't tasted, think you better call your waitress
'Cause IHOP's open 'til the early morn
No fruitcakes, no salads, I don't have a taste for that
Looking for a meal with a balance, something that can satisfy me
Girl, I want something fulfilling, that's gon' take care of my cravings
So girl tell me can you feed me

[Chorus]
Will you be my IHOP baby? Can I place my order?
The food in here is crazy, twenty-four hours
'Round the clock you open, baby, here's a tip
You hop on top of me, I hop on top of you

[Bridge]
I like that blueberry syrup, I like that strawberry syrup
Now baby lay your body down and let me lick it all up
Now baby let's get you seated, don't need a plate to whoo
Get a good meal, let me show you girl, it's real
But it's gon' be just me and you
We gon' grub 'til we full, so tell me it's cool

[Chorus]
Will you be my IHOP baby? Can I place my order?
The food in here is crazy, twenty-four hours
'Round the clock you open, baby, here's a tip
You hop on top of me, I hop on top of you
Will you be my IHOP baby? Can I place my order?
The food in here is crazy, that's twenty-four hours
'Round the clock you open, I'll give you a big tip
You hop on top of me, I hop on top of you

[Outro]
Now gimme that rootie-tootie
That fresh and fruity
That, that, that big ol' booty
Now come and do me
Grub on, grub on
Grub on, grub on

[Intro]
Songz
It's Songbook, baby
Oh, oh, oh, whoo
Ride, ride, come and ride with the Prince
Come ride, ride, ride, ride with the Prince
Come ride, come ride, come ride
Uh, let's go

[Verse 1]
Friday night, and I'm home just chilling on the sofa
Relaxing, I'm so glad the week is over
I got my remote, good sack of that green, I'ma lean and smoke
Going through my cell for the number of a chick that I met last week and her body ain't no joke
She picked up on the first ring "What took you so long to call me?
Recognized your name and number from the caller ID"
She said her roommate is gone and she all alone
Let me get your street address, let me get dressed, and hung up the phone and it's on

[Pre-Chorus]
She want it and I want it too but I'm unprepared
And we came so close to going raw dog that we both got scared
And she said, "I ain't ready to have no babies," jumped up put my clothes back on
I was just about to get some, had to make a store run

[Chorus]
Store run, pack of three up at the counter
Store run, be back in less than half an hour
Store run, I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm, I had to make a store run

[Verse 2]
Speeding, switching lanes, and I'm flying
And I'm trying to get back to her before she changes her mind
'Cause if I take too long
She might put her clothes back on
Henny in my system, she tipsy on that Grey Goose
It's obvious what she's tryna get into
Top hugging them curves, got a nigga like me at a loss for words
I know she can tell that I'm with it, wanna get it, while it's H-O-T, she can tell when I'm close to her
She keep licking her lips, she touching and she grabbing
Oh, I'ma throw her the bone, I'ma give it to her all night long
I want it bad, oh so bad
But I know that it's wrong, here we go

[Pre-Chorus]
She want it and I want it too but I'm unprepared
And we came so close to going raw dog that we both got scared
And she said, "I ain't ready to have no babies," jumped up put my clothes back on
I was just about to get some, had to make a store run

[Chorus]
Store run, pack of three up at the counter
Store run, be back in less than half an hour
Store run, I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm, I had to make a store run
Store run, pack of three up at the counter
Store run, be back in less than half an hour
Store run, I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm, I had to make a store run

[Bridge]
All I could do is think of being inside you
I'm driving like I'm up out of my mind
Baby, here I come
And you can take your clothes back off

[Chorus]
Store run, pack of three up at the counter
Store run, be back in less than half an hour
Store run, I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm, I had to make a store run
Store run, pack of three up at the counter
Store run, be back in less than half an hour
Store run, I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm, I had to make a store run
Store run, pack of three up at the counter
Store run, be back in less than half an hour
Store run, I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm, I had to make a store run

[Outro]
I know, I know, shoulda thought of this before
But who would've thought that we'd end up right on the kitchen floor?
I ain't ready to have no babies, no ifs, ands, buts, or maybes
I'm tryna keep it safe, girl, ain't you heard of AIDS?

[Chorus]
I can't stop missing you
Wish I was there with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you
Wish I was there with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
I miss the way you kiss
Miss the way you wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way your hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here 'til the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out?
Do you still live at your old house?
Do you got somebody new in your life?
'Cause I can't get you out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanna erase
But I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it? Simply 'cause I can't

[Chorus]
I can't stop missing you
Wish I was there with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you
Wish I was there with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
I can't stop missing everything you say
Missing all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away?
I want you to know
It's been hell tryna do this without you here
Baby, '07's supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts
Every time you was going out
'Cause I knew you were telling me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanna erase
But I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it? Simply 'cause I can't

[Chorus]
I can't stop missing you
Wish I was there with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you
Wish I was there with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no

[Bridge]
Wish I could wake up and forget about you
Not try to call you when I know I want to
Oh wish I, I gotta fight this feeling, wish I, can't let it take over me
Wish I, You just don't understand how much you were a part of me

[Chorus]
I can't stop missing you
Wish I was there with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you
Wish I was there with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you
Wish I was there with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you
Wish I was there with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you
Wish I was there with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no

[Outro]
I can't stop missing you
I can't stop missing you
I don't wanna stop
I can't stop missing you, baby
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you

[Chorus]
Last night I had the strangest dream I've ever known before
I dreamed that all the world agreed to put an end to war

[Verse]
I dreamed I saw a mighty room, the room was filled with men
And the papers they were signing said they'd never fight again
And when the papers were all signed, and a million copies made
They all shook hands and bowed their heads and grateful prayers were prayed
And the people in the streets below were dancing round and round
While swords and guns and uniforms lay scattered on the ground

[Chorus]

[Intro: Narrator]
This is Bo Burnham. He is 22 years old, he's a male, and he looks like the genetic product of a giraffe having sex with Ellen DeGeneres. He has a gigantic head and tiny nipples. He's isolated himself over the last five years in pursuit of comedy and, in doing so, has lost touch with reality. You're an asshole, Bo. You hear me? You think you know better than me. You think you know better than everybody. You will die alone, and you will deserve it. But in the meantime, you might as well tell those silly jokes of yours. See if that helps.

[Break]
Bo! Bo, Bo, Bo!
Bo! Bo, Bo, Bo!
Bo! Bo, Bo, Bo!
Bo! Bo, Bo, Bo!

[Verse 1: Bo Burnham]
You used to do comedy when you felt like being funny
But now, you're contractually obligated
So dance, you fucking monkey
Dance, monkey, dance!
Welcome to the show
This is Bo, this is his show
And Bo likes to dance like this
Welcome to the show
This is Bo, this is his show
And Bo takes off his pants like this
Play an invisible drum
Play an invisible trumpet (Trumpet sound)
Drink some invisible water
Oh shit, that water's real!

[Bridge 1: Bo Burnham]
Bo wants to make you feel comfortable
Bo wants to make you feel comfortable (Random voice)
Bo wants to make you feel comfortable
So sit back, relax, and enjoy
A healthy dose of
Prolonged eye contact (Prolonged eye contact)
Prolonged eye contact (Prolonged eye contact)
Prolonged eye contact (Prolonged eye contact)
Prolonged eye contact (Prolonged eye contact)
Prolonged eye contact (Prolonged eye contact)
Prolonged eye contact (Prolonged eye contact)
Prolonged eye contact (Prolonged eye contact)
Prolonged eye contact
Prolonged eye contact (Prolonged eye contact)
Prolonged eye contact (Prolonged eye contact)
Prolonged eye contact (Prolonged eye contact)
Lick your lips to make it more comforting

[Verse 2: Bo Burnham]
Do you want to see a magic trick?
Do you want to see a magic trick?
Do you want to see a magic trick?
Then pick a card, any card
Psych!

[Bridge 2: Bo Burnham]
Magic isn't real, you idiot (Read a book)
Magic isn't real, you idiot (Read a book)
Magic isn't real, you idiot (Read a book)
Magic isn't real
Or is it?

[Interlude 1: Bo Burnham, Troll & Pentacorn]
And at that moment, Bo's 20-year old cynicism melted into childlike wonder. He never knew there could be so much magic in the world
It's a world of possibilities, Bo. What do you want to do first?
Run? Yeah, sure you can run
Fly? Well, yeah, you can fly
What? What are you— What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Stop. S— Stop it. The fu— You fucking idiot. Stop. Stop. Stop
Anyways...
In the distance, Bo saw a beautiful fairy
A fairy so beautiful that he felt proud about being called one in high school
He then came across an old bridge with a troll standing guard
Bo knew that he'd have to answer a riddle to get by
The troll spoke thus:
"Alright, for the last time, man: I'm not a troll, I'm homeless. Okay, do you have any spare change? Okay, that's a used napkin. I don't want that. No, no. Stop, just— You know what? Leave. Just leave. Please leave."
And then, as Bo arrived on the other side of the stage
He saw a unicorn, with five horns, right in front of him
And the penta-corn spoke thus
"Hello, Bo
I've been looking for you for quite a long ti—"
(*Gunshots*) (*Reloads Gun*) (*More Gunshots*)
He was safe... for now. But the dark thoughts would soon return

[Pre-Verse]
(It's Godzilla!)
(*Godzilla Shrieking*)
(*Screaming*)
(*Buildings Crashing*)

[Verse 3: Bo Burnham]
It's so hard to be a lizard
It's hard to be a lizard (What did we do God? What did we do) (He killed my wife)
Tiny arms, itchy gizzards ("That monster killed my wife! Why is he singing!?")
It's hard to be a lizard (He's a monster) (Why!?)
But it's harder to segue

[Verse 4: Bo Burnham]
Is he skiing? Or is he in a gay porn?
Is he skiing? What? Or is he in a gay porn?
Is he skiing? Huh? Or is he in a gay porn?
Here's a hint (*spits into hand*)
He's in a gay porn

[Interlude 2: Bo Burnham]
Okay Bo, this miming shit is getting pretty annoying
So give them the real thing

[Verse 5: Bo Burnham (Auto-Tuned)]
My voice is so fucking natural
It's naturally good (*Voice cracks*) naturally good
Naturally good

[Bridge 3: Bo Burnham]
This is the end of the song at the beginning of the show
Welcome to the show!

[Skit 1: Bo Burnham]
That lizard part was pretty fucking stupid
We're uh- recording part of the CD tonight
And yeah, good to start off with 8 minutes of mime jokes, for the CD
I want to start off with a joke for the fellas
I don't feel like I connect with my men in the audience
As well as I do with my, uh, prepubescent girls
Where my fellas at!? Fellas!?
Yo fellas, don't you hate it when you're sucking a guy's dick
And he ends up being a faggot?
Am I right?
These fucking faggots with their tasty dicks
Alright, um-
If you'd like to leave during the show
The exit signs are marked clearly in red
Sort of an orangish, reddish, fiery red
So we'll be fucked if we need them
But we can see them now!
Um, this show is called "what."
And I hope there's some surprises-

[Accidentally knocks over water bottle]
Oh

[Verse 6: Voiceover]
He meant to knock the water over
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But you all thought it was an accident
But he meant to knock the water over
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Art is a lie
NOTHING IS REAL

[Skit 2: Bo Burnham]
So it's called "what."
And uh, it's about
Hey, cool it

[Verse 7: Voiceover]
He meant to knock the water over
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But you all thought it was an acc-

[Skit 3: Bo Burnham]
Take it off repeat, it won't
This is the good thing
We can edit all this
In the actual CD recor-

[Verse 8: Voiceover]
He meant to play the track again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But you all thought it was an accident
But he meant to play the water track a-
Gain, gain, gain
Art's still a lie
NOTHING'S STILL REAL

[Skit 4: Bo Burnham]
What's the deal with segues?
Uh, food jokes
Let's do some food jokes
How you guys doing in the nosebleeds?
Up-top?
Yes, the nosebleeds
Where the cocaine is done
I had a hot dog for breakfast in Madison actually this morning
Yeah, afterwards I felt like this
(Picks up stool and swings it around)
Because I couldn't control my stools
Alright, Jesus
For the people listening, I moved the stool around a lot. This is going to get difficult. But I'm glad you like poop-based puns; they'll be a majority of the show. Never waste a moment! Every moment could become a comedy moment! See, thank you so much
I um-

[Verse 1]
You, you light my red fire babe
Hot white, and blue
And I, I think that you
I think you’re so cool, babe
Loving everything you do

[Pre-Chorus]
You say we’re gonna run away
Put on your sundress, summer day
Flying around on the highway

[Chorus]
Spin me ’round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down
Spin me ’round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
You found me when I had lost my way
Foot down, we’re going all the way, touchdown
Gonna make a getaway, top down

[Verse 2]
You know what I want
Take me to the K-Mart, pick me up pink lip gloss
How you get so hot?
You’re making me crazy
Hoping you’ll never stop

[Pre-Chorus - Variation]
You say that we were meant to be
We’ll be together finally
Flying around and I’m finally free

[Chorus]
Spin me ’round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down
Spin me ’round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
You found me when I had lost my way
Foot down, we’re going all the way, touchdown
Gonna make a getaway, top down

[Bridge]
We’re on our way
We’re on our way
We’re on our way
We’re on our way

[Verse 3]
Why do I think too much?
You tell me not to worry
Because you’re the boss
And you, you got a real good plan
My trouble’s all over now
Because you’re my man

[Pre-Chorus - Variation]
You don’t know what you’ve done to me
You’re heavier than heavenly
Life on the run has set me free, me free now

[Hook: Gucci]
You can't tell me anything, no you can't talk to me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]

Lost 200 grams on water wippin', need some better bricks (fuck!)
Peep my new shit, Gucci Mane glue brick

Cooler than a penguin in a cooler with a lot of juice
Shawty swallow yea your daughter and she use a lotta spit

And French Montana can bite my swag, but I'm still head honcho (wop!)

[Hook: Gucci]
You can't tell me anything, no you can't talk to me

Drop my top with your main bitch, damn she off the leash!
Gotta mean lookin' at them jeans, as she po' my lean
Try to refrain from smoking the green, cause of all my friends
My girl said, "Me or the fucking lean!"  , and I choose the codeine
Bitch go 'head and leave, Ho just leave my keys

Said, "She ain't got nothin' on ya" , bitch he ain't got nothing on me!
And matter of fact bitch where's my pint at, cause you ain't my cup of tea!
(Guwop!)

[Hook: Gucci]

Double cuppin stuffing like a thug
Your head too good this lady

[Verse 1]
We never really got right down to talking, we couldn't seem to find the place or time
Distance in the miles between us made us kinda stranger
And it added to the distance already there between our minds
And Cindy I love you, yes, I love you, yes, I love you
And when I can't think of anything to say
Don't be reading something in my mind that isn't there

[Chorus]
Remember Cindy, I love you anyway

[Verse 2]
I look at you and wonder what you're thinking
I'm sure you felt the same, a time or two
We must both remember that true love sure costs us nothing
You just told me your affection and I owed the same to you
And Cindy I love you

[Chorus]
1. I hate getting my nails done
2. I can spend hours glued to Investigation Discovery. It's my favorite network

6. I enjoy doing laundry
7. I'm a homebody
8. I've had the same group of girlfriends for as long as I can remember
9. I'm always cold
10. Some of my favorite labels are Giuseppe Zanotti, Roberto Cavalli, Chanel and Versace
11. My pet peeve is when people spend lots of money just to impress others
12. My father taught me how to make curry chicken
13. I'm the best cook on the planet
14. I'm now listening to beats for my third album
15. My brothers are my world
16. I can't stand going to meetings or talking on the phone
17. I also hate texting and having to return emails
18. I collect paintings of Marilyn Monroe
19. I've always loved acting
20. My first movie, "The Other Woman" comes out next year

24. My fans inspire me
25. I plan to write a book about my life — someday!

[Intro]
Flatline, flatline, flatline, flatline

[Verse 1]
Lately you've been busy, wondering if you miss me
Why did you go against me? I just wanna know
How come you act so different? Just talk to me I'll listen
All the love I'm giving, don't act like you don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there

[Chorus]
Girl you always catch me at the bad time
When I know you probably think it's a lie
I know I told you last time was the last time
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Flatline, flatline
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?

[Verse 2]
Not breathing, what is it I'm not seeing?
She said she's leaving, damn I can't believe it
It's like my heart's bleeding knowing that you don't need me
Shut my heart down, now I don't know what I'mma do now

[Pre-Chorus]
I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there

[Chorus]
Girl you always catch me at the bad time
When I know you probably think it's a lie
I know I told you last time was the last time
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Flatline, flatline
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?

[Bridge]
Girl you always catch me at the bad time
Girl you always catch me at the bad time
I know I told you last time was the last time
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline, flatline

[Chorus]
Girl you always catch me at the bad time
When I know you probably think it's a lie
I know I told you last time was the last time
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Flatline, flatline
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?

[Verse 1]
Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old?
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold?
You can untrain yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
'Til next year?

[Pre-Chorus]
God, I can’t do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I’m not alone

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I’m coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I’m not alone?
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I’m coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I’m not alone? No

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I’m coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I’m not alone?
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I’m coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I’m not alone? No

[Instrumental Chorus]
Tires SCREECH outside. Dude 2 stands up
There's a small crash outside

Yelling

VOICE: FREEZE!

GUNSHOTS

The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other

FATHER miraculously shows up in the doorway, larger than life, with an M-16 in one hand and a white tiger on a leash in the other. The tiger mauls Dude 2 to death

FATHER (Rick Ross)
Boy, what did I tell you 'bout fucking around with these cops?! Dope game ain't made for brothas like you

THE BOY
Figured I can learn from the internet like everything else I've ever done. You were never there. It's all I had and all I ever needed. You think coming in here and saving my ass will make up for lost time? Fuck that. This all I got

FATHER motions the boy over with outstretched arms. Looking for some sort of appreciation for saving his son's life. THE BOY smugly denies the motion of affection
THE BOY
Don't play dad with me now! Too late for this fuckery. I'm packing my shit-

BANG!

FATHER kills his white tiger and now has his gun aimed at THE BOY

FATHER
You unappreciative sack of shit. Should've left you in your mama's mouth, boy

THE BOY dives for Dude 2's pistol which is now lying covered in blood on the floor. FATHER fires, misses and realizes he must reload. THE BOY steadies his shot as FATHER now has a full clip. THE BOY's phone is prone on the floor, somehow filming the action

BANG BANG!!

Two bodies drop. ZOOM shot of FATHER's bloody hand reaching for the phone. He shuts off the video and clutches his chest as THE BOY slowly pulls his bloody self up off the floor, pistol in hand

SCREEN goes black

THE END

[Verse: 1]
As my mind drift
Then split, like the middle of a spliff
I began to catapult off the cliff
Of the unknown, I got a feeling in my funny bone
That we're not the same, just antonyms of a different age
My soul flock, with the carefree
Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a Goldie
(Haha) L-M-F-A-O. I hate yall, but I spread love like mayo
Then spread slugs
My brain matter
Is a brain fatter
See my vision
Or my vision'll stare at ya
This is the future if I say so
Yall copping fitted caps
I'm about to go and cop a halo
The God of rap and I mean it
I play kickball with Mars
And marbles with Pluto and Venus
Witness the genius
I interact with the inner city villains
That are into your circle
Like a computer hack
Then give you that (Haha)

[Verse 1]
I had a king in a tenement castle
Lately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brown
He's taken the curtains down
He's swept with the broom of contempt
And the rooms have an empty ring
He's cleaned with the tears
Of an actor who fears for the laughter's sting

[Chorus]
I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never can

[Verse 2]
I had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisley
Lately he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blind
He lives in another time
Ladies in gingham still blush
While he sings them of wars and wine
But I in my leather and lace
I can never become that kind

[Chorus]
I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never can

[Verse 3]
I had a king in a salt-rusted carriage
Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon
Beware of the power of moons
There's no one to blame
No there's no one to name as a traitor here
The king's on the road
And the queen's in the grove till the end of the year

[Chorus]
I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can, they never can

[Verse]
I will miss you when you go much more than you'll ever know
But I'll have a memory to keep you near
In my heart, you will remain, but it just won't be the same
I will miss a million things that make you dear

[Chorus]
Your lovely ways make you so sweet
I prayed the angels fair will keep your happiness
So you'll be blessed just as you deserve to be
I wonder why there are so few lovely people like you
My but I will surely miss you when you go

[Chorus]
Your lovely ways make you so sweet
I prayed the angels fair will keep your happiness
So you'll be blessed just as you deserve to be
I wonder why there are so few lovely people like you
My but I will surely miss you when you go

Hah, woo!
Public Service Announcement and another annoying message from Slim Shady
Due to a massive amount of bootlegging
No thanks to this fucking guy, DJ Whoo Kid
And constant downloading
People are no longer buying CDs so that we can get paid for our fucking work
They are just continuing to get songs for free
Teenagers, older folks, and little fucking brats alike
See, what they do, is they buy computers, strictly pick songs that they like
And burn them on to CDs or put them on iPods
Causing major decrease in sound scan
Putting music retail in a tremendous slump
Causing artists such as myself, to make no money for record sales
And be forced to tour
Causing more stress
Arguments with my wife
Not being able to see my kids
Drink more
Take more pills
Punch more people in the face
Hate the world
And end up in rehab!
sighs
This has been a Public Service Announcement and an excuse to vent by Marshall Mathers
Not that I wouldn't have done the same thing if I could get music for free when I was a kid
But now that I rap for a living
Buy my goddamn CDs!
But in the meantime, buy this Obie Trice bootleg from DJ Whoo Kid and put more money in his pocket
Thanks

You love me , tell me you do
Cause too often love gets lost in the translation
So when I tell you I love you, I know that it is real
Baby, I can be your motivation

[Hook]
Your attitude is right, for real
Can't get you out of my mind, girl
And anything you need I got
Just tell me that you'll be mine, girl
If they tryna hate, so what?
Roll up and kill them with kindness
And if the temptation is real
Then maybe we can be timeless (timeless)

[Bridge]
Stay here with me, sleep here in my palace
Wanna be free? Frolic in my fabrics
Wrapped up in sheets (wrapped up in sheets)
Close your eyes imagining another day
Waking up next to me, baby
No other way, waking up next to you, baby
No other way, waking up next to you, baby
No other way, waking up next to you, baby
No other way, waking up next to you, baby

[Verse 2]
In the mornin', whether sunny or grey
All I wanna do is stay under the covers with you, baby
Any others be in the way (be in the way)
Cause it's something about your love I can't get over

[Hook + Bridge]

Hey, I wanna get with ya, yeah!
I wanna get with ya, yeah!
I wanna get with ya, yeah!

Got that .44 on my gut, I don't need no nigga but me
I'm a thug, yea, my mama raised a thug
But I'm a multi-millionaire, you wish you motherfucking was me

[Verse 1:]
Nigga wish you was the motherfuckin Gucci Mane
But stop man wit yo wishin' there cause on the real you trippin man
And I know bands can make her dance but I can’t really dance
You spend 100 thousand on it they will really glance
I throw so much money on me, I need hammer pants
And we can bet 1 million, that’s if you’s a gambling man
I ain’t running from it, I was born in Birmingham
East Atlanta, Bentley Mulsanne check my instagram
I’m a shooter, I’m a builder and I’m a business man
I talk so disrespectful that I hurt yo feelings damn
I whip and took a pass then to you, I need them extra grams
And when that choppa blip my bitch y'all say I’m goin' Ham

[Hook]

[verse 2:]
I’m fuckin with the young niggas, all my niggas thuggin'
Robin Hood of the city, all my niggas struggling
Big money Gucci nigga, I don’t do the budget
Feel just like eazy when he made eazy does it
Rap niggas name drop, Gucci Mane cocaine drop
Thought it was a choppa, 100 bottles of champagne popped
Thought I was a doctor, 50 pints on my counter top
4-58 cause I just load a Ferrari shop
Pray to be a hustla, man I got it from grandpa
In the kitchen cookin’ Rest In Peace to my grandma
Nigga ran off so Imma blow his fuckin’ head off
You can work for me cause now you got a dead boss

[Hook]
Who you? Dr. Dre? *laughs*
Are you a real doctor, dude? I mean, like
You know, can you prescribe some drugs for me, man?
Come on dude, I-I-I'll split whatever I get witcha okay?
*laughs*
*inhales*
*exhales* Ahhhhh, The Chronic

[Hook: Gucci Mane and Verse Simmonds]
Baby I don’t mean to stare cause yo nigga right there
I suggest you fuck with me cause baby I’m a bigger player
If yo man is a square then you shouldn’t fuck with squares
I suggest you call yo girl cause I fuck bitches by the pair
From the bed to the couch, fucking all over the house
If yo man don’t pay yo rent then I suggest you put him out
I suggest you invest in a nigga with some clout
I suggest that you put a rich nigga off in yo mouth
You know I’m ice cold
Ice cold 

[x4]

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I’m so cold when it comes to hoes
Think my heart is made of coal
If you ask my mama though, she’ll say my heart is made of gold
But my Rollie made of gold and my heart been turned to stone
And my boss a rolling stone and where he lay his head home
Baby girl I’m freezing, take me out the freezer
If you don’t believe me I can make you a believer
My motor had a heart attack, my truck, it had a seizure
All this gold around my neck, they think I come from Egypt
Gucci Mane got stupid grown so you can fire that weed up
Go on and call yo hairdresser cause I’ma fuck yo weave up
Diamond rings all on my fingers, I look like a preacher
Losers keepers, you can keep her, I just wanna freak her

[Hook: Gucci Mane and Verse Simmonds]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Coldhearted, I got mo' money than a gold artist
They say rapping make you money, I keep buying mo' 'raris
Strangers talk when they walk by me then they say sorry
And if a nigga touch me, shut down the whole damn party
Drinking Rosé out the bottle, like a ice cold vodka
They say you bought her the D but you just start balling
I used to run up on the scene but I got no degree, shawty
Niggas don’t gotta fuck with me long as these bitches keep calling
I’m a stone cold killer, load my shot Glock 40
You got a problem 'fore you walk, don’t be no dead man walking
Tried to be a humble nigga but my bread started talking
Tried to tell my dogs to stop but them choppas start barking
I say what the fuck I wanna say like my nigga Charles Barkley
How you gon' play ball with niggas when you niggas not balling?
Tried to sneak me in the joint, had to stomp 'em to the floor
I ain’t goin' back no more cause it’s so ice cold in the hole

[Hook: Gucci Mane and Verse Simmonds]
Uh, they say, uh, a black man is a pimp!
Well lemme tell you the biggest pimp on planet motherfucking Earth:
Is her momma
It's her momma that told her:
Get a man that a good job, gurl
Make sure he got a good car, gurl
Make sure he can take you out and buy you somethin, gurl!
What happened to just fallin' in love with a nigga wit a bus pass?
Just 'cuz you LOVE the nigga?
But I'm the pimp, motherfucker, I gotta be the player!

Biggest hoes, on Planet Earth, are walkin' through the motherfuckin' neighborhood
You KNEW when you got with the nigga he already had a woman
You KNEW he already had a family, but you FUCKED him anyway!
And you thought you was gon' LOSE the nigga, you went and got pregnant
Didn't ya bitch? DIDN'T YA! The Ol' keep a nigga, baby!
And den when the nigga AIN'T AROUND, what do ya tell the child?
"Awh, that nigga ain't shit, that's why yo Daddy ain't here, 'cuz that nigga ain't SHIT!"
How about bein' a woman, and tellin' the child the TRUTH? That yo momma, YOU was a ho!
Tell the kid! Momma was a ho, I was weekend pussy, I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out
That's why he ain't here. But he a good nigga. 'Cuz he take care of his REAL family
I was just a dumb bitch, tryna keep, a nigga that I wanted

[Intro]
When you were worrying about pissing on your fuckin' self, I was a stoner

I just drank with YSL just like a f- boss (I feel like Fabo)
Just like a f- boss, just like a boss, boss

[Verse 2]
Run that money up, like ya 'bout to start trial
When you beat the case, turn into a stoner child
We don't stand in line, foreign shoes hurt your feet
Everybody stoned, weed, lean, molly, E (Whoo)
Every time I walk inside the club I see everybody looking
You know I'm a stoner, I love drugs and I can't never be tooken
And you can suck my banana, but I won't eat your pudding
So come a lil' closer, my bitch won't know ya
Andalé andalé andalé, andalé andalé andalé
How the fuck a nigga think he gone survive on a YSL runway
(How fool?)
My glasses are metro no blood off your chest
I control ya ho like Net-and-flix
Your bitch is my dinner she wet like a fish
I took off her three legs, T-Rex

[Chorus]
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner

[Post-Chorus]
I just put a 40 on my wrist just like a boss
I just put 10,000 on my bitch just like a boss
I just drank with YSL just like a f- boss
Just like a f- boss, just like a boss, boss

I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel just like

Second gear (little Honda Honda) I lean right (faster faster)
Third gear (Honda Honda) hang on tight (faster faster)

To any place I know you like

Second gear (little Honda Honda) I lean right (faster faster)

Whoa, yeah!
You've got a '65 Chevy Malibu
With automatic drive
A custom paint job, too
I'll trade you for my old wheelbarrow
And a slightly used sombrero
And I'll even throw in a stapler, if you insist

Craigslist!
I'm on Craiglist, baby, come on!
Yeah

Well, we shared a quick glance
Saturday at the mall
I never took a chance
Never approached you at all
You were a blonde half-Asian with a bad case of gas
I was wearin' red Speedos and a hockey mask
Come on, let's find that love connection that we missed

On Craigslist!
Yeah, Craigslist, come on!
I'm on Craigslist
Oh, baby, maybe you are too!
Be bom ba chomb cadonk bin bam boo!
An open letter to the snotty barista
At the Coffee Bean on San Vicente Boulevard:
I know there were twenty people behind me in line
But I was on a cell phone call with my mother
Didn't you see me hold up my index finger?
That means, "I'll order my soy decaf hazelnut latte
In just a couple minutes"
So, what's with the attitude, lady?
No tip for you!

Got a trash can of Styrofoam peanuts
You can have 'em for free
You can drop by on the weekend
And pick 'em up from me
But the trash can ain't part of the deal
Only givin' you the peanuts
Get real!

Don't have no Hefty bag, so bring your own
Don't bug me with questions on the phone
Don't ask for help, don't waste my time
And don't complain, cause they won't cost you a dime
Just ask yourself:
Do you want my Styrofoam peanuts?
You can have my Styrofoam peanuts
Do you want my Styrofoam peanuts?
You can have them all
They're on Craigslist, yeah!
Craigslist!
Ow, baby, come on!
I'm on Craigslist, Craigslist, Craigslist!
I'm on Craigslist, Craigslist, Craigslist, now

Craigslist!

And pull her seven jeans down she like fuck drawls
And I'm like fuck that but she thought I was ignorant
Approached her like a gentleman
Her friends trying to get with him but

Through the doctor's exact calculations
He said, "Nigga, you almost bust the Final Destination
Shit, you must have had a blessing from Pastor Mason"
'Cause that trip to L.A. could have been my last vacation, what?

We can't be sitting up here, complaining about the bills
Complaining about whatever beef we may have

Got a lot of dreams, but pimping I never chase mine
This G strolling, heck to the cops, loaded
Pushing that new Rover, still copping the cola
Whipping that with soda
You looking at a Young Money soldier

Big dough folder, big lead holder
Shampoo bullets that hit heads and shoulders

[Hook 2x]

[Bridge 3]

[Verse]
Modern day gangsta, old school playa
A fine display of greatness at it's greatest
Send an array of strays at any patriot
Breaking down K's instead of quarters, it's kettle water
Please, no more zip locks or shoe boxes
My little niggas in school got shit now
All of the teachers in the school got fixed
When they seen me in the streets they give me gifts
I ain't riffing or raffing or rapping or yapping
No I ain't from the Nolia, but I'm clapping
No I ain't into coke, but I have it
No I ain't into dope, but I stock it
Like I ain't got the po in my pocket
No I don't like they clothes but I cop it
The white man looking like I ain't fit to go in my pocket
No I ain't fit to stop I'm still poppin
Holla, like I ain't at your throat
I'm a turtle neck collar
Our purpose is respect with a capital R
Whoever don't die today, they'll be back tomorrow nigga
I'm on a Harley, cruising by rides
With the stogey in my mouth, Makeveli in the iPod
Weezy F., nine milli and the eye's lied
Make you think that was a fire squad
The way I fire mine, in reality yall behind mine
So I can't see you, all you see is Evisu signs
Weezy

[Verse 1]
You, you make my life much brighter
You're always on my mind
You, you make my load much lighter
True love is hard to find
Sometimes I feel I have to get away
I change my mind when I look in your eyes
And when those clouds come in
And try to darken our days
I'll always want you to stay

[Chorus]
Stay darling
Stay, stay darling
Stay, stay darling
(You know you've got to stay)
Stay, stay darling

[Verse 2]
You saw through my lies and deception
Yeah, I was losing my way
You, you gave my life some direction
And now I'm ready to say
I know there's bound to be some hard times ahead
I'd be a fool to believe
But if you go I'd rather think of dying instead
I never want you to leave

[Chorus]
Stay darling
Stay, stay darling
(You know you've got to stay)
Stay, stay darling
Stay, stay please, stay darling

[Bridge]
When you walked out my door
I knew you'd be back for more
Let's leave the past behind
True love is so hard to find

Don't be afraid
It's going to be all right
Cause I know that I can make you love me
Love me, love, love, love, love me, love me

When you walked out my door
I knew you'd be back for more
Let's leave the past behind
True love is so hard to find
I'll always want you to stay

[Chorus]
Stay darling
Stay, stay darling
Stay, stay darling
Stay, stay please, stay darling

[Outro]
And then we can scoop, scoop, scoop, scodolybe bop, yeah

[Verse 1]
Accidentally I saw you this morning
You were lovely dressed in your wedding gown
And they say that you married a stranger to me
That had drifted to our old hometown

[Verse 2]
Accidentally you've met him one evening
And you say it was love at first sight
Accidentally on purpose you've married
Accidentally on purpose for spite

[Verse 3]
Because I saw you out cheating and running around
And I was just a fool with a heart of a clown
Accidentally you were mistaken that night
Accidentally on purpose for spite

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Because I saw you out cheating and running around
And I was just a fool with a heart of a clown
Accidentally you were mistaken that night
Accidentally on purpose for spite

[Verse 1]
Why am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around?
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near

[Pre-Chorus]
You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now, I realize

[Chorus]
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
In disguise, I can see it in your eyes

[Verse 2]
Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why

[Pre-Chorus]
You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now, I realize

[Chorus]
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
In disguise, I can see it in your eyes
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel in disguise
I can see it in your eyes

[Post-Chorus]
You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel

[Verse 3]
Now I believe that dreams come true
'Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that

[Chorus]
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
In disguise, I can see it in your eyes
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
Ooh, you're an angel
In disguise, I can see it in your eyes

[Post-Chorus]
You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel, baby

[Outro]
Clouds just disappear

[Verse 1]
Hurry up, I just can't wait
I gotta do it now, I can't be late
I know I'm not afraid I got to get out the door
If I don't do it now, I won't get anymore
You try to criticize my drive
If I lose, I don't feel paralyzed
It's not the game, it's how you play
And if I fall, I get up again now

[Chorus]
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over

[Verse 2]
Got past my first mistake
I'll only give as much as I can take
You're never going to see me standin' still
I'm never going to stop 'til I get my fill
It doesn't matter who you are
It's what you do that takes you far
And if at first you don't succeed
Here's some advice that you should heed

[Chorus]
You get up again, over and over
You get up again, over and over
You get up again, over and over
You get up again, over and over

[Bridge]
I'm not afraid to say I hear a different beat, oh
And I'll go out in the street, yeah
And I will shout it again
From the highest mountain

[Breakdown]
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

[Verse 3]
Hurry up, I just can't wait
I gotta do it now, I can't be late
I know I'm not afraid I got to get out the door
If I don't do it now, I won't get anymore
You try to criticize my drive
If I lose, I don't feel paralyzed
It's not the game, it's how you play
And if I fall, I get up again now

[Chorus]
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over

[Bridge]
I'm not afraid to say I hear a different beat, oh
And I'll go out in the street, yeah
And I will shout it again
From the highest mountain

[Interlude]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Shout it, shout it, shout it, ah
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over

[Chorus]
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over

[Breakdown]
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

[Chorus]
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over

[Outro]
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

[Verse 1]
When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Troubles seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore (Anymore)

[Verse 2]
Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore (Love don't live here anymore)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore (Anymore)

[Verse 3]
Through the windmills of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me (Me)
Why'd ya have to go away? (Away)
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love?

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore (Love don't live here anymore)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore (Anymore)
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore (Love don't live here anymore)
Live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore (Love don't live here anymore)
No, no, you don't, you don't live here anymore
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore (Love don't live here anymore)
No, you don't live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore (Love don't live here anymore)
You don't live here anymore

[Verse 1]
I can't lock my door
Oh, I don't have no privacy
The only thing that's mine
Is what's inside of me
When I've had enough
A little voice inside
It says you've got to be tough
You've got to take it in stride
Sometimes I am foolish
I let it get the best of me
At least I know that my mistakes
Are my responsibility
And

[Chorus]
I just have to laugh to keep from crying
I just have to laugh to keep from crying

[Verse 2]
I don't have a dime
Oh, to buy those pretty things
But I hear all the evidence
You know it all sounds the same
But I'm still waiting
I've got my hands open wide
You know my dream isn't fading
I keep it hidden inside
Oh

[Chorus]
I just have to laugh to keep from crying
I just have to laugh to keep from crying

[Verse 3]
My friends don't understand
Oh, they think I've lost my mind
And I'm choking back the tears
I've got to swallow my pride

[Chorus]
I just have to laugh to keep from crying
I just have to laugh to keep from crying

[Intro]
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la
When I look in your eyes
Baby, here's what I see
I see so much confusion
And it's killin' me

[Verse 1]
When I look in your eyes
Baby, here's what I see
I see so much confusion
And it's killin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I can't take it anymore (Take it anymore), baby
Why don't you dry your eyes, try and realize?
Love can open any door (Open any door), and maybe
If you trust in me I can make you see

[Chorus]
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, come to me, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, don't say maybe
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, come to me, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la

[Verse 2]
I can see you've been hurt before
But don't compare them to me (Don't compare them to me)
Cause I can give so much more
You know you're all I see (You know you're all I see)

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I can make it on my own (Make it on my own), baby
But I'd rather share all the love that's there
I don't want to be alone (Want to be alone), and maybe
You will see the light, baby, spend the night

[Chorus]
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, come to me, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, don't say maybe
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la, come to me, baby
Shoo-bee-doo-bee-doo, ooh la la
Come here, baby

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take it anymore (Take it anymore), baby
Why don't you dry your eyes, try and realize?
Love can open any door (Open any door), and maybe
If you trust in me I can make you see

[Chorus]
He's a pretender, he knows just what to say
He's a pretender, yeah you meet him every day
He's a pretender, like the fish that got away
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love

[Verse 1]
It was so strange the way he held my hand
I wanted more than just a one night stand
He had a way of making me believe
That he was mine and that he'd never leave

[Refrain]
I know that I should take my friends' advice
'Cause if it happened once, you know it happens twice
If there's a chance then I know I've got to try
I'll make him dance with me, I'll make him tell me why

[Hook]
He's a pretender
He's a pretender

[Bridge]
I'm not afraid to fall a hundred times
And I'll believe in all your silly lies
I'd like to think that I could change your mind
Don't say that I am blind, I know all about your kind

[Chorus]
He's a pretender, yeah you meet him every day
He's a pretender, like the fish that got away
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love

[Verse 2]
I like the way he moved across the floor
And when he danced with me I knew he wanted more
But in the dark things happened much too fast
I should've stopped him then, I knew it wouldn't last

[Refrain]
I know that I should take my friends' advice
'Cause if it happened once, you know it happens twice
If there's a chance then I know I've got to try
I'll make him dance with me, I'll make him tell me why

[Bridge]
I'm not afraid to fall a hundred times
And I'll believe in all your silly lies
I'd like to think that I could change your mind
Don't say that I am blind
You lied, you lied, you lied, you lied
You lied, you lied, you lied, you lied
You lied, you lied, you lied, you lied
You lied, you lied

I know all about your kind

[Outro]
He's a pretender
He's a pretender
He's a pretender
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love

He's a pretender, yeah, he knows just what to say
He's a pretender, yeah you meet him every day
He's a pretender, like the fish that got away
He's a pretender, don't know how he got that way

He's a pretender
He's a pretender
He's a pretender, like the fish that got away
He's a pretender, why'd I fall in love

[Chorus 1]
Crimes of passion
Give me such a sweet reaction
Oh, crimes of passion
Give me so much satisfaction

[Verse 1]
Don't play dumb with me, I know you know the score
I wait impatiently, tonight I'm yours
Show you what it's like to have your cake and eat it too
I think you'll like what I'm going to do, oh

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
I'm not the type of girl who likes to settle down
Some people say that I just want to fool around
Once I get a taste I want more
I'm like a baby in a candy store, oh

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
There's no reason to feel guilty
It's too late now, what's done is done
If you can keep it a secret darling
We can have some fun

[Verse 3]
I always want the things that I can't get
I don't believe in rules that you can't bend
Even when you say you've got someone at home
Tell her tonight that she's on her own

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[x3]

[Intro: James Cagney]
A copper... how do ya like that boys? A copper!
And we went for it... I went for it!
Treated him like a kid brother
And I was going to split fifty-fifty with a copper
They were there waiting to pin a medal on him
"C'mon, get up, get your hands up!"
Yeah, that's it, a nice gold medal for the copper
Only maybe he's going to get it sooner than he thinks!

[Chorus: Madonna]
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

[Verse 1: Madonna]
You think you can have my love for free
But I've got news for you
That's not the way it's gonna be
So don't come hanging 'round my door
If you're not ready to give
You're not gonna get much more

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy
This time you're gonna, gonna have to play my way
C'mon, make my day

[Chorus: Madonna]
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Can you feel the rhythm of my mind?
Boy, I've got so much to give
But I don't want to waste my time
I can't let my heart put on a show
Till you surrender, baby, you've got to let it go

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy
This time you're gonna, gonna have to play my way
C'mon, make my day

[Chorus: Madonna]
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

[Bridge: Madonna]
Drop your weapons
You'd better come clean
I've got you covered
I'll catch you when you fall to me

I'm not gonna hurt you
'Cause I'm not that kind
We're not going nowhere
Till you have a change of mind

[Interlude: James Cagney]
You haven't got a chance, come out with your hands up
'Come out with your hands up', the man says
How do you like that, ma? Heh!
Here's my answer, you dirty...

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy
This time you're gonna, gonna have to play my way
C'mon, make my day

[Chorus: Madonna]
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

[Outro: Madonna]
(Get up, stand tall)
C'mon, baby, make my day
('Cause my love is dangerous)
Going to have to play my way (This is a bust)
(Get up, stand tall)
Put your back up against the wall ('Cause my love is dangerous)
This is a bust (Get up, stand tall)
Get up, get up, get up, get up ('Cause my love is dangerous)
This is a bust (Get up, stand tall)
I'm so good for you, baby here I come
I'm going to get to you before the day is done ('Cause my love is dangerous)
This is a bust (Get up, stand tall)
C'mon, baby, make my day ('Cause my love is dangerous)
Going to have to play my way (This is a bust)
(Get up, stand tall)
('Cause my love is dangerous)

[Verse 1]
I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Verse 2]
I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

[Bridge]
If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Pre-Chorus]

[x3]
Reach out, reach out

[Chorus]
It’s not a big deal to say I love you still
Call out my name, I'll be here
It’s not a big deal to say my love is real
When you reach out I'll be there

[Verse 1]
Please don't be afraid to look me in the eye
Sad time is gone, I got no tears to cry
So don't so say you don't know I'm right
When I say we'll get by

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Nobody makes me feel the way that you do
Night time's such a thrill when I spend it with you
Now ask me what is on my mind
So I can tell you true

[Pre-Chorus]

[x3]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Got love for you so strong it's making me high
Don't know what I'll do if you won't give it a try
So now's the time to make it clear
Let me show you why

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Working Monday through Friday takes up all of my time
If I can get to the weekend, everything will work out just fine
That's when I can go crazy, that's when I can have fun
Time to be with my baby, time to come undone

[Chorus]
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to free my soul
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to lose control
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to free my soul
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to lose control

[Verse 2]
Couldn't wait to get older, thought I'd have so much fun
I guess I'm one of the grown-ups now, I have to get the job done
People give me the business, I'm not living in fear
I'm just living in chaos, got to get away from here

[Chorus]
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to free my soul
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to lose control
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to free my soul
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to lose control

[Post-Chorus]
Don't want to grow old too fast
Don't want to let the system get me down
I've got to find a way to make the good times last
And if you'll show me how, I'm ready now

[Refrain]
Slow down, you move too fast
Gonna make the good times last
Gonna let my hair hang down
I'm ready now
Slow down, you move too fast
Gonna make the good times last
Gonna let my hair hang down
I'm ready now

[Chorus]
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
Someone tell me, where's the party? (Where's the party?)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)

[Post-Chorus]
Don't want to grow old too fast
Don't want to let the system get me down
I've got to find a way to make the good times last
And if you'll show me how, I'm ready now

[Chorus]
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to free my soul
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
I want to lose control

Slow down, you move too fast
Gonna make the good times last
Gonna let my hair hang down
I'm ready now
Slow down, you move too fast
Gonna make the good times last
Gonna let my hair hang down
I'm ready now

[Chorus]
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)
Someone tell me, where's the party? (Where's the party?)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Where's the party? (Where's the party?)

[Outro]
We can make it all right
We can make you dance, we can make a party last all night
We can make it all right
We can make you dance, we can make a party last all night
We can make it all right
We can make you dance, we can make a party last all night
We can make it all right
We can make you dance, we can make a party last all night
We can make it all right
We can make you dance, we can make a party last all night
We can make it all right
We can make you dance, we can make a party last all night
We can make it all right
We can make you dance, we can make a party last all night

[Chorus]
He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playing cards and shooting dice
He's in the jailhouse now

[Verse 1]
Well I had a friend named Rambling Bob
Who used to steal, gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday
That Bob got locked up Sunday
They got him in the jailhouse way down town

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well I went out last Tuesday
Met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
Well she started in to spend my money
She started in to call me honey
We took in every honky tonk in town

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Hey
What?
Listen

[Verse 1]
I've had other guys, I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before until you walked through my door
I've had other lips, I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go, you're the one for me, baby
This I know, 'cause it's...

[Chorus]
True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you

[Verse 2]
I've heard all the lines, I've cried oh-so-many times
Those teardrops, they won't fall again, I'm so excited, 'cause you're my best friend
So if you should ever doubt wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear, those words whispered in your ear
I said...

[Chorus]
True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you
'Cause it's true love (This time I know it's true love)
You're the one I'm dreaming of (The one I'm dreaming of)
Your heart fits me like a glove (Heart fits just like a glove)
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you

[Bridge]
No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

[Refrain]
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's (True love, baby)
True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love it's true

[Verse 3]
So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said

[Bridge]
No more sadness, I kiss it goodbye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

[Verse 1]
"Make love, not war," we say
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight

But not with guns and knives
We've got to save the lives
Of every boy and girl
That grows up in this world

[Chorus]
There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go 'round

It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round

[Verse 2]
They think that love's a lie
But we can teach them how to try
Love means to understand
Reach out for someone's hand

Because everything you do
Comes back in time to you
We have to change our fate
Before it gets too late

[Chorus]
There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round

It's easy to forget
We've got to take a stand
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go 'round
(We've got to take a stand)
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round
(If you don't hear the sound)
Love makes the world go 'round

[Bridge]
Don't judge a man until you've been standing in his shoes
You know that we're all so quick to look away
'Cause it's the easy thing to do
You know that what I say is true

[Breakdown]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

'Round
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round

"Make love not war," we say
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight

[Chorus]
There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go 'round
It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go 'round
(We've got to take a stand)
Love makes the world go 'round
Love makes the world go 'round
(If you don't hear the sound)
Love makes the world go 'round

[Intro]
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?

[Verse 1]
When you see her, say a prayer
And kiss your heart goodbye
She's trouble, in a word get closer to the fire
Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
You're spinning round and round
You can't get up, you try but you can't

[Chorus]
¿Quién es esa niña? (Who's that girl?)
Señorita, más fina (Who's that girl?)
¿Quién es esa niña? (Who's that girl?)
Señorita, más fina (Who's that girl?)

[Verse 2]
You try to avoid her, fate is in your hands
She's smiling, an invitation to the dance
Her heart is on the street, tu corazón es suyo
Now you're falling at her feet
You try to get away but you can't

[Chorus]
¿Quién es esa niña? (Who's that girl?)
Señorita, más fina (Who's that girl?)
¿Quién es esa niña? (Who's that girl?)
Señorita, más fina (Who's that girl?)

[Verse 3]
Light up my life, so blind I can't see
Light up my life, no one can help me now
Run faster, her laughter burns you up inside
You're spinning round and round
You can't get up, you try but you can't

[Chorus]
¿Quién es esa niña? (Who's that girl?)
Señorita, más fina (Who's that girl?)
¿Quién es esa niña? (Who's that girl?) (La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Señorita, más fina (Who's that girl?)

[Bridge]
Light up my life, so blind I can't see
Light up my life, no one can help me now
Who's that girl?
Now, who's that girl?
Now, who's that girl?
Now, who's that girl?

[Outro]
¿Quién es esa niña? (Who's that girl?) (La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Señorita, más fina (Who's that girl?) (Who's that girl, tell me have you seen her?)
¿Quién es esa niña? (Who's that girl?) (La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Señorita, más fina (Who's that girl?) (Who's that girl, who's that girl?)
¿Quién es esa niña? (Who's that girl?) (La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Señorita, más fina (Who's that girl?) (Who's that girl, tell me have you seen her?)
¿Quién es esa niña? (Who's that girl?) (La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Señorita, más fina (Who's that girl?) (Who's that girl, who's that girl?)
¿Quién es esa niña? (Who's that girl?) (La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Señorita, más fina (Who's that girl?) (Who's that girl, tell me have you seen her?)

Je suis prête
Vous êtes prêt aussi?

[Verse 1: Madona & Prince, Madonna]
Are you wasting my time?
Are you just being kind?
Oh no baby
My love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time?
Are you just being kind?
Don't give me one of your lines

[Chorus: Madona & Prince, Madonna]
Say what you mean, mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong
This is not a love song

[Post-Chorus: Madonna, Prince]
Are you just being kind? (No-o)
Am I losing my mind? (Losing your mind)
Oh no baby
Yeah

Wait

[Bridge: Madonna & Prince, Madonna, Prince]
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
And those who run
Seem to have all the fun
But am I wasting my time?
She's so fine
Are you just being kind?
No

[Chorus: Prince, Prince & Madonna]
Come try to tell me what your enemies taught you
Show them never how I didn't do you wrong
That this is not a love song

[Post-Chorus: Madonna, Prince]
Ooh, are you just being kind? (No-o)
Am I losing my mind? (Losing your mind)
Oh no, baby

[Chorus:  Madonna & Prince, Madonna, Prince]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
That's how I feel
Don't fog my mind
(Don't)
Mean what you say or baby I am gone
This is not a love song

[Post-Chorus: Madonna, Prince]
Ooh are you just being kind?
(Embrasse-moi)
(What?)
Am I losing my mind
(Pour la dernière fois)
(Yeah)
Love song, love song

[Chorus: Madonna & Prince]
Don't try to tell me what your enemies taught you
I'm gone but I just want you to know
(Love song)
That this is not a love song that I want to sing

[Chorus]
I've got the moves, baby, you got the motion
If we got together, we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves, baby, you got the motion
If we got together, we'd be causing a commotion

[Verse 1]
You met your match when you met me
I know that you will disagree it's crazy
But opposites attract you'll see
And I won't let you get away so easy

[Pre-Chorus]
The love you save may be your own
Can't fight this feeling, aren't you tired of being alone?
You won't admit it but you know it's true
It's not a secret how I feel when I stand next to you

[Chorus]
I've got the moves, baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves, baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

[Verse 2]
Someday you'll see my point of view
You can't keep wishing on the stars, baby
What works for me can work for you
You've got to make a compromise and maybe

[Pre-Chorus]
Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game, so get into the groove

[Chorus]
I've got the moves, baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves, baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

[Post-Chorus]
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion

[Middle 8]
I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove

[Pre-Chorus]
Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game, so get into the groove

[Middle 8]
I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove

[Chorus]
I've got the moves, baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves, baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

[Post-Chorus]
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion

[Chorus]
I've got the moves, baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves, baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

[Verse 1]
Should have left you standing right where you stood
Should have let you go, should have had the sense to know
Like a train you'd come, and I'd lose my place
Now I'm on this trip, I took a fall from grace

[Chorus]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

[Verse 2]
I've had a map laid out from the day I was born
But the roads are blocked, and the paper is worn
And all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to laugh, never taught to let go

[Chorus]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

[Verse 3]
My conscience is clear I know right from wrong
That's a lie I know nothing except that you're gone
But there's more to learn from the look in your eyes
That trip round this world, the stars in the sky

Now all the books I've read, and the things I know
Never taught me to live, never taught me to let go

[Chorus]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, from the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love, Lord knows I've tried
Nowhere to go, no place to run
From the look of love, now I've come undone

[Outro]
(Nowhere to hide)
(No place to run)
(Nowhere to hide)
(No place to run)

Can't stop
Can't stop thinking about you babe, can't stop
Can't stop screaming and shouting your name, can't stop
Look out boy 'cause I'm going to the top
Of your list, can't stop

[Verse 1]
I've tried and tried to get next to you
My friends say I am blind I'll never break through
But I don't give in so easily
This I know, you just wait and see
I know that you're afraid that I might
Come steal your heart away in the night
But I can't take away what's not mine
You'll see, you'll come to me in time, can't stop

[Chorus]
Can't stop thinking about you babe, can't stop
Can't stop screaming and shouting your name, can't stop
Look out boy 'cause I'm going to the top
Of your list, can't stop

[Verse 2]
I've never gone the distance before
To find if love was worth giving more
I was born to love you I've got nothing to hide
I know about your secret side
So shut me out, I'll never let go
'Cause I can work a spell on your soul
I play the fool but it won't last for long
Oh no, 'cause baby I'm too strong, can't stop

[Chorus]
Can't stop thinking about you babe, can't stop
Can't stop screaming and shouting your name, can't stop
Look out boy 'cause I'm going to the top
Of your list, can't stop
Can't stop thinking about you babe, can't stop
Can't stop screaming and shouting your name, can't stop
Look out boy 'cause I'm going to the top
Of your list, can't stop

Don't be afraid to try
Just let me love you for a while
You'll see, what it's all about
Oh baby I can't clear you out

[Interlude]
(Can't stop)

[Verse 3]
So shut me out, I'll never let go
'Cause I can work a spell on your soul
I play the fool but it won't last for long
Oh no, 'cause baby I'm too strong, can't stop

[Bridge]
Don't be afraid to try
Just let me love you for a while
You'll see, what it's all about
Oh baby I can't clear you out

[Chorus]
Can't stop thinking about you babe, can't stop

Just can't help myself
You know I've got to have you and no one else (Can't stop)
Just can't help myself
You know I've got to have you and no one else (Can't stop)
Just can't help myself
You know I've got to have you and no one else (Can't stop)
Just can't help myself

[Verse 1]
I'll never be an angel
I'll never be a saint, it's true
I'm too busy surviving
Whether it's heaven or hell
I'm gonna be living to tell

[Pre-Chorus]
So, here's my story (My story)
No risk, no glory (No glory)

[Chorus]
A little up and down, and all around

Does your criticism (Criticism)
Have you caught up in what you cannot see?

A little up and down, and all around
It's all about survival
Up and down and all around
It's all about survival

[Chorus]
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

[Verse 1]
You need so much, but not from me
Turn your back in my hour of need
Something's wrong, but you pretend you don't see
I think I interrupt your life
When you laugh, it cuts me just like a knife
I'm not your friend, I'm just your little wife

[Chorus]
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't if you don't
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

[Post-Chorus]
They never laugh, not like before
She takes the keys, he breaks the door
She cannot stay here anymore
He's not in love with her anymore

[Verse 2]
The bruises they will fade away
You hit so hard with the things you say
I will not stay to watch your hate as it grows
You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

[Chorus]
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't if you don't
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

[Post-Chorus]
He takes a drink, she goes inside
He starts to scream, the vases fly
He wishes that she wouldn't cry
He's not in love with her anymore
He makes demands, she draws the line
He starts to fight, she starts the lie
But what is truth when something dies
He's not in love with her anymore

[Verse 3]
You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

[Chorus]
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't if you don't
Our luck is running out of time
You're not in love with me anymore
I wish that it would change, but it won't
'Cause you don't love me no more

[Post-Chorus]
They never laugh, not like before
She takes the keys, he breaks the door
She cannot stay here anymore
He's not in love with her anymore

He takes a drink, she goes inside
He starts to scream, the vases fly
He wishes that she wouldn't cry
He's not in love with her anymore
He makes demands, she draws the line
He starts to fight, she starts the lie
But what is truth when something dies
He's not in love with her anymore

[Outro]
She's had enough, she says, "The end"
But she'll come back, she knows it then
A chance to start it all again
'Til death do us part

[Verse 1]
Things haven't been the same
Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I'm never, ever, ever gonna let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand how it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

[Chorus]
Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

[Verse 2]
You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reasons why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along what I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever loving anybody else

[Pre-Chorus]
Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand how it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

[Chorus]
Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

[Pre-Chorus]
Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand how it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

[Chorus]
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

[Outro]
Mmm-mmm, my baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, my baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, my baby's got a secret for me
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm

[Verse 1]
Little girl, don't you forget her face
Laughing away your tears
When she was the one who felt all the pain

[Verse 2]
Little girl, never forget her eyes
Keep them alive inside
I promise to try
But it's not the same

[Chorus]
Keep your head held high
Ride like the wind
Never look behind, life isn't fair
That's what you said, so I try not to care

[Verse 3]
Little girl, don't run away so fast
I think you forgot to kiss
Kiss her goodbye

[Chorus]
Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall?
Does she hear my voice in the night when I call?
Wipe away all your tears, it's gonna be all right

[Bridge]
I fought to be so strong
I guess you knew
I was afraid
You'd go away too

[Verse 4]
Little girl, you've got to forget the past
And learn to forgive me
I promise to try
But it feels like a lie

[Chorus]
Don't let memory play games with your mind
She's a faded smile frozen in time
I'm still hanging on
But I'm doing it wrong

[Outro]
Can't kiss her goodbye
But I promise to try

Erotica, romance
Erotica, romance
My name is Dita, I'll be your mistress tonight
I'd like to put you in a trance

[Verse 1]
If I take you from behind, push myself into your mind
When you least expect it, will you try and reject it?
If I'm in charge, and I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild, let my mouth go where it wants to?

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it up, do as I say, give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to
I'd like to put you in a trance, all over

Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body

[Verse 2]
Once you put your hand in the flame, you can never be the same
There's a certain satisfaction, in a little bit of pain
I can see you understand, I can tell that you're the same
If you're afraid, well rise above, I only hurt the ones I love

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it up, do as I say, give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to
I'd like to put you in a trance, all over

I don't think you know what pain is

Only the one that inflicts pain can take it away (Trance, trance, trance, trance...)

[Verse 1]
Baby face, don't grow so fast
Make a special wish that will always last
Rub this magic lantern
He will make your dreams come true for you
Ride the rainbow to the other side
Catch a falling star and then take a ride
To the river that sings and the clover that
Brings good luck to you, it's all true

[Chorus]
Pink elephants and lemonade
Dear Jessie, hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day
Dear Jessie, see the roses raining on the love parade

[Verse 2]
If the land of make believe
Is inside your heart it will never leave
There's a golden gate where the fairies all wait
And dancing moons for you

Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade

[Chorus]
Pink elephants and lemonade
Dear Jessie, hear the laughter running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day
Dear Jessie, see the roses raining on the love parade

[Post-Chorus]
Your dreams are made inside the love parade
It's a holiday inside the love parade

[Bridge]
On the merry-go-round of lovers and white turtle doves
Leprechauns floating by, this is your lullaby
Sugarplum fingertips kissing your honey lips
Close your eyes sleepy head, is it time for your bed
Never forget what I said, hang on you're already there

[Pre-Chorus]
Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade

Candy kisses and a sunny day
Dear Jessie, see the roses raining on the love parade

[Chorus: Madonna]
I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right
I'd rather be your lover

[Verse 1: Madonna]
I don't know where I stand with you
I never ever make any plans with you
I don't know what I mean to you
The only thing I know is I dream of you

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
And all that I know (All that I know)
Is I just don't understand (Just don't understand)
Why my, mmmm, happiness
Always lies in the palm of your hand, but

[Chorus: Madonna]
I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right
I'd rather be your lover

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Sometimes, I know what you're thinking next
But wouldn't it be better if I loved you less?
Sometimes, I think that I made you up
But wouldn't it be better if I gave you up?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
And all that I know (All that I know)
Is I just don't understand (Just don't understand)
Why my, mmmm, happiness
Always lies in the palm of your hand, but

[Chorus: Madonna]
I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right
I'd rather be your lover
Are you surprised?

[Verse 3: Meshell Ndegéocello]
Tell me, what do you want, tell me, what do you need?
Tell me, what do you want, tell me, what do you need?
I, I bet you I, I give you what do you need
Take a walk within me, venture through the dark sea
Can't you see, I need you beside me?
Don't you see, I want you to want me?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna, Meshell Ndegéocello]
And all that I know (Tell me, what do you want, tell me, what do you need?)
Is I just don't understand (Just don't understand)
Why my, mmmm, happiness (Tell me, what do you want, tell me, what do you need)
Always lies in the palm of your hand (This ain't a chorus)

[Chorus: Madonna]
Now, I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right
I'd rather be your lover
Now, I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right
I'd rather be your lover
Are you surprised?
I could be your sister, 'cause I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I, I'd rather be your lover
That's right
I'd rather be your lover (Are you surprised?)
Are you?

[Verse 1]
It's funny that way
You can get used to the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

[Verse 2]
Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father, I have sinned

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

[Bridge]
Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?
Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?

[Verse 3]
Maybe someday
When I look back, I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

[Verse 1]
Get up on the dance floor, everything is groovin'
Get up on the dance floor, got to see you movin'
Let the music shake you, let the rhythm take you
Feel it in your body, sing "la di da di"

[Chorus]
Don't stop doin' what you're doin', baby
Don't stop, keep movin', keep groovin'
Don't stop doin' what you're doin', baby
Don't stop, keep movin', keep groovin'

Bring your body over, baby let me bump you

Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together

[Verse 1]
I got brothers, I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle, tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of sharing all the hand-me-downs
To get attention, I must always be the clown
I wanna be different, I wanna be on my own
But Daddy said, 'Listen, you will always have a home"

[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

[Verse 2]
I hit the big time, but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger, city life can get to you
People can be so cold, never want to turn your back
Just giving to get something, always wanting something back

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

[Bridge]
When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
Because blood is thicker than any other circumstance

[Refrain]
Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever, keep people together

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

[Bridge]
When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
Because blood is thicker than any other circumstance

[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

[Outro]
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever

[Intro]
You give me
You give me fever

[Verse 1]
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
Listen to me baby, hear every word I say
No one can love you the way I do
Because they don't know how to love you my way

[Chorus]
You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 2]
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
Because I know you're gonna treat me right
Bless my soul I love you, take this heart away
Take these arms I'll never use
And just believe in what my lips have to say

[Chorus]
You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 3]
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you should know
Fever isn't such a new scene
Fever started long ago
You give me fever, fever
You give me, you give me fever

[Chorus]
You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 4]
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet, she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said Julie baby, you're my flame
He gave her fever

[Bridge]
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
Because I know you're gonna treat me right

[Chorus]
You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

[Bridge]
Fever, with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you should know
Fever isn't such a new scene
Fever started long ago

[Verse 5]
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, "Daddy oh don't you dare"
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Missus
Daddy, won't you treat him right

[Outro]
Fever, when you kiss them
Fever, if you live and learn
Fever, until you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

[Chorus]
You, you make my life much bright, baby
You're always on my mind
Don't you know you, you make my load much light, baby
True love is ours to find

[Verse 1]
You came along when I was losing my way
You touched my heart and now I'm ready to say
That all your sweetness calling back ugly skies
And now I've fallen for the look in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I couldn't ask for more
You're what I'm looking for
Oh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel I have to get away
I change my mind when I look in your eyes
And when those clouds come in to darken our day
You're never going to hear me say good-bye

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Bridge]
Uh, oww, uh, oww
Uh, oww, uh, oww
Tainted love
Oh

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I know for sure his heart is here with me
Though I wish him back
I know he cannot see my hands trembling
I know he hears me sing

[Chorus]
I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this? If God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

[Verse 2]
He had to fight like all the rest
In the barrio, all the streets are paved with fear
I don't understand
At least he was a man

[Chorus]
I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this? If God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

[Refrain]
How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes, when will they ever learn?

[Verse 3]
You were not the Maravilla in our minds
We were proud to fight, but we cannot win this blind
Stand your gun's against the wall
Who's next in line to fall?

[Chorus]
I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ, he'll come tonight
To pray for Spanish eyes
And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this? If God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

[Interlude]
Tus lagrimas de tristeza
No me dejan olvidarte

[Refrain]
How many lives will they have to take?
How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?
Spanish eyes, when will they ever learn?

[Verse 1]
I can't stop thinking of you
The things we used to do
The secrets we once shared
I'll always find them there
In my memories

[Pre-Chorus]
But this heartache isn't going anywhere
In the public eye I act like I don't care
When there's no one watching me
I'm crying

[Chorus]
I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

[Verse 2]
I keep a picture of you
Next to my bed at night
And when I wake up scared
I know I'll find you there
Watching over me

[Pre-Chorus]
When my world seems to crumble all around
And foolish people try to bring me down
I just think of your smiling face
And I'm flying

[Chorus]
I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

[Breakdown]
You'll always be inside of my heart
Inside of me

[Pre-Chorus]
When my world seems to crumble all around
And foolish people try to bring me down
I just think of your smiling face
And I'm flying

[Chorus]
I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

[Outro]
I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love still carries on
(I will always feel you)
You'll always be inside of my heart
I'll always have you inside of me
(I will always have you, mom)

[Pre-Chorus]

[x3]
Reach out, reach out

[Chorus 1]
It’s not a big deal to say I love you still
Call out my name, I'll be here
It’s not a big deal to say my love is real
When you reach out I'll be there

[Verse 1]
Please don't be afraid to look me in the eye
Sad time is gone, I got no tears to cry
So don't so say you don't know I'm right
When I say we'll get by

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Nobody makes me feel the way that you do
Night time's such a thrill when I spend it with you
Now ask me what is on my mind
So I can tell you true

[Chorus 2]
It’s not a big thing, uh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]

[x7]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Got love for you so strong it's making me high
Don't know what I'll do if you won't give it a try
So now's the time to make it clear
Let me show you why

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
Just reach out
I'll be there 

[x5]

[Pre-Chorus]

[x4]

[Chorus 2]

[x7]

[Verse 1]
For thou art the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory
Forever and ever, amen
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee
Blessed art thou amongst women
And blessed is the fruit of thy

[Chorus]
Oh my God
I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee
And I detest all my sins because of Thy just punishment
But most of all, because I have offended Thee
Oh my God

[Verse 2]
Who art all good and deserving of all my love
I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace
To confess my sins, to do penance, to amend my life
And to avoid the temptations of evil

[Chorus]
Oh my God
I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee
And I detest all my sins because of Thy just punishment
But most of all, because, my God, I have offended Thee

[Outro]
Who art all good, like I knew you would
And deserving of all my love
I reserve, I reserve, I reserve
I reserve, I resolve
I have a reservation

[Verse 1]
You wouldn't let me say the words I longed to say
You didn't want to see life through my eyes
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You tried to shove me back inside your narrow room
And silence me with bitterness and lies
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)

[Pre-Chorus]
Did I say something wrong?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
(I must've been crazy)
Did I stay too long?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't speak my mind

You punished me for telling you my fantasies
I'm breaking all the rules I didn't make
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You took my words and made a trap for silly fools
You held me down and tried to make me break
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)

[Pre-Chorus]
Did I say something true?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
(I must've been crazy)
Did I have a point of view?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about you

[Intro]
This is not a love song
Bye bye baby

[Verse 1]
I keep on waiting, anticipating
But I can't wait forever
You say you love me, you're thinking of me
But we're never together

[Chorus]
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
This time we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

[Verse 2]
You had your chances, all your romances
And now I just don't want you
I know I love you because I hate you
And now I'd rather haunt you

[Chorus]
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

You're so beautiful
What makes you feel exciting?
What wakes you up inside?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say bye bye

[Chorus]
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say it

[Bridge]
I don't wanna keep the bright flame of your ego going
So I'll just stop blowing in the wind
To love you is a sin
Adiós

[Breakdown]
Uh, this is not a love song
I'd like to hurt you
What excites you? What turns you on?
What makes you feel good?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say goodbye
Bye bye

[Outro]
First time and the last time
You can forget about it, baby
Forget the rules, forget the fools
Forget your fears, forget my tears
You can forget about it, baby
Bye bye baby bye bye
You can forget about it, baby
'Cause it's the first time and the last time
You'll ever see me cry
You f**cked it up

Better get over here fast
They're gonna find out we're together

[Verse 1]
All work and no play
Makes Dick a dull, dull boy
Career gets in the way
Square jaw, oooh, such a handsome face
Why do you have to save the human race?
Life of crime, no it never pays
Clean up the streets and make your secret getaway

[Pre-Chorus]
All alone
In your room with your radio
No one to hold you
Had to let her go

[Chorus]
You're a man with a gun in your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't take time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run (On the run)
Oh, God! Let me be the one (Be the one)
And I don't mean with a gun

[Verse 2]
All bucks and no brains
Bullies and thugs
They take up all your time in vain
Can't let go
Someone cries and you hear the call
Who's going to catch you?
Don't good guys ever fall?

[Chorus]
You're a man with a gun in your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't take time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run (On the run)
Oh, God! Let me be the one (Be the one)
And I don't mean with a gun

Nobody knows who they are
And you better get over here right away
Can you get down here Tracy?
Better get over here fast
They're gonna find out we're together

[Pre-Chorus]
All alone
In your room with your radio
No one to hold you
I would never let you go

You're a man with a gun in your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't take time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run (On the run)
Oh, God! Let me be the one (Be the one)
'Cause I can show you some fun (Some fun)
And I don't mean with a gun, no

(You are a man)
Oh, with a gun in your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't make time, it's not nice
So here's my advice
Take your love on the run (On the run)
Oh, God! Let me be the one (Be the one)
And I don't mean with a gun
Take it out of your hand
Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore
If you don't make time, it's not nice
So here's my advice

Take your love on the run (On the run)
Oh, God! Let me be the one (Be the one)

I don't, don't care if it's not right
(Don't go near the fire, don't go in the dark)
To have your arms around me
(Don't give in to your desire, 'cause he's going to break your heart)
I want to feel what it's like
(Let go, let go)
Take all of you inside of me

[Chorus]
In your eyes (In your eyes), forbidden love
In your smile (In your smile), forbidden love
In your kiss (In your kiss), forbidden love
If I had one wish, love would feel like this (Love would feel like this)

[Verse  2]
I know that you're no good for me
That's why I feel I must confess
What's wrong is why it feels so right
I want to feel your sweet caress

In your eyes (In your eyes), forbidden love
In your smile (In your smile), forbidden love
In your kiss (In your kiss), forbidden love
If I had one wish, love would feel like this (Love would feel like this)

Love would always feel like this
Wishing on the stars above
Forbidden love
If I only had one dream
This would be more than it seems

[Intro]
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Verse 1]
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
The deeper I go

All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Bridge]
Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Outro]
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
You've got to just let your body move to the music
You've got to just let your body go with the flow
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
I can't keep from falling in love with you
You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do
Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Baby, it's time that you faced it
I always get my man

Sooner or later, you're gonna decide
Sooner or later, there's nowhere to hide
Baby, it's time, so why waste it in chatter?
Let's settle the matter
Baby, you're mine on a platter
I always get my man

But if you insist, babe
The challenge delights me
The more you resist, babe
The more it excites me
And no one I've kissed, babe
Ever fights me again

If you're on my list, it's just a question of when
When I get a yen
Then baby, Amen
I'm counting to ten
And then
I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known
I'm gonna love you, and you all alone
Sooner is better than later
But lover, I'll hover
I'll plan
This time I'm not only getting; I'm holding my man

[Verse 1]
These are my hands, but what can they give me?
These are my eyes, but they cannot see
These are my arms, but they don't know tenderness
And I must confess that I am usually drawn to sadness
And loneliness has never been a stranger to me

[Chorus]
But love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin
Love tried to take me in

[Verse 2]
These are my lips, but they whisper sorrow
This is my voice, but it's telling lies
I know how to laugh, but I don't know happiness
And I must confess
Instead of spring, it's always winter
And my heart has always been a lonely hunter, but still

[Chorus]
Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
I was covered with dust and sin
Love tried to take me in
Love tried to break me

[Verse 3]
And I must confess, instead of spring, it's always winter
And my heart has always been a lonely hunter, but still

[Chorus]
Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
(I was) guilty of lust and sin
Love tried to take me in

[Chorus]
Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Covered with dust and sin
Love tried to take me in
Love tried to break me (Love tried to welcome me)
But my soul drew back
(Guilty of lust and sin) I was covered with dust, covered with sorrow
(Love tried to take me in) Covered

[Outro]
Still, love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin (Covered with dust and sin)
Love tried to take me in
Love tried to break me (Love tried to welcome me)
Love tried to welcome me (But my soul drew back)
But my soul drew back (Guilty of lust and sin)
I was covered with sadness (Love tried to take me in)
Love tried to welcome me

[Chorus]
These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life

[Bridge]
Dreaming alone and I feel that someone
Listens to me
Angel for life

[Chorus]
These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life

[Verse]
Heaven is smiling down, heaven's girl in a wedding gown
I'm going to be so good, just like a good boy should
I'm going to change my ways
Angel for life
Of all the saints alive
Don't I feel like a saint alive
She's not mine for eternity
Though I'll never fly so high
I'm smiling

[Outro]
I believe in magic
Angel for life

[Spoken Intro]
Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice
Him or her I shall follow

[Verse 1]
Who needs the sun, when the rain's so full of life
Who needs the sky
It's here in your arms I want to be buried
You are my sanctuary
Who needs the sun, when the rain's so full of life?
Who needs the sky?
It's here in your arms; I want to be buried
You are my sanctuary

[Verse 2]
Who needs a smile, when a tear's so full of love
Who needs a home, with the stars up above
It's here in your heart I want to be carried
You are my sanctuary
Who needs the light, with the darkness in your eyes
Who needs to sleep, with the stars in the sky
It's here in your soul I want to be married
You are my sanctuary

[Spoken]
And the earth was void and empty
And darkness was upon the face of the earth

[Bridge]
Is all of this pain so necessary
You are my sanctuary

[Spoken]
Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice
Him or her I shall follow
As the water follows the moon, silently

[Outro]
Who needs the sun? (With fluid steps)
Who needs the sky? (Around the globe)
Who needs to sleep? (I hear your voice)
You are (You are) my sanctuary
You are (You are, you are)
You are (You are) my sanctuary

[Intro]
Hola! Ese bato loco!

[Verse 1]
I'm going bananas
And I feel like my poor little mind is being devoured by piranhas
For I'm going bananas
I'm non compos mentes
And I feel like a tooth being drilled, a nerve being killed by a dentist
For I'm non compos mentes

[Chorus]
Who knows?
Could be the tropic heat
Or something that I eat
That makes me gonzo
I do carry on so, for

[Verse 2]
I'm going bananas
Someone book me a room in the hot hacienda with all my mañanas
For I'm going bananas
I'm going meshuga
All day long there's a man in my brain incessently playing "Booga wooga"
But I'm going meshuga
There's bats in my belfry
Won't you make sure this straight jacket's tight otherwise I might get myself free
Yes, there's bats in my belfry

[Chorus]
Who knows?
Could be the wine I drink
Or it's the way I think
That makes me gonzo
Oh, Doctor Alonzo says

[Verse 3]
I'm going bananas
Someone get me a bed in the "Casa de Loco" for all my mañanas
For I'm going bananas
Yes, I'm going bananas
Si, I'm going bananas

[Outro]
Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!

[Intro]
Warm inside, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'd like to direct your attention
To something that needs directing to
A lot of people talk about
Dining in and eating out
I guess that's what this song's about
I know this is not a dining room conversation
And you don't have to listen if you don't have the time
But let me remind you in case you don't already know
Dining out can happen down below

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's talking about
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different kind of kiss

[Chorus]
So won't you go down where it's warm inside
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down that's where my love is

[Verse 2]
Now what could be better than a home cooked meal
How you want to eat it depends on how you feel
You can eat all you want and you don't get fat
Now where else can you go for a meal like that
It's not fair to be selfish or stingy
Every girl should experience eating out
Sometimes when I come home from a hard day at work
I swear it's all I can think about

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's talking about
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

[Chorus]
So won't you go down where it's warm inside
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down that's where my love is

[Verse 3]
Colonel Sanders says it best
"Finger licking good"
Let's put what you've learned to the test
Can you make a fire without using wood?
Are you still hungry; aren't you glad we came?
I'm glad you brought your raincoat
I think it's beginning to rain

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's talking about
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

[Chorus]
So won't you go down where it's warm inside
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down that's where my love is

[Outro]
That's where my love is
Come inside
That's where all life begins
It's warm inside

[Verse 1]
Today is the last day that I'm using words
They've gone out, lost their meaning
Don't function anymore

[Refrain]
Let's
Let's
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious, honey

[Verse 2]
Today is the last day that I'm using words
They've gone out, lost their meaning
Don't function anymore

[Chorus]
Traveling
Leaving logic and reason
Traveling
To the arms of unconsciousness
Traveling
Leaving logic and reason
Traveling
To the arms of unconsciousness

[Refrain]
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious

[Verse 3]
Words are useless, especially sentences
They don't stand for anything
How could they explain how I feel

[Chorus]
Traveling
I'm traveling
Traveling
Leaving logic and reason

Traveling
I'm gonna relax
Traveling
In the arms of unconsciousness

[Refrain]
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious

[Bridge]
And inside we're all still wet
Longing and yearning
How can I explain how I feel?

[Refrain]
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious

[Chorus]
Traveling, traveling
Traveling, traveling
Traveling, traveling
In the arms of unconsciousness

[Outro]
And all that you've ever learned
Try to forget
I'll never explain again

[Verse 1]
My guy is really something
He's sensitive and shy
My guy is such a bumpkin
It doesn't take much to make him cry, if you
Hurt someone helpless, it's like
Taking away all his toys, he's just a
Cry baby boy

[Verse 2]
My guy is sentimental, he's
Always feeling blue
He can be so temperamental and
I don't know what I should do, if you
Step on a little bug
He cries all over the floor, he's just a
Cry baby bore

[Chorus]
I don't want to hurt his feelings
But his outbursts have me really
Boo-hoo-hoo-ing all the time
If I turn out like him
I think I'm going to cry, baby
La, la, la-la-la-la
He's such a cry baby
La, la, la-la-la-la

[Spoken]
And I'll tell you something else

[Verse 3]
My guy is such a wet noodle, he's
Always teary-eyed
He acts like a real cock-a-doodle, he
Can't even tell you why
If you just play him a sappy song, he
Acts like his dogie just died
He's just a cry baby guy
No kidding, oh dear

[Verse 4]
My guy is such a whiner, he's
Worse than Betty Sue
A cockroach seen in the diner and
The tears flow out of the blue
And if I ask him to knock it off
He goes and cries in the can, he's just a
Cry baby man

[Chorus]
I don't want to hurt his feelings
But his outbursts have me really
Boo-hoo-hoo-ing all the time
If I turn out like him
I think I'm going to cry, baby
La, la, la-la-la-la
He's such a cry baby
La, la, la-la-la-la

[Bridge]
I love a cry baby
La, la, la-la-la-la
He's such a cry baby
La, la, la-la-la-la

[Outro]
Would you knock it off please?
Thank you

[Verse 1: Madonna, Babyface]
Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)
Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
(No one around)
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

[Verse 2: Madonna, Babyface]
Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breaking my heart
(Breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
(Just make them smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
(Role that you played)
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

[Bridge: Madonna, Babyface]
All the world is a stage (World is a stage)
And everyone has their part (Has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story’d go?
How was I to know you'd break (You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart?

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you
(I've always been in love with you)
I guess you've always known
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

[Outro: Madonna]
Say good-bye

[Verse 1]
Seems I've played the game for much too long
I let people buy my love and I
Never got to sing my songs for you
I had all my bets laid all on you
Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose
In the game of love you pay your dues
Say that happiness can not be measured
And a little pain can bring you all life's little pleasures
What a joke

[Chorus]
I was not your woman, I was not your friend
But you gave me something to remember
No other man said, "Love yourself"
Nobody else can
We weren't meant to be
At least not in this lifetime
But you gave me something to remember
I hear you still say, "Love yourself"

[Verse 2]
I had all my bets laid all on you
Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose
In the game of love I've paid my dues
Guess I'm waiting for my place in your sun
Wish I had the chance to know you and it wasn't stormy weather
What a shame, who's to blame?

[Chorus]
I was not your woman, I was not your friend
But you gave me something to remember
No other man said, "Love yourself"
Nobody else can
We weren't meant to be
At least not in this lifetime
But you gave me something to remember
I hear you still say, "Love yourself"

[Verse 1]
Something's missing and I don't know why
I always feel the need to hide my feelings from you
Is it me or you that I'm afraid of?
I tell myself I'll show you what I'm made of
Can't bring myself to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart, I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do
I don't wanna feel blue

[Chorus]
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy, I'm not happy

[Verse 2]
Something's happened and I can't go back
I fall apart every time you hand your heart out to me
What happens now, I know I don't deserve you
I wonder how I'm ever gonna hurt you
Can't bring myself to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do
I don't wanna feel blue

[Chorus]
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy, I'm not happy this way

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do
I don't wanna feel blue

[Chorus]
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way
I'm not happy this way
Bad girl drunk by six (Not happy this way)
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy, I'm not happy this way

[Outro]
I'm not happy this way
Kissing some kind stranger's lips

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna show you
That good guys don't always win
I'm gonna show you
The brighter side of livin' in sin
So when you're six feet under
You won't wonder why
Just 'cause you gotta halo
Don't mean that you can fly

[Pre-Chorus]
If you thought it was over, you're way off track
You made a blunder

[Chorus]
And you put me back (Put me back)
Back in business (I'm back and I'm on the right track)
This ain't no hit or miss
I'm gonna get my way (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause you put me back (Put me back)
Back in business (Put me back and I'm on the right track)
You're my first witness
And I'm here to stay

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna show you
Good guys always finish last
Speaking of virtue
Being nice is a thing of the past
When I want something done
I'll say it with a gun
Just 'cause you're an angel
Don't mean you're havin' fun

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanted to thank you for what you lack
Hope they don't hang you

[Chorus]
'Cause you put me back (Put me back)
Back in business (I'm back and I'm on the right track)
This ain't no hit or miss
I'm gonna get my way (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause you put me back (Put me back)
Back in business (Put me back and I'm on the right track)
You're my first witness
And I'm here to stay

[Bridge]
A tisket, a tasket, you lost your yellow basket

[Spoken]
You don't know if you want to hit me or kiss me

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanted to thank you for what you lack
Hope they don't hang you

[Chorus]
'Cause you put me back (Put me back)
Back in business (I'm back and I'm on the right track)
This ain't no hit or miss
I'm gonna get my way (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause you put me back (Put me back)
Back in business (Put me back and I'm on the right track)
You're my first witness
And I'm here to stay

[Outro]
(He's back in business now)
Gimme a hand and I'll take a bow
(He's back in business now)
Bah dah, buh dah dah, buh dah dah, buh dah dah
(He's coming back in style)
Gimme an inch and I'll take a mile
(He's back and my, oh, my)
Buh dah, buh dah dah, buh dah dah, buh daah
(He's back in business now)
Gimme a hand and I'll take a bow
(He's back in business now)
Buh de de bah bah, buh dah dah, buh dah dah, buh dah dah bah
(He's coming back in style)
Gimme an inch and I'll take a mile
(He's back and my, oh, my)
Wah wah wah wah wah

[Intro]
I, yi yi yi
I, yi yi yi
I, yi yi yi

[Chorus]
I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you
Da-da, da-da, da da-da

[Verse 1]
I'll give you all the love I want in return
But half a love is all I feel, sweet darling
It's too bad, it's just too sad
You don't want me anymore
But I'm going to change your mind
Some way, somehow

[Chorus]
I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you
Da-da, da-da, da da-da

[Verse 2]
One way love is just a fantasy
To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with something you should cherish for life
Oh baby, don't you want to care
Isn't it lonely out there

[Chorus]
I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you

I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want me baby, just like I want you
Da-da, da-da, da da-da

[Outro]
I want you, the right way
Want me baby
Don't play with something you should cherish for life

[Intro]
Cool, I am, when I am with you
Cool, I'm not, when I am lonely

[Verse 1]
I feel so sad, what I did wasn't right
I feel so bad, and I must say to you
Sorry, but

[Chorus]
Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
What did you expect?
I'm doing my best

[Verse 2]
I feel so sad, but you know I'll be true
I feel so bad, and I must say to you
Sorry, but

[Chorus]
Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
What did you expect?
I'm doing my best
Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
I was dishonest
I will do my best, yeah

[Breakdown]
Cool, I am, when I am with you
Cool, I'm not, when I am lonely

[Chorus]
Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
What did you expect?
I'm doing my best
Nobody's perfect
Nobody's perfect
I was dishonest
I will do my best, yeah

[Outro]
Mmm, mmm, yeah
Mmm, mmm, yeah
Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect
Mmm, mmm, yeah
Mmm, mmm, yeah
Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect
Mmm, mmm, yeah
Mmm, mmm, yeah
Once upon a time I had plenty of nothin'
Which was fine with me
Because I had rhythm, music, love
The sun, the stars, and the moon above
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea
That was when the best things in life were free
Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty
Which is fine with me
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm
But look at what I got to go with 'em
"Who could ask for anything more?" I hear you query
Who could ask for anything more? Well, let me tell you, dearie

Got my diamonds, got my yacht
Got a guy I adore
I'm so happy with what I got
I want more!
Count your blessings, one, two, three
I just hate keeping score
Any number is fine with me
As long as it's more
As long as it's more!
I'm no mathematician
All I know is addition
I find counting a bore
Keep the number mounting, your accountant does the counting
(More! More!)

I got rhythm, music too
Just as much as before
Got my guy and my sky of blue
Now, however, I own the view
More is better than nothing, true
But nothing's better than more, more, more
Nothing's better than more

One is fun, why not two?
And if you like two, you might as well have four
And if you like four, why not a few?
Why not a slew more?
More! More!

If you've got a little, why not a lot?
Add a bit and it'll get to be an oodle
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle
More! More!
Never say when, never stop at plenty
If it's gonna rain, let it pour
Happy with ten, happier with twenty
If you like a penny
Wouldn't you like many
Much more?

Or does that sound too greedy?
That's not greed, no, indeedy
That's just stocking the store
Gotta fill your cupboard
You remember Mother Hubbard
(More! More!)

Each possession you possess
Helps your spirits to soar
That's what's soothing about excess
Never settle for something less
Something's better than nothing, yes!
But nothing's better than more, more, more
(Except all, all, all)
Except all, all, all
Except once you have it all (Have it all)
You may find all else above (Find all else above)
That though things are bliss
There's one thing you miss, and that's
More! More!
More! More! More! More!
More! More! More!

[Verse 1: Mandy Patinkin]
What can you lose?
Only the blues
Why keep concealing everything you're feeling?
Say it to her, what can you lose?
Maybe it shows
She's had clues, which she chose to ignore
Maybe though she knows
And just wants to go on as before
As a friend, nothing more
So she closes the door

[Verse 2: Madonna, Mandy Patinkin, Both]
Well, if she does
Those are the dues
Once the words are spoken
Something may be broken
Still, you love her
What can you lose?
But what if she goes?
At least now, you have part of her
What if she had to choose?
Leave it alone
Hold it all in
Better a bone
Don't even begin
With so much to win
There's too much to lose

[Verse 1]
Well, I know from experience
That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place
And that's hard to accept when you love someone
And you're led to believe in their moment of need
That they want what you want but they don't

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify this

[Chorus]
Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart
Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

[Verse 2]
It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running from your feelings
Like you are now
What happened?
What do I remind you of?
Your past? Your dreams?
Or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Life has taught me that love with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

[Chorus]
Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart
Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

[Bridge]
Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify

[Break]
I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me
I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

[Bridge]
Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

[Chorus]
Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart
Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

[Post-Chorus]
I knew it from the start that you would desert me (Waiting for you)
You're gonna break my heart (Just waiting)
Baby, please don't hurt me
I knew it from the start that you would desert me (Waiting for you)
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

[Chorus]
Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

[Post-Chorus]
Break my heart (Waiting for you)
Don't break my heart (Just waiting)
Break my heart (Waiting for you)
Don't break my heart
Break my heart (Waiting for you)
Don't break my heart (Just waiting)
Break my heart (Waiting for you)
You broke my heart
You broke my heart (Waiting for you, just waiting)
You broke my heart (Waiting for you)

[Spoken Outro]
And the next time you want pussy...
Ha!
Just look in the mirror, baby
Here, kitty kitty kitty kitty

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Let's dance, you can do a little two-step
I'll go anywhere that you step to
'Cause I'm following you

[Verse 2: Warren Beatty]
My feet might be fallin' out of rhythm
Don't know what I'm doin' with 'em
But I know I'm following you

[Chorus: Madonna, Warren Beatty, Both]
Unlikely as it is to me
On the floor with two left feet
Let's boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat
But who's counting?
Encore
Once again around the dance floor
Romance is in the picture too
Now I'm following you

[Spoken: Madonna]
Take it away, boys

[Tap Solo]

[Chorus: Madonna & Warren Beatty]
Unlikely as it is to me
On the floor with two left feet
Let's boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat
But who's counting?
Encore
Once again around the dance floor
Romance is in the picture too
Now I'm following you

[Intro]
Mmmm, mmmm

[Verse 1]
Say good-bye
To not knowing when
The truth in my whole life began
Say good-bye
To not knowing how to cry
You taught me that

[Chorus]
And I'll remember
The strength that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you saved me
I'll remember

[Verse 2]
Inside
I was a child
That could not mend a broken wing
Outside
I looked for a way
To teach my heart to sing

[Chorus]
And I'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you changed me
I'll remember

[Verse 3]
I learned
To let go
Of the illusion that we can possess
I learned
To let go
I travel in stillness

[Bridge]
And I'll remember happiness
I'll remember (I'll remember)
Mmmmm... (I'll remember)
Mmmmm...

[Chorus]
And I'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you changed me
I'll remember

[Outro]
No, I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)
No, I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)
No, ​I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)

[Verse 1]
You think that I can't live without your love
You'll see
You think I can't go on another day
You think I have nothing
Without you by my side
You'll see, somehow, some way

[Verse 2]
You think that I can never laugh again
You'll see
You think that you destroyed my faith in love
You think after all you've done
I'll never find my way back home
You'll see, somehow, someday

[Chorus]
All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive
All on my own
I don't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see

[Verse 3]
You think that you are strong, but you are weak
You'll see
It takes more strength to cry, admit defeat
I have truth on my side
You only have deceit
You'll see, somehow, someday

[Chorus]
All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive
I'll stand on my own
I won't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see
You'll see
You'll see
You'll see

[Intro]
Bitch!
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
How many licks does it take?
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
Which leg do you want me to break?
(You'll be sorry) You'll be sorry

[Verse 1]
Here she comes, little miss thinks she can have what she wants
In a blink of an eye
Here she comes, acts like she's your best friend
When you turn your back and she's off with your guy

[Chorus]
She's a thief of hearts
What will happen to the thief of hearts?
What she does is a crime
She's a thief of hearts
Someone please arrest her
She's a thief of hearts
No one ever takes what's mine
And gets away with it
Not this time

[Verse 2]
Here she comes, acting all dejected
So you give advice and she gives you her poison
Here she comes, little miss black widow
First she spins her web and she's stealing your boyfriend

[Chorus]
She's a thief of hearts
What will happen to the thief of hearts?
What she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts
Someone please arrest her
She's a thief of hearts
No one ever takes what's mine
Thief of hearts

[Post-Chorus]
Bitch!
You'll do it, you'll take it
You'll screw it, you'll fake it
Undo it, you'll break it
You're over, you can't take it
You'll do it, you'll take it
You'll screw it, you'll fake it
Undo it, you'll break it
You're over, you can't take it
You can't take it, not what's mine
I could break you, 'cause what you've done is a crime
Bitch, he's mine

[Verse 3]
Here she comes, little miss thinks she can have his child
Well anybody can do it
Here she comes, little Susie ho-maker
Thinks she'll get respect if she screws it

[Chorus]
She's a thief of hearts
What will happen to the thief of hearts?
What she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts
Someone please arrest her
She's a thief of hearts
No one ever takes what's mine

[Post-Chorus]
Bitch!
You'll do it, you'll take it
You'll screw it, you'll fake it
Undo it, you'll break it
You're over, you can't take it
You'll do it, you'll take it
You'll screw it, you'll fake it
Undo it, you'll break it
You're over, you can't take it
You can't take it, not what's mine
You'll be sorry, 'cause what you've done is a crime

[Chorus]
She's a thief of hearts (Of hearts, of hearts)
Thief of hearts, what she's done is a crime
She's a thief of hearts (Of hearts, of hearts)
Thief of hearts, no one ever takes what's mine
She's a thief, thief
Thief, thief
She's a thief, thief
Thief of hearts
No one ever takes what's mine
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
How many licks does it take?
You're a thief of hearts and now you'll have to pay
Which leg do you want me to break?

[Outro]
Stop, bitch!
Now sit your ass down

[Chorus]
Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

[Verse 1]
You think you're so smart
You try to manipulate me
You try to humiliate with your words
You think you're so chic
You write me beautiful letters
You think you're so much better than me

[Pre-Chorus]
But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

[Chorus]
Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

[Verse 2]
You think you're so shrewd
You try to bring me low
You try to gain control with your words

[Pre-Chorus]
But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

[Chorus]
Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

[Bridge]
Friends they tried to warn me about you
He has good manners, he's so romantic
But he'll only make you blue
How can I explain to them
How could they know
I'm in love with your words
Your words

[Verse 3]
You think you're so sly
I caught you at your game
You will not bring me shame with your words

[Pre-Chorus]
But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

[Chorus]
Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

[Outro]
Too much blinding light
Your touch, I've grown tired of your words
Words, words
A linguistic form that can meaningfully be spoken in isolation
Conversation, expression, a promise, a sigh
In short, a lie
A message from heaven, a signal from hell
I give you my word I'll never tell
Language that is used in anger
Personal feelings signaling danger
A brief remark, an utterance, information
Don't mince words, don't be evasive
Speak your mind, be persuasive
A pledge, a commitment, communication, words

[Chorus]
This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

[Verse 1]
Don't look back, keep your head held high, don't ask them why
Because life is short, and before you know, you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking, don't hold on to the past
Well, that's too much to ask

[Chorus]
This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

[Verse 2]
No regrets, but I wish that you were here with me
Well, then there's hope yet, I can see your face In our secret place
You're not just a memory, say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)

[Chorus]
This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy
This used to be our playground (Used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me
This used to be our playground (Used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me

[Verse 1]
I turned around too late to see the fallen star
I fell asleep and never saw the sun go down
I took your love for granted
Thought luck was always on my side
I turned around too late and you were gone

[Chorus]
So give me one more chance
Darling if you care for me
Let me win your love
Because you were always there for me
If you care for me
Be there for me

[Verse 2]
I like to play the queen of hearts and never thought I'd lose
I rolled the dice but never showed my hand
I planned it out so perfectly
So you'd never leave a girl like me
I was a fool, but now I understand

[Chorus]
So give me one more chance
Darling if you care for me
Let me win your love
Because you were always there for me
If you care for me
Be there for me

[Bridge]
Here is the law of the land
You play with fire and you'll get burned
Here is the lesson I've learned
That you don't know what you've got until it's gone

[Chorus]
So give me one more chance
Darling if you care for me
Let me win your love
Because you were always there for me
If you care for me
Be there for me

Give me one more chance
Tell me that it's not too late
Let me win your love
Darling please don't hesitate
If you care for me
Be there for me

[Outro]
Give me one more chance

[Intro]
I feel it, it's coming

[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Verse 1]
When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it's real
Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
'Til I feel your

[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Verse 2]
When you looked into my eyes and you said goodbye
Could you see my tears?
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky?
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
'Til I feel your

[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Bridge]
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say, never go away

[Spoken Interlude]
(Waiting is the hardest thing)
(It's strange)
(I tell myself that if I believe in you)
(I feel like I've known you before)
(In the dream of you)
(And I want to understand you)
(With all my heart and all my soul)
(More and more and more)
(That by sheer force of will I will raise you from the ground)
(When I'm with you I feel like a magical child)
(And without a sound, you'll appear)
(Everything strange)
(And surrender to me)
(Everything wild)
(To love)

[Verse 3]
Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
'Til I feel your

[Intro]
Do I know you from somewhere?
Why do you leave me wanting more?
Why do all the things I say
Sound like the stupid things I've said before?
(Put your hand on my skin)
(Put your hand on my skin)
(Put your hand on my skin)

[Verse 1]
Kiss me, I'm dying
Put your hand on my skin

I need to make a connection
I'm walking on a thin line
I close my eyes
I close my eyes

[Verse 1]
When I was very young
Nothing really mattered to me
But making myself happy
I was the only one
Now that I am grown
Everything's changed
I'll never be the same
Because of you

[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

[Verse 2]
Looking at my life
It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one
I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Nothing takes the past away
Like the future
Nothing makes the darkness go
Like the light
You're shelter from the storm
Give me comfort in your arms

[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need

What do I have to do to be accepted?
What do I have to say?
What do I have to do to be respected?
How do I have to play?
What do I have to look like to feel I'm equal?
Where do I have to go?
What club do I have to join to prove I'm worthy?
Who do I have to know?

I'm telling you brothers (Brothers), sisters (Sisters)
Why can't we learn to (Why's it so hard?) challenge the system

Before it's too late? (Why's it so damn hard?)

What do I have to learn to know what's right for me?
What do I have to know?

Who should have the right?
What am I going to do with all this anger?
Why do I have to fight?

[Verse 1]
Sitting on a park bench
Thinking about a friend of mine
He was only twenty-three
Gone before he had his time
It came without a warning
Didn't want his friends to see him cry
He knew the day was dawning
And I didn't have a chance to say goodbye

[Chorus]
In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
Because now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?
What for?

[Verse 2]
Driving down the boulevard
Thinking about a man I knew
He was like a father to me
Nothing in the world that he wouldn't do
Taught me to respect myself
Said that we're all made of flesh and blood
Why should he be treated differently?
Shouldn't matter who you choose to love

[Chorus]
In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
Because now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

[Bridge]
People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn?
In this case ignorance is not bliss

[Chorus]
In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
Because now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

[Bridge]
People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn?
In this case ignorance is not bliss

[Verse 3]
Have you ever watched your best friend die? (What for?)
Have you ever watched a grown man cry? (What for?)
Some say that life isn't fair (What for?)
I say that people just don't care (What for?)
They'd rather turn the other way (What for?)
And wait for this thing to go away (What for?)
Why do we have to pretend? (What for?)
Some day I pray it will end

[Outro]
I hope it's in this life
I hope it's in this life time
I hope it's in this life
I hope it's in this life time

[Intro: André Betts]
Tell me
We're gonna do that when we finish?
Yo, what's up?
What are we gonna do after we finish this?

[Verse 1: André Betts]
Tick tick tock, Mo is on the jock
I did her in the limo as we went around the block
Sucked the mole on her hip, licked the lipstick off her lip
She got real excited, yo she started to flip
She says, "'Dré baby 'Dré baby, oh"
I said, "Just relax, ayo chill, Mo"
We made a right turn onto Central Park West
One hand gripped the car, the other on her breast

[Chorus: Dave Murphy, Mark Goodman & André Betts]
Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it
Did you do it? I said I did it
Did you do it? I said I did it
Did you do it? I said I did it
But I backed out quick because I thought I split it

[Refrain: Madonna]
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you

[Verse 2: André Betts & Mark Goodman]
Uh, ho's in the front for the 1990's
Walking around showing off their heinies
Wiggling, they're jiggling, they're swinging and flinging
9-7-0, yo ho, your phone's ringing
You get a call from your John, you meet him at the mot'
He's chilling in a pamper and a fur coat
Your head starts spinning, you drunk too much gin and
Your jaw starts grinning, and this is the beginning
Of a night of an average ho
It ain't all about working on the streets no more
Here's another episode of dropping off a load
Peter was on the beater, I was about to explode
I couldn't hold back (So, whatcha do?)
I took her to my place (Yo, did she sit on your face?)
She was so good just like uh, Campbell's Soup
I won't try to front so here's the rude scoop
I dipped it and I stripped it and I ripped it like before
I had her screaming, nope no diddily, nope no more
I can't stop once I get started
But yo honey, uh, get them legs parted

[Refrain: Madonna]
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you

[Chorus: Dave Murphy, Mark Goodman & André Betts]
Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it
Did you do it? I said I did it
Did you do it? I said I did it
Did you do it? I said I did it
But I backed out quick because I thought I split it

[Bridge: André Betts]
Oh, my God!
They come with the rough stuff
Boy, we hit it, split it, and forget it
In the same order as you hear
But boy I'm not fronting
Don't ask what, me tell you the truth, you understand me eye?
The iron eye can get pissy, you know what I'm saying?
Clean up me rifle, clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, me elephant rifle
Clean up me rifle, you clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, elephant rifle
You know, you know, you moving slow
You make them tingle, yeah, you make them tingle

[Verse 3: André Betts]
I flipped her from the top of my head, enough said
I'm the brother with the short, short dreads
A couple different styles, a couple different flows
Just some that my souls about some girls I know
I gotta hit it hard because I go for the gusto
And I cover up the moans by turning up my stereo

[Chorus: Dave Murphy, Mark Goodman & André Betts]
Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it
Did you do it? Yo, you know I did it
Did you do it? Yo Mark, I said I did it
Did you do it? Yo
I backed out quick 'cause I thought I split it

[Interlude: Mark Goodman & André Betts]
You didn't do it, he didn't do it
I made her go

[Refrain: Madonna & Mark Goodman]
Waiting for you, just waiting
(Yo man, she been waiting, she keep on waiting)
Waiting for you
(Yeah, she been waiting, and you have not hit it)
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you

[Outro: Dave Murphy & André Betts]
Yo, Dré... Dré!
Yo man, you're so loud, Goddamn
What's up?
Yo, we printing this mix?
I thought you did that already
You know I did it

[Verse 1]
In my secret garden, I'm looking for the perfect flower
Waiting for my finest hour
In my secret garden, I still believe after all
I still believe and I fall
You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my secret garden, there's

[Chorus]
A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

[Verse 2]
If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess?
Will I still be thirsty?
Will I pass the test?
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by
Because I'm not supposed to see
Because the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for

[Chorus]
A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

[Verse 3]
I still believe, I still believe
Because after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
Because the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for

[Chorus]
A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

[Outro]
Somewhere in Fontainebleau
Lies my secret garden

[Intro]
Ah-hah a-hah! Ehehehehe
I'm just doin my thang man
But they can't do it quite like me
Cause they not like me

[Chorus]
I put my shoes on like ya, my shirt on like ya
My jeans on like ya, but I ain't nothin like them
Put my shades on like ya, set my rims high like ya
Keep a bad bitch like ya, but I ain't nothin like them naw
You - cain't be - fly - like - me (ayyy) 

[3X]
Cause you - just - ain't B.o.B

[B.o.B - talking over second half of Chorus to start]
Aight look
Jam out
I... pull up to the parking lot
Tinted windows on the car ain't stock
And you already know how I do it when I do it
When I hop up out the car they stop
Straight pimpin in my LRG
Creative wreck on my feet
So ev'rybody looking at my toes as I creep
Quit lookin cause you ain't got these
I talk it, how I, wanna, talk it
Y'all already what the pen is for
Soon as I hit the club
Ev'rybody crabbin on me cause they wish they was
I wish I could, go back when
Back when I didn't get too much
To show y'all haters how I came up
When y'all label it love
So I get fresher, deffer than you
You cain't be me, don't thank you could
Yeah Eastside, Ham Squad on deck
Straight up slangin dat wood
Handle dat good; man you can have that back
Grippin woodgrain like Cadillac
I see yo' Charger, bet mines harder
Whippin that black on black

[Chorus]

[B.o.B]
Ah ha, a-hah! Yeah... look
Well I ain't nothin like y'all
Stay fresh from Winter to Fall
And y'all already know how I move when I move
When I come through the do' they pause
Lookin fresh in my Moschin'
With them Academik jeans
With them Oakleys on my face
I can see you but you cain't see me
Cause I walk it, how I, wanna, walk it
Y'all already know I'ma let them hang
Soon as I hit the stage man
I get thangs shakin like a 8 point 8
And to this day, I don't play
I came from the struggle so I'm 'bout my pay
I want them marble countertops
Forget them paper plates!
Cause you not me and I'm not like you
A whole bunch of real players in my crew
But nowadays e'rybody so fake
That you can only trust a few
Think I'm talkin 'bout you? Well then I probably am
If the shoe fit put it on yo' foot
Yeah, Eastside, Ham Squad on deck
Straight up slangin that wood

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(I hear you talkin) I hear you talkin
(But I really don't hear a thing) Naw
(So keep on tryin) Keep on tryin
(But you don't be nuttin like me) Ha ha ha ha
(I hear you talkin) I hear you
(But I really don't hear a thing) Naw
(So keep on tryin) Keep on
(But you don't be nuttin like me) Nah
(I hear you talkin) Ha ha ha
(But I really don't hear a thing) That what they do?
(So keep on tryin)
(But you don't be nuttin like me) They just try
(I hear you talkin) Keep on
(But I really don't hear a thing)
(So keep on tryin) Yup
(But you don't be nuttin like me) Nah

You cain't do it man, that's just how I do it
B.o.B, I'm nuttin like you you nuttin like me
Ha ha ha ha
Ahhh, wooooooo!

[Chorus]
I am the man, I am the man 

[4X]

[B.o.B]
Geah; up in this booth, so let me introduce
Myself to all the haters that debate on what I do
Yeah, they in my face but I fade away and shoot
I - beat up the basket that's the way I do
Yuh! Just like a bottle of vodka, I'm Absolut
The proof is in the product, I'm hotter, and that's the truth
I squish the competition with the bottom of my shoe
But competition is none, so what am I to do?
And I was worth it, yeah - since they birthed me
But now I've murdered these verses put 'em in hearses
I, ate all the food on my plate but I am thirsty
From open mics, the flashing lights, I learned it
And what I learned is the game ain't for certain
So I live my life, I ain't worried
While I fly my high behind curtains

[Chorus]

[OJ Da Juiceman]
Down South hustlin, came up from nothin
Trap in the apartment, with a controlled substance
Livin with my momma, 'til I got busted
Down on my dick, maybe start back hustlin
Moto' crack workin, so I'm bailin money
Sick cell phone, distributin to the junkies
McDonald trap got me gettin to the money
Turn the warm water then I count up the hundreds
Murder by trap, hand it down for the zombie
One trap car and it was mainly for the junkie
Been a damn man ever since I was a young'n
Blue color chain like it came from Yonkers
Candy colored jewelry like my name was Willy Wonka
Came to the club, truck tall like a Tonka

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
I, am the man, makin jumbo
Keep the game hot like a big pot of gumbo
Do dumb shit, but don't be thinkin that I'm dum, bro
Watch what you say, I hear it all like I'm Dumbo
You say you wanna rumble? Is your dumb ho?
Toe to toe you're bound to stutter or stumble
Take your tough talk down to a mumble
It ain't goin down in my house, like Mutumbo
But it's definitely an honor
To light your scaff' up for the money like I'm a brawner
Brother, brother I consider it a pleasure
To break you down to minimum measure, just for the leasure
(The leasure?) Oh shit, my bad, I mean the leisure
Forgot who I was talkin to like I got amnesia
Damn, back on the track again, the mack is back again
Get the word out to them boys and tell 'em pack it in

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Where do we go from here?
This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all, you believed in me
I believed in you
Certainties disappear
What do we do for our dream to survive?
How do we keep all our passions alive
As we used to do?

[Chorus]
Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me
You must love me

[Verse 2]
Why are you at my side?
How can I be any use to you now?
Give me a chance and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed

[Chorus]
Deep in my heart I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me
You must love me
You must love me

[Verse 1]
Universe is full of stars
Nothing out there looks the same, the same
You're the one that I've been waiting for
I don't even know your name

[Interlude]
I'm in a trance
I'm in a trance

[Verse 2]
Cosmic systems intertwine
Astral bodies drip like wine
All of nature ebbs and flows
Comets shoot across the sky
Can't explain the reasons why
This is how creation goes

[Verse 3]
I don't want nobody else, 'body else
All the others look the same, the same
Galaxies are sliding into view
I don't even know your name

[Chorus]
I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go
I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

[Interlude]
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me

[Bridge]
I like to singy, singy, singy
Like a bird on a wingy, wingy, wingy
I like to rhumba, rhumba, rhumba
Dance to a samba, samba, samba

[Chorus]
I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go
I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

[Outro]
Trance
I'm in a trance
Universe is full of stars
Nothing out there looks the same
You're the one that I've been waiting for
I don't even know your name

[Verse 1]
You lost your reputation on a woman
You didn't understand or care to know
You get your education from your lovers
But now there's just no place for you to go

[Chorus]
It doesn't pay to be a runaway lover
It doesn't pay to give away what you lack
You'll never get your money back

[Verse 2]
You're set adrift with no direction
Just like a ship that's lost at sea
You don't care where you drop your anchor
Make sure it doesn't land on me

[Chorus]
It doesn't pay to be a runaway lover
It doesn't pay to give away what you lack
You'll never get your money back
It doesn't pay to be a runaway lover
It doesn't pay to give away what you lack
You'll never get your money back

[Refrain]
Walking around on a cloud
'Cause every girl you meet just trips on you
Saying your name out loud
I guess you met your match
Now what will you do?
Uh-uh, no way

[Chorus]
It doesn't pay to be a runaway lover
It doesn't pay to give away what you lack
You'll never get your money back
It doesn't pay to be a runaway lover
It doesn't pay to give away what you lack
You'll never get your money back

[Refrain]
Walking around on a cloud
'Cause every girl you meet just trips on you
Saying your name out loud
I guess you met your match
Now what will you do?

[Outro]
It doesn't pay, it doesn't pay, it doesn't pay
To give your heart away to a runaway lover
Uh-uh, no way
Mm-mm, no way
Uh-uh, no way

[Verse 1]
This guy was meant for me
And I was meant for him
This guy was dreamt for me
And I was dreamt for him
This guy has danced for me
And I have danced for him
This guy has cried for me
And I have cried for him

[Chorus]
Many miles, many roads I have traveled
Fallen down on the way
Many hearts, many years have unraveled
Leading up to today

[Verse 2]
This guy has prayed for me
And I have prayed for him
This guy was made for me
And I was made for him

[Chorus]
Many miles, many roads I have traveled
Fallen down on the way
Many hearts, many years have unraveled
Leading up to today

[Bridge]
I have no regrets, there's nothing to forget
All the pain was worth it
Not running from the past
I tried to do what's best
I know that I deserve it

[Chorus]
Many miles, many roads I have traveled
Fallen down on the way
Many hearts, many years have unraveled
Leading up to today
Many miles, many roads I have traveled
Fallen down on the way
Many hearts, many years have unraveled
Leading up to today

[Outro]
And I thank you

[Verse 1]
You took a pretty picture
And you smashed it into bits
Sank me into blackness
And you sealed it with a kiss
If only I could let you go
Why do I need you so?

[Chorus]
It's amazing what a boy can do
I cannot stop myself
Wish I didn't want you like I do
Want you and no one else

[Verse 2]
You took a poison arrow
And you aimed it at my heart
It's heavy and it's bitter
And it's tearing me apart
If only I could set you free
You worked your way inside of me

[Chorus]
It's amazing what a boy can do
I cannot stop myself
Wish I didn't want you like I do
Want you and no one else
It's amazing what a boy can say
I cannot stop myself
Seems I love you more than yesterday
Love you and no one else

[Interlude]
Oooh, it's amazing

[Chorus]
It's amazing what a boy can do
I cannot stop myself
Wish I didn't want you like I do
Want you and no one else
It's amazing what a boy can say
I cannot stop myself
Seems I love you more than yesterday
Love you and no one else

[Outro]
Oooh, it's amazing
Oooh, it's amazing
I cannot stop myself
Wish I didn't
Love you and no one else

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Oh, no, babe
Yeah-yeah
Baby, you
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
*Woman moaning*
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Yeah
*Woman moaning*

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
If you leave this time, I fear that you'll be gone for good, so
And I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and he said he'll be back
With that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh
It seems that you're the only reason for it

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I've been bleeding in your silence, I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God, he must be mad with me, it's karma
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked (And I poked)
And I poked at it but it stayed stagnant
Then I poked at it some more (Some more)
And in my notepad, man, I wrote (Man, I wrote)
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip, then a toe tag is one last, I'ma hope (I'ma hope)
So iceberg don't float (Don't float)
If I do manage to do damage to you, dammit
It'll be grand as, ten Grammies on my granite
Still standin' with a note (With a note)
That read, ''Granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most (The most)
One day, it'll make you grow (You grow)
When you outlandish and you lose manners
To God, you shall consult (Consult)
When the bright cameras are still crammin' in your face
And it provoke (Provoke)
You to act mannish, just stay planted
'Cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep (Keep) positivity in your heart and (And)
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (And)
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just note, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you renew your vision
Just think, if it had sunk Titanic
The fuck it would do to a critic, my nigga?
(Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em, Lord?
(Ooh-ooh)
Do you hear 'em, Lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live, even with remorse that I give
When they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
(Ooh-ooh)
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me, don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh
*Woman moaning*
Ooh

[Spoken Sample: Charlotte Gainsbourg]
Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's OK to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
What it feels like for a girl?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world?

[Outro: Madonna]
For a girl
In this world
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
What it feels like in this world?

[Verse 1]
I can't remember when I was young
I can't explain if it was wrong
My life goes on, but not the same
Into your eyes my face remains

[Chorus]
I've been so high, I've been so down
Up to the skies, down to the ground
I was so blind, I could not see
Your paradise is not for me

[Verse 2]
Autour de moi, je ne vois pas
Qui sont les anges? Sûrement pas moi
Encore une fois, je suis cassée
Encore une fois, je ne crois pas

[Chorus]
I've been so high, I've been so down
Up to the skies, down to the ground

[Bridge]
There is a light above my head
Into your eyes, my face remains

[Chorus]
I've been so high, I've been so down
Up to the skies, down to the ground

[Verse 3]
I can't remember when I was young
Into your eyes, my face remains
Into your eyes, my face remains

[Chorus]
I've been so high, I've been so down
Up to the skies, down to the ground
I've been so high, I've been so down
Up to the skies, down to the ground

[Verse 1]
I've had so many lives
Since I was a child
And I realize
How many times I've died
I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly
Closer to the sky

[Chorus]
No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up

[Verse 2]
This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire
I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

[Chorus]
No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

[Refrain]
Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

[Chorus]
No one's telling me how to live my life
But it's a setup and I'm just fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

[Breakdown]
I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine
I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

[Verse 3]
I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

[Refrain]
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me (It's no fun, but the damage is done)
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me (Don't want your social disease)
Li-like you know me
Like you know me
Like you know me
Like you know me (Don't want your social disease)
Like you know me

[Refrain]
Nobody knows me (I don't want no lies)
Nobody knows me (I don't watch TV)
Nobody knows me (I don't waste my time)
Like you know me (Won't read a magazine)
Nobody knows me (I don't want no lies)
Nobody knows me (I don't watch TV)
Nobody knows me (I don't waste my time)
(Don't want your social disease)
Li-like you know me (Won't read a magazine)

[Verse]
There is no peace
I ride 'till is not wheels
Till there is no streets
Like where is my piece
They dying in them cells or already dead
Or tryna kill themselves
I rep my niggas, I love my city
I feel myself and she feel my wealth
So it will not help, I gotta get me
And money like pussy and I gotta get deep
So I gotta get street cause it's riding on me
My niggas can't drive, I got riders with me
And nah I ain't in to that back and forth chit chat
As a matter fact I'mma end that...
Prone to destruction, home is corrupting
Stones in my dungies won't do the justice
Them hundred dollar homes is in abundance
Hustle on a mountain, hustle in a tundra
Get that money or don't function
Punctuation exclamation exclamation period
That's the way I have to make it
S to K, you better take it, idiots period
Bull shit, I pity it
Them guns shot so loud you would think I MIDI'd it
I shot more than once, I'm ab-libing it
Oh well you been in hell so what, I live in it
I'm giving it all, I got for them incentives
Riding for them benefits and now it's back to 10 a brick
I like 'em thin and thick
Really I like 'em thick, high yellow and shit
Weezy F Baby

[Verse 1]
Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good?

[Chorus]
Shine your light now
This time it's got to be good
You get it right now, yeah
'Cause you're in Hollywood

[Verse 2]
There's something in the air in Hollywood
The sun is shining like you knew it would
You're ridin' in your car in Hollywood
You got the top down and it feels so good

[Verse 3]
Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good?

[Verse 4]
I lost my memory in Hollywood
I've had a million visions, bad and good
There's something in the air in Hollywood
I tried to leave it, but I never could

[Chorus]
Shine your light now
This time it's got to be good
You get it right now, yeah
'Cause you're in Hollywood

[Verse 5]
There's something in the air in Hollywood
I've lost my reputation, bad and good
You're riding in your car in Hollywood
You got the top down and you feel so good

[Bridge]
Music stations always play the same song
I'm bored with the concept of right and wrong

[Verse 6]
Everybody comes to Hollywood
They wanna make it in the neighborhood
They like the smell of it in Hollywood
How could it hurt you when it looks so good?

[Chorus]
Shine your light now
This time it's got to be good
You get it right now, yeah
'Cause you're in Hollywood
'Cause you're in Hollywood
'Cause you're in Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood

[Spoken Interlude]
Check it out
This bird has flown

[Chorus]
Shine your light now
This time it's got to be good
You get it right now, yeah
'Cause you're in Hollywood

'Cause I used to live
In a fuzzy dream
And I wanted to be
Like all the pretty people

[Verse 1]
I'm so stupid
'Cause I used to live
In a fuzzy dream
And I used to believe
In the pretty pictures
That were all around me
But now I know for sure
That I was stupid

[Chorus]
Please don't try to tempt me
It was just greed
And it won't protect me
Don't want my dreams
Adding up to nothing
I was just looking for
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 2]
I'm so stupid
'Cause I used to live
In a tiny bubble
And I wanted to be
Like all the pretty people
That were all around me
But now I know for sure
That I was stupid
Stupider than stupid
Stupider than stupid
Stupider than stupid

[Chorus]
Please don't try to tempt me
It was just greed
And it won't protect me
Don't want my dreams
Adding up to nothing
I was just looking for
Everybody's looking for something

[Breakdown]
Everybody's looking for something
Everybody's stupid, stupid
Everybody's looking for something
Everybody's stupid, stupid
Everybody's looking for something
Everybody's stupid, stupid
Everybody's looking for something
Everybody, everybody

[Chorus]
Please don't try to tempt me
It was just greed
And it won't protect me
Don't want my dreams
Adding up to nothing
I was just looking for
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 1]
There are too many questions
There is not one solution
There is no resurrection
There is so much confusion

[Chorus]
And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love vibration
You make me feel
You make it shine

[Verse 2]
There are too-too-too-too many options
There is no consolation
I have lost my illusions
What I want is an explanation

[Chorus]
And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love direction
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel

[Refrain]
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

[Verse 3]
There is no comprehension
There is real isolation
There is so much destruction
What I want is a celebration

[Chorus]
And I know, I can feel bad
When I get in a bad mood
And the world can look so sad
Only you make me feel good

[Refrain]
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

[Chorus]
And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love intention
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel
You make me shine
You make me feel

[Refrain]
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

[Chorus]
And I know, I can feel bad
When I get in a bad mood
And the world can look so sad
Only you make me feel good

[Verse 1]
I'm in love with you, you silly thing
Anyone can see
What is it with you? You silly thing
Just take it from me
It was not a chance meeting
Feel my heart beating
You're the one

[Verse 2]
You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
'Cause I've climbed the tree of life
And that is why, no longer scared if I fall

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

[Chorus]
Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, you washed away my tears
Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, nothing fails

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not religious
But I feel so moved
Makes me wanna pray
Pray you'll always be here
I'm not religious
But I feel such love
Makes me wanna pray

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

[Chorus]
I'm not religious
But I feel so moved, mmm
I'm not religious
Makes me wanna pray
I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel so moved
Makes me wanna pray (But I feel so moved, mmm)
Pray you'll always be here
I'm not religious (I'm not religious)
But I feel such love
Makes me wanna pray (Pray)

[Breakdown]
(I'm not religious) I'm not religious (But it makes me wanna pray)
But I feel so moved, mmm
I'm not religious (I'm not religious) (But it makes me wanna pray)
Makes me wanna pray (Makes wanna pray)
I'm not religious
But I feel so moved, mmm (Makes me wanna pray)
I'm not religious
Makes me wanna pray (Makes me wanna)

[Chorus]
Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails, you washed away my tears
Nothing fails, no more fears
Nothing fails

[Verse 1]
I got to save my baby
Because he makes me cry
I got to make him happy
I got to teach him how to fly
I want to take him higher
Way up like a bird in the sky
I got to calm him down now
I want to save his life

[Chorus]
And I know that love will change us forever
And I know that love will keep us together
And I know, I know there is nothing to fear
And I know that love will take us away from here

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's such a pleasure
Sometimes I wanna tear it all down
It's easy to be lazy
And hard to go away from the crowd

[Pre-Chorus]
I know the road looks lonely
But that's just Satan's game
And either way, my baby
We'll never be the same

[Chorus]
And I know that love will change us forever
And I know that love will keep us together
And I know, I know there is nothing to fear
And I know that love will take us away from here

[Verse 3]
In the blink of an eye, everything could change
Say hello to your life, now you're living
This is it from now on, it's a brand new day
It was time to wake up from this dream (From this dream)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know the road looks lonely
But that's just Satan's game
And either way my baby
We'll never be the same

[Chorus]
And I know (and I know) that love (that love) will change us forever
And I know (and I know) that love (that love) will keep us together
And I know (and I know) that love (that love) will change us forever
And I know (and I know) that love (that love) will keep us together
And I know (and I know), I know (I know) there is nothing to fear
And I know (and I know) that love (that love) will take us away from here

[Verse 1]
I'm not myself when you're around
I'm not myself standing in a crowd
I'm not myself and I don't know how
I'm not myself, myself right now

[Chorus]
Jesus Christ, will you look at me?
Don't know who I'm supposed to be
Don't really know if I should give a damn
When you're around, I don't know who I am

[Verse 2]
I'm not myself when you go quiet
I'm not myself all alone at night
I'm not myself, don't know who to call
I'm not myself at all

[Chorus]
Jesus Christ, will you look at me?
Don't know who I'm supposed to be
Don't really know if I should give a damn
When you're around, I don't know who I am

[Bridge]
I always wished that I could find
Someone as beautiful as you
But in the process, I forgot
That I was special too

[Verse 3]
I'm not myself when you go quiet
(I'm not myself when you're around)
I'm not myself standing in a crowd
(I'm not myself all alone at night)
I'm not myself and I don't know how
(Don't know what I believe)
I'm not myself, myself right now

[Chorus]
Jesus Christ, will you look at me?
Don't know who I'm supposed to be
Someone say if I should give a damn
(Don't really know if I should give a damn)
When you're around, I don't know who I am

[Outro]
I always wished that I could find
Someone as beautiful as you
But in the process, I forgot
That I was special too
I always wished that I could find
Someone as talented as you
But in the process, I forgot
That I was just as good as you

[Verse 1]
There was a time I was happy in my life
There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

[Verse 2]
Nobody else would ever take the place of you
Nobody else could do the things that you could do
No one else I guess could hurt me like you did
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, mother, why aren't you here with me?
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes, father, you know I'm not so free

[Chorus]
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

[Verse 3]
There was a time I was happy in my life
There was a time I believed I'd live forever
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ
There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh mother, why aren't you here with me?
No one else saw the things that you could see
I'm trying hard to dry my tears
Yes father, you know I'm not so free

[Chorus]
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for

[Verse 4]
My mother died when I was five
And all I did was sit and cry
I cried and cried and cried all day
Until the neighbors went away
They couldn't take my loneliness, I couldn't take their phoniness
My father had to go to work, I used to think he was a jerk
I didn't know his heart was broken
Not another word was spoken
He became a shadow of
The father I was dreaming of
I made a vow that I would never need another person ever
Turned my heart into a cage, a victim of a kind of rage
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
I've got to give it up

[Chorus]
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
I've got to give it up
Find someone to love me
I've got to let it go
Find someone that I can care for
Find someone that I can care for
Find someone that I can care for

[Outro]
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
I've got to let it go
I've got to give it up
Oh mother, oh father
I've got to give it up
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)
(I've got to give it up)

[Verse 1]
I want the good life
But I don't want an easy ride
What I want is to work for it
Feel the blood and sweat on my fingertips
That's what I want for me

[Verse 2]
I want to know everything
Maybe someday I will
What I want is to find my place
Breathe the air and feel the sun on my children's face
That's what I want

[Chorus]
I go 'round and 'round just like a circle
I can see a clearer picture
When I touch the ground, I come full circle
To my place and I am home
I am home

[Verse 3]
I want to let go of all
Disappointment, it's waiting for me
What I want is to live forever
Not defined by time and space
It's a lonely place
That's what I want

[Chorus]
I go 'round and 'round just like a circle
I can see a clearer picture
When I touch the ground, I come full circle
To my place and I am home
I am home
I go 'round and 'round just like a circle
I can see a clearer picture
When I touch the ground, I come full circle
To my place and I am home
I am home

[Outro]
I go 'round and 'round just
'Round and 'round just
(Verse)
Looking in the mirror
Looking in the mirror
My own reflection
Can't stand to look into my eyes
It's been eating me up
The things we're hiding
I'm so done with those lies

(Verse)
Now I've cheated, I've miss-leaded, baby oh oh
Forgot your birthday, it was on Thursday, I am so oh
By the time you got you cryin but you know
I'm only human

(Pre-Hook 1)
I did some things that I can't erase
I'm not looking for no one to blame
Think it's time I've told you everything
I'm not who you think
(Hook)
Now you know who I really am
Now you know where I've been
I'm only hoping that you'll understand
Sometimes I make...
Mistakes
Mistakes
Mistakes
Sometimes I make mistakes
(Verse)
I'm so possessive, overprotecting
Wanna know who what and where
It's cause I love you
But maybe too much
But I'm only human

(Pre-Hook 2)
Now you know what you don't see
Only comes from insecurity
I'm not perfect and I'll never be
I'm not who you think

(Hook)
Now you know who I really am
Now you know where I've been
I'm only hoping that you'll understand
Sometimes I make...
Mistakes

Yo quiero chimichangas y chile colorado
Yo tengo el dinero para un steak picado
Las flautas y tamales, siempre muy bueno
Y el chile relleno

You see, I just gotta have a tostada, carne asada
That's right, I want the whole enchilada
My only addiction has to do with a flour tortilla
I need a quesadilla

I love to stuff my face with tacos al carbón
With my friends, or when I'm all alone
Yo tengo mucho hambre y ahora lo quiero
Un burrito ranchero

So give me something spicy and hot, now
Break out the menu, what you got, now?
Oh, would you tell the waiter I'd like to have sour cream on the side
You better make sure the beans are refried
Taco
Grande
Taco

Well, there's not a taco big enough for a man like me
That's why I order two or three
Let me give you a tip, just try a nacho chip
It's really good with bean dip

I eat uno, dos, tres, quatro burritos
Pretty soon I can't fit in my Speedos
Well, I hope they feed us lots of chicken fajitas
And a pitcher of margaritas

Well, the combination plates all come with beans and rice
The taquitos here are very nice
Now I'm down on my knees, we need some extra tomatoes and cheese
And could you make that separate checks, please?

"Buenos noches, senor
Bienvenido a el burritos casa de salsa
Tenemos muchos platos muy sabrosos si puedo
Recomendar el ardiente pollo al infierno muy delicioso
Sus ojos se quemaran, su estomago estara en fuego
Se quedaran en el baño por una semana
Entiendes lo que digo gringo estupido tonto?"
Well, the food is coming, I can hardly wait
Now watch your fingers, careful hot plate!
What you think you're doing with my chile con queso?
Well, if you want some, just say so

Oh boy, pico de gallo
They sure don't make it like this in Ohio
No gracias, yo quiero jalapeños, nada más
You can toss away the hot sauce

Donde estan los nachos? Holy frijole!
You better get me a bowl of guacamole
Y Usted, Eugene? Why's your face turning green?
Don't you like pinto beans?

You want some more cinnamon crispas?
If you don't, hasta la vista
Just take the rest home in a doggie bag if you wanna
You can finish it mañana

Well, it's been a pleasure, I can't eat no more
Señor, la cuenta, por favor
If you ain't ever tried real Mexican cooking, well, you oughta
Just don't drink the water

But it's a set up, until you're fed up

[Chorus]
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

[Verse 2]
I've had so many lives
Since I was a child
And I realize
How many times I've died
I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly
Closer to the sky

[Chorus]
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

[Verse 3]
This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire

Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

[Verse 4]
I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm going to try
To improve my life

[Hook]
I don't want no lies
I don't watch tv
I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I don't want no lies

I don't waste my time
Won't read a magazine

I don't want no lies

[Verse 5]
No ones telling you how to live your life
But it's a set up, until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
Well why should I care
What the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

[Chorus]
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me

[Verse 1]
I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shoté
It goes into my body and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my mini cooper
And I'm feeling super-duper
Yo, they tell me I'm a trooper and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and Pilates
And the room is full of hotties
So, I'm checking out the bodies
And you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysic shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager
An agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant
And a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler
And a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems

[Chorus]

I see the fire burning in your eyes

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight I want to dance with someone else

[Chorus: Madonna, Missy]
(Uh, uh) Get into the groove
Let me show you some moves
Best to take it from me, yeah (Misdemeanor on the)
Get up on your feet
Let me step to the beat
Show you how it should be (Misdemeanor on the)

[Verse 4: Missy]
Let me go and do my thing
I bring it hard on the track if you know what I mean
Hollywood and New York, Madonna is the queen
And misdemeanor say, uh-uh

[Bridge: Madonna]
Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time
Now I know you're mine

Get into the groove
Let me show you some moves
Best to take it from me, yeah (Misdemeanor on the)

If you up in the club tryna get a rub
Then you need to tell the DJ to put this song
Put-put-put-put this song, put this song on

Feeling on her booty, touching on her butt
Time to get her back to the crib, beat it up

Down, down, down in your heart
Find, find, find the secret
Turn, turn, turn your head around
Baby we can do it, we can do it all right

I really, I really wanna be with you
Come on, check it out with me
I hope you, I hope you feel the same way too

Let's forget your life
Forget your problems
Administration, bills and loans
Come with me

[Verse 1]
I don't like cities, but I like New York
Other places make me feel like a dork
Los Angeles is for people who sleep
Paris and London, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep

[Chorus]
Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad except New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York

[Verse 2]
If you don't like my attitude then you can F off
Just go to Texas, isn't that where they golf?
New York is not for little pussies who scream
If you can't stand the heat, then get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street

[Chorus]
Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad except New York

All day yearning for your body
You're my woman, you deserve good love, good love
I'm fiening for your kisses
You're my misses, I'm gon' give you good love, love, love
I'm ready, I'm ready

[Intro]
There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that I wait, the more time that I waste

[Verse 1]
I haven't got much time to waste, it's time to make my way
I'm not afraid of what I'll face, but I'm afraid to stay
I'm going down my own road and I can make it alone
I'll work and I'll fight till I find a place of my own

[Chorus]
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to jump

[Verse 2]
We learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me
The only thing you can depend on is your family
Life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree
It sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see

[Chorus]
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to, are you ready?

[Verse 3]
There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that you wait, the more time that you waste
I'll work and I'll fight till I find a place of my own
It sways and it swings and it bends until you make it your own

[Breakdown]
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone (My sisters and me, my sisters and me)
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone (My sisters and me, my sisters and me)
I can make it alone
I can make it alone

[Chorus]
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to jump
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to, are you ready?

[Intro]
I still see us making love sometimes
I wake up in cold sweats
I wonder where you are
What you doing? I miss you
I think of you, I miss us

[Verse]
I remember that silly fight we had, soon as your mama left the house
Do you remember?
You said I won't quite the man that I used to be
And I didn't understand the words coming out your mouth
I remember
Every argument like yesterday
Still can't believe that you gone away, I can't believe it
And I know it's a choice that we both done made
That it was best for us just to break apart
But I wanna let you know that you're still in my heart
And you, baby you know
That you're still in my heart
Like a seed, let you grow
I still love you girl, no matter where you go
No matter where you are, no matter how far
I'm gon' be right there
If you need me, I'm right here
If you want me, I'm right here here here here
And all you gotta do is

[Intro]
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?

[Verse 1]
It's funny
I spent my whole life wanting to be talked about
I did it
Just about everything to see my name in lights

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it all worth it?
And how did I earn it?
Nobody's perfect
I guess I deserve this

[Chorus]
How high are the stakes? How much fortune can you make?
Does this get any better?
Should I carry on? Will it matter when I'm gone?
Will any of this matter?

[Verse 2]
It's funny
How everybody mentions my name, but they're never very nice
I took it
Just about everything, except my own advice

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it all worth it?
And how did I earn it?
Nobody's perfect
I guess I deserve this

[Chorus]
How high are the stakes? How much fortune can you make?
(Nothing lasts forever) Does this get any better?
Should I carry on? Will it matter when I'm gone?
(Doesn't make a difference) Will any of this matter?

[Bridge]
How high? Doesn't make a difference
Nothing lasts forever
Should I? Will it matter when I'm gone?
Will any of this matter?
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?
Should I carry on?
Will it matter when I'm gone?

[Chorus]
How high are the stakes? How much fortune can you make?
Does this get any better?
Should I carry on? Will it matter when I'm gone?
Will any of this matter?
How high are the stakes? How much fortune can you make? (How high? Doesn't make a difference)
(Nothing lasts forever) Does this get any better?
Should I carry on? Will it matter when I'm gone? (Should I? Will it matter when I'm gone?)
(Doesn't make a difference) Will any of this matter?

[Outro]
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?
Should I carry on?
Will it matter when I'm gone?
How high are the stakes?
How much fortune can you make?
Should I carry on?
Will it matter when I'm gone?

[Verse 1]
You push me, to go the extra mile
You push me, when it's difficult to smile
You push me, a better version of myself
You push me, only you and no one else
You push me, to see the other point of view
You push me, when there's nothing else to do
You push me, when I think I know it all
You push me, when I stumble and I fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep on pushing (Keep on)

Everything I know, it's all because you push me

You push me, when I don't appreciate
You push me, not to lie and not to hate
You push me, when I want it all to end
You push me, when I really need a friend
You push me, all I wanna do is cry
You push me, when it's hard for me to try
You push me, when I do it for myself
You push me, only you and no one else

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep on pushing (Keep on)

(Every step I take) When there's nothing else to do
(Everything I do) When I think I know it all
Only you and only you and only you
Every race I win (To go the extra mile)
Every mood I'm in (When it's difficult to smile)
Everything I do (A better version of myself)
I owe it all to you (Only you and only you and only you)
Every move I make (To see the other point of view)
Every step I take (When there's nothing else to do)
Everything I do (When I think I know it all)
It's all because you push me

[Outro]
You push me

[Verse 1]
You can call me a sinner
You can call me a saint
Celebrate me for who I am
Dislike me for what I ain't
Put me up on a pedestal or drag me down in the dirt
Sticks and stones will break my bones
But your names will never hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be the garden, you'll be the snake
All of my fruit is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow, because

[Chorus]
This is who I am, you can
Like it or not, you can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no

[Verse 2]
Cleopatra had her way
Mata Hari too
Whether they were good or bad
Is strictly up to you
Life is a paradox and it doesn't make much sense
Can't have the Femme without the Fatale
Please don't take offense

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let the fruit rot under the vine
Fill up your cup and let's drink the wine
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow, because

[Chorus]
This is who I am, you can
Like it or not, you can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop

If you ever need me to be, what you need
Girl, I'm free and forever you can holla at me
Girl, you can holla at me, whoa whoa

[Outro]
Girl, I really really really wanna let you know
That I really really really can't let you go
And even if we never get it back
Girl, you can still come and holla at me

[Verse 1]
What you gonna do when your love is gone?
Who you gonna play when the game has ended?
Where you gonna go when the bird has flown?
How you gonna play when you're all alone?

[Chorus]
Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love

[Verse 2]
What you gonna do when you're on your own?
What you gonna have when you've got no place to call your own?
What you gonna try when your cover's blown?
How you gonna fly when your wings are broken?

[Chorus]
Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love

[Verse 3]
Don't let it get you down
Keep the fighting spirit and turn your head around
Don't let it take you in
Keep the fighting spirit and you'll begin again

[Chorus]
Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love
Keep the fighting spirit of love

[Verse 1]
On a plane, on a plane
Off to see the city girls again
Only bringing what to carry on
So that you know I won't be long

[Chorus]
Dripping beard as cold as hell
And the motherfuckers gonna go to jail

[Verse 2]
Honestly I can see
The giggling virgin overlooking me
Trying to put together what to say
Although it wouldn't matter anyway

[Chorus]
Dripping beard as cold as hell
And the motherfuckers gonna go to jail

[Verse 3]
This Rememo is set for home
It's personal but they need to know

[Verse 4]
I'm overdue another round
To gain control and take me down
You're all tied up as you should be
And I'll be cutting out naturally

[Chorus]
Dripping beards as cold as jail
And the motherfuckers gonna go to hell

[Outro]
This Rememo is set for home
It's personal but they need to know

[Verse]
I've got no fire inside of me can't be the man I try to be
Oh Mr Lonesome hanging round
Don't want to see nobody don't want to be nobody
Oh Mr Lonesome got me down
He makes me leave the party when folks are laughing hearty
Happiness is one thing he can't stand
Nobody wants or needs me I go just where he leads me
Oh Mr Lonesome got my hand
And so my whole life over each day is like the other but still if my one wish could be
If that old chain that binds me breaks when true love finds me
And Mr Lonesome sets me free oh Mr Lonesome got me down
"Piru Blues"

[Hook]
Show me how to breathe again
Give me a reason to end
This pain and all this suffering
Is there something, can I win?
It's hard to believe again
Is it something?
Or maybe nothing, nothing

[Verse 1]
Blood stains on the camouflage jacket
And love pain hands on the fully automatic
She looks into the eyes of her comrade/lover
Comcast, C-SPAN cover warfare rages on the other
Side of the wall where the revolution utters
In the language besides brotherly love for the sufferers
It's the sacrifice that touches her
He brushes her cheek, smeared with black smudges
Of oil and dirt he picked up from falling to the earth
When did things fall so far to love and so into berserk?
Supplies in the church but nothing of worth
That can repair the hurt, so out comes the tears and
In come the visions, gargoyles and gryphons
The tensions, the strength, and the stiff and release
On his way to God, guarded by the beast
She picks up his rifle and rushes to the street

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
With blood stains on the chinchilla fur
And a hundred bullet holes in the Rolls Royce Spur
Through designer sunglasses the world is a blur
Diamonds are being ripped from the neck of the third
Second and first seems so unneeded
But this one she feels that he got what he deserved
The money floats, the liquor spills
She dances on macabre; a nigga is being killed
Skeletons dance with her an elegant prance amidst the
Whores and the drunks, the sinners and the punks
A parliament of fools baptized in the funk
Cologne won't stop bullets no matter where you put it
But they spray it in the trunk
It mixes with the blood and the residue of drugs
It hits her all at once
Stings the nostrils, as our Rihanna as Madonna
And Nirvana bewitches another hostile

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
With blood stains on the maxi pad missing
We welcome another soul into the land of the living
Something about the mirror so different, it smiles
Now how could glass smile?
So she runs into the kitchen
The microwave, the spoons and the plates
Everywhere where there's a reflection of her face
The turned off TV, the cell phone and laptop screen be
Looking jubilant as Jeezy
In the trap or Gucci in the chain shop
A fan getting name dropped, this wasn't in the plans
But the pain stopped, and held the daffodils
Pleasant surprise not in the newspaper horoscope
A scene in the leaves of the chamomile
She musta missed it
Probably fell outta the bag but she dipped it
Nonetheless, she feels terrific

[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
Some girls can do anything
Whole world hanging on a string
She's flawless, so fresh and clean
(Like a virgin, sweet and keen)
Some girls got an attitude
Fake tits and a nasty mood
Hot chick when she's in the nude
(In the naughty, naked, nude)
Some girls got a sexy slur
One drink and it's all a blur
Cash now if you wanna flirt
(Cash or credit, it's going to hurt)
Some girls going off the deep end
Some girls living for the weekend
Some girls like to get their freak on
(Freaky, getting freaky)

[Pre-Chorus]
Some girls make a scene
Shoot their mouths and talk obscene
Crying in the limousine (Crying in the limousine)
Some girls make you feel like a rocket, hard as steel
Some girls only ever like to tease (Some girls only like to tease)

[Chorus]
Some girls are not like me
I'm everything you ever dreamed of
I got you begging, "baby, please"
I got you begging, "baby, please"

[Verse 2]
Some girls wanna call the shots
Come first, wanna be on top
Gotta work till you hit the spot
(Spot, spot, spot)
Some girls have a filthy mouth
All talk and they never stop
Just takin, it's not enough
(Too much is never enough)

[Pre-Chorus]
Some girls make a scene
Shoot their mouths and talk obscene
Crying in the limousine (Crying in the limousine)
Some girls make you feel like a rocket, hard as steel
Some girls only ever like to tease (Some girls only like to tease)

[Chorus]
Some girls are not like me
I'm everything you ever dreamed of (Your worst nightmare)
I got you begging, "baby, please"
I got you begging, "baby, please"

[Interlude]
(A wet dream, wet dream, wet dream, wet dream, wet dream)
(You're big and hard enough)

[Bridge]
Wrap you arms around my neck
It's time to deal, so cut the deck
If you wanna play this game with me
I'm not like all the rest
Some girls are second best
Put your loving to the test, you'll see
Some girls are not like me
I never wanna be like some girls
Some girls are just for free
I never wanna be like some girls

[Chorus]
Some girls are not like me
I'm everything you ever dreamed of
I got you begging, "baby please"
I got you begging, "baby please"
(Got their "fuck me" porn star heels on)
Some girls are not like me
I'm better than you ever dreamed of
I got you baby on your knees
I got you begging, "baby, please"
Some girls are not like me
I never wanna be like some girls
(Got their "fuck me" porn star heels on)
Some girls are just for free
I never wanna be like some girls

[Verse 1]
If you were the Mona Lisa
You'd be hanging in the Louvre
Everyone would come to see you
You'd be impossible to move

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems to me that's what you are
A rare and priceless work of art
You stay behind your velvet rope
But I will not renounce all hope

[Chorus]
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible

[Verse 2]
From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to white
An Impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems to me that's what you're like
The "Look but please don't touch me" type
And honestly, it can't be fun
To always be the chosen one

[Chorus]
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece (Masterpiece)
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible, nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible

[Chorus]
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece
And I'm right by your side, like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why it hurts so much
To be in love with a masterpiece (Masterpiece)
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible
'Cause, after all, nothing's indestructible

[Intro: Timbaland]
Uh
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1: Madonna & Timbaland]
I’m no stranger to deception
I have lied and been lied to (Uh, so have I)
I’m no paragon of virtue
But I wanna be with you
I have never been a righteous soul
And I don’t pretend I am
But I walk the line when I’m with you
Because you make me believe I can

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Timbaland]
But we’re running out of options
And we’re running out of time (Out of time, out of time)
And I don’t know if it’s you or me
But it’s time to speak your mind

[Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
Because I’m traveling across the sky
When you’re with me, your hand in mine
Our honesty will make us fly
And we’ll be traveling across sky
Across the sky (Whoa)
Across the sky (Whoa)
Across the sky (Whoa)
Across the sky (Whoa)

[Verse 2: Madonna & Timbaland]
I’m not good at keeping quiet (Quiet)
And I can’t keep this tied down (Don't tie her down, tie her down)
But it’s got to count for something (Yeah)
That we’re still hangin’ around ('Cause I'm with ya, baby)
If you need an explanation for (Yeah)
What is false and what is true (You gotta talk to me)
Then I’d rather stop the world than think
That I could not be with you (Talk to me, talk to me)

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Timbaland]
But we’re running out of options (Ahh)
And we’re running out of time (Out of time, out of time)
And I don’t know if it’s you or me
But it’s time to speak your mind (Here I go, here I go, here I go)

[Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
Because I’m traveling across the sky
When you’re with me, your hand in mine
Our honesty will make us fly
And we’ll be traveling across the sky
Across the sky (Whoa)
Across the sky (Whoa)
Across the sky (Whoa)
Across the sky (Whoa)
Across the sky (Whoa) Traveling across the sky
Across the sky (Whoa) Traveling across the sky
Across the sky (Whoa) Traveling across the sky
Across the sky (Whoa) Traveling across the sky

[Outro: Timbaland]
Come on, come on
Alright

[Intro: LMFAO]
Pa-party rock
Party, pa-party rock
Party, pa-party rock

[Verse 1: Madonna & LMFAO]
(Yeah)
Don't play the stupid game
'Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You have got to step into my world

[Chorus: Madonna]
Gimme all your lovin', gimme your love
Gimme all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', gimme your love
Let's forget about time
And dance our lives away

[Post-Chorus: Nicki Minaj & M.I.A.]
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna

[Chorus: Madonna]
Gimme all your lovin', gimme your love
Gimme all your love today (Gimme all your love)
Gimme all your lovin', gimme your love
Let's forget about time
And dance our lives away

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj & Madonna]
Gimme all your love, boy
You can be my boy, you can be my boy toy
In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme
Because it's time for change, like a nickel or a dime (Gimme all your love)
I'm Roman, I'm a barbarian, I'm Conan
You was sleeping on me, you were dozin'
Now move, I'm going in (Whoa)

[Verse 3: LMFAO]
Yo, I'm Trojan (Uh)
Pin you on the mat, Hulk Hogan (Uh)
My slogan
'I'm sexy and I know it'
Show it, baby girl this your moment
Work it, twerk it, own it
Gimme your love, devote it, oh

[Verse 4: Madonna]
Don't play the stupid game
'Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love

[Breakdown: Nicki Minaj & M.I.A., Madonna]
L-U-V, Madonna (Gimme all your love)
Y-O-U, you wanna
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna

[Verse 5: LMFAO]
Hol-hol-hold up
Baby girl, your man look tore up
You should be with me 'cause I'm swole up (Woo)
Knock it out the park, home run (Yeah)
Word to Young Money I'm on one
A Milli, calmest guy, I am
I know Willy, like a virgin
But not really, can't-can't breath without your love
Don't kill me, so (Woo)

[Chorus: Madonna]
Gimme all your lovin', gimme your love
Gimme all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', gimme your love
Let's forget about time
And dance our lives away
And dance our lives away

[Outro: Madonna & LMFAO]
L-U-V Madonna
(Party, pa-party rock)
And dance our lives away
Y-O-U you wanna
(Party, pa-party rock)
And dance our lives away, way, way...

[Verse 1]
A long, long time ago I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew that if I had my chance
I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

[Verse 2]
Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in Rock 'n' roll?
And can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

[Verse 3]
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes (Both kicked off your shoes)
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

[Verse 4]
I was a lonely teenage bronking buck
With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck
But I knew that I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Verse 5]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
Well, I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

[Verse 6]
Well now, in the streets the children screamed (The children screamed)
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed (The poets dreamed)
But not a word was spoken (Not a word was spoken)
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire the most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
We started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

[Outro]
We started singing
We started singing
We started singing
We started singing

[Verse 1]
I can practice restraint, if that's what you want
Let me zip up my boots, we can go for a walk
If I rein you in, you can follow my lead
We can ride so fast, just remember to breathe
If you start to gear up, then I'll tighten my grip
If you try to talk back, I'll be using my whip
Might be hard to hear you with my bit in your mouth
If it starts to hurt then you'll have to scream loud

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no use going back 'cause the damage is done
Throw away all the rules cause there's gonna be none
Come on and let yourself go, 'cause there's no time to think
Now I'm in control of your animal instinct

[Chorus]
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
If you want, I'll feed you like an animal
If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal

[Verse 2]
If you misbehave, I can make you submit
If you start to act up, I can force you to quit
If you want me to break you, I can bring you the heel
Won't be hard to tame you when it's me that you fear

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no use going back 'cause the damage is done
Throw away all the rules cause there's gonna be none
Come on and let yourself go, 'cause there's no time to think
Now I'm in control of your animal instinct
There's no use going back 'cause the damage is done
Throw away all the rules 'cause there's gonna be none
Come on and let yourself go, 'cause there's no time to think
Now I'm in control of your animal instinct

[Chorus]
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
If you want, I'll feed you like an animal
If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus]
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal
If you want, I'll feed you like an animal
If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal
If you want, I'll treat you like an animal

[Verse 1]
Swaying room, as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two, their bodies become one
I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare?
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

[Chorus]
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Verse 2]
Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all
Slowly now, we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

[Chorus]
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss
Because I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you

[Outro]
It's all brand new
I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
I'm crazy, crazy for you
It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
Yeah, I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you, baby
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you, baby

[Intro]
Don't you feel sorry, don't you feel sorry

[Verse 1]
Broken like a crooked smile
A little hunched over but I walked that mile
I've woken from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe the things that I have seen

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you feel sorry for me
Because I'm right where the universe wants me to be
A lesson that I needed to learn
But that doesn't mean that it doesn't burn

[Chorus]
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry for me
Because I won't change my story
Don't take all my glory
Don't you feel sorry for me

[Verse 2]
Tied up with leather and rope
A little bit of medicine to give me hope
I'm inky like a smoking gun
It's going to take a while to heal the damage done

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you feel sorry for me
Because I'm right where the universe wants me to be
A lesson that I needed to learn (A lesson that I needed to learn)
But that doesn't mean that it doesn't burn

[Chorus]
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry for me
Because I won't change my story
Don't take all my glory
Don't you feel sorry for me

[Bridge]
(A lesson that I needed to learn)

No pain, no gain
No defective parts
No dirty business, no forgiveness
No broken heart
(Don't you feel sorry)

[Chorus]
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry for me
Because I won't change my story
Don't take all my glory
Don't you feel sorry for me

Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry for me
Because I won't change my story
Don't take all my glory
Don't you feel sorry for me

[Verse 1]
I think you wanna come over
Yeah, I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk? Are you sober?
Think about it, doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good, then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my temperature rising
There's too much heat, I'm gonna lose control
Do you want to go higher? Get closer to the fire?
I don't know what you’re waiting for

[Chorus]
Come join the party, yeah
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, yeah
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

[Verse 2]
Boy, you got a reputation
But you're gonna have to prove it
I see a little hesitation
Am I gonna have to show you
That if it feels right, get on your mark
Step to the beat, boy, that's what it's for

[Pre-Chorus]
Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot, we can go outside
But for now, just come here, let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance of life

[Chorus]
Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

[Spoken Interlude]
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
You look familiar
You wanna dance? Yeah
I guess I just don't recognize you with your clothes on

[Laughter]
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

[Outro]
Boy, you got it
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won’t do
Let's get it started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Boy, you got it
'Cause anybody just won’t do
Let’s get it started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Chances are..we're gonna leave now
Sorry for..the victim now

Though my days..are filled with sorrow
I see here..a bright tomorrow
Chances, chances are..some might not hold out
Chances are..hang on right now

Though all of my, days..are filled with sorrow
I stay here..a bright tomorrow

Chances, chances are..some might not hold out
Chances are..hang on right now
Chances are..oh, chances, you're my chances

Chances are..chances are..
Oh chances, you're my chances..

[Verse 1]
My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight
I'll be your loved one darling
Turn off the light
I'll be your sorceress, your heart's magician
I'm not a witch, I'm a love technician

I'll be a guiding light in your darkest hour
I'm going to change your life, I'm like a poison flower

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...

[Chorus]
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
All over me
All over me
All over me

[Verse 2]
We could use the cage
I've got a lot of rope
I'm not full of rage
I'm full of hope
This is not a crime and you're not on trial
Bend over baby, I'm going to make you smile

Light the candles, until they're nice and soft
And when they start to drip, I'm going to get you off

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...

[Chorus]
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body

I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...
I could bring you so much pleasure

[Chorus]
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
All over me
All over me
All over me
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
All over me
All over me
All over me

[Outro]
Only the one that hurts you can make you feel better
Only the one that inflicts pain can take it away

Eroti - ca

[Verse 1]
Every revolution starts inside a broken heart
Every new beginning starts when something falls apart
Can't you hear a voice inside that's calling out your name?
What you risk is what you value, nothing is in vain

[Chorus]
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

[Verse 2]
Learn to live your life in the pursuit of happiness
Never take for granted, freedom is a privilege
Prison is a state of mind we build around ourselves
Take responsibility, you can't blame someone else

[Chorus]
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

[Bridge]
We all need a hero
Are you willing to fight for what you believe in?
We all need a hero
Are you willing to die for what you believe in?
I walk in the footsteps of giants
Remember a man who had a dream
I stay in the shadow of those who gave their lives
So we can be free

[Interlude]
Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you
Be the change you wanna see in the world (Freedom)
You cannot, you cannot blame what you see happening in the world to anybody else (Freedom)
It's time that we all stand together (Freedom)
One for all and all for one (Freedom)
We all play the same part (Freedom)
We all want to be loved (Freedom)

[Outro]
I want to start a revolution of love
I want to start a revolution of love
Freedom

[Intro]
Ahh ahh
Ahh ahh
Gambler (Gambler)
Ahh ahh
Gambler (Gambler)

[Chorus]
I'm a gambler
And I will take you by surprise
Gambler
I'll aim straight between your ey-eyes
Gambler
Yeah, I know all the words to say
'Cause I'm a gambler
I only play the game to win, yeah

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna say this but I think that I should
I'm better off forgotten if you think that I'd be good
One day you see me, the next day I'm gone
Don't fight me, baby, I don't wanna hold on

[Chorus]
I'm a gambler (Gambler, gambler)
A gambler (Gambler, gambler)

[Verse 2]
You're not happy with the way I act
You better turn around boy, don't look back
You're getting angry, you know I can see
You're just jealous 'cause you can't be me

[Chorus]
I'm a gambler
And I will take you by surprise
Gambler
I'll aim straight between your ey-eyes
Gambler
Yeah, I know all the words to say
'Cause I'm a gambler
I only play the game to win, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You can't stop me now
'Cause I'm right
And I'm making advances
Let me show you how
Tonight
I'll be taking my chances on you (On you, on you)
On you (On you, on you)
On you (On you, on you)
On you (On you, on you)
That's right, baby

[Refrain]

Do you understand what I'm talking about?
Ahh ahh ahh ahh

[Chorus]
I'm a gambler
And I will take you by surprise
Gambler
I'll aim straight between your ey-eyes
Gambler
Yeah I know all the words to say
'Cause I'm a gambler
I only play the game to win

[Post-Chorus]
You can't stop me now

You can't stop me now
You can't stop me now
'Cause I'm a gambler (Gambler, gambler)
Yeah, I'm a gambler
That's right, baby

[Verse 1]
Get out of bed
And you look in the mirror
And the haze in your head
Doesn't get any clearer
The boss man says:
"You're gonna lose your job
You're gonna lose your pay
If you're late, late"
And then the weatherman says:
"It's gonna be sunny"
And it starts to rain
And you don't think it's funny
So you visit your friends
But there's no one home
And you don't have a dime
And you can't even call her on the phone

[Chorus]
So get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up

[Verse 2]
Your stomach so empty
And you need some food
So you distract yourself
But it just doesn't do any good
You think about going home
But it can't be the same
'Cause they'll never change
They don't wanna know
About the sin of you
And the wasting of time
They wanna grab your hair and pull you in line

[Chorus]
So get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up

[Bridge]
Pick yourself off the ground
No one can push you around
Don't let it get you down
You get up
Pick yourself off the ground
No one can push you around
Don't let it get you down
You get up
Pick yourself off the ground
No one can push you around
Don't let it get you down
You get up
Pick yourself off the ground
No one can push you around
Don't let it get you down
You get up
So get up, up

[Verse 3]
Another day goes by
And you look in the mirror
And the haze in your head
Gets a little bit clearer
And you realize
That all the silly things
That used to get you down
Were just a test to see if you could get up

[Chorus]
So get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Pick yourself off the ground
No one can push you around
You get up, up
Pick up yourself up off the ground
No one can push you around
You get up, up
So get up
(Self up, of the ground)
Get up
(Self up, of the ground)
Get up
(Self up, of the ground)
Get up
Get up
(Self up, of the ground)
Get up
(Self up, off the ground)
Get up
(Self up, off the ground)
Get up
(Self up, off the ground)
Get up
(Self up, off the ground)
Get up
(Self up, off the ground)
Get up
(Self up, off the ground)
Get up
(Self up, off the ground)
Get up
(Self up, off the ground)
Get up

[Outro]
(Self up, off the ground)
(Self up, off the ground)
(Self up, off the ground)
(Self up, off the ground)
(Self up, off the ground)
Get up

[Intro]
I don't want to say goodbye

[Verse 1]
There are some who believe that I owe them something
But they're wrong, I owe nothing to no one but myself
And there are some who say they created me
But only my parents will have that acclaim
I took it from there, I am to blame

[Chorus]
Say goodbye to anonymity
I have to (have to, have to) say goodbye
To privacy, but most of all
To innocence, to innocence
To innocence, to innocence

[Verse 2]
My life is not a game that I play to entertain you
And if you can do it better, then you're welcome to my fame
I'm not going to waste my time correcting myths and rumors
You believe what you want to believe

[Chorus]
Say goodbye to anonymity
I have to (have to, have to) say goodbye
To privacy, but most of all
To innocence, to innocence
To innocence, to innocence

[Interlude]
I don't want to say goodbye
I don't need a reason to cry
Kinda makes me want to
Kinda makes me have to

Stop and think about it
Stop and think about it
Stop and think about it
Stop and think about it
Do I want to?

I don't (getting up and down)
I don't (getting up and down)
I don't (getting up and down)

Up-up, d-d-down, up-up-up

I don't (getting up and down)
I don't (getting up and down)
I don't (getting up and down)
Up-up, d-d-down, up-up-up

Listen up
It always comes down to this
It always comes down to this

[Verse 3]
Some people have a snake at the base of their spine
That would suck out your life, that would take all your time
They're called feeders
They're not believers but you must not fear it
They're takers

You know you better stop, stop and think about it
You know you better stop, stop and think about it
You know you better stop, stop and think about it
You know you better stop, stop and think about it

Your innocence
Your innocence
Your innocence
Your innocence

I don't want to say goodbye to innocence
I don't need a reason to cry, innocence
Hold on to your innocence
Hold on (hold on, hold on), hold on to innocence
Hold on

[Outro]
Stop and think about it, say goodbye, think about it
Stop and think about it, say goodbye, think about it
Stop and think about it, say goodbye, think about it

Why are we separated
Defined by our greed and hatred?
Why aren't we all united?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting
Why aren't we all together?
Let's end this fight forever
Why are we still divided?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

[Verse 2]
How many tragedies
Will we see before we come together? Uh-huh
It's easy to forget
We have the power to make things better, uh-huh

Why aren't we all together?
Let's end this fight forever
Why are we still divided?
I'm so sick and tired of fighting

We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

[Verse 1]
It's so hard to be someone
It's so hard to be unknown
In your heart you are to blame
In your heart you play the game

[Verse 2]
Do you realize you pay the price
Do you know the cost of all your vice
Save your soul, it's all a test
Save your soul, it's for the best

[Chorus 1]
We need love (Love, love, love, love)
We need love (Love, love, love, love)
We need love (Love, love, love, love)
We need love (Love, love, love, love)

[Verse 3]
Save your soul, little sister
Save your soul, dear little brother
You need hope, says the preacher
Learn to cope, says all my teachers

[Verse 4]
Do you really know God's intention
Do you ever ask what it's all for
We need love, love and love
We need more, more and more

[Chorus 1]
We need love (Love, love, love, love)
We need love (Love, love, love, love)
We need love (Love, love, love, love)

[Verse 5]
Prophets are telling us
We're near the end
But I am telling you
That it's all pretend

[Chorus 2]
It's so cool to be uncool
It's so right to be unright
It's so good to look so bad
Isn't this the best thing you ever had
It's so cool to be uncool
It's so right to be unright
It's so good to look so bad
Isn't this the best thing you ever had

[Chorus 1]
We need love (Love, love, love, love)
We need love (Love, love, love, love)

We need love (Love, love, love, love)
We need love (Love, love, love, love)

[Chorus 1]
Was it just a dream?
Did I feel your devotion?
Dreams are never what they seem
Did we just go through the motions?

[Verse 1]
I keep your photograph by my bed to remind me
That I was part of your life
I say my prayers to the sandman
That he'll find me fast asleep
Sleep has always been kind
And in my dreams you'll always be mine
But in the morning when I wake
I remember that my heart does ache

[Chorus 1]
Was it just a dream?
Did I feel your devotion?
Dreams are never what they seem
Did we just go through the motions?
Was it just a dream?
Did I feel your devotion?
Dreams are never what they seem
Did we just go through the motions?

[Verse 2]
I admit that I did my bit to deceive you
But sometimes I was afraid
That this day would come
How could you just leave me all alone now
I have always been strong
So I know that I can go on
But right now I feel so dead inside
Oh sleep come to me, cause that's where I hide

[Chorus 1]
Was it just a dream?
Did I feel your devotion?
Dreams are never what they seem
Did we just go through the motions?

[Chorus 1]
Was it just a dream?
Did I feel your devotion?
Dreams are never what they seem
Did we just go through the motions?

[Chorus 2]
All that I have, all I ask
All my dreams, they fade so fast
Don't wake me up, not today
All my dreams will fade away

[Chorus 3]
And I want him, and I need him
I can't live and I'd die just to see him
Just to feel his hands on my face
Smell his skin, and his warm embrace
Cause it's all that I have
And it's fading so fast

[Bridge]
Mh, mh
Uh, uh-huh

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I have always been strong
So I know that I can go on
But right now I feel so dead inside
Oh sleep come to me, cause that's where I hide

[Chorus 1]
Was it just a dream?
Did I feel your devotion?
Dreams are never what they seem
Did we just go through the motions?
Was it just a dream?
Did I feel your devotion?
Dreams are never what they seem
Did we just go through the motions?

[Chorus 2]
All that I have, all that I ask
All my dreams, they fade so fast
Don't wake me up, not today
All my dreams will fade away

[Chorus 3]
(Was it just a dream?)
And I want him, and I need him
I can't live and I'd die just to see him
Don't wake me up, not today
All my dreams will fade away
(Was it just a dream?)
All that I have, all that I ask
All my dreams, they fade so fast
Don't wake me up, not today
All my dreams will fade away

[Verse 1]
I want to kiss you in Paris
I want to hold your hand in Rome
I want to run naked in a rainstorm
Make love in a train cross-country
You put this in me
So now what, so now what?

[Chorus]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love

[Verse 2]
I want to know you
Not like that
I don't want to be your mother
I don't want to be your sister either
I just want to be your lover
I want to have you baby
Kiss me, that's right, kiss me

[Chorus]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Yearning, burning
For you to justify my love

[Verse 3]
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Talk to me, tell me your dreams
Am I in them?
Tell me your fears
Are you scared?
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly!
Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me, that's right, love me
I want to be your baby

[Chorus]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
(My love) I'm open (My love) And ready
For you to justify my love
(My love) To justify my love (My love)
Wanting (For you) To justify (To justify my love)
Waiting (My love) To justify my love (My love)
Praying (For you) To justify (To justify my love)
To justify my love
I'm open, to justify my love (My love, my love)

[Verse 1]
The madness of love
And what we'll do for it
To walk through the fire
And just go through with it
To cancel your doubt
And fly into the sun
To go without
And feel like you're the lucky one

[Pre-Chorus]
The mad things we do for love
We're caught in a world of lies
I just had the strangest dream
We won't get to do this twice

[Chorus]
Lela lela lela lela pala tute
Jas kana medess medess anda latay
Lela lela lela lela pala tute
Giascanamés del balla late

[Verse 2]
The madness of love
And where we'll go for it
To travel the world
And lose control for it
To give it away
And never hesitate
Just knowing one day
It will reciprocate

[Pre-Chorus]
The mad things we do for love
The heavens are falling through
I'm caught in the world of lie
There's nothing that I can do

[Chorus]
Lela lela lela lela pala tute
Jas kana medess medess anda latay
Lela lela lela lela pala tute
Giascanamés del balla late
Lela lela lela lela pala tute
Jas kana medess medess anda latay
Lela lela lela lela pala tute
Giascanamés del balla late

[Bridge]
It's a mad mad world
All the things you make me feel
It's a mad mad world
Had a drink so I could forget
It's a mad mad world
All the noise inside of my head
It's a mad mad world
I would never change this moment
It's a mad mad world
All the things you make me feel
It's a mad mad world
Had a drink so I could forget
It's a mad mad world
All the noise inside of my head
It's a mad mad world
I would never change this moment

[Chorus]
Lela lela lela lela pala tute
Jas kana medess medess anda latay
Lela lela lela lela pala tute
Giascanamés del balla late
Lela lela lela lela pala tute
Giascanamés del balla late
He runs through the street
Because his house's falling down
And his eyes are burning as they touch the ground
The baseball cap won't hide the pain
There's no one here today
He runs through a house
And he looks for food
He feels so bad
But he knows he's good
He lays down on the kitchen floor
He ain't hungry no more
Little boy lost
In little boy land
How much does it cost
To understand
Little boy say
Why do you cry
And how much will you pay
To know why
Sometimes at night he wets his bed
As you stay playing tricks inside his head
He waits so cold
For a longer life
There's no one here tonight
Little boy lost
In little boy land
How much does it cost
To understand
Little boy say
Why do you cry
And how much will you pay
To know why

[Verse 1]
Talk about it people
If you dream and shout it
Was I nothing, feel the action
I can't get no satisfaction

[Chorus]
With your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun
To have your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun

[Verse 2]
Tell your tales to someone else
Or written keep them to yourself
I've heard your stories
All before you're always walking out the door

[Chorus]
With your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun
To have your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun

[Post-Chorus]
So get out the door with your love on the run
Get out the door, you're just no fun
Get out the door with your love on the run
You're just no fun on the run

[Verse 3]
You would think I've had enough
Of all your kinks, it's just too much
I could have known when I first met you
We're trying so hard to forget

[Chorus]
With your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun
To have your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun

[Post-Chorus]
So get out the door with your love on the run
Get out the door, you're just no fun
Get out the door with your love on the run
You're just no fun on the run
So get out the door with your love on the run
Get out the door, you're just no fun
Get out the door with your love on the run
You're just no fun on the run

[Chorus]
With your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun
To have your love on the run
Oh, you're just no fun

[Verse 1]
Miss you most of all
When all those autumn leaves start to fall
Drifting by my window
They come up over the wall
Why does a good thing have to do end?
Can't see it happen where and when
The cycle of change can be so cruel
I've got no one to blame, I'm just a fool, you know

[Chorus]
Hold on, they keep on telling me
Something good is gonna come
The red and gold has put its spell on﻿ me
And old man winter's gonna come
You know he keeps on blocking off the sun

[Verse 2]
Miss you most of all
When they burn those bonfires tall
Smoke and ashes fill the air and the
Harvesters are everywhere
No time to waste, let's drink the wine
Don't let the fruit rot on the vine
When the sun is big and fiery it goes, you know
That is the time I miss you the most, they say

[Chorus]
Hold on, they keep on telling me
Something good is gonna come
The red and gold has put its spell on﻿ me
And old man winter's gonna come
You know he keeps on blocking off the sun

[Verse 3]
Cold wind is howling
And there's dampness creeps﻿ in our bones
Seasons change, why didn't we?
Come on, bring that summer back to me

[Chorus]
Hold on, they keep on telling me
Something good is gonna come
The red and gold has put its spell on﻿ me
And old man winter's gonna come
You know he keeps on blocking off the sun

[Outro]
Tell me, why does he always have to come?

[Intro]
I'm talking, I'm talking
I believe in the power of love
I'm singing, I'm singing
I believe that you can rescue me

[Verse 1]
With you I'm not a little girl, with you I'm not a man
When all the hurt inside of me comes out, you understand
You see that I'm ferocious, you see that I am weak
You see that I am silly, and pretentious, and a freak
But I don't feel too strange for you
Don't know exactly what you do
I think when love is pure you try
To understand the reasons why
And I prefer this mystery
It cancels out my misery
And gives me hope that there could be
A person that loves me

[Chorus]
Rescue me (Rescue me, it's hard to believe)
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me (Rescue me, it's hard to believe)
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

[Verse 2]
With you I'm not a fascist, can't play you like a toy
And when I need to dominate, you're not my little boy
You see that I am hungry for a life of understanding
And you forgive my angry little heart when she's demanding
You bring me to my knees while I'm scratching out the eyes
Of a world I want to conquer, and deliver, and despise
And right while I am kneeling there
I suddenly begin to care
And understand that there could be
A person that loves me

[Chorus]
Rescue me (Rescue me, it's hard to believe)
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me (Rescue me, it's hard to believe)
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

[Post-Chorus]
Love is understanding
Its hard to believe life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an s.o.s.
Stop me from drowning, baby, I'll do the rest

[Chorus]
Rescue me
Your love has given me hope (Your love has given me hope)
Rescue me
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope (Baby, throw out your rope)
Rescue me
Your love has given me hope (Your love has given me hope)
Rescue me
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope (Baby, throw out your rope)

[Breakdown]
Ooh ahh, ooh ahh
Love is understanding
Ooh ahh, ooh ahh
Love is understanding

[Post-Chorus]
Love is understanding
It's hard to believe life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an s.o.s.
Rescue me, rescue me

[Verse 3]
It's not my business to decide
How good you are for me
How valuable you are
And what the world can see
Only that you try to understand me
And have the courage to love me for me

[Breakdown]
I believe (I believe in the power)
I believe that you can rescue me (I believe you can rescue me)
I believe (I believe in the power)
I believe that you can rescue me (I believe you can rescue me)
I'm singing I believe (I believe in the power)
I believe that you can rescue me (I believe you can rescue me)
I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing (I believe in the power)
I believe that you can rescue me (I believe you can rescue me)

[Outro]
I'm talking, I'm talking (I believe in the power)
I believe in the power of love (I believe you can rescue me)
I'm talking, I'm talking (I believe in the power)
I believe in the power of love (I believe you can rescue me)
I'm singing, I'm singing, I believe (I believe in the power)
I believe that you can rescue me (I believe you can rescue me)
Hey hey, hey hey (I believe in the power)
R.e.s.c.u.e. me, only you can rescue me (I believe you can rescue me)
Hey hey, hey... (I believe in the power)
(I believe you can rescue me)
(I believe in the power)
(I believe you can rescue me)

[Intro]
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I've been an awful good girl
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, an out-of-space convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 1]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be oh so good
If you'd check off my Christmas list
Boo doo bee doo

[Verse 2]
Santa honey, I want yacht and really that's
Not a lot
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa cutie, there's one thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, I'm filling my stocking with a duplex, and checks
Sign your 'X' on the line
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 3]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me
Boo doo bee doo

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
I don't mean a phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

[Outro]
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 1]
I have read somewhere in a book
That you can change your destiny
If you work enough
You can change your luck
Tell me where I have to be
So I can find this liberty

[Chorus]
Don't push me to the left
Don't push me to the right
I don't wanna have to fight
'Cause I know the justice is coming right

[Verse 2]
Gather up your hopes
Gather up your dreams
Just to stay alive
Is harder than it seems
I lay awake at night
Wondering what to do
Then this all did came to me
We're all changed to the red and blue

[Chorus]
Don't push me to the left
Don't push me to the right
I don't wanna have to fight
'Cause I know the justice is coming right
Don't push me to the left
Don't push me to the right
Just push me straight ahead
And you'll find that justice is coming right

[Bridge]
To the left
To the right
Have to fight
Coming right
To the left
To the right
Straight ahead
Coming right

[Verse 3]
I have learned nothin' is for free
If my ship goes down
No one's gonna come for me
Soldiers, they take arms
And ready for the slaughter
God forgive us all our sins
We were once your sons and daughters

[Chorus]
Don't push me to the left
Don't push me to the right
I don't wanna have to fight
'Cause I know the justice is coming right
Don't push me to the left
Don't push me to the right
Just push me straight ahead
And you'll find that justice is coming right

[Outro]
To the left
To the right
Have to fight
Coming right

[Verse 1]
Hear me, I'm knocking at your door
Could it mean I'm coming back for more
Could it be I could not stay away
Now all I want to do is say
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 2]
I got to tell you how I feel
It's getting oh so dark out here
The moonlight is shining on my skin
Now open up and let me in
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Chorus]
Shine a light in your window
Oooh, I'm here in the shadow
I saw your face in the doorway
Oooh, turned around and it slipped away

[Verse 3]
My body's shaking with the cold
I'm feeling tired, feeling old
And I see your fire burning bright
Now please wake up for me tonight
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Hear me, I'm knocking at your door
And you're in the doorway no more
I'll stay right here at your door
No way I'm going no more

[Michael Jackson]
"Say, say, say, what you want

Oh how cocky of me! To speak so highly of me

And this is just how I feel - why would I lie on a beat?

(Talkin 'bout her man) (Oh yeah)

Straight high voltage, fool with the poses
Will I smoke it? Ye ain't gotta ask me

Frank White, Lil' Kim, lick her on her chest
Ain't nothin like a tit with a lil' Henn'
Got her new, tryin to get it in
Sayin shit like "Girl just once let me put it in"
I'm talkin 'bout her
Talkin 'bout girl, you fine as fuck
So talk about me, up in that P
Leg to the West, one leg to the East (spread 'em)
And let me go deep, like Roddy White
Stood up in it and the girl got hype
But man I don't know, somethin ain't right
Shawty got different niggas callin all night
I'm talkin 'bout her

[Chorus]

[Mickey Factz]
Jack in, jack in
Givin me a feeling like a Blackwood, Blackwood
Momma's so appealing and I got this, option
That we can get it poppin
And right after I plug her
I can take her to an outlet for shopping, shopping
But I don't know if I trust her
So I gotta go, peace out, he's out
Like all up in my head tweaked out
Keep out, I don't know what to think, she's out
On the town gettin frisky
Raising the hairs on my arm when she with me
Shorty got charm
Lucky just to be with her, breathe with her
But T-R-E's with her, and he did her
Deliver her to me, currently, it worries me
What her and he did vertically
If I see her with him I pass out
No bolts, no volts or pulse I black out
Ow!

[Chorus]

[over end of Chorus]
(I'm talkin 'bout her bro) (You mean her?)
(Yeah her bro) (Hehehehe)

[B.o.B]
I'm talkin 'bout she's so psychadelic
She's so cool you can tell she gellin (hehe!)
And Led Zeppelin sell it
If she were a statue, she'd be a relic
Strikin like venom, in all white denim
Sugar in the brain cells on my neurons
I'm on her like the Hamburgler on buns
Runnin like the marathon you run
Someone gave her a medallion
Kickin like kung-fu from Shaolin
Which means how she looks is arousing
And so I'm thinkin how lucky her blouse is, yeah
Built like brick houses
Appraised at about eight hundred thousand, heh
And so the whole place shoutin
So for her I gotta scream this ballad, like

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
If I was an animal, I'd be a lion
If I was a car, I'd be an Aston Martin
If I was a genius, I'd be Isaac Newton
If I was a hero, I'd be Martin Luther

[Chorus]
If you want to reach the top (Reach the top)
If you do, you'll never stop (Never stop)

If I was an actor, I'd be Marlon Brando (The top)
If I was a painter, I'd be Frida Kahlo (The top)

If you do, you'll never stop (Never stop)
If you want to reach the top (Reach the top)
If you do, you'll never stop (Never stop)

[Verse 3]
If I was a star, I would be who I am today
If I was a fighter, I'd be Cassius Clay
If I was emotion, I would be intense
If I was a man, I would be president

[Bridge]
I'll be different
If I'm the president
I'll be different
If I'm the president
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

[Verse 4]

[Chorus 1]
Dance, you're not fighting
Dance, you're not lying
Dance, you're not cheating
Dance, you're only triggering your senses
You're not dying
Dance, you're not crying
Dance, you're not killing yourself
You're only triggering your senses
You're only triggering your senses

[Verse 1]
Dance is a lovely friend
Dance to your heart's content
Dance and we don't pretend
Dance is your only friend

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're on the street
To a different beat
When you're feeling down
When there's no one else around

[Chorus 2]
Dance, you're not taking
Dance, you're not hating
Dance, you're not killing yourself
You're only triggering your senses
You're only triggering your senses

[Verse 2]
I like it
A hip, a hip, a hippety hop
And you don't stop, you get on your feet
You do the hip hop to a different beat
I know you don't stop when you're on the street
You're not feeling down and there's no one else around
You get on your feet until you hear the funky beat
(Beat, beat, beat, beat)

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're on the street
To a different beat
When you're feeling down
When there's no one else around
When there's no one else around

[Chorus 1]
Dance, you're not fighting
Dance, you're not lying

Wouldn't want to change a thing... (In spite of)

What can I do?
I'm so in love with you

[Chorus 2]
You thrill me, surround me
You fill me
You send me
You put me in a trance

[Chorus 3]
You feel me
Inside me you take me (Romance)
You fill me
You put me in a trance

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
Sky fits heaven, so fly it
That's what the prophet said to me
Child fits mother, so hold your baby tight
That's what my future could see

[Verse 2]
Fate fits karma, so use it
That's what the wise man said to me
Love fits virtue, so hold on to the light
That's what our future will be

[Chorus]
Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go?
I think I'll follow my heart
It's a very good place to start

[Post-Chorus]
Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as I go
Traveling down my own road
And I'm watching the signs as they go
Traveling, traveling
Watching the signs as I go

[Verse 3]
Hand fits giving, so do it
That's what the Gospel said to me
Life fits living, so let your judgments go
That's how our future should be

[Chorus]
Traveling down this road
Watching the signs as I go
I think I'll follow the sun
Isn't everyone just
Traveling down their own road
Watching the signs as they go?
I think I'll follow my heart
It's a very good place to start

[Post-Chorus]
Traveling down my own road
Watching the signs as I go
Traveling down my own road
And I'm watching the signs as they go
Traveling, traveling
Watching the signs as I go

[Verse 1]
Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no

[Verse 2]
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress you had to burn
Pain is a warning that something's wrong
I pray to God that it won't be long
Do you wanna go higher?

[Chorus]
There's nothing left to try
There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye

[Verse 3]
Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress

[Chorus]
There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye

[Interlude]
Learn to say good-bye
I yearn to say good-bye

[Chorus]
There's nothing left to try
There's no more places to hide
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye
There's nothing left to lose
There's no more heart to bruise
There's no greater power
Than the power of good-bye

[Verse 1]
To have and not to hold
So hot, yet so cold
My heart is in your hand
And yet you never stand
Close enough for me to have my way

[Verse 2]
To love but not to keep
To laugh, not to weep
Your eyes, they go right through
And yet you never do
Anything to make me want to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a moth to a flame
Only I am to blame

[Chorus]
Ba ba da ba ba ba
What can I do?
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I go straight to you
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I've been told, mmm
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram, abahu purusakaram)

[Verse 3]
To look but not to see
To kiss but never be
The object of your desire
I'm walking on a wire
And there's no one at all
To break my fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a moth to a flame
Only I am to blame

[Chorus]
Ba ba da ba ba ba
What can I do?
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I go straight to you
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I've been told, mmm
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram)
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram)
You're to have (And yet you never do)
Not to hold

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a moth to a flame
Only I am to blame

[Chorus]
Ba ba da ba ba ba
What can I do?
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I go straight to you
Ba ba da ba ba ba
I've been told, mmm
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram)
You're to have, not to hold
(Abahu purusakaram)
You're to have, not to hold
(And yet you never do)

[Outro]
You're to have
Not to hold
(To break my fall)
Mmm
(Only I am to blame)
(Only I am to blame)
(Am to blame)
(Abahu purusakaram)
(Abahu purusakaram)

[Chorus]
Never forget who you are

God gave a present to me
Made of flesh and bones

You breathe new life
Into my broken heart

[Verse 1: Madonna]
What are you waiting for? Nobody's gonna show you how
Why wait for someone else to do what you can do right now?
Got no boundaries and no limits
If there's excitement, put me in it
If it's against the law, arrest me
If you can handle it, undress me

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on, and on, and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on, and on, and on

[Chorus: Madonna]
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna stop me now

[Verse 2: Madonna & Pharrell Williams]
They say that a good thing never lasts, and then it has to fall
Those are the people that did not amount to much at all
Gimme the baseline, and I'll shake it
Gimme a record, and I'll break it
There's no beginning and no ending
Give me a chance to go, and I'll take it

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on, and on, and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on, and on, and on

[Chorus: Madonna]
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna stop me now

[Bridge: Madonna, Pharrell Williams]
Watch this
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it (What?)
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it (What?)
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it (What?)
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it (What?)
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it (To the left, to the right, to the left, to the right)
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it (To the left, to the right, to the left, to the right)
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it (To the left, left, right, right, left, left, right, right)
Get stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid (Left, left, right, right, left, left, right, right)

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on, and on, and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on, and on, and on

[Chorus: Madonna]
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna stop me now

[Breakdown: Madonna]
You're only here to win
Get what they say?
You're only here to win
Get what they do?
They'd do it too if they were you
You done it all before, it ain’t nothing new
You're only here to win
Get what they say?
You're only here to win
Get what they do?
They'd do it too if they were you
You done it all before, it ain’t nothing new

[Chorus: Madonna]
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna stop me now
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah
No one's gonna stop me now
Give it to me

[Verse 1]
I ran from my house that cannot contain me
From the man that I cannot keep
My mother who haunts me, even though she's gone
From my daughter that never sleeps
I ran from the noise and the silence
From the traffic on the streets

I ran to the treetops, I ran to the sky
Out to the lake, into the rain
That matted my hair, and soaked my shoes and skin
Hid my tears, hid my fears

[Chorus]
I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran, I was looking for me

[Verse 2]
I ran past the churches and the crooked old mailbox
Past the apple orchards and the lady that never talks
Up into the hills, I ran to the cemetery
And held my breath, and thought about your death
I ran to the lake, up into the hills
I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still
And I saw the crumbling tombstones
All forgotten names
I tasted the rain, I tasted my tears
I cursed the angels, I tasted my fears
And the ground gave way beneath my feet
And the earth took me in her arms
Leaves covered my face
Ants marched across my back
Black sky opened up, blinding me

[Chorus]
I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran, I was looking for me
I ran to the lakes, and up to the hill
I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still

[Verse 3]
And I smelled her burning flesh
Her rotting bones
Her decay
I ran and I ran
I'm still running away

[Intro]
Breathe in, breathe out
I say a little prayer
How the gods above
Could be so unfair

[Chorus]
I know there's someone out there
Waiting for me
There must be someone out there
There just has to be

[Verse 1]
Go on, go on
Don't sit there like a fool
You've graduated from
A different kind of school

[Chorus]
I know there's someone out there
Waiting for me
There must be someone out there
There just has to be

[Verse 2]
I should be glad that I'm alive
It could have been much worse
I might have never loved at all
And never known what I am worth
How the gods above
Could be so unfair

[Chorus]
I know there's someone out there
Waiting for me
There must be someone out there
There just has to be
I know there's someone out there
Waiting for me
There must be someone out there
There just has to be

[Verse 1: Madonna]
On any given night, catch me on the floor
Workin' up the sweat, that's what music's for
I'd rather not explain, for me, it's just usual

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
(You can catch me popping that, dropping that)
Once I get going, I am gone
(Ain't no stopping that, are you watching that?)
(You can catch me popping that, dropping that)
I'll keep it going all night long
(Ain't no stopping that, are you watching that?)

[Chorus: Madonna, Pharrell Williams]
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me, it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know? Can't you see? When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one
The only one that the light shines on (Hey!)

[Verse 2: Madonna]
This complicated life, I try to do my best
I always tell myself it's all just a test
For me, it's an escape, 'cause dancing makes me feel beautiful

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna, Pharrell]
(Come on)
(And I can't pretend, it should never end)
Once I am moving, I'm alright
(Let the music play, are you watching that?)
Once I am moving, I'm alright
(She's alright, alright, alright)
(You can catch me popping that, it should never end)
I'll keep on dancing through the night
(Let the music play, 'cause I'm here to stay)

[Chorus: Madonna, Pharrell]
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new (C'mon)
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know? Can't you see? When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (The only one, the only one)
The only one (Oh) that the light shines on (Hey!)

[Breakdown: Madonna, Pharrell]
See my booty get down like (Uh)
See my booty get down like (Come on, uh)
See my booty get down like (Lower, uh)
See my booty get down like (Little lower, baby, uh)
Huh, get down
Huh-uh, (Uh) get down (Come on, uh)
See my booty get down like
(Huh? What? What? What?)

[Bridge: Madonna, Pharrell]
You probably think I'm crazy
I don't want you to save me (Dance)
Don't mean to disappoint you, I've never felt so free
If you could stand in my shoes
Then you would feel my heartbeat too

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna, Pharrell]
(You can catch me popping that, dropping that)
Once I am moving, I'm alright
(Ain't no stopping that, are you watching that?)
She's alright, alright, alright
(You can catch me popping that, dropping that)
I can keep on going through the night
(Ain't no stopping that, are you watching that?)

[Chorus: Madonna, Pharrell]
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know? Can't you see? When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel it in my heartbeat (The only one, the only one)
It may feel old to you, but to me it feels new
You know I feel it in my heartbeat
Don't you know? Can't you see? When I dance, I feel free
Which makes me feel like the only one (Only one, the only one)
The only one that the light shines on (Girl!)

[Outro: Pharrell]
M-Dolla
M-Dolla
What?

[Verse 1]
I just woke up from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe the things that I have seen
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away

[Pre-Chorus]
All my dreams, they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

[Verse 2]
When no one is around, then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart
When we're six thousand miles apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

[Bridge]
I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true
When I'm gone, you'll realize
That I'm the best thing that happened to you

[Breakdown]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

[Chorus]
You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

[Outro]
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

[Verse 1: Madonna]
I shoulda seen the sign way back then
When she told me that you were her best friend
And now she's rolling, rolling, rolling
And you were stolen, stolen, stolen
She started dressing like me, and talking like me, it freaked me out
She started calling you up in the middle of the night, what's that about?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
I just wanna be there when you discover
You'll wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might cook you breakfast, and love you in the shower
The flavor of the moment, 'cause she don't have what's ours

[Chorus: Madonna]
She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)

[Verse 2: Madonna]
I shoulda seen the sign when you were here
Under a different light, it's all so clear
She was stealing, stealing, stealing
And now you're feeling, feeling, feeling
She started dyeing her hair and wearing the same perfume as me
She started reading my books, and stealing my looks and lingerie

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
I just wanna be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might make you breakfast, and love you in the shower
The thrill is momentary, 'cause she don't have what's ours

[Chorus: Madonna]
She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)

[Bridge: Madonna]
She is licking her lips and she's batting her eyes
She's not me
She's got legs up to there and such beautiful hair
She's not me
Oh, devoted for life, make a beautiful wife
She's not me
If you spend some more time, I guarantee you will find
She's not me
I know I can do it better

[Verse 3: Madonna]
There's someone else to pimp your style
And hang with you a little while
And make up for the things you lack
You're gonna have to watch

[Chorus: Madonna]
She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)

[Interlude: Madonna]
Never let you forget
She's not me
She's not me, and she never will be
Never let you forget
She's not me
She's not me, and she never will be

[Verse 4: Pharrell Williams, Pharrell & Madonna]
Gotta find a way to show your feelings
I guess it was some bullshit saying you love me, love me
I guess my expectations hit the ceiling
When you come back, it will cost, just trust me, trust me
Wendy

[Outro: Madonna]
She's not me, she's not me
She's not me, and she never will be
She's not me, she's not me
She's not me, and she never will be
She never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be, never will be, never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
She's not me and she never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
She's not me
Never will be, never will be
She's not me and she never will be, she never will be

[Chorus: Madonna]
Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(C-c-c-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)
And all of those things that used to get you down now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(C-c-c-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Remembering the very first time
You caught that someone specials eye
And all of your care dropped
And all of the world just stopped (I hope)

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
I wanna go back to then
Gotta figure out how, gotta remember when
I felt it (Hmm)
It thrilled me (Hmm)
I want it (Hmm)
To fill me

[Chorus: Madonna]
Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(C-c-c-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)
And all of those things that used to get you down now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)

[Verse 2: Madonna]
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And everything in life just goes wrong
Feels like nobody's listening
And something is missing (I hope)

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
I wanna go back to then
Gotta figure out how, gotta remember when (Hmm)
I felt it (Hmm)
It thrilled me (Hmm)
I want it (Hmm)
To fill me

[Chorus: Madonna]
Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(C-c-c-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)
And all of those things that used to get you down now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(C-c-c-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)

[Interlude: Madonna]
I remember when
You were the one, you were my friend
You gave me life, you were the sun
You taught me things, I didn't run
I fell to my knees, I didn't know why
I started to breathe, I wanted to cry
I need a reminder, so I can relate
I need to go back there before it's too late

[Bridge: Madonna]
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body groovin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body groovin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body groovin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body groovin'

[Chorus: Madonna]
Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(C-c-c-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)
And all of those things that used to get you down now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(C-c-c-can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)

[Chorus: Madonna]
Incredible
Let's finish what we started
Incredible
You're welcome to my party

[Bridge: Madonna, Pharrell Williams, Both]
I don't want this to end
I am missing my best friend
It was incredible, there is no reason
Sex with you is  (Uhh)

Incredible (Hey girl)
Let's finish what we started (Let's finish where we started, girl)

There's no reason to pretend

[Bridge: Madonna]
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body groovin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body groovin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body groovin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body groovin'

[Breakdown: Madonna,  Pharrell, Both]
(It's time to get your hands up)
It's incredible, unbelievable
(It's time to get your body groovin')
It's incredible, unachievable
(It's time to get your hands up)
It's incredible, metaphysical
(It's time to get your body groovin')
It's incredible
Sex with you is (Uhh)

[Outro: Madonna, Pharrell]

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Hey Madonna
I'm taking you to the club
Go!
Uh
Feels good
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
Move your body
Catch me from across the floor
Everybody's watching, but I just wanna give you more
Don't care about nothing
I've fallen for your love in the worst way
So move closer
'Cause I can feel your body rise
The heat from you and I just have to fantasize
We're all alone now
And I don't care what people have to say

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna,  Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to be beautiful to be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous to be good
You just gotta give more, more, more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast, fast, fast
If you want this good thing to last

[Chorus: Madonna, Justin Timberlake, Both]
Let's dance tonight, dance tonight
And prove ourselves to the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy and you're just a girl
I want to dance tonight, dance tonight
Don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's prove ourselves to the world

[Post-Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
Do it, do it, let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it 'til the break of dawn
Do it, do it, while the night is young
Let the music pull you through it 'til the lights go on

[Verse 2: Madonna, Justin Timberlake, Both]
Now we're in our zone
Do you wanna take it further?
And before too long
I'm gonna start to wonder
Are you a one trick pony
Or do you wanna keep running this race?
I'm so into you
I've heard it all before
So what should I do?
I told you, catch me on the floor
Don't spoil this moment
'Cause talk is cheap, I don't have time to waste

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna,  Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to be beautiful to be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous to be good
You just gotta give more, more, more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast, fast, fast
If you want this good thing to last

[Chorus: Madonna, Justin Timberlake, Both]
Let's dance tonight, dance tonight
And prove ourselves to the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy and you're just a girl

Don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's prove ourselves to the world

Do it, do it, while the night is young
Let the music pull you through it 'til the lights go on

"Mucho gusto" means "I'm welcome to you"
Señorita, I just wanna fall in love
"Cállate" means "close your mouth"
"Bésame" means "give me love"
Señorita, she just want to fall in love

[Chorus]
Baby, hurry up, 'cause I cannot get enough
If you like my style, I can love you for the while
Can you hear me call your name?
Baby, I'm onto your game

[Verse 2]
"Dígame" means "tell me, baby"
"Yo soy loco" means "you drive me crazy"
Señorita, I just wanna fall in love

When you do your homework (Work)
Get up on the dance floor (Work)

[Verse 1]
As quiet as it is tonight, you'd almost think you were safe
Your eyes are full of surprises, they cannot predict my fate
Waiting underneath the stars, there's something you should know
The angels, they surround my heart, telling me to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet he couldn't, I bet he couldn't recognize
But I played right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

[Chorus]
It's like over and over, you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can't lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do, I do, I do

[Verse 2]
You almost fooled yourself this time, let all of the saints be praised
You hide your sadness behind your smile and you keep your lost heart raised (Lost heart raised)
With steps that edge along the ledge is much higher than it seems
But I've been on that ledge before, you can't hide yourself from me

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet he couldn't, I bet he couldn't recognize
I still played right into it, who am I to criticize?
Somehow I'll get through it and you won't even realize
Falling through your own disguise

[Chorus]
It's like over and over, you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can't lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, I do, I do, I do

[Instrumental breakdown]

[Chorus]
It's like over and over, you're pushing me right down to the floor
I should just walk away
Over and over, I keep on coming back for more
I play into your fantasy
Now that it's over, you can't lie to me right through your smile
I see behind your eyes
Now I'm sober, no more intoxicating my mind
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, you

[Outro]
Devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you, you, you
Devil wouldn't recognize you, you, you-you
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do, I-I, I do
You, you, you, you
Devil wouldn't recognize you (Recognize you)
I do (You, you)
Even the devil wouldn't recognize you
I-I-I-I-I do

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Who is the master? Who is the slave?

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Treat me like a curse then tell me I'm your savior
I'm living with a stranger I used to know so well
Waiting for your answer is a kind of torture
Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Are you walking the dog?
'Cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control?
Is that dog walking you?
Haven't you had enough?
Now your time is up
Baby, show me your hand

[Chorus: Madonna]
Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me, what do they say?
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain

[Post-Chorus: Madonna]
So you claim madness like it's convenient
You do it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?

[Verse 2: Madonna]
First you say you love me then you wanna leave me
Then you say you're sorry, you play the game so well
I bought your illusion, you're the greatest salesman
How could I refuse you when you sold it to yourself?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Are you walking the dog?
'Cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control?
Is that dog walking you?
Haven't you had enough?
Now your time is up
Baby, show me your hand

[Chorus: Madonna]
Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me, what do they say?
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain

[Post-Chorus: Madonna]
So you claim madness like it's convenient
You do it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]

But I ain't drinking lean no more I swear I’m through with this shit

But I ain't smoking that shit no more man I’m through with this shit

But I ain't fucking with these hoes no more I’m through with this shit
So many diamonds on me I done caught the flu with this shit
But I ain't buying that shit no more man I’m through with this shit

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Ain't no flexing on me, it’s a blessing homie

And the girl so cool she brought and extra homie
Girl on girl no question homie

Which one of y’all gonna be a little bitch?
Which one you young niggas wanna get rich?
Dropped out of school but he got a little sense
Wanna get rich? Gotta take that risk
Gotta work yo’ bitch, gotta work your wrist
Gotta use good sense, gotta sell that fish
If you shit where you piss then it don’t make sense
Selling bricks with a bitch then it don’t make sense
They were friends til the end then you snitched on a friend?
Well a friend tells the truth and you’re not my friend
If niggas were real then niggas will win
I never put trust in these niggas again
How you my clan you and didn’t stick to the plan?
You say you a man but you told on your man?
Sammy the bull, man you know what you did
Snitched on them all just to show off to yo bitch
2 shots in the head for the shit that you said
You say you OG but you talk to the feds
Judas betray me, you gave me this bread
All the time you had dope planted on edge
The city infested man, watch for the plague
Watch for the rest and look out the pigs

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Think about how bad you want it
Take it easy, Susie's fine, trying to make everyone happy in their mind
Think about how bad you want it
It's alright by me, don't worry anymore
Nothing is gone, everything's center and yo, I'm freaking out
Calm down, don't call too soon

Calm down, don't call too soon

Don't like it, so take it easy

[Verse]
When I'm alone I often think of an old house on the hill
Of a big yard hedged in roses where we ran and played at will
And when the night time brought us home hushing our merry din
Mother would look around and ask are all the children in
Well it's been many a year now and the old house on the hill
No longer has my mother's care and the yard is still so still
But if I listen I can hear it all no matter how long it's been
I seem to hear my mother ask are all the children in
And I wonder when the curtain falls on that last earthly day
When we say goodbye to all of this to our pain and work and play
When we step across the river where mother so long has been
Will we hear ask her a final time are all the children in (I come)

[Intro]
Oh lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home

[Verse 1]
When life's toils are ended
And parting days have come
Sin no more will tempt me
There from thee I'll roam
If you'll only lead me father
Lead me gently home

[Chorus]
Oh lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home father
If I fall upon the wayside
Lead me gently home
Lead me gently home father
Lead me gently home

[Verse 2]
In life's darkest hours father
When my troubles come
Keep my feet from wandering
There from thee I'll roam
Lest I fall upon the wayside
Lead me gently home

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Drumma Boy

[Verse 3]
Okay, hol' up I'm 'bout to roll up

Hell of a night, 100 million dollar yacht
Never paid for the pussy but after this you gon' owe us
She s-s-sick on the dick but don't throw up
Br-Br-Break it down, bend you over
OHB, I'm off the THC

Ah, yeah, boy
Ah, yeah (Ah, yeah)
Ah, yeah, boy
Ah, yeah (Ah, yeah)
Ah, yeah, boy
Ah, yeah (Ah, yeah)
Ah, yeah, boy

[Verse]
I saw you walking by his side
Heard you whisper all those lies
And I couldn't keep from crying

[Verse]
You sang him love songs tenderly
That should've been for you and me
And I couldn't keep from crying

[Chorus]
I saw his eyes drink in your charms
While he held you in his arms
Him, with all his winning ways
Rules your heart now in my place

[Verse]
I stood and watched him steal a kiss
From two lips I know I'll miss
And I couldn't keep from crying

[Chorus]
I saw his eyes drink in your charms
While he held you in his arms
Him, with all his winning ways
Rules your heart now in my place

[Verse]
I stood and watched him steal a kiss
From two lips I know I'll miss
And I couldn't keep from crying

[Verse 1]
Now this here's a story about the Rock Island Line
Well the Rock Island Line she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big tollgate down there and you know
If you got certain things on board when you go through the tollgate
Well you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well a train driver he pulled up to the tollgate
And a man hollered and asked him what all he had on board and said

[Chorus]
I got livestock
I got livestock
I got cows
I got pigs
I got sheep
I got mules
I got all livestock

[Verse 2]
Well he said you're alright boy you don't have to pay no toll
You can just go right on through so he went on through the tollgate
And as he went through he started picking up a little bit of speed
Picking up a little bit of steam
He got on through he turned and looked back at the man he said

[Chorus]
Well I fooled you
I fooled you
I got pigiron
I got pigiron
I got all pigiron

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

[Verse 3]
Looked cloudy in the west and it looked like rain
Round the curve came a passenger train
North bound train on a southbound track
He's alright a leaving but he won't be back

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

[Verse 4]
Oh I may be right and I may be wrong
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well the engineer said before he died
There were two more drinks that he'd like to try
Conductor said what could they be
A hot cup of coffee and a cold glass of tea

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line, she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

[Verse]
I was riding Number 9
Heading south from Caroline
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I got in trouble, had to roam
I left my gal and left my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

[Chorus]
Just a kid, acting smart
I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off the Georgia Main
Locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

[Verse]
All alone I bear the shame
I'm a number, not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
All I do is sit and cry
When that evening train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

[Chorus]
I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that gal of mine
I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

[Verse]
My baby left me just the other day
I guess the things will never be the same
But I must forget that she is gone
Because time goes by and life goes on

Making plans, shaking hands
Try to prove that I'm a man
It's hard to do but I must try
Because life goes on and so will I

It's been kind of tough these last few days
Trying to act normal and be gay
It's not easy to be all alone
But time goes by and life goes on

If I see her anywhere
I hope she thinks that I don't care
For after night there comes the dawn
Yes time goes by and life goes on

[Verse 1]
Country boy, ain't got no shoes
Country boy, ain't got no blues
Well, you work all day
While you're wanting to play
In the sun and the sand
With a face that's tan
But at the end of the day
When your work is done
You ain't got nothing but fun

[Chorus 1]
Country boy, ain't got no ills
Country boy, don't owe no bills

[Verse 2]
You get a wiggly worm
And then you watch him squirm
While you put him on a hook
And you drop him in a brook
And if everything's gonna turn out right
You're gonna fry fish tonight

[Chorus 2]
Country boy, you're lucky free
Country boy, I wish I was you, and you was me

[Verse 2]
Country boy, got work to do
Country boy, in the morning dew
You got to cut the weeds
You got to plant the seeds
There's many a row
You know you gotta hoe
But when it's quittin' time
And your work is through
There's a lot of life in you

[Verse 3]
Country boy, you got a shaggy dog
Country boy, up a holler log
Well, he comes in a run
When you pick up your gun
And with a shell or two
And your dog and you
When you get your rabbit
You'll skin his hide
He's gonna be good fried

[Chorus 3]
Country boy, got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes

[Verse]
If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays down
I'll be in your arms, time the moon come around
For a taste of love that's shining in your eyes
If the rooster crows at the cracking of the dawn
I'll be there just as sure as you're born
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll comb my hair down, brush my teeth
Shine up, slick up, dress up neat
Get everything looking just right
Because I want to look pretty when I see you tonight
Just as sure as the rabbits are a jumping in the holler
I'll be there, you can bet your bottom dollar
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays low
I'll be there a knocking at your door
With a hug and a kiss for the one I idolize
I'll wear my suit, my Sunday best, I'll be there looking my best
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll feed the mules and slop the hogs
Feed the cows and chop all the logs
Get all of my working done
'Cause tonight we're going to have lots of fun
Just as sure as there ever was a preacher man
I'll be there with a ring for your hand
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise

[Verse 1]
Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
I think you only live to see the lights of town
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try
Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry

[Verse 2]
Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you: "Bye, bye, bye!"
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry

[Chorus]
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry, cry, cry

[Verse 3]
I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

[Verse 4]
When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me: "Why, why, why?"
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry

[Outro]
You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been
You're gonna cry, cry, cry

[Verse 1]
When you're all alone and blue
No one to tell your troubles to
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
When this world turns you down
Not a true friend can be found
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you

[Pre-Chorus]
And through all kinds of weather
You'll find, I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same

[Chorus]
We're together right or wrong
Where you go I'll tag along
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I do my best to hide this lowdown feeling
I try to make believe there's nothing wrong
But they're always asking me about you darling
And it hurts me so to tell them that you're gone

[Verse 2]
If they ask me, I guess, I'd be denying
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it crying:
"Where's my darling, when's she coming home?"

[Chorus 1]
I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
Well I make it pretty good until that moon comes shining through
And that I get so doggone lonesome

[Verse 3]
Time stands still when you're awaiting
Sometimes I think my heart is stopping too
One lonely hour seems forever
Sixty minutes more to wait for you

[Verse 4]
But I guess I'll keep waiting till you're with me
Cause I believe that loving you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow
If I can't have you with me tonight

[Chorus 2]
Well I know, I'll keep on loving you cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind but I guess I never will
I could have a dozen others but I know, I'd love you still
'Сause I get so doggone lonesome

[Verse 1]
There are some people who say we cannot tell
Whether we are saved or whether all is well
They say we only can hope and trust that it is so
Well, I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know

[Chorus 1]
Yes, I know when Jesus saved me (Saved my soul)
The very moment He forgave me (Made me whole)
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within (Peace within)

[Chorus 2]
Satan can't make me doubt it (I won't doubt it)
It's real and I'm going to shout it (I'm going to shout it)
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know

[Verse 2]
I don't care who tells me salvation is not real
Though the world may argue, that we cannot feel
The heavy burden's lifted and the vile sins go
I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know

[Chorus 1]
Yes, I know when Jesus saved me (Saved my soul)
The very moment He forgave me (Made me whole)
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within (Peace within)

[Chorus 2]
Satan can't make me doubt it (I won't doubt it)
It's real and I'm going to shout it (I'm going to shout it)
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know
They gave him his orders at Monroe Virginia
Saying Steve you're way behind time
This is not 38 this is old 97
You must put her into Spencer on time

He turned around and said to his black greasy fireman
"Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Old Mountain
Watch old 97 roll"

And then a telegram came to Washington station
This is how it read:
It said, "That brave engineer that has run old 97
Is lying down in Danville, dead"

He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam

So now all you pretty ladies you better take a warning
From this time on and learn
Don't you speak hard words to your true lover husband
He may leave you and never return

[Verse]
On this old rock pile with a ball and chain
They call me by a number, not a name Lord, Lord
Got to do my time, I got to do my time
With an aching heart on that gal of mine

You can hear my hammer, you can hear my saw
Gonna swing it like John Henry all day long Lord, Lord
Got to do my time, I got to do my time
With an aching heart on that gal of mine

When that old judge looked down at me
Said I put you in that penitentiary Lord, Lord
Got to do my time, I got to do my time
With an aching heart on that gal of mine

Well now it won't be long just a few more days
They'll let me out of here I'm gonna stay Lord, Lord
With that gal of mine, with that gal of mine
She's waited for me while I've done my time

[Verse]
Everybody says you let me down
I should be ashamed to take you round
Makes no difference what you used to do
Darling I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you were reckless yesterday
But together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true
Darling I could never be ashamed of you

All the happiness I've ever known
Came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through
Darling I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you've been cheated in the past
And perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you prove to be untrue
Darling I could never be ashamed of you

[Verse]
Why do you punish me for loving you?
You're counting my mistakes, how about yours?
Why do you sentence me to nights of tears?
Convicting all these dreams I've dreamed for all these years

[Verse]
My heart cries out behind these prison bars
It pleads to you for your true love to set it free
Why do you punish me? Is love a crime?
If so, I'll spend a lifetime loving serving time

[Verse]
My heart cries out behind these prison bars
It pleads to you for your true love to set it free
Why do you punish me? Is love a crime?
If so, I'll spend a lifetime loving serving time

[Intro]
If you should meet some lonely soul
Who on this earth can't reach his gold
And he's traveling down the road so dark and dim

[Verse]
Lend the hand, say a prayer
Give a smile that he might share
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him)
Befriend each stranger in the night
Help to make his burdens light
Lift up the fallin' ones and be a friend
(Be a friend)

[Chorus]
Shed a tear, share a sight
Share his fears don't pass him by
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(It could be you instead of him)
Shed a tear, share a sight
Share his fears don't pass him by
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(It could be you instead of him)

[Hook]
In the East Atlanta I'm Birdman

Ain't got money like Birdman but in the East Atlanta i'm Birdman

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Pistol to your motherfucking head, you a dead man
Spraying every bed til' they put me in the feds, man
It's Gucci, and the crazy young nigga with the dreads man
And we smoke kush we stay high like Method Man and Redman
And these farmer's growing weed just like tomatoes and eggplants
Box cutter in my pocket, tryna open up ya chest man
If you live after these 50 shots, you a blessed man
I'm not a rapper I'm a ordinary nigga from the 'Crest, man
I got a extra ordinary cook game in the kitchen
You can diss me and put me in a awkward position
Green dot a nigga make him kill him in prison
Disrespect Brick Squad a very bad decision

[Hook]
You don't have to call me
And say you're sorry
I'm already gone

You don't have to call me
And break my heart
Each time i try movin on, oh

You don't have to call, Anymore
Oh, Yeah
You don't have to call baby

You don't have to call me

And break my heart
Each time i try movin on, oh

You don't have to call, Anymore
Oh, Yeah
You don't have to call baby
You don't have to call me
And say you're sorry
I'm already gone

You don't have to call me
And break my heart
Each time i try movin on, oh

You don't have to call, Anymore
Oh, Yeah
You don't have to call baby

[Verse]
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep
Oh I thrill to her kisses and she thrills to mine
Run softly while she sleeps and dreams for a time
Cause she dreams of tomorrow when she'll be my wife
And I pray that as peaceful as you is our life
And if your murmuring soothes me till I'm sleeping too
Run softly Blue River we'll both dream with you
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
Oh I thrill to her kisses
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)

[Verse]
Well now, Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
They were true as a blue, blue sky
He was a long-legged guitar picker with a wicked wandering eye
But he was her man nearly all of the time
Well, Johnny he packed up to leave her, but he promised he'd be back
He said he had a little picking to do a little farther down the track
He said, "I'm your man, I wouldn't do you wrong"
Well, Frankie curled up on the sofa, thinking about her man
Far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band
He was Frankie's man, he wadn't doing  her wrong
Then, in the front door walked a redhead, Johnny saw her right away
She came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played
He was Frankie's man, but she was far away
He sang every song to the redhead, she smiled back at him
Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none
Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him, she slapped him a time or two
She said, "I'm Frankie's sister and I was checking up on you
If you're her man you better treat her right"

[Outro]
Well, the moral of this story is be good but carry a stick
Sometimes it looks like a guitar picker just can't tell what to pick
He was Frankie's man and he still ain't done her wrong

[Verse 1]
Well now I heard that you been talking about me
Really I don't mind
I know you try to block my progress a lot of the time
Well the mean things you said don't make me feel bad
Because I can't miss a friend that I never had

[Chorus]
(I've got) I've got Jesus and that's enough (that's enough)
That's enough

[Verse 2]
When I'm sick (he's there) and troubled (he's there)
When I call him he will answer my prayers (answer my prayers)
When I'm burdened (he's there) with a load (he's there)
That's when Jesus is a comforter (to my soul)
Well you may scorn me turn your back on me
God's got his arms wrapped all around me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You know there's been a lot of times that I didn't have a dime
And I didn't cry to nobody but my Lord
He heard my plea and came to see about me because he's one thing I can afford
So if you push me down he'll pick me up
And he'll stick by me when the going gets tough

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Well he's the great emancipator and my heart regulator (Jesus is) yes he is
He'll make my way brighter and my burdens lighter yes he will (Jesus will)
Well you may scorn me turn your back on me
God's got his arms wrapped all around me
And he fights down the devil till he makes him give up
And that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
When I'm sick (he's there)

[Verse 1]
I long for the trip don't need no grip I'm taking one more ride
Way out there in the prairie air I guess it's in my hide
Oh the clickety clack of the railroad track is calling
If a man could know where the Santa Fe goes when she gets under steam
And the big loud bell that bongs farewell to hear her whistle scream
She's bound to go where there ain't no snow a falling

[Chorus]
One more ride

[x2]

[Verse 2]
I miss the gloom of the prairie moon that seemed to know my name
And the tumbleweed where the prairie dog feed I miss them just the same
They're all a part of a song of heart I'm saying
I recall the tune that I sang to the moon and it seemed to make it smile
And I rode away at the close of day and I stayed so long awhile
But I long to be where the memory is ringing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
As the years go by I wonder why I longed to leave my home
And to hit the trail of the iron rail away out there alone
But my heart would sigh till I know that I am leaving
If I don't come back on a one way track way down from Mexico
You could find me there or any old where that a tumbleweed will grow
It's a goodbye now you'll never know how I'm grieving

[Chorus]

[Verse]
At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Because I still miss someone

Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

I still miss someone
Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
I still miss someone

[Verse 1]
A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 2]
He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 3]
He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 4]
He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself atlast he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 5]
Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered around
And wondered at his final words

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town
I'd rather die young than grow old without you
So don't ever leave me whatever you do
To see someone's picture where my picture hung
Believe me my darling I'd rather die young

I'd rather die young than grow old without you
So don't ever leave me whatever you do
Though others may tempt you and tell you they care
You'll find only sorrow in a secret affair

Don't leave me
Never leave me
Please don't leave
Me never leave me

I'd rather die young than grow old without you
So don't ever leave me whatever you do
To see someone's picture where my picture hung
Believe me my darling I'd rather die young

I'd rather die young than grow old without you
So don't ever leave me whatever you do
To see someone's picture where my picture hung
Believe me my darling I'd rather die young

[Verse]
I got cotton in the bottom land
It's up and growing and I got a good stand
My good wife and them kids of mine
Gonna get new shoes, come Picking Time
Get new shoes come Picking Time
Every night when I go to bed
I thank the Lord that my kids are fed
They live on beans eight days and nine
But I get them fat come Picking Time
Get them fat come come Picking Time
The corn is yellow and the beans are high
The sun is hot in the summer sky
The work is hard til laying by
Laying by until Picking Time
Laying by until Picking Time
It's hard to see by the coal-oil light
And I turn it off purty early at night
Because a jug of coal-oil costs a dime
But I stay up late come Picking Time
Stay up late come Picking Time
My old wagon barely gets me to town
I patched the wheels and I watered them down
Keep her in shape so she'll be fine
To haul my cotton come Picking Time
Haul my cotton come Picking Time
Last Sunday morning when they passed the hat
It was still nearly empty back where I sat
But the preacher smiled and said that's fine
The Lord'll wait until Picking Time
The Lord'll wait until Picking Time

[Verse]
You're the shepherd of my heart so treat it tenderly
It's a heart that needs your everloving care
You're the shepherd of my heart until eternity lead it not into the valley of despair
While it's in your keeping guard it with your love
Shelter it from harm along life's way
You're the shepherd of my heart and darling honestly
It's a heart that will not ever go astray
You're the shepherd of my heart so surely you must know
You have but to speak and my heart will obey
It's at your command my dear because it loves you so
So my darling shepherd guide it where you may
If it be green pastures or a rocky road it will follow you and not ask why

[Outro]
You're the shepherd of my heart until the trumpet blows
And I go to meet the shepherd in the sky

[Verse 1]
Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play until evening time would come
Then winding down an old familiar pathway I hear my mother call at setting sun

[Chorus]
Come home, come home it's suppertime
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime
We're going home at last

Some of the fondest memories of my childhood are woven around suppertime. When mother used to call from the back steps of the old homeplace, "Come on home now son, it's suppertime." My how I'd love to hear that once again. But you know time has woven for me a realization of a truth that's even more thrilling. That soon we'll be called together around the great supper table up there for the greatest suppertime of them all with our Lord. I can almost hear the call now coming through the portals of heaven, "Come home son, it's suppertime. Come on home."

[Chorus]
Come home, come home it's suppertime
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime
We're going home at last

[Verse 2]
Through the distant clouds I see my mother
Her face is shining bright, with tender love
She's gone up in heaven, with her maker
And I can still hear her voice, from up above
(and she said)

[Chorus]
Come home, come home it's suppertime
The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime
We're going home at last

[Verse 1]
I dreamed I walked in a field of flowers
Oh, what a dream
The houses all were silver towers
Oh, what a dream
Beside the road an angel sat
I said hello and tipped my hat
And stopped when I saw her smile
And set me down a while
I set me down a while
You dreamer you
I tried the angel for a kiss
Oh, what a dream
But she turned away and my lips missed
Oh, what a dream
She said, "Sir, I'll have you know
I met you just a while ago
You're welcome for to sit
But calm yourself a bit, sir
Calm yourself a bit
You dreamer you
I fell in love like one, two, three
Oh, what a dream
I asked the angel to marry me
Oh, what a dream
She said, "Sir, I can't marry you
But I'm a dream that can come true
There are dreams of much my worth
That live upon the earth, sir
Live upon the earth
You dreamer you"
Then I awoke and found my love
Oh, what a dream
As heavenly as the one above
Oh, what a dream
We'll marry in a sea of flowers
Home will be a silver tower
There'll be heaven in my life
With an angel for a wife

[x2]

[Outro]
You dreamer you

[x2]

[Verse 1]
She said that she just couldn't leave her mother
I met a girl in our town I tour all my resistance down
I thought what a dream this going to be
I live with her a month or two and like any boy in love will do
Ask her if she would marry me

[Chorus]
But she was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother

[Verse 2]
Then I said well then probably the only thing that's left for me it's a going come back in a year
And so, the year past away, and then I try to win her hand again
She even pact her close, but wouldn't go

[Chorus]
Because she was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother

[Verse 3]
Well I hang around untill finally I asked her to marry me
Her mother says that it would be alright
We bought ourselfs a little home
And I finally got her all alone but she stays with her mother every night

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Well she said that she just couldn't leave - her mother

[Verse 1]
Well if I live to be a hundred, I won't forget the day
I broke the heart you gave me and let you walk away
That's when they hung my name in the fool's hall of fame

[Chorus]
Ah baby since we've been apart, I can't console my heart
It cries and cries all night long

[Verse 2]
Can't I ever make you see this change you've made in me
Just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong
Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery
You know I'll keep on a beggin untill you come back to me
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Baby can't you ever see the change you've made in me
Just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong
Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery
You know I'll keep on beggin untill you come back to me

[Outro]
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame

[Verse]
I'll remember you
Long after this endless summer has gone
I'll be lonely oh so lonely
Living only to remember you
I'll remember too
Your voice as soft as the warm summer breeze
Your sweet laughter, mornings after
Ever after, I'll remember you
To your arms someday I'll return to stay
Till then I will remember too
Every bright start we made wishes upon
Love me always, promise always

[Outro]
Oooh, youll remember too

[Verse 1]
There's a fire burning bright at our house tonight
Slow music playing and soft candlelight
On her lips I keep tasting the warm red wine
I'm there in her arms but it's all in my mind

[Chorus]
The snow is piled high on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder

[Verse 2]
This old highway us like a woman
Sometimes she can be your best friend
But she's the real jealous kind
She's the lady that leads me to the life I dream of
She's the mistress that keeps me from the ones that I love

[Chorus]

[Outro]
God, I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder

[Verse]
Old Apache squaw how many long lean years you saw
How many bitter winter nights shivering in a cold teepee shivering in a cold teepee
Old Apache squaw how many hungry kids you saw
How many bloody warriors running to the sea fleeing to the sea
Well now they tell me that you saw Cochise when he made his last stand
He said the next white man that sees my face is going to be a dead white man
Old Apache squaw how many broken hearts you saw
Have you had misty eyes for years could that mist be tears could that mist be tears
Well now they tell me

[Outro]
Old Apache squaw

[Verse]
Goodbye, little darling, we're parting
Parting don't always mean goodbye
Although we had to part, you're always in my heart
Goodbye, little darling, goodbye
Goodbye, little darling, I'll miss you
Miss you like the stars would miss the sky
I hate to see you go, I'm going to miss you so
Goodbye, little darling, goodbye
Goodbye, little darling, I love you
Love you until the day I die
Would you dream a dream of me, wherever you may be
Goodbye, little darling, goodbye

[Verse]
I just thought you'd like to know
Since you'd made your plans to go
It's going to hurt me so to see you go
But I hope you find another love and he'll be good to you
But still and yet I can't forget the things we used to do
I just thought I tell you this
I love you since that first sweet kiss
It's going to hurt to miss your tender kiss
But I hope you get to do the things you say you want to do
But still and yet I can't forget the happiness we knew
I just thought you'd like to know how much you've hurt my pride
I just thought you'd like to know how much my heart has cried over you
But darling you could never see the misery you caused for me
So I will tell you so because I just thought that you'd like to know

[Verse]
Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
Tell you why I stayed around tell me why she lied
I'll tell why my heart's broken tell me why she said goodbye
Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
You tell me then I'll tell you
I'll tell you why I loved her tell me why she said goodbye
Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
Tell me why I'm lonely I'll tell you why I'm alone
Tell you why I stayed around tell me why she's gone
I'll tell why my heart's broken tell me why she was untrue
Tell me why she left me and I'll tell you why I'm blue
You tell me then I'll tell you

[Verse]
(Just about time I'm feeling blue trying to get over you)
Maybe it's just about time I told you I'm all through with you
But just about the time I start to tell you I start feeling blue
And just about then I lose my nerve and wait another day or two
Because just about the time I think it's over I start missing you
(Hardest thing I'll ever do tryin' to get over you)
It's just about time I had my saying I told you a thing or two
It's just about time I paid you back you treat me like you do
But just about the time I get the nerve I can't seem to carry through
Beause just about then an mpty feeling reminds me I miss you
(Like to find somebody new I could just get you)
(Just don't know what I go through trying to get over you)
It's just about time I let you know I've had my fill of you
But just about the time I think about going I start missing you
I'd like to go find another love that'll never be untrue
But just about the time I think about leaving I start missing you
(Having a hard time feeling blue trying to get over you)

[Verse]
I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time

[Chorus]

[x2]
The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Because I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

[Verse 1]
I'm not the going steady kind
I miss them all, all the time
I told Annie I'd be true
But I still think about Katy too

[Chorus]
Katy too, Katy too
I still think about Katy too

[Verse 2]
If you should see miss Mary-Ann
Just tell her I'm her loving man
Give my love to Jane and Sue
But don't forget ol' Katy too

[Chorus]
Katy too, Katy too
Don't forget ol' Katy too

[Verse 3]
I like Sadie's chicken stew
And Suzie's good at stitching wool
I like Mary's barbecue
But I still like ol' Katy too

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Now, girls I'm not the flirty kind
But I just can't make up my mind
I'd like to marry all of you
But I still miss ol' Katy too

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
To all the girls I make this toast
I love you eveyone the most
But don't ask me to say "I do"
Because I still miss ol' Katy too

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
Cupid you bet you been good to me
I got more girls than I can see
But if you give me all but two
Then let's squeeze in ol' Katy too

[Outro]
Katy too, Katy too
Let's squeeze in ol' Katy too

[Verse]
You're telling everyone in town that I don't treat you right
You even say I stay away and don't come home at night
I'm losing you and you are all I've got thanks a lot thanks a lot
It seems you like to hurt me and you know I'm good to you
I'd give you anything I own do anything you want me to
Yeah now you really got me on the spot thanks a lot thanks a lot
Still I would forgive you if you'd let me I'd be glad if we could try again
But it seems that you're just out to get me
And it looks as if you're just about to win
No matter what you do I'll always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
And you're calling me those things you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot

[Outro]
No matter what you do I always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
You say I'm happy but you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot thanks a lot
The news is out all over town
That you've been seen
Out running around
I know that I
Should leave, but then
I just can't go
You win again

This heart of mine
Could never see
What everybody knew
But me
Just trusting you
Was my great sin
What can I do?
You win again

I'm sorry for
Your victim now
Cause soon his head
Like mine will bow
He'll give his heart
But all in vain
And someday say
You win again
You have no heart
You have no shame
You take true love
And give the blame
I guess that I
Should not complain
I love you still
You win again

(Again)

[Chorus]
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me

[Verse 1]
A rose, a carnation, the lily and an orchid make such a pretty bouquet
(Drink to me, drink to me)
But only the orchid was worthy of you, so I threw all the others away
(Drink to me, drink to me)
Then you took the orchid and you breathed on its petals
And after a day or two
The flower still blooms but the scent's not the orchids
It carries the savor of you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
So if you are going to drink to me, drink with your eyes
And I will never cry for wine
(Drink to me, drink to me)
Or leave a kiss in an empty coffee cup then pass it from your lips to mine
(Drink to me, drink to me)
Because I've got a thirst burning way down in my soul
And honey from a sugar tree
Is not half as sweet as the air that you breathe
Honey come here and drink to me

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Two feet high and rising

[Verse 1]
We can make it to the road in a homemade boat
That's the only thing we got left that'll float
It's already over all the wheat and the oats
Two feet high and rising

[Chorus]
How high's the water, mama?
Three feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Three feet high and rising

[Verse 2]
Well, the hives are gone
I've lost my bees
The chickens are sleeping
In the willow trees
Cow's in water up past her knees
Three feet high and rising

[Chorus]
How high's the water, mama?
Four feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Four feet high and rising

[Verse 3]
Hey, come look through the window pane
The bus is coming, it's going to take us to the train
Looks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain
Four feet high and rising

[Chorus]
How high's the water, mama?
Five feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Five feet high and rising

[Verse 4]
Well, the rails are washed out north of town
We got to head for higher ground
We can't come back till the water comes down
Five feet high and rising
Well its five feet high and rising

[Verse 1]
Hey hey good looking what you got cooking how's about cooking something up with me
Hey hey sweet baby don't you think maybe we could find us a brand new recepie
I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill and I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin's free if you want to have fun come along with me

[Chorus]
Hey hey good looking what you got cooking how's about cooking something up with me

[Verse 2]
I'm free and ready so we can go steady how's about saving all your time for me
No more looking I know I've been tooken how's about keeping steady company
I'm going to throw my datebook over the fence find me one for five or ten cents
Keep it untill it's covered with age because I'm writing your name down on every page

[Chorus]
Say hey good looking what you got cooking how's about cooking something up with me

[Verse]
Will we get cold and hungry
Will times be very bad?
When we are needing bread and meat
Where are we going to get it, Dad?
We'll get it from the man
In the house on the hill
Yes we will from the man on the hill
Ploughing time is over
Still the fields are bare
How we going to make a living
With twenty acres to share?
I'll beg for more land
From the man on the hill
Yes I will, I'll ask the man on the hill
I haven't got no Sunday shoes
That I can wear to town
Papa reckon the boss has got
A pair of hand-me-downs
I'll go and ask the man
In the house on the hill
Yes I will, I'll ask the man on the hill
Maybe he will help us
Maybe we'll get by
But who's going to pay the dying bills
If we all should die
We'll leave it to the man
In the sky when we die
Yes we'll leave it to the man in the sky

[Verse 1]
In the desert where we searched for gold
The days are hot the nights are cold
Hank and Joe and me walked on
So bold and brave and free
For days and days we fought the heat
I got so thirsty and I got so weak
And when I fell because I couldn't go
I heard Hank say to Joe

[Chorus]
He's dying
(Dying dying)
For water
Hear him crying
(Crying crying)
For water

[Verse 2]
Well lay him down in the dust and sand he said
Joe you know he's a dying man
Leave him there and let him die
I can't stand to hear him cry for water
I don't remember how long I lay
But when I awoke it was the break of day
Buzzards circled miles ahead
I knew Hank and Joe were dead
My eyes were dimmed but I could see
A bed of gold nuggets under me
Now I know that it won't be long
Till they decorate my bones

[Chorus]

[Verse]
My Pappy said when I was seventeen
"You're six feet tall and your face is clean
And it don't look right for a boy that old
To not make a living loading coal"

[Chorus]
Loading coal, loading coal
I'm a double first cousin to a dag-blamed mole
Never get rich for to save my soul
In forty-eleven years of loading coal, loading coal

[Verse]
Ain't never got acquainted with a dollar bill
And I don't ever reckon that I ever will
A dollar isn't made for a fellar I'm told
That scoops up a living loading coal

[Chorus]
Loading coal, loading coal
I'm a double first cousin to a dag-blamed mole
Never get rich for to save my soul
In forty-eleven years of loading coal, loading coal

[Verse]
I cussed everything in the mining camp
From a shovel and my pick to my carbide lamp
But I know mighty well till I grow old
I'll still be a-cussing, but loading coal

[Chorus]
Loading coal, loading coal
I'm a double first cousin to a dag-blamed mole
Never get rich for to save my soul
In forty-eleven years of loading coal, loading coal

[Verse]
I know just as well as coal is black
One of these days the mines were strike
And I'll sit around starving till I'm finally told
There's a nickel more a ton for loading coal

[Chorus]
Loading coal, loading coal
I'm a double first cousin to a dag-blamed mole
Never get rich for to save my soul
In forty-eleven years of loading coal, loading coal

[Verse]
She knew that Cody was the man she wanted
But she had waited nearly all her life
Just one more trip to town to tell the boys goodbye
Then he'd be back to take her for his wife
(Don't you worry)
Clementine
Cody saddled up and left his darling
Then rode to town to celebrate his plan
He told them this would be his last carousing
"I'm going to settle down boys if I can"
(With my darling)
Clementine
Someone said, "It must have been past midnight
When Cody had to face a jealous man "
Another story goes that no one really knows
But it seems there was a dance hall girl called Nan
(Don't you tell)
Clementine
We do know that the shot or two was heard from some back room
Then there was a silence in the place
Just one more trip to town but all his chips were down
They found Cody lying on his face
(Softly calling)
Clementine
So buddies, make a monument to lay down at his head
Sure you hate to leave your pal behind
Mother, help your daughter put her wedding dress away
Because Cody won't be riding back this time
(To his darling)
Clementine

[Verse 1]
I ride an old Paint, he's on the weary side
And I am a saddle tramp about to cross the Great Divide
Where there's grass in the Coulees and water in the drawl
And the forty-pound saddle won't make us both raw

[Chorus]
Slow rider, slow rider, move on a little more
The sky boss is waiting at the big ranch house door

[Verse 2]
I can't help but missing the daughters that I had
One went to Denver, the other went bad
My young wife died in a poolroom fight
But I try to keep singing from morning till night

[Chorus]
Slow rider, slow rider, move on a little more
The sky boss is waiting at the big ranch house door

[Verse 3]
Whenever I die, take my saddle from the wall
Strap it on Snuffy, lead him out of the stall
Throw me on his back and turn him toward the West
He knows how to take me to the spot I love best

[Chorus]
Slow rider, slow rider, move on a little more
The sky boss is waiting at the big ranch house door

[Verse 1]
We all were called to come back
To the old home on the farm
Mother's passed away, what a mournful day
And as my daddy watched
His eyes were filled with pain and hurt
When someone stepped upon a rose
And crushed it in the dirt

[Chorus]
Don't step on Mother's roses, Daddy cried
She planted them the day she was my bride
And every time I see a rose, I see her smiling face
She made my darkest days look bright
Around the old home place"

[Verse 2]
"Don't step on Mother's roses, let them grow
The way they did since many years ago
They will bloom for me each year
And I will have Mother near
Don't step on Mother's roses, let them grow"
Years have passed away
And how the old home place has changed
Daddy had to go, we all miss him so
Children pick the roses as they go along the way
But when their petals are abused, I hear my daddy say

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Ride this train to Roseburg, Oregon, now there's a town for you
And you talk about rough
You know a lot of places in the country claim Paul Bunyon lived there
But you should have seen Roseburg when me and my daddy come there
Every one of them loggers looked like Paul Bunyon to me
And I was a skinny kid about sixteen
And I was scared to death when we walked into that camp
None of the lumberjacks paid any attention to me at first
But when my pa told the boss that me and him wanted a job
A lot of 'em stopped their work to see what was gonna happen
That big boss walked around me looked me up and down and said
Mister, I believe that boy is made out of second growth timber and I guess I was
Everybody but me and pa had a big laugh over it
Pa got kinda mad and the boss finally said he might start me out as a high climber
I didn't know what a high climber was, boy, I sure learned fast
That steel corded rope cut my back and that axe
I thought it was gonna break my arms off but I stuck with it
It wasn't long 'til I learned that a man's got to be a lot tougher than the timber he's cuttin'
Finally I could swing that crosscut saw with the best of them

[Verse 1]
I lived on a farm out in Iowa
I pulled the corn and I worked in the hay
Got trapped by a girl but I wiggled free
Heard the Oregon timber calling me

[Chorus]
Will you tell me something, Mr. Lumberjack?
Is it one for forward and three for back?
Is it two for stop or four for go?
Boy, ask a whistle punk, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Well, I learned this fact from a logger named Ray
You don't cut timber on a windy day
Stay out of the woods when the moisture's low
Or you ain't gonna live to collect your dough

[Chorus]
Will you tell me something, Mr. Lumberjack?
Is it one for forward and three for back?
Is it two for stop or four for go?
Boy, ask a whistle punk, I don't know

[Verse 3]
Well you work in the woods from morning to night
You laugh and sing and you cuss and fight
On Saturday night you go to Eugene
And on a Sunday morning, your pockets are clean

[Chorus]
Will you tell me something, Mr. Lumberjack?
Is it one for forward and three for back?
Is it two for stop or four for go?
Boy, ask a whistle punk, I don't know

[Verse]
What a beautiful thought I am thinking
Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word
All the other birds are flocking around her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God
All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name
Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake
She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky
In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is over
I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look
When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird

[Verse 1]
As I walked by the lake one day, by chance my Dorraine passed my way
Then she and I walked hand in hand on the banks of Pontchartrain
I pinned a flower on her heart, I swore we'd never be apart
She vowed her love forever and, as I kissed her, did the same

[Chorus]
Dorraine, my Dorraine
My dark-haired little angel
My belle of Pontchartrain

[Verse 2]
We sat down on the dock and with our hearts and fingers locked
We laughed and talked and joked about when our names are the same
And joking, I said, "Honey, are you marrying me for money?"
And it took just one quick look to tell it hurt my dear Dorraine

[Verse 3]
She jumped and stood above me and she cried, "Why you don't love me!
I'm rowing home across the lake you won't see me again"
I called and called some more, but she rowed fast from the shore
And the clouds brought by a wind began to rain on Pontchartrain

[Chorus]
Dorraine, I called Dorraine
Come back, my little angel
My belle of Pontchartrain

[Verse 3]
The storm should make her learn that she should make a swift return
But as the rain fell harder, I lost sight of my Dorraine
As panic gripped my heart, I drew the oars and made my start
To look for her on raging water and the rain on Pontchartrain

[Verse 4]
At darkness, I still called, but no one heard my cries at all
And when the daybreak came then others helped me look for my Dorraine
But there was not a thing afloat except the oars from her rowboat
For all was lost upon the choppy waves and rain on Pontchartrain

[Verse 5]
Now I come day after day to where my sweetheart rowed away
And I gaze across the water of the rainy Pontchartrain
Just one thing and nothing more ever floated back to shore
It was this flower I hold, it is the one I pinned on my Dorraine

[Chorus]
Dorraine, my Dorraine
My dark haired little angel
My belle of Pontchartrain

[Verse 1]
We sailed on the ship John B, my grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night, got into a fight
Well, I feel so homesick I want to go home

[Chorus]
So hoist up the John B sail, see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home?
Well, I feel so homesick I want to go home

[Verse 2]
The first mate, he got drunk, broke up the people's trunk
Constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone, why don't you leave me alone?
Well, I feel so homesick I wanted to go home
Then the cook, he caught the fits, threw out all of my grits
Then he took and ate up all of my corn
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home?
Well, this is the worst trip since I have been born

[Chorus]
So hoist up the John B sail, see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home?
Well, I feel so homesick I want to go home

[Verse 1]
Well I took my Ruby juking
On the out-skirts of town
She took her high heels off
And rolled her stockings down
She put a quarter in the jukebox
To get a little beat
Everybody started watching
All the rhythm in her feet

[Chorus]
She's my rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
Rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
When Ruby starts a-rocking
Boy it satisfies my soul

[Verse 2]
Now Ruby started rocking about one o'clock
And when she started rocking
She just couldn't stop
She rocked on the tables
And rolled on the floor
And Everybody yelled: "Ruby rock some more!"

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It was around about four
I thought she would stop
She looked at me and then
She looked at the clock
She said: "Wait a minute Daddy
Now don't get sour
All I want to do
Is rock a little bit more"

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
One night my Ruby left me all alone
I tried to contact her on the telephone
I finally found her about twelve o'clock
She said: "Leave me alone Daddy
Because your Ruby wants to rock"

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Rock, rock, rock and roll

[x4]
When Ruby starts a-rocking
Boy it satisfies my soul

[Verse]
My Papa was a hobo when they delivered me
We didn't have a doctor 'cause he couldn't pay the fee
But when the going got too bad to ease his misery
Papa played the dobro this a-way and he'd go

[Verse]
When company would come around, he kept the dobro hid
He knew he couldn't play the way the other players did
Why the guitar's resonator was a gallon-bucket lid
But Papa played the dobro this way and he'd go

[Verse]
Well now that Papa's gone away, it's hanging by the flue
The top of it's rusted and the strings are rusty too
It won't ever sound the way that it did when it was new
When Papa played the dobro this a-way and he'd go

[Verse]
Pick a lotta cotton, drag a long sack
Coming across the field, well, I see Boss Jack
He's a riding straddle of a single-foot roan
When you know that horse, you'll leave him alone

That ole roan's got green in his eyes
Mean as the devil and twice as wise
A fire in his nose and a bow in his back
Can't nobody ride him but Boss Jack

"Come on children, bend your back
Work a little faster, fill your sack
Then you hitch up the wagon, take it to the gin
Finish picking before the winter sets in"

Now here a while back when the crop was laid by
Remember who took us on a big fish fry?
Caught a heap of catfish, goggle-eye, and carp
Dashed and sang to the guitar and the harp
Well, someday old Boss Jack is going to set us all free
Gabriel's gonna blow for you and me
Angels going to bring that chariot from above
Flapping their wings like a turtle dove

"Come on children, bend your back
Work a little faster, fill your sack
Then you hitch up the wagon, take it to the gin
Finish picking before the winter sets in"

[Verse 1]
I live in the cemetery
'Old Caretaker' they call me
In the wintertime I rake the leaves
And in the summer I cut the weeds
When a funeral comes
The people cry and pray
They bury their dead
Then they all go away
But through their grief
I can still see
Their hate and greed and jealousy
So here I work
And I somehow hide
From a world that rushes
By outside
But each night
When I rest my head
I'm contented
As the peaceful dead

[Chorus]
But who's going to cry
When old John dies?
Who's going to cry
When old John dies?

[Verse 2]
Once I was a young man
Dashing with the girls
Now no one wants an old man
When I lost my handsome curls
But I want to say
When my time comes
Lay me facing
The rising sun
Put me in a corner
Where I buried my pup
Tell the preacher to pray
Then cover me up
Don't lay flowers
Where my head should be
Maybe God would
Let some grow for me
And all the little children
That I love like my own
Will they be sorry
That Old John's gone?

[Chorus]
But who's going to cry
When old John dies?
Who's going to cry
When old John dies?

[Verse]
Old Apache Squaw, how many long lean years you saw?
How many bitter winter nights shivering in a cold teepee?
Shivering in a cold teepee
Old Apache Squaw, how many hungry kids you saw?
How many bloody warriors running to the sea, fleeing to the sea?

[Chorus] 

[x2]
Well, now they tell me that you saw Cochise
When he made his last stand
He said, "The next white man that sees my face
Is going to be a dead white man"
Old Apache Squaw, how many broken hearts you saw?
Have you had misty eyes for years?
Could that mist be tears? Could that mist be tears?

[Verse 1]
Well a man walked down by Galilee
So the holy book does say
And a great multitude was gathered there
Without a thing to eat for days
Up stepped a little boy with the basket
"Please take this, Lord", he said
And with just a five loaves and two little fishes
Five thousand had fish and bread

[Chorus]
Who was it everybody

[x3]
It was Jesus Christ, our Lord

[Verse 2]
Now pay close attention little children
It's somebody you ought to know
It's all about a man that walked on earth
Nearly two thousand years ago
Well he healed the sick and afflicted
And he raised them from the dead
Then they nailed him on an old rugged cross
And put thorns on his head

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well they took him down and they buried him
And after the third day
When they came to his tomb where they knew he was gone
Because the stone was rolled away
He's not here for he is risen
The angel of the Lord then said
And when they saw him walking with these nail-scared hands
They knew he came back from the dead

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
He was just an old country doctor in a little country town
Fame and fortune had passed him by, though we never saw him frown
As day by day in his kindly way, he'd serve us one and all
Many a patient forgot to pay although Doc's fees were small

[Verse 2]
Though he needed his dimes and there were times that he would receive a fee
He'd pass it onto some poor soul that needed it worse than he
He had to sell his furniture, couldn't pay his office rent
So to a dusty room over a livery stable, Doc Brown and his satchel went

[Verse 3]
And on the hitching post at the curb below to advertise his wares
He nailed a little sign that read "Doc Brown has moved upstairs"
One day he didn't answer when they knocked upon his door
Old Doc Brown was lying down, but his soul was no more

[Verse 4]
They found him there in that old black suit, on his face was a smile of content
But all the money they could find on him was a quarter and a copper cent
So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull
Beside each debtor's name old Doc had writ these words "Paid In Full"

[Verse 5]
Old Doc should've had a funeral fine enough for a king
It's a ghastly joke our town was broke and no one could give a thing
'Cept Jones the undertaker, he did mighty well
Donating an old iron casket he had never been able to sell

[Verse 6]
And the funeral procession it wasn't much for grace and pomp and style
But those wagon loads of mourners they stretched out for more than a mile
We wanted to give him a monument we kinda figured we owed him one
Because he made our town a better place for all the good he'd done

[Verse 7]
We pulled up that old hitchin' post where Doc had nailed his sign
We'd painted it white and to all of us, it certainly did look fine
Now the rains and the snows have washed away our white trimmin's of paint
There aren't nothing left but Doc's own sign and that's getting pretty faint

[Verse 8]
But you can still see that old hitching post, as if an answer to our prayers
Mutely tellin' the whole wide world Doc Brown has moved upstairs
Well I knew a boy named Willie Brown
He was a lover of our town
Wherever he went, the girls fell down
And cried for Willie Brown
Crazy 'bout Willie Brown

Tall and dark and lean and long
Big as a bull and twice as strong
He loved the girls and turned 'em down
A chic was Willie Brown
Dashin' Willie Brown

Well a new girl moved in on our street
We knew that she and Will would meet
But then when we inquired around
She'd not met Willie Brown
She said "Who's Willie Brown?"

The prettiest girl you ever saw
Head to toe without a flaw
When they met one night in town
She fell for Willie Brown
In love with Willie Brown
But the trouble was that we all knew
Willie Brown was fallin' too
Then he announced when June comes 'round
She'll marry Willie Brown
She's in love with Willie Brown

But then the girl denied it all
She said "It's true that I did fall
But he took my love for granted
Now, to heck with Willie Brown
Conceited Willie Brown"

Willie Brown was shocked to learn
That his love had at last been spurn
So on a hill ouside of town
We buried Willie Brown
We buried Willie Brown

[Verse]
My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died
My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound
And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died
It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come
Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died
Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamed an angel came
He took my hand, he called my name
He bid me look the other way
I saw a man, I heard him say

[Chorus]
He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all men to me
He turned and then I saw
The nail-scarred hands
That bled for me
I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there

[Bridge]
My life my heart I gave
My soul was in his care

[Verse 2]
When I awoke my heart beat so and in the dark I saw a glow
This was no dream he turned my way

[Bridge]
Again I heard my Savior say

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
On A Monday I Was Arrested (Uh Huh)
On A Tuesday They Locked Me In The Jail (Oh Boy)
On A Wednesday My Trial Was Attested
On A Thursday They Said Guilty And The Judge's Gavel Fell

[Chorus]
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
I Got Chains - Chains Around My Feet
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
And Them Chains - Them Chains They're About To Drag Me Down

[Verse 2]
On A Monday My Momma Come To See Me
On A Tuesday They Caught Me With A File
On A Wednesday I'm Down In Solitary
On A Thursday I Start On Bread And Water For A While

[Chorus]
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
I Got Chains - Chains Around My Feet
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
And Them Chains - Them Chains They're About To Drag Me Down

[Chorus]
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
I Got Chains - Chains Around My Feet
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
And Them Chains - Them Chains They're About To Drag Me Down

[Verse]
I walked up to the desk and asked the man about a room
I asked about the bridal suite, I told him I'm the groom
Then I took the elevator to the floor I was assigned
I fumbled with the key the way I did that other time
Inside I thought of all the things that started in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I hear the happy people laughing in the street below
But the loneliness I feel tonight I hope you never know
The life that was a happy song has ended much too soon
And I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I look around the room and see you standing everywhere
The fragrance of your bridal flowers seems to fill the air
The blushing bride that gave me such a free and eager kiss
Two loving arms around me as you offered wedded bliss
We'd said that we'd return to live it over in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon

[Verse]
Son said my mother when I was knee high
You need of clothes to cover you and not a rag have I
There's nothing in the house to make a boy's britches
Nor shears to cut a cloth with nor thread to take stitches
There's nothing in the house but a leaf end of rye
And the harp with a with the woman's head nobody will by and she began to cry
That was in the early fall and when came the late fall
Son she said the sight of you makes your mother's blood crawl
Little skinny shoulder blades sticking through your clothes
And where you get a jacket from God above knows
It's lucky for me lad your daddy's in the ground
And can't see the way I let his son go around and she made a queer sound
That was in the late fall when the winter came
I'd not a pair of bridges nor a shirt to my name
I couldn't go to school or out of doors to play
And all the other little boys passed our way
Son said my mother come climb into my lap
And I'll chave your little knees while you take a nap
And oh but we were silly for half an hour or more
Me with my long legs dragging on the floor
I rocked rocked rocked to a mother goose rhyme
Oh but we were happy for half an hour's time
But there was I a great boy and what would folks say
To hear my mother singing me to sleep all day in such a daft way
Men say the winter was bad that year fuel was scarce and food was dear
A wind with a wolf's head howled about our door
And we burned up the chairs and sat upon the floor
All that was left us was a chair we couldn't break
And the harp with the woman's head nobody would take for song or pity sake
The night before Christmas I cried with the cold
I cried myself to sleep like a two year old
And in the deep night I felt my mother rise
And stare down upon me with love in her eyes
I saw my mother sitting on the one good chair
A light falling on her face from I couldn't tell where
Looking nineteen and not a day older
And the harp with the woman's head leaned against her shoulder
Her thin fingers moving in the thin tall strings
Were weave weave weaving wonderful things
Many bright threads from where I couldn't see
Were running through the harp strings rapidly
And gold threads whistling through my mother's hands
I saw the web grow and the pattern expand
She wove a child's jacket and when it was done
She laid it on the floor and wove another one
She wove a red cloak so regal to see
She's made it for a king's son I said and not for me but I knew it was for me
She wove a pair of bridges and quicker than that
She wove a pair of boots a little cocked hat
She wove a pair of mittens she wove a little blouse
She wove all night in the still cold house
She sang as she worked and the harp strings spoke
But her voice never faltered and the thread never broke
But when I awoke there sat my mother
With the harp against her shoulder looking nineteen and not a day older
A smile about her lips and a light about her head
And her hands in the harp strings frozen dead
And piled up beside her toppling to the skies
Were the clothes of a king's son just my size

[Verse]
I dreamed I walked in a field of flowers
Oh, what a dream
The houses all were silver towers
Oh, what a dream
Beside the road an angel sat
I said hello and tipped my hat
And stopped when I saw her smile
And set me down a while
I set me down a while
You dreamer you
I tried the angel for a kiss
Oh, what a dream
But she turned away and my lips missed
Oh, what a dream
She said, "Sir, I'll have you know
I met you just a while ago
You're welcome for to sit
But calm yourself a bit, sir
Calm yourself a bit
You dreamer you
I fell in love like one, two, three
Oh, what a dream
I asked the angel to marry me
Oh, what a dream
She said, "Sir, I can't marry you
But I'm a dream that can come true
There are dreams of much my worth
That live upon the earth, sir
Live upon the earth
You dreamer you"
Then I awoke and found my love
Oh, what a dream
As heavenly as the one above
Oh, what a dream
We'll marry in a sea of flowers
Home will be a silver tower

[Outro]
There'll be heaven in my life
With an angel for a wife

[x2]
You dreamer you

[x2]

[Verse]
Well it was a time on earth when in the books of heaven
An old account was standing for sins yet unforgiven
My name was at the top and many things below
But I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees) long ago (I settled it all)
Yes the old account was settled long ago (hallelujah)
And the record's clear today because he washed my sins away
And the old account was settled long ago
Well the old account was large and growing  every day
And I was always sinning and I never tried to pray
But when I looked ahead and saw such pain and woe
Well I went unto the keeper and settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees)
Now sinner seek the Lord repent of all your sins
Because this he has commanded if you would enter in
And then if you should live a hundred years below
Well you know you got it settled cause you settled it long ago
Long ago (down on my knees)

[Verse]
The seasons come, the seasons go
We get a little sunshine, rain, and snow
Just the way that it was planned to be
But there's no season in my heart
While I play the leading part
'Cause the flowers will bloom eternally

[Chorus]
Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And, darling, we could be happy after all

[Verse]
As it is in nature's plan
No season get the upper hand
How I try to keep this fact in mind
The trees are bare the cold wind blows
And by experience we should know
Winter comes but the spring is close behind

[Chorus]
Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And, darling, we could be happy after all

[Verse]
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere's else, baby
When I'm out with you
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere's else
When you kiss me like you do

Well, I am as wild as a buck every time you calls me up
You sure makes me feel like a wheel
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere's else
That's exactly how I feel

Oh, I feel better all over more than anywhere's else
When you whisper sweet nothings in my ear
Oh, I feel better all over more than anywhere's else
Any time that you are near

Well, my heart beats double time when you hold your hand in mine
You sure is a wonderful deal
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere's else
That's exactly how I feel
Oh that's exactly how I feel

[Verse 1]
Well, I looked over Jordan, and what did I see?
Coming for to carry me home
There was a band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home

[Chorus]
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

[Verse 2]
I'm sometimes up, and I'm sometimes down
Coming for to carry me home
But but I know my soul is heavenly bound
Coming for to carry me home

[Chorus]
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

[Verse 3]
If you get there before I do
Coming for to carry me home
Tell all my friends that I'm a-coming too
Coming for to carry me home

[Chorus]
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

[Outro]
And now they're coming for to carry me home
Time has passed, I've forgotten
Mother Nature does wonderful things
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you
But time changes everything

You can change the name of an old song
Rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you
But time changes everything

Goodbye, good luck, may God bless you
I don't say I won't love again
I guess that it's true for me and for you
That time changes everything

[Verse 1]
I may say that I don't care, hold my head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through, my heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all

[Chorus]
And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you

[Verse 2]
No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again
Because nothing else means half as much as you
My world just seemed to die the day you left my side
And I can't forget no matter what I do

[Chorus]
And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you

[Verse]
Well now sugar in the morning sugar in the evening sugar at suppertime
Be my little sugar and love me all the time
Honey in the morning honey in the evening honey at suppertime
Be my little honey and love me all the time
Put your arms around me swear by stars above
You'll be mine forever in the heaven of love
Sugar in the morning sugar in the evening sugar at suppertime
Be my little sugar and love me all the time
Now sugar time is anytime that you're near oh you're so dear
Now don't you roam just be my honeycomb and live in a heaven of love

[Outro]
Well sugar in the morning

[Verse 1]
The years have been many, the years have been long
But at last I'm returning to daddy and home
He's looking my way though he hardly can see
God bless my old daddy he recognize me

[Chorus]
There's snow in his hair and I helped to put it there
A halo of worry and care
As my daddy grows old he's more precious than gold
For I cherish the snow in his hair

[Verse 2]
His shoulders were bent with the weight of the years
I scarcely could hold back the flood tide of tears
He walked with a cane as he hurried along
Coming to meet me to welcome me home

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Oh please don't be so careless with your glances
Don't look at me that way and breathe a sigh
Please don't get too close and let me love you
'Cause I just might be fool enough to try

[Chorus]
It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you
But memories from the past I still recall
Please don't get too close and let me love you
'Cause I just might be fool enough to fall

[Chorus]
It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you
But memories from the past I still recall
Please don't get too close and let me love you
'Cause I just might be fool enough to fall

[Verse]
There's a boy across the street lately he's looked very neat
Seems he's always on the run down the street to 301
(Seems he's always on the run down the street to 301)
Saturday he mows the lawn it's about a crack of dawn
Nine o'clock the work's all done down the street to 301
(Nine o'clock the work's all done down the street to 301)
When it's back to school this fall winter's chill may end it all
But for now there's lots of fun with the girl at 301
(But for now there's lots of fun with the girl at 301)
Maybe they will never wed sure they may break up instead
But for now she is the one the girl who lives at 301
(But for now she is the one the girl who lives at 301)
The boy who lives across the street has a reason to be neat
He's in love and on the run with the girl at 301
(He's in love and on the run with the girl at 301)
Don't you tell them to beware of a summer love affair
You know she is only one the girl that live at 301
(You know she is only one the girl that live at 301)

[Verse]
Early one morning while making the rounds
Took a transfusion and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head

Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a transfusion and away I run
Made a good run, but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

Laid in the hot joint, taking the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, "Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty heck that shot your woman down"

Said, "Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant, just read it to me"
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more
When I was arrested, I was dressed in black
Put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried-up carcass in that county jail

Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by 12 honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commenced to look about

In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
Verdict read "in the first degree"
I hollered, "Lordy, Lordy, have mercy on me!"

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the San Quentin pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot my woman down

Come all you gotta listen unto me
Lay off that liquor and let that transfusion be

[Verse 1]
When my hands are tired and my step is slow
Walk beside me and give me the strength to go
Fill my face with Your courage, so defeat won't show
Pick me up when I stumble, so the world won't know

[Chorus]
Lead me Father, with the staff of life
Give me the strength for a song
That the words I sing might more strength bring
To help some poor troubled, weary worker along

[Verse 2]
When my way is light but I still can see
With a strong hand, strike out the blindness in me
Show me work that I should carry on for Thee
Make my way straight and narrow like You wanted to be

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Well, the blue's still in the water and the blue's still in the sky
And way beyond the blue there's someone watching from on high
My clothes may be ragged and my shoes may be worn
But I've been a wealthy boy since I've been born

[Chorus]
Because I call Him when I'm troubled and I call Him when I'm weak
And He always pulls me through my troubles some way and I believe
He'll be there
(He'll be there)
He'll be there
(He'll be there)
Like He always is to answer when I call Him

[Verse 2]
My mother used to tell me I should take it slow
The pace is not what matters, it's the direction that you go
Keep your feet upon the path and your eyes upon the goal
You'll have all the joy a heart could ever hold

[Chorus]
And I call Him when I'm troubled and I call Him when I'm weak
And He always pulls me through my troubles some way and I believe
He'll be there
(He'll be there)
He'll be there
(He'll be there)
Like He always is to answer when I call Him

[Outro]
Like He always is to answer when I call Him

[Verse 1]
A ship came in, but it was empty
And then it sailed back out to sea again
Now there's the sail on the horizon
And now I wait until your ship comes in

[Chorus]
And I'll be waiting in the port of lonely hearts
Watching for your topsail on the sea
Praying that my ship of love will come
To the port of lonely hearts where I will be

[Verse 2]
I'll brave the storm until you're with me
Because wind and rain can't change a love that's true
I'll be alone until you anchor and then
I'll leave this lonely port with you

[Chorus]
Till then I'm waiting in the port of lonely hearts
Watching for your topsail on the sea
Praying that my ship of love will come
To the port of lonely hearts where I will be

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

[Verse 2: Nick Cave]
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry

[Verse 3: Johnny Cash]
Did you ever see a Robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That means he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 4: Johnny Cash & Nick Cave]
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry

[Verse 1]
These things shall pass and some great morning
We'll look back and smile at heartaches we have known
So don't forget when shadows gather
The Lord our God is still the King upon His throne

[Chorus]
A rose looks gray at midnight but the flame is just asleep
And steel is strong because it knew the hammer and white heat
These things shall pass and life be sweeter
When love and faith are strong they cannot long endure

[Verse 2]
These things shall pass so don't you worry
The darkest time is just one hour before dawn
So hold up high and face your troubles
And don't dispare if you must face them all alone

[Chorus]

[Outro]
These things shall pass

[Verse]
Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay there till I'm not able
To see your face in every place that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone
One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink, just one more, and then another

[Verse]
I'll keep drinking, it won't matter
I'll just remember that I once had her
I don't know why I sit and cry every day
I've been trying to forget
But I haven't stopped as yet
One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink, just one more, and then another

[Verse]
Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay there till I'm not able
To see your face in every place that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone
One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink, just one more, and then another

[Verse 1]
Don't be fooled by big blue eyes
By a smile or a golden curl
Because she'll love you now and then break every vow
Because she is just a honky-tonk girl

[Chorus]
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love, she'll give your heart a twirl
Because she is just a honky-tonk girl

[Verse 2]
She can never change your ways
Though you'll give her all the world
She's had more than one or two and each day there's someone new
Because she is just a honky-tonk girl

[Chorus]
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love, she'll give your heart a twirl
Because she is just a honky-tonk girl

[Verse]
I saved a lot of money my fortune was untold
And like a fool I idealized my silver and my gold
My earthly treasure's mounted but when I counted through
I realized the treasure I had overlooked was you
My treasure unmeasured but forsaken of the treasures that come from above
My treasure unmeasured but it don't hold a heart of the one that I love
If I had my life before me if I could see it all
I'd stake my claim on things that are secured against downfall
I'd work for earthly treasures like any man would do
But I set my sights much higher and I'd be sure that I had you
My treasure unmeasured unmeasured

[Verse 1]
Well, God told Noah to build an ark
He said it's going to rain, going to be dark
Call in the animals two by two
And don't let a sinful man go through
So the flood came just like He said
And every evil thing on earth was dead
But Noah's faith was like a rock
God laid his ark on a mountain top

[Chorus]
He'll be a friend and guide you
He'll walk along with you
You'll feel it there inside you
He'll help you make it through

[Verse 2]
When things look dark Noah saw the light
Because faith had told him right was might
If you need a friend He'll guide you
He'll be a friend to you
Well, you've heard of Samson, the strong man
The mightiest man in all the land
There was one purpose for his might
He had to deliver the Israelites
By the Philistines he was overcome
They tied him up to carry him home
But Samson prayed and his bounds were gone
He killed a thousand with an old jawbone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
God showed Samson what to do
And it's the same God that stands by you
If you need a friend He'll guide you
He'll be a friend to you

[Verse]
Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set set me free oh lonesome me
A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
I thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me
I'll bet she's not like me she's out and fancy free
Flirting with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms
Well there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me oh lonesome me

[Outro]
Well I'll bet she's not like me
Oh lonesome me
A burning hot sun, a cry for water
Black wings circle the sky
Stumblin' and fallin', somebody's callin'
You're lost on the desert to die

I had to give up and they took me to jail
But I hid all the money I got
Way out on the desert where no one could get it
And I left a mark at the spot
Then I got away and I ran for the desert
The devil had taken control
I needed water but he said I'd make it
Near the money is a big waterhole

A burning hot sun, a cry for water
Black wings circle the sky
Stumblin' and fallin', somebody's callin'
You're lost on the desert to die

Just up ahead is where I left my mark
Or it may be to the left or the right
I've been running all day and they'll catch up tomorrow
I've got to find it tonight
Then up jumped the devil and ran away laughing
He drank all the waterholes dry
He moved my mark 'til I'm running in circles
And lost on the desert to die
A burning hot sun, a cry for water
Black wings circle the sky
Stumblin' and fallin', somebody's callin'
You're lost on the desert to die

(Lost on the desert to die)
Lost on the desert to die
(Lost on the desert to die)

[Verse]
God will walk with me down the streets where no one else will walk
God will talk with me of things that no one else will talk
When no one else will walk and no one else will talk
When no one will, God will
God will share with me the little worries no one knows are there
God will care for me whenever there is no one else to care
When no one will be there and no one else will share
When no one will, God will
God will think of me when friends forget and fail to understand
God will strengthen me when I am weak and need a helping hand
When no one understands or lends a helping hand
When no one will, God will, when no one will, God will

[Verse 1]
I can see now that you've stacked the cards
So I leave you with my best regards
When you've played the field with nothing left to show
Look for me, you won't have far to go

[Verse 2]
Love's a gamble and I'm a gamblin' man
I've done everything to make you understand
But the odds are high and luck is running low
Look for me, you won't have far to go

[Verse 3]
You won't have far to go if you want me
'Cause I'm gonna stick close to you
And I'm not the kind to say I told you so
Look for me, you won't have far to go

[Verse 3]
You won't have far to go if you want me
'Cause I'm gonna stick close to you
And I'm not the kind to say I told you so
Look for me, you won't have far to go (Far to go)

[Verse]
When I was a little bitty baby my mama would rock me in my cradle
In them old cottonfields back home
When I was a little bitty baby
Now when them cotton bolls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
It was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home

[Outro]
When I was a little bitty baby

[x2]
In them old cottonfields back home in them old cottonfields back home

[Verse 1]
Give, when you give Him the best of your service
Tellin' the world that the savior has come
Be not dismayed if man don't believe you
He'll understand and say, Well done

[Chorus]
Oh, when I come to the end of my journey
Weary of life and the battle is won
Bearing the staff and the cross of redemption
He'll understand and say, Well done

He'll understand and say, Well done

[Verse 2]
Misunderstood the savior of sinners
Died on the cross, He was God's only Son
But He knew well that his Father in Heaven
Would understand and say, Well done

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Delia, oh, Delia Delia all my life
If I hadn't have shot poor
Delia I'd have had her for my wife
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

I went up to Memphis
And I met Delia there found her in her parlor
And I tied to her chair
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

She was low down and trifling
And she was cold and mean
Kind of evil make me want to Grab my sub machine
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

First time I shot her I shot her in the side
Hard to watch her suffer
But with the second shot she died
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
But jailer, oh, jailer Jailer
I can't sleep 'cause all around my bedside
I hear the patter of Delia's feet
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

So if you woman's devilish
You can let her run
Or you can bring her down and do her
Like Delia got done
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

[Verse]
You think you know the smile on her lips the thrill at the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss in each caress and each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You stole her love from me one day you didn't care how you've hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be
You think she's yours to have and to hold
But someday you'll learn when her love grows cold
That I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You stole her love from me

[Intro]
God has my fortune laid away

[Verse 1]
Oh, the world is full of people with money just to burn
Affording all the things in life for which a man might yearn
Some can take life easy but I live from day by day
God has my fortune laid away
(Laid away)

[Chorus]
I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain
The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame
Pockets that stay empty, dreams that go astray
God has my fortune laid away

(God has my fortune laid away laid away, laid away)

[Verse 2]
Oh how often I have wondered why some things have to be
Some people live in riches while some live just like me
The more I try to work and save the more I have to pay
But God has my fortune laid away
(Laid away)

[Chorus]

[Verse]
You were young and needed love and I was wild and free
But every time you said a prayer you said a prayer for me
Why the ring upon your hand we vowed fidelity
There were times when I forgot but you remembered me
(There were times when I forgot but you remembered me)
You remembered only that wedding bells would ring
You remembered only to count the days till spring
You knew only love and honor but I couldn't see
I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me
(I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me)
I believed that promises were made to break apart
But every time I broke a vow I always broke your heart
So here's to you God bless you now wherever you may be
There were times that I forgot but you remembered me
(There were times that I forgot but you remembered me)


You remembered only that wedding bells would ring
I got rid of the shackles that bound me
And the guards that were always around me
There were tears on the mail mother sent me in jail
But I'm free from the chain gang now

Back home I was known and respected
Then one day I was wrongly suspected
So they put me in chains in a cold freezing rain
But I'm free from the chain gang now

All the years I was known by a number
How I kept my mind is a wonder
But like a bird in a tree I got my liberty
And I'm free from the chain gang now

I got rid of the shackles that bound me
And the guards that were always around me
There were tears on the mail mother sent me in jail
But I'm free from the chain gang now

There were tears on the mail mother wrote me in jail
But I'm free from the chain gang now

[Verse 1]
I got shoes, you got shoes, all God's children got shoes

Going to walk all over God's Heaven

I got a harp, you got a harp, all of God's children got a harp
Oh Glory when I get to Heaven going play on my harp

[Chorus]

I got wings, you get wings, all got children got wings
When I get to Heaven going to put on my wings I'm going to fly, fly

[Outro]
Everybody talking about Heaven
Ain't going there Heaven, Heaven
Going to fly all over, going to shout all over
Going play all over, going walk all over God's Heaven

[Verse]
Let me down easy if you must go why not deceive me it won't hurt me so
Truth is so painful tell me a lie let me down easy and I'll get by
Let me down easy for old time's sake
Is it too much to ask when my heart's going to break
I'm bound to lose you I'm bound to cry oh let me down easy and I'll get by
Let me down easy

[Verse]
So you gave up all between us for a glamorous career
And with all your talent you should be the big star of the year
Then you'll be public property so I release my claim to you
Go on and give them all you've got sing it pretty Sue
I can't take just part of you and give the world a half
So smile for all the papers and give them autographs
Go on to all the cities so your public can see you
But I'll watch on television so sing it pretty Sue
I hope you'll soon be on the top of every hit parade
I'll try to be excited about the progress that you've made
I'll collect your pictures like any fan would do
And I'll buy all your records so sing it pretty Sue
But I won't ever tell a soul that we have ever met
I'll just be one of millions who'll give the praise you get
And maybe every year or so I'll drop a card to you
To tell you I'm still listening so sing it pretty Sue

[Intro]
When I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die old enough to die

[Verse 1]
I've met the Master on my knees
I was tested I was tried
I've seen the God of heaven
Paint the fields and country side

[Verse 2]
I've been the husband of one wife
Heard my newborn baby cry
But when I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die old enough to die

[Pre-Chorus]
I've always been a hard working man
No stopping place have I found
But when I'm tired I'm still inspired
At night when I lie down

[Chorus]
I've learned to kinda like this earth
Some time I wonder why
Because when I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die

[Bridge]
Old enough to die
When I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die old enough to die

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Old enough to die

John Henry's Papy woke him up one midnight
He said before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you, listen boy
Said learn to ball a jack, learn to lay a track, learn to pick and shovel too, and take my hammer, it'll do anything you tell it to
John Hery's mammie had about a dozen babies, John Henry's papie told tale about a dozen times
The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money, he said I'll pay you quarter at a time, startin' tomorow, that's the pay for a steel driver on this line
Then the section foreman said hey hammer swinger, I see you brought your own hammer boy, but what else can all those muscles do?
And he said, I can turn a jack, I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too
(can you swing a hammer boy?)
I can I'll do anything you hire me to
Now ain't you something so high and mighty with your muscles, just go ahead pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer
He said get a rusty spike and swing it down three times, I'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to, go on and do what you say you can do
With a steep nose hammer on a four foot switch panel, John Henry raised it back till it touched his heels, then the spike went through the cross tie and it split it half in two, 35 cents a day for driven steel
(sweat sweat boy, sweat, you owe me two more swings)
I was born for driven steel
Well John Henry hammered in the mountain, he'd give a grunt and he'd give groan with every swing, the women folks for miles around, heard him and come down, to watch him make the cold steel ring, Lord what a swinger, just listen to that cold steel ring
But the bad boss come up laughing at John Henry, said you full of vinegar now, but you bout through, were gonna get a steam drill to do your share of drivin, then what's all them muscles gonna do, huh John Henry, gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you
John Henry said I feed four little brothers, and my baby sister's walking on her knees, did the Lord say that machines awtta take the place of living, and what's a subsitute for bread and beans, I ain't seen it, do engines get rewarded for their steam
John Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner now, had thirty minutes to rest before the bell, the mine boss hollered get up whoever you are and get a pick ax, give me enough coal to start another hill, and keep it burning, mine me enough to start another hill
John Henry said to his captain, a man ain't nothin but a man, but if you bring that steam drill round, I'll beat it fair and honest, I'll die with my hammer in my hand, but I'll be laughing, cuz you can't replace a steel driven man
There was a big crowd of people at the mountain, John Henry said to the steam drill how is you, pardon me mister steam drill, I suppose you didn't hear me, I said how you, well can you turn a jack, can you lay a track, can you pick and shovel too, listen this hammer swingers talkin' to you
2000 people hollered go John Henry, then somebody hollered the mountain's caving in, John Henry told the captain, tell the kind folks not to worry, that ain't nothin but my hammer suckin' wind, keeps me breathing, a steel drivers muscle I intend
Captain tell the people move back further, I'm at the finish line and I ain't no drill, she's so far behind you ain't got the brains to quit it, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills, Lord Lordy, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills
Well John Henry had a little woman, I believe the lady's name was Polly Ann, yeah that was his good woman, John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home, he layed down to rest his weary back and early next morining he said come here Polly Ann come here sugar, ya know I believe this is the first time I ever watched the sun come up that I couldn't come up with it
Take my hammer Polly Ann and go to that rail road, swing that hammer like you seen me do it, and when your swinging with the lead men, they'll all know they'll all know your John Henry's woman, but tell them that's not all I can do, tell em I can hoist a jack, and I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too, ain't no machine can, that's been proved to you
There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house, the section hands laid him in the sand, trains go by on the rails John Henry laid, they slow down and take off their hats, the men do, when they come to the palce John Henrys laid, rests on his back, some say mornin steel driver you sure were a hammer swinger, then they go along pickin up speed, clikty clak, clikty clak, down there lies a steel driven man oh Lord, down there lies a steel driven man, down there lies a steel driven man oh Lord, down there lies a steel driven man

[Verse 1]
Brightly beams our Father's mercy from his lighthouse evermore
But to us he gives the keeping of the lights along the shore

[Chorus]
Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save

[Verse 2]
Dark the night of sin has settled loud the angry billows roar
Eager eyes are watching longing for the lights along the shore

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Trim your feeble lamp my brother, some poor sailor tempest tossed
Trying now to make the harbor in the darkness may be lost

[Chorus]

[Verse]
You, take this hammer, take it to the capt
Hey, take this hammer, take it to the capt
Take this hammer, take it to the capt
You can tell him I'm gone, tell him I'm gone
Because I am not going to take no more kicks and whippings
No, I am not going to take no kicks and whipping
I am not going to  take no more, no more this kicks and his whippings
You can tell him I'm gone, gone, gone, you can tell him I'm gone
Captain call me a hard headed devil
Well, the captain call me a hard headed devil
Well, the captain call me, you hard headed devil
And that isn't my name that isn't my name
Well, the Captain got a big gun, about a ninety-nine caliber
Captain got a big gun, about a ninety-nine caliber
Well the captain got a big gun, about a ninety-nine caliber
He is going to shoot me down if he ever catches me, he is going to shoot me down

[Outro]
But you tell him that I went where the great goose goes
Tell him that I'm gone where the great goose goes
Tell him I'm gone where the great goose goes
Tell him I'm gone, tell him I'm gone, just tell him I'm gone
Take this hammer, take it to the capt

[x2]
Take this hammer

[Verse]
Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
Until we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore
If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the river of life
Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separation come no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore
Oh so often we are parted with sorrow
And action often quietens our pain
But we never shall sorrow in heaven
God be with you untill we meet again

[Verse]
Just around the corner there's heartache
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues

I walk and cry while my heartbeat
Keeps time with the drag of my shoes
The sun never shines through this window of mine
It's dark at the Home of the Blues

Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest memories
Memories so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
I just want to give up and lay down and die

So if you just lost your sweetheart
And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me misery loves company
You're welcome at the Home of the Blues
Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest memories
Memories so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
I just want to give up and lay down and die

Just around the corner there's heartache
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues

Yeah, you're gonna find me at the Home of the Blues

[Verse]
Another man done gone
He had a long chain on
They hung him in a tree
They let his children see
When he was hanging dead
The captain turn his head
He's from the county farm
I didn't know his name
Another man done gone

[Verse]
There are those who are taking vacations
To the mountains the lakes and the sea
Where they rest from their cares and their troubles
What a wonderful time that must be
But it seems not my lot to be like them
I must toil through the heat and the cold
Seeking out the lost sheep on a mountain
Bringing wanderers back to the fold
But when I take my vacation in Heaven
What a wonderful time that will be
Hearing concerts by the Heavenly chorus
And the face of my Saviour I'll see

[Chorus]

[x2]
Sitting down on the banks of the river
Beneath the shade of the evergreen tree
There I'll rest from my burdens forever
Won't you take your vacation with me

[Verse]
My bills are all due and the babies need shoes
But I'm Busted
Cotton's gone down to a quarter a pound
And I'm Busted
I got a cow that's gone dry
And a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills
Getting bigger each day
The county's going to haul my belongings away
But I'm Busted
So I called on my brother to ask for a loan
Because I was Busted
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone
But I'm Busted
My brother said, "there's not a thing I can do
My wife and my kids
Are all down with the flu
And I was just thinking about calling on you
Because I'm Busted
Lord, I am not no thief, but a man can go wrong
When he's Busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone
But I'm Busted
Now the fields are all bare
And the cotton won't grow
Me and my family's got to pack up and go
But I'll make a living, just where, I don't know
Because I'm Busted

[Verse]
On your knees you are taller than trees
You can look over heartaches and pain
When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go, growing stronger and taller than trees
One night it was a long time ago now
I knelt at my mother's knee
And she said, Son lift up your eyes to Him in the skies
And you'll grow like the mighty oaks
But you son, created in the image of God
Can become taller even taller than the tallest of trees
And this was the answer I felt
As down at her knees I knelt
On your knees you're taller than trees
You can look over all your heartaches
And son you can look over all of your pains

[Outro]
When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go, growing stronger and taller than trees

[Verse]
Come all you rounders if you want to hear the story about a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the roller's name on a 68 wheeler course he won his fame
Caller called Casey about half past four he kissed his wife at the station door
He climbed in the cabin with his orders in his hand
Said this is the trip to the Promised Land
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin Casey Jones orders in his hand
Casey Jones leaning out the window taking a trip to the Promised Land
Through South Memphis Yards on a fly rain been a falling and the water was high
Everybody knew by the engine's moan that the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
Well Jones said fireman now don't you fret Sam Webb said we are not a giving up yet
We are eight hours late with the southbound mail
We'll be on time or we are leaving the rails
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Dead on the rail was a passenger train blood was a boiling in Casey's brain
Casey said hey now look out ahead jump Sam jump or we'll all be dead
With a hand on a whistle and a hand on a brake north Mississippi was wide awake
I see railroad official said he's a good engineer to be a laying dead
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
Headaches and heartaches and all kinds of pain all the part of a railroad train
Sweat and toil the good and the grand part of the life of a railroad man
Casey Jones climbed in the cabin

[Verse 1]
Well, this nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
For my size, honey for my size
I'm going on the mountain, going to see my baby
And I am not coming back, Lord I am not coming back

[Chorus]
Oh, roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
How can I go when my wheels won't roll
Roll on buddy, pull a load o'coal
How can I go when my wheels won't roll

[Verse 2]
Well, it's a long way to Harlem, it's a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little brew, just to get a little brew
Now when I'm long gone you can make my tombstone
Out of number nine coal, out of number nine coal

[Chorus]
Oh, roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
How can I go when my wheels won't roll
Roll on buddy, pull a load o'coal
How can I go when my wheels won't roll

[Verse]
When I come to the river at the ending of day
When the last winds of sorrow have blown
There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan alone Jesus died all my sins to atone
In the darkness I see he'll be waiting for me I won't have to cross Jordan alone
Often times I'm weary and troubled and sad
When it seems that my friends have all flon
There is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad
I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan
Though the billows of trouble and sorrow may sweep
Christ the Saviour will care for his own
Untill the end of my journey my soul he will keep and I won't have to cross Jordan alone
I won't have to cross Jordan

[Verse 1]
I have sailed the peaceful waters of the ocean deep and blue
I held my breath and watched the western sunsets golden hue
I've flown above the mountain peaks and valleys wide and green
But you're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
You're the nearest thing to heaven yes you are
I have searched for happiness so long and far
But my search for love was through the day that I found you
Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven yes you are
I confess that I've been tempted by alluring magic charms
When the smile was flashed my way and stood before two open arms
But I turned and walked away because I love you like I do
You're the nearest thing to heaven darling you

[Chorus]
You're the nearest thing to heaven

[Verse 2]
I have watched the silver raindrops fall to earth to cool the day
Watched the rainbow at twilight when the clouds had blown away
I love the pretty flowers but they cannot buy the worth
But you're the nearest thing to heaven on this earth

[Chorus]

[Intro]
When he reached down his hand for me

[Verse]
Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and vile as could be
But my Saviour in love gave me peace from above
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down his hand for me when he reached way down for me
I was lost and undone without my God or his son
When he reached down his hand for me
I was near to despair when he came to me there
And he showed me that I could be free
Then he lifted my feet gave me gladness complete

[Outro]
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down

[Verse 1]
I was just a kid roaming around
Traveling through, a little old town
A man walked up and said come with me
You are broke and son that's vagrancy
A carefree lad that love to roam
But Lord I wish I'd stayed at home
The way it looks I'll probably hang
Because there is no hope on a chain gang

[Chorus]
I dig that ditch, I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang

[Verse 2]
The guard stands there with a great big gun
I bet he'd love to see me run
And I guess, I probably will some day
I'd rather be dead than to live this way
He's well fed and he's six foot tall
And he's a meanest of them all
He cracks that whip and he swings that cane
That sun must've touched his brain

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got a gal back home that's sweet and kind
But she's been waiting a long, long time
I just told her to forget my name
I won't ever live down the shame
Lord, deliver me from this hole
Before I lose my mind and soul
The flesh gets weak and the back gets broke
There is no because to laugh and joke

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Hmm the story of a broken heart
Well the sprinftime is coming and the honeybees are humming
And I just saw a robin flying by
While your wedding bells are ringing my poor heart is singing
The story of a broken heart hmm the story of a broken heart
When the trees start to blooding the memories start to flooding
And my heart takes a trip to yesterday
When we walked neath the moon an our love was in bloom
Now we're two lovers drifted apart hmm the story of a broken heart
Now the wedding invitation forced out to your relation
But you ask me to give the pride away
Although I can't show it I think that you'll know it
A story that's told from my heart hmm the story of a broken heart

[Verse]
All around the water tank waiting for a train
A thousand miles away from home sleeping in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman just to give him a line of talk
He said if you've got money I'll see that you don't walk
Well I haven't got a nickel not a penny can I show
He said get off you railroad bum and he slammed the boxcar door

Well he put me off in Texas a place I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me the moon and stars above
Nobody seems to want me nor to lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco heading back to Dixie Land
My pocketbook is empty my heart is willed with pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home just waiting for a train

[Verse 1]
There are some things I may not know
There are some places I can't go
But I am sure of this one thing
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul

[Chorus]
My God is real, real in my soul
My God is real for He has washed and made me whole
His love for me is like pure gold
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul

[Verse 2]
Some folks may doubt, some folks may scorn
Well, they can all go on, just leave me alone
But ask for me, I'll take God's part
My God is real for I can feel Him in my heart

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothing
Pulling case and laying pipe
Is hard labor

[Verse 1]
Well, I was born in a boomer shack
About a half mile from town
Papa was a driller on a wildcat crew
And my mama never was around
I learn to cuss when I was two
And fight when I was three
And by the time I was five there was no kid alive
Could ever get the best of me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well, I started working like a regular man
When I was just about knee high
Skinning the knuckles with my two bare hands
But they never heard me cry
I remember walking down the road
And hearing somebody say
He was born to live a rougneck's life
And he's never going to change his ways

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Verse]
These hands aren't the hands of a gentleman
These hands are calloused and old
These hands raised a family, these hands built a home
Now these hands raised to praise the Lord
These hands won the heart of my loved one
And with hers they were never alone
If these hands filled their task then what more could you ask
For these fingers have worked to the bone
Now don't try to judge me by what you'd like me be
For my life hasn't been a success
Some people have power but still they grieve
While these hands brought me happiness
Now I'm tired and I'm old and I haven't much gold
Maybe things ain't been all that I planned
Lord above hear my plea when it's time to judge me
Take a look at these hard working hands

[Outro]
Take a look at these hard working hands

[Verse 1]
I was born in West Virginia
Where the land is black with coal
For a man to feed his family
It takes twelve hours a day a digging in a dirty black hole

[Chorus]
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
Way down in the bottom of a hole
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
I'm digging and a shoveling and a loading out the dirty black coal

[Verse 2]
Some men give their wives jewelry
Some men give their wives gold
But all I can give to my sweet woman
Are the few dollars I make from digging out the dirty black coal

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I draw script for most of my money
I never see a lot of that
I work all week and go to church on Sunday
Well the preacher going to get what's left when they pass the hat

[Chorus]
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
Way down in the bottom of a hole
Way down in the bottom of a mountain
I'm digging and a shoveling and a loading out the dirty black coal
I'm digging and a shovelin' and a loading out the dirty black coal

[Intro]
Praises sing to Christ the King
And peace to men on earth

[Verse 1]
On Christmas Eve I dreamed I traveled all around the earth
And in my dream I saw and heard the ways the different people
Hail the king whose star shone in the east and what a dream it was

[Verse 2]
In London Town I walked around Piccadilly Circus
A mass of people movin' here and there, I wondered where
On every face at every place was, Hurry up, I'm late
But a kind old man at a chestnut stand said, Merry Christmas mate
And I felt the Christmas spirit

[Verse 3]
In a little town nestled down in Bavaria Germany
I walked along to see what the feeling there would be
And here again was the busy din, the rushing, the yelling
But some kind boy said, Frohliche Weihnachten
Not understanding the words but getting the buying and selling
I felt the Christmas spirit

[Verse 4]
In Bethlehem I heard a hymn, some distant choir sang
And with other tourists I walked along to a Church as its bells rang
Then I heard someone tell someone, There's where Christ was born
I wonder if He looked like our baby looked on that first morn
And then I really felt the Christmas spirit

[Verse 5]
From a businessman in the Holy Land at a sidewalk souvenirshop
I bought a little Bible since I'd already stopped
And it was in Paris France somehow by chance that I took the Bible out
As I flipped the pages I saw these words

[Verse 6]
And I knew what it was all about
For I read, "Fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy
Which shall be to all people
For unto you He was born this day in the City of David, a Saviour
Which is Christ the Lord"

[Verse 7]
Then I took the little Holy Book, held it close and tight
I closed my eyes and visualized the glory of that night
So suddenly it came to me for when I awoke on Christmas Day
I felt the Christmas spirit down deep inside to stay

[Verse 8]
O little town of Bethlehem how still we see Thee lie
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in Thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight

[Chorus]
As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow

[Verse]
The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquois nation
Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line you'll find their reservation
After the US revolution Cornplanter was a chief
He told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief
He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined
George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand
They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land

[Chorus]
As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow

[Verse]
On the Seneca reservation there is much sadness now
Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how
Across the Allegheny River they're throwing up a dam
It will flood the Indian country a proud day for Uncle Sam
It has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin
It will drown the Indians graveyards Cornplanter can you swim
The earth is mother to the Senecas they're trampling sacred ground
Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down

[Chorus]
As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow

[Verse]
The Iroquois Indians used to rule from Canada way south
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way
They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinzua dam is here to stay
Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea
So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy

[Chorus]
As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow

[Verse]
Washington, Adams, and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring
The treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling
It's the back water from Perfidy Lake it's rising all the time
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill
But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow
The father of our country must be wrong what's an Indian anyhow

[Outro]
As long as the moon shall rise 

[Look up]
As long as the rivers flow 

[Are you thirsty?]
As long as the sun will shine 

[My brother, are you warm?]
As long as the grass shall grow

[Verse 1]
I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth goodwill to men
I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along unbroken song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men
And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong that mocks the song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

[Chorus]
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doubt He sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men

[Verse 2]
Until ringing singing on its way
The world revolve from night to day
A voice a chime a chance so blind
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Hoof prints and foot prints, deep ruts the wagons made
The victor and the loser came by here
No head stones, but these bones bring the mascalero death moans
See the smooth black nuggets by the thousands lying here
Petrified, but justified are these apache tears
Dead grass, dry roots, hunger crying in the night
Ghost of broken hearts and laws are here
And who saw the young squaw, they judged by their whiskey law
Tortured till she died of pain and fear
Where the soldiers lay her back, are the black apache tears
The young men, the old men, the guilty and the innocent
Bled red blood and chilled alike with fears
The red men, the white men, no fight ever took this land
So don't raise the dust when you pass here
They're sleeping and in my keeping are these apache tears

[Intro]
I'll have a blue blue Christmas

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll have a blue blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red, on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me

[Chorus]
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when those blue blue heartaches start hurting
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
A blue blue Christmas without you

[Verse]
Jesus our King, kind and good
Was humbly born in a stable of wood
And the lowly beasts around Him stood
Jesus our King, kind and good
I, said the donkey, shaggy and brown
I carried His mother up and down
I carried His mother to Bethlehem town
I, said the donkey, shaggy and brown
I, said the ox, This was my hay
I gave Him my manger, it was here that He lay
I gave Him my manger, it was here that He lay
I, said the ox, This was my hay
I said the sheep with pearly horn
I gave Him my wool for a blanket warm
He wore my coat on Christmas morn
I, said the sheep with pearly horn
I, said the dove, from the rafters high
I sang Him to sleep that He would not cry
We sang Him to sleep, my love and I
I, said the dove, from the rafters high

[Outro]
And so every heart, by some good spell
In the stable dark, was glad to tell
Of the gift that he gave to Emmanuel
Of the gift that he gave to Emmanuel
Now, I will tell you, buster, that I ain't a fan of Custer's
And the General, he don't ride well anymore
To some, he was a hero, but to me, his score was zero
And the General, he don't ride well anymore

Now, Custer done his fighting without too much exciting
And the General, he don't ride well anymore
General Custer come in pumping when the men were out a-hunting
But the General, he don't ride well anymore

With victories he was swimming: he killed children, dogs, and women
But the General, he don't ride well anymore
Crazy Horse sent out the call to Sitting Bull and Gall
And the General, he don't ride well anymore

Now, Custer split his men ― well, he won't do that again
'Cause the General, he don't ride well anymore
Twelve thousand warriors waited, they were unanticipated
And the General, he don't ride well anymore

It's not called an Indian victory but a bloody massacre
And the General, he don't ride well anymore
There might have been more enthusing if us Indians had been losing
But the General, he don't ride well anymore
General George A. Custer, oh, his yellow hair had luster
But the General, he don't ride well anymore
For now the General's silent, he got barbered violent
And the General, he can't ride well anymore
Oh, the General, he don't ride well anymore

[Verse 1]
(Joy to the world, the Lord is come)
Here was a man, a man
Who was born in a small village
The son of a peasant woman
He grew up in another small village
Until he reached the age of thirty
He worked as a carpenter

[Verse 2]
Then for three years
He was a traveling minister
But he never traveled more
Than two hundred miles from
Where he was born and
Where he did go he usually walked

[Verse 4]
He never held political office
He never wrote a book
Never bought a home
Never had a family
He never went to college
And he never set foot inside a big city
Yes, here was a man

[Verse 5]
Though he never did one on the things
Usually associated with greatness
He had no credentials but himself
He had nothing to do with this world
Except through the divine purpose
That brought him to this world

[Verse 6]
While he was still a young man
The tide of popular opinion turned against him
Most of his friends ran away
One of them denied him
One of them betrayed him
And turned him over to his enemies
Then he went through the mockery of a trial

[Verse 7]
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves
And even while he was dying
His executioners gambled
For the only piece of property
That he had in this world
And that was his robe his purple robe

[Verse 8]
When he was dead
He was taken down from the cross
And laid in a borrowed grave
Provided by compassionate friends
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone
And today he's a centerpiece of the human race
Our leader in the column to human destiny

[Verse 9]
I think, I'm well within the mark when I say
That all of the armies that ever marched
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas
All of the legislative bodies that ever sat
And all of the kings that ever reigned
All of them put together have not affected
The life of man on this earth
So powerfully as that one solitary life

[Outro]
Here was a man
(Joy to the world, the Lord is come)

[Verse]
Sequoia's winters were sixteen silent tongue spirit clean
He walked at his father's side
Across the smoking battle ground where red and white men lay all around
So many here had died
The wind had scattered around snow white leaves upon the ground
Not leaves like leaves from trees
Sequoia said what can this be what's the strange thing here I see
From where come leaves like these
Sequoia turned to his father's eyes and he said father you're wise
From where come such snow white leaves
With such strange marks upon these squares
Not even the wise owl could put them there
So strange these snow white leaves
His father shielding his concern resenting the knowledge Sequoia yearned
Crumbled the snow white leaves
He said when I explain then it's done these are talking leaves my son
The white men's talking leaves
The white man takes a berry of black and red
And an eagle's feather from the eagle's bed
And he makes bird track marks
And the marks on the leaves they say carry messages to his brother far away
And his brother knows what's in his heart
They see these marks and they understand the truth in the heart of the far off man
The enemies can't hear them
Said Sequoia's father son they weave bad medicine on these talking leaves
Leave such things to them
Then Sequoia walking lightly followed his father quietly but so amazed was he
If the white man talks on leaves why not the Cherokee
Vanished from his father's face Sequoia went from place to place
But he could not forget
Year after year he worked on and on till finally he cut into stone
The Cherokee alphabet
Sequoia's hair by now was white his eyes began to lose their light
But he taught all who would believe
That the Indian's thoughts could be written down
Just as the white men's there on the ground and he left us these talking leaves

[Intro]
Ira Hayes
Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 1]
Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
Until the white man stole the water rights
And the sparkling water stopped
Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Bridge]
There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

[Verse 2]
And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Bridge]
Ira Hayes returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
Everybody shook his hand

[Verse 3]
But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no home, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance?

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 4]
Then Ira started drinking hard
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!
He died drunk early one morning
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

[Verse 5]
Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died

[Verse 1]
From the Indian reservation to the governmental school
Well they're going to educate me to the white men's Golden Rule
And I'm learning very quickly for I've learned to be ashamed
And I come when they call Billy though I've got an Indian name

[Chorus]
And there are drums beyond the mountain Indian drums that you can't hear
There are drums beyond the mountain and they're getting mighty near

[Verse 2]
And when they think that they'd changed me cut my hair to meet their needs
Will they think I'm white or Indian quarter blood or just half breed
Let me tell you Mr teacher when you say you'll make me right
In five hundred years of fighting, not one Indian turned white

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well you thought that I knew nothing when you brought me here to school
Just another empty Indian just America's first fool
But now I can tell you stories that are burnt and dried and old
But in the shadow of their telling walks the thunder proud and bold

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Long Pine and Sequoia, Handsome Lake and Sitting Bull
There's Magnus Colorado with his sleeves so red and full
Crazy Horse the legend those who bit off Custer's soul
They are dead yet they are living with the great Geronimo

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Well you may teach me this land's history but we taught it to you first
We broke your hearts and bent your journeys: broken treaties left us cursed
Even now you have to cheat us, even though you this us tame
In our losing we found proudness, in your winning you found shame

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
When you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror
I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near
I'd be curious to know if your reflection is as clear
As the one that I've got on my mind, mama, you been on my mind

[Verse 2]
Well perhaps it's the wind and the dark dark night that's covering
The crossroads that I'm at
And maybe it's the weather or something like that
But mama, you been on my mind, mama, you been on my mind

[Verse 3]
Well I don't need trouble, please don't put me down
Don't get upset, I am not pleading, I won't say I'll forget
And I won't pace a floor bowed down and bent but yet
Mama, you been on my mind, mama, you been on my mind

[Verse 4]
Even though my mind is hazy and my thoughts are kinda narrow
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow
It don't matter to me where you'll be waking up tomorrow
But mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind

[Verse]
One day near Christmas when I was just a child
Mama called us together and mama tried to smile
She said you know the cotton crop hadn't been too good this year
There's not a lot of spending money and well at least we're all here
I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat
That'll make things a little more pleasant
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were
At least we were all healthy and most of all we had her
Roy cut down a pine oak tree and we drug it home Jack and me
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed
Mama and daddy sacrificed because this Christmas was kind of lean
After all there was the babies Tom and Joanne
And babies need a few things
I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack
And though we disagreed now and then
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks
And when she ironed them down
You couldn't tell that they hadn't come from town
A sharecropper family across the road didn't have it as good as us
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk
And mama said, Well I bet they don't even have coal oil
Let alone apples and oranges and such
Me and Jack took a jar of coal oil nd some hickernuts we'd found
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set them down
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door
She picked up the coal oil and hickernuts and said
"I sure do thank you" and quickly closed the door
We started back home me and Jack
And about halfway we stopped looked back
And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light
So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night
Christmas came and Christmas went
Christmas that year was heaven sent
And my daddy put on his rubber boots
And paced the floor waiting for the thaw
Back home in Dyess Arkansas

[Intro]
Silent night holy night

[Verse 1]
Silent night holy night all is calm all is bright
Around young virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace

[Chorus]
Silent night holy night all is dark save the light
See the eastern wise men bring gifts and homage to our King
Christ the Saviour is born Jesus the Saviour is born

[Verse 2]
Silent night (holy night) all is calm all is bright
Poorest dreams from heaven afar heavenly host sing hallelujah
Christ the Savious is born Jesus the Saviour is born

[Chorus]
Silent night holy night wonderous dark lend Thy light
With the angels let us sing hallelujah hail the King
Christ the Saviour is born Jesus the Saviour is born

[Verse 1]
I am stunned and I am broken and my head is in my hand
For she who said she love me will not wed an Indian man
My Gods who were wild ridden stand quiet by my side
For although I loved her she would not be my bride

[Chorus]
Oh goodbye softly sweet one it was splendid while it ran
Goodbye, my bitter white girl, I'll forget you if I can

[Verse 2]
She came up to the pueblo with her bright blonde hair
They told me not to love her but I did not care
She took me to her parties, she carried me around
And I was a proud one, the tallest man in town
For I found great wonder all wrapped in brilliant dreams
I held her strong but gentle as kings have held their queens
I learned to drink strong whiskey as she took me here and there
Until life without my whiskey, I could not bear

[Chorus]
Oh goodbye softly sweet one it was splendid while it ran
Goodbye, my bitter white girl, I'll forget you if I can

[Verse 3]
Well when she came to leave me she took me by the arm
And she said she loved me and would not do me harm
But she would not marry not an Indian she said
She thanked me for my offer and I wished that I was dead
Now I'm back among my people and they are kind to me
Although I'm sad with staggers when I drink that tough whiskey
For I've been a white girl's pet, a captive Indian
Shown off and discarded just a drunk who might have been

[Chorus]

[x2]
Oh goodbye softly sweet one it was splendid while it ran
Goodbye, my bitter white girl, I'll forget you if I can

[Verse]
Come, they told me
Our newborn King to see
Our finest gifts we bring
To lay before the King

This is to honor Him
When we come
Baby Jesus, I am a poor boy too
I have no gift to bring
That's fit to give a King

But may I play for You
On my drum?
The Mother Mary nodded
The Ox and Lamb kept time
I played my drum for Him
I played my best for Him

[Outro]
Then He smiled at me
Me and my drum

[Verse]
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
Oh wagon trains rolling along they fade from my visions and in time will be gone
I see an eagle in space my people will follow oh oh a vanishing race
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
An Indian brave rolled along one day on a lonely mountain trail
And he gazed below with a heart of woe where the prairie schooners sail
A vision formed like a mortal storm in the dust of the wagon train
A vanishing race appeared in space and he sang his sad refrain
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
Oh wagon trains rolling along
Oh now great spirits on high please spare them the sorrow you show to my eye oh oh
Now my blankets are roll and I ride to the valley of the brave Navajo oh oh
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
And I ride to the valley of the brave Navajo oh oh
Oh oh a vanishing Navajo oh the vanishing Navajo
Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou

[Verse 1]
The father heard church bells at midnight
A wrong time for church bells to chime
He went to the tower, found a little girl there
Said, Why ring the bells at this time?

[Chorus]
I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm crying but my brother Jim is dying
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim

[Verse 2]
Please father, pray for him this Christmas
He's sick and he's in so much pain
The doctors all say, he'll be gone any day
So, I must ring the bells again

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
On the day after Christmas
She brought him said, Father, heed little Jim
You see, he got well, when he heard the church bells
I was ringing the bells for Jim

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I mushed from Port Barrol through a blizzard of snow
Been out prospecting for two years or so
Pulled into Fairbanks, the city was a boon
So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon
When I walked in the door, the music was clear
Prettiest voice I had heard in two years
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below
It was red headed Luie that was singing so sweet
I reached down and took the snow packs off of my feet
I reached for the gal that was singing the tune
We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon
Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
We did our dance on a Kodiak rug
The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below
Well, I was as innocent as I could be
I didn't know that Luie was big Ed's wife to be
He took out his knife and he gave it a throw
When it's springtime in Alaska, I'll be six feet below

[Verse]
So here is the stable and there is the manger
The new Saviour sleeps on His first earthly night
The wise men brought riches but we brought a candle
It's all that we have but it gives a good light
We are the shepherds we walked cross the mountains
We left our flocks when the new star appeared
Oh, the beautiful singin' of heavenly choir
We had to come see Him, we had to come here
We beg You forgive us for such a small offering
But our sheep are out there with wolves in the night
We bring You this candle it's all we have with us
But with it the new Saviour has His first light
We are the shepherds
We thank Thee kind Joseph for bidding us enter
Please take our gift for the new babe to thine
It's only one candle but it is our symbol
Of how we believe that His great life will shine
We are the shepherds

[Verse 1]
Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're looking for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

[Chorus]
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe

[Verse 2]
Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You say you're looking for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life
And nothing more

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
The shepherds afar left their flocks by night
Followed the new star by its heavenly light
Did the lambs fear the wolves
Did they lay down and sleep

[Chorus]
Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep

[Verse 2]
Did robbers not steal or did they fear the light
That the shepherds had followed night after night
Did they not stray
Did little lambs weep

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Under the new star, the new Saviour lay in his dim manger
He lay on the hay
The shepherds that came had a vigil to keep
But who kept the sheep

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Who kept the sheep
There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
But the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Staring at the wall
Staring at the wall

In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
Namin' their wedding day
Namin' their wedding day

As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
I heard him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm going to be the first
I'm going to be the first

Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Because there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall
If you ever touch that wall
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall
He never made that wall

Well there's never been a man who shook this camp
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide
I know it was suicide

[Verse]
It isn't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter, anyhow
And it isn't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on
Don't think twice, it's all right

It isn't no use in turning on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
And it isn't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right

It isn't no use in calling out my name, girl
Like you never did before
It isn't no use in calling out my name, girl
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
I'm walking down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, girl
So I'll just say fare thee well
I am not saying you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 1]
Oh you wild raging river like my woman's lips you lure me
Pied piper of the desert roll on to the sea
You're the same at noon or midnight and I follow where you go
But you're planning no returning you wild Colorado

[Chorus]
If I had no love of life I'd become part of your flow
But I fear the place you'd take me you wild Colorado

[Verse 2]
Oh you wild raging river from the fountains of the mountains
You ripple down the valleys growing wide and swift and deep
With what powed you cut your canyons how long ago
You're as wayward as my woman you wild Colorado

[Chorus]

[Verse]
On the shores of Gitchgoomy by the shining Big Sea water
Hiawatha old and graying listened to the older prophet listened to Lagu
And the young men and the women from the land of Ojibways
From the land of the Dakotas from the woodlands and the prairies
Stood and listened to the prophet heard lagu tell Hiawatha
I have seen, he said, A water bigger than the Big sea water
Broader than the Gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it
Salty so that none would use it
Hiawatha then spoke to them
Stopped all their jeering and their jesting
And he spoke to all the people
It's true what Lagu tells you for I have seen it in a vision
I have also seen the water to the east to the land of morning
And upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions
Bigger than a grove of pine trees, taller than the tallest tree tops
And upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly
And it carried many people, strange and foreign were these people
And white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered
Then said Hiawatha, I beheld a darker vision
Many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies
In our woodlands rang their axes, in our valleys smoked their cities
Our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils
Left their homelands going westward wild and woeful
And the man with bearded faces, the men with skin so fair
With their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people
Farther westward, westward, westward then wild wild and wilder
Grew the west that once was ours

[Verse]
I'd sing more about moral of this land but all God's children aren't free
I'd open up every door I can because all God's children aren't free
I met a beaten broken man he shovels dirt but got no land
And he held out his hand to me all God's children aren't free
I'd sing along too a silly song but all God's children aren't free
I'm going to sing the blues for the men they done wrong
Because all God's children aren't free
Mister how bout the man you condemn to die
But taking everything that he's living by
And reject him from society all God's children aren't free
No reject him from society all God's children aren't free

[Outro]
I'd be happy walking any street but all God's children aren't free

[x2]
I'd whistle down the road but I wouldn't feel right
I'd hear somebody crying out at night
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all God's children aren't free

[x2]

[Verse]
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses fallin'
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide
But come yet back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so
But if you come, when all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an "ave" there for me
And I will know, though soft you tread above me
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me
And I will rest in peace until you come to me
Amen, amen, amen amen amen

Little baby, in the manger, King Jesus
At the temple, there they found him, teaching the elders
Poor Lazarus, didn't bear it, up a walking

Yeah, amen, amen, amen, amen amen amen

Lord Jesus, up in heaven, who'll be returning
Shout it children, let me hear you, hallelujah
Sing it children, sing amen, amen, one more time

[Verse 1]
Well, my name it is Sam Hall, Sam Hall
Yes, my name it is Sam Hall, it is Sam Hall
My name it is Sam Hall and I hate you, one and all
And I hate you, one and all

Damn your eyes!

[Verse 2]
I killed a man, they said, so they said
I killed a man, they said, so they said
I killed a man, they said and I smashed in his head
And I left him laying dead

Damn his eyes!

[Verse 3]
But swinging, I must go, I must go
A swinging, I must go, I must go
A swinging, I must go while you critters down below
Yell up, "Sam, I told you so!"
Damn your eyes!

[Verse 4]
I saw Molly in the crowd, in the crowd
I saw Molly in the crowd, in the crowd
I saw Molly in the crowd and I hollered, right out loud
Hey there Molly, aren't you proud

Damn your eyes!

[Verse 5]
Then the Sheriff, he came too, he came too
Ah, yeah, the Sheriff, he came too, he came too
The Sheriff, he come too and he said, "Sam, how are you?"
And I said, "Well, Sheriff, how are *you*?

Damn your eyes!"

[Verse 6]
My name is Samuel, Samuel
My name is Samuel, Samuel
My name is Samuel, and I'll see you all in hell!
And I'll see you all in hell!

Damn your eyes!

[Chorus]
We're going west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap
Down the wilderness road
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap

[Verse 1]
There was a time when going way out west meant going to Kaintuck
The dark and bloody ground as Indians called it
Indians wars were ragin' and men like Daniel Boone and Michael Stoner
Came down the wilderness road like countless families did
Through a place in south West Virginia called Big Moccasin Gap
It's a hot day in '73 and this is my wife and my kids with me
Daniel Boone lost his boy the other day young Jim Boone is dead twenty miles away
The wagons turn and went back home even Daniel couldn't make it alone
I guess probably Daniel could but he stopped awhile in castle wood

[Bridge]
If you love your wife and love your baby man
Turn your wagons back as soon as you can
Every Injun in these hills has gone berserk you never gonna make it to Kaintuck
Ah I bet I'm going to make it to Kaintuck

[Chorus]
We're going west to Kaintuck down the road to Moccasin Gap
Down the wilderness road
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap

[Outro]
The Dug Road the old Reedy Creek Road
The Road down Troublesome Road through Moccasin Gap

[Verse]
I discovered the Valley of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
While prospecting in a western state
I saw the silent windmills, the crumbling water tanks
The bones of the cattle picked clean by buzzards
Bleached by the desert sun
I stumbled over a crumbling buck board
Nearly covered by the sand
And stopping to rest I heard a tinkling, whispering sound
And suddenly realized that even though the wind was quiet
The sand did not lie still
I seemed to be surrounded be a mystery
So heavy and apperceive I could scarcely breath
For weeks I wondered aimlessly in the valley
Seeking answers to the many questions that raced through my mind
Where was everyone? Why the white bones? The dry wells?
The barren valley where people must have lived and died
I sat down and buried my face in my hands
And resting I learned the secret of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
How I managed to escape from the valley I don't know
But now to pay my debt for being saved
I must tell you what I learned out on the desert
So many years ago
When the day is oddly quiet
And the breeze seems not to blow
One would think the sun is resting
But you'll find this is not so
It is whispering softly whispering
As it slowly moves along
And for those who stop and listen
It will sing this mournful song
Of sidewinders and the horn toads
On the thorny chaparral
In the sunny days and moonlight lights
The lonely coyotes yell
How the stars seem they can touch you
As you lay and gaze on high
At the heavens where your hoping
You'll be going when you die

[Intro]
(Spoken)
One day in 1881, the Tombstone Epitaph, a booming newspaper in a booming silver mining town, screamed out the headlines about a fight at the O.K. Corral, right down town. The headlines read "Murder in the Streets of Tombstone." Well, that wasn’t such hot news, but more stark and spine-chilling than that was the sight on the boardwalk in front of the epitaph building. Neatly laid out in beautiful caskets were the bodies of Tom McLaury, Frank McLaury, and young Billy Clanton, 28 years old. A witness at the trial later said that he saw Doc Holiday blast away with a nickel-plated pistol and Billy Clanton screamed, “Don’t shoot me! I don‘t want to fight.” Today there’s no more silver mining in Tombstone, but up there on Boot Hill, you can see where the graves of the men are. The ones who fought over or because of that big silver strike that created Tombstone

(Sung)
Here lies Les Moore
Four slugs from a .44
No Les no more

[Verse]
Out in Arizona just south of Tucson
Where tumbleweeds tumble in search of a home
There's a town they call Tombstone where the brave never cry
They live by a sixgun by a sixgun they die
It's been a long time now since the town was a boom
The jailhouse is empty so's the Palace Saloon
Just one look will tell you that this town was real
A secluded old dirt road leads up to Boot Hill
Walk up to the fence there and look at the view
That's where they were hanging eighteen eighty two
It's easy to see where the brave men have died
Rope marks on the oak tree are now petrified
At night when the moon shines so far away
It gets mighty lonesome looking down on their graves
There lies Billy Clanton never wanted to kill
But he's there with the guilty way up on Boot Hill (Boot Hill)

[Chorus 1]
I ride an old paint, I lead an old dan
I'm going to Montana to throw the hoolihan
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw

[Chorus 2]
Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are raring to go

[Verse 1]
Old Bill Jones had a daughter and a son
One went to college, the other went wrong
His wife, she got killed in a poolroom fight
But still he's a-singing from morning  untill night

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
When I die, take my saddle from the wall
Place it on my old pony, lead him out of his stall
Tie my bones to my saddle and turn our faces to the West
And we'll ride the prairie we love the best

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow
For the fiery and snuffy are raring to go

[Verse]
I know a man whose plow handle hand is quicker than a light
Wes Hardin is his name they say he travels in the night
For he might have to kill or walk around a fight
And if you ever saw Wes Hardin draw you know he can skin his gun
He won't say how many tried and died
Up against the top hand up against the wrong man because Hardin wouldn't run
He rode in like a Texas wind took the eastbound train
Going going with Jane Bowen till the law men caught up
So long Janie chin up I'll be back again
Off he went to Huntsville Prison so long Janie he cried
Fifteen years she waited till her heart broke and she died
And she left that bad land to wait up in the sky
Free at last the paying past for all the wrong he did
First free air they let him breathe since he was a kid
So let him come and let him go and let him deal and bid
Near the border in El Paso Lawyer reads the sign
You won't find him there for business every day at nine
For business is real bad one client's all he's had in quite a long long time
Then sheriff Selman's boy broke in to Wes's woman's place
Up she jumped and pistol whipped him kicked him in the face
And John Selman demands revenge for this disgrace
You could see every night by candlelight in Hardin's favorite bar
She'd be hanging on his arm and very late they'd leave there
Headed for the Goose Hair glad it wasn't far
Right through the swinging doors John Selman came with a blazing gun
Wes Hardin chug-a-lugging red eye got him in the back of the head
John Wesley Hardin fell dead because Hardin wouldn't run

[Verse]
Along came the F15 the swiftest on the line
Running o'er the C&O road just twenty minutes behind
Running into Cevile head porters on the line
Receiving their strict orders from a station just behind
Georgie's mother came to him with a bucket on her arm
Saying my darling son be careful how you run
Many a man has lost his life by trying to make lost time
And if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time
Up the road she darted against the rocks she crushed
Upside down the engine turned and Georgie's breast did smash
His head was against the firebox door the flames were rolling high
I'm glad I was born to be an engineer on the C&O road to die
The doctor said to Georgie my darling son be still
Your life may yet be saved if it is God's blessed will
Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free
I want to die for the engine I love one hundred and forty three
The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved
Murdered upon a railroad and laid in a lonesome grave
His face was covered up with blood his eyes you could not see
And the very last words that Georgie said was nearer my God to thee

[Verse 1]
Now don't laugh at the condition the lady's in
She soon could wear a cocktail dress again
But we get along without cocktails, mighty fine
This will be our first and I'm proud the baby is mine

[Chorus]
Yes, I married her although I knew the kind of life she used to live
And because I knew she loved me too, it was easy to forgive
And if you just mind your own business we'd be fine
Don't ever doubt I'm proud the baby is mine

[Verse 2]
She's awkward, yeah, but have you seen her face
Where there once was shame there's a sparkle in it's place
And her conscience is clear that's why her eyes shine
Mister don't ever doubt I'm proud the baby is mine

[Chorus]
As I walked out on the streets of Laredo
As I walked out on Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay
"I can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy"
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
"Come and sit down beside me and hear my sad story
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die"

"It was once in the saddle, I used to go dashing
Once in the saddle, I used to go gay
First to the card-house and then down to Rose's
But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today
Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Six dance-hall maidens to bear up my pall
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin
Roses to deaden the clods as they fall"

"Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong"
"Then go write a letter to my grey-haired mother
And tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone
But please not one word of the man who had killed me
Don't mention his name and his name will pass on"
When this he had spoken, the hot sun was setting
The streets of Laredo grew cold as the clay
We took the young cowboy down to the green valley
And there stands his marker we made to this day

We beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as we carried him along
Down in the green valley, lay the sod over him
He was a young cowboy and he said he'd done wrong

[Verse]
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Me and my brother was down close to the depot when I heard the report of a pistol
My brother run out and come back in all excited
And I said what was it and he said it was the report of a pistol and then he said
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Lord I knew the President was supposed to be at the depot that day
And we just would't believe that he's shot
But we'd run over there and there was so many folks around
That we couldn't see him but some lady was standin' there crying
And I said m'am what was it that happened m'am and she said
Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low
Well everybody drifted off toward home finally
And they looked like they felt about as bad as I did
But in a few weeks I heard that the President was still alive
And I told my brother I said let's get on that train and go to where he's laid up hurt
Well when we got to his big house up there I asked the fellow
I said who was it that did it who was it that shoot the President
And he said it was Charlie Guiteau that shoot Mr. Garfield and I said
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man good man
Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man low
I heard some fellow there that had been in the house to see the President
And I sidled up him to listen to what he was telling and he said
Mrs Lucretia Garfield was always at his side
In the heat of the day fanning him when he was hot
He said that just that day the President said to Mrs Lucretia
He said Crete honey (he called her Crete)
Said if somethin' worse happens to me after awhile you get yourself a good man
And Mrs Lucretia said James (she called him James)
She said I won't hear to that now she said I love you too much but he said
You'll make some good man a good wife good wife
You'll make some man a good good good wife
(Don't pull in single harness all your life good gal
Don't pull in single harness all your life)
That's what he said don't pull in single harness all your life
Well a few days later I come back to where the President was resting
And it seems everybody was crying
The flag was hanging halfway up to the flagpole in front of the house
And everybody looked so sad and I asked a soldier boy there
And I said is is is Mr. Garfield and he said yeah he's gone
Going to lay him in that cold lonesome ground down low
Going to lay him in that cold lonesome ground
Well they laid the President by that long cold branch Mr. Garfield's been laid down low
Mr. Garfield has been shot dow Mr. Garfield's been shot
(Mr. Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr. Garfield been shot down low)

[Intro]
You fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb

[Verse 1]
Saw you a marching with Robert E Lee
You held your head high trying to win the victory
You fought for your folks but you didn't die in vain
Even though you lost they speak highly of your name

[Chorus]
Because you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb

[Verse 2]
I heard your teeth chatter from the cold outside
Saw the bullets open up the wounds in your side
I saw the young boys as they began to fall
You had tears in your eyes cause you couldn't help at all

[Chorus]
Because you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb

[Verse 3]
I saw General Lee raise a sabre in his hand
Heard the cannons roar as you made your last stand
You marched into battle with the Grey and the Red
When the cannon smoke cleared it took days to count the dead

[Chorus]
Because you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb

[Outro]
When Honest Abe heard the news about your fall
The folks thought he'd call a great victory ball
But he asked the band to play the song Dixie
For you Johnny Reb and all that you believed
Because you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb
(Yeah) You fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
You fought all the way Johnny Reb

[Verse]
A cowpoke rode in one hot dusty day to a store down in old San Antone
He stood at the window and I heard him say do I have a letter from home
The postmaster looked through the mail that had come
Then smilingly shook his grey head
The cowboke looked sadly a moment at him and these are the words that he said
No letter from home no letter from home there's never a letter from home
(No message from mother and none from the other) there's never a letter from home
That night he was shot on the wrong side of town no more of those plains will he roam
I reached for my Bible and gave it to him and said son here's your letter from home
If only I had just a little more time to read it the young cowpoke said
I can't take it with me and I must go on then he died with his letter unread

[Outro]
The letter from home the letter from home no time for the letter from home
(The cowboy laid dead with his letter unread) too late for the letter from home

[Spoken: A Cowboy's Prayer]
Lord, I've never lived where churches grow
I loved creation better as it stood
That day you finished it so long ago
And looked upon your work and called it good

I know that others find you in the light
That sifted down through tinted window panes
And yet I seem to feel you near tonight
In this dim, quiet starlight on the plains

I thank you, Lord, that I'm placed so well
That you've made my freedom so complete
That I'm no slave to whistle, clock or bell
Nor weak-eyed prisoner of Waller Street

Just let me live my life as I've begun
And give me work that's open to the sky
Make me a partner of the wind and sun
And I won't ask a life that's soft or high
Let me be easy on the man that's down
Let me be square and generous with all
I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when I'm in town
But never let them say I'm mean or smal

Make me as big and open as the plains
And honest as the horse between my knees
Clean as a wind that blows behind the rains
Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze

Forgive me, Lord, if sometimes I forget
You know about the reasons that are hid
You understand the things that gall or fret
Well, you knew me better than my mother did

Just keep an eye on all that's done or said
And right me sometimes when I turn aside
And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead
That stretched upward toward the great divide

[Chorus]
"Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie"
These words came low and mournfully
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay
On his dying bed at the close of day
"Oh, bury me not..." - and his voice failed there
But we took no heed to his dying prayer
In a shallow grave, just six by three
We buried him there on the lone prairie

[Verse]
Son said my mother when I was knee high
You need of clothes to cover you and not a rag have I
There's nothing in the house to make a boy's britches
Nor shears to cut a cloth with nor thread to take stitches
There's nothing in the house but a leaf end of rye
And the harp with a with the woman's head nobody will by and she began to cry
That was in the early fall and when came the late fall
Son she said the sight of you makes your mother's blood crawl
Little skinny shoulder blades sticking through your clothes
And where you get a jacket from God above knows
It's lucky for me lad your daddy's in the ground
And can't see the way I let his son go around and she made a queer sound
That was in the late fall when the winter came
I'd not a pair of bridges nor a shirt to my name
I couldn't go to school or out of doors to play
And all the other little boys passed our way
Son said my mother come climb into my lap
And I'll chave your little knees while you take a nap
And oh but we were silly for half an hour or more
Me with my long legs dragging on the floor
I rocked rocked rocked to a mother goose rhyme
Oh but we were happy for half an hour's time
But there was I a great boy and what would folks say
To hear my mother singing me to sleep all day in such a daft way
Men say the winter was bad that year fuel was scarce and food was dear
A wind with a wolf's head howled about our door
And we burned up the chairs and sat upon the floor
All that was left us was a chair we couldn't break
And the harp with the woman's head nobody would take for song or pity sake
The night before Christmas I cried with the cold
I cried myself to sleep like a two year old
And in the deep night I felt my mother rise
And stare down upon me with love in her eyes
I saw my mother sitting on the one good chair
A light falling on her face from I couldn't tell where
Looking nineteen and not a day older
And the harp with the woman's head leaned against her shoulder
Her thin fingers moving in the thin tall strings
Were weave weave weaving wonderful things
Many bright threads from where I couldn't see
Were running through the harp strings rapidly
And gold threads whistling through my mother's hands
I saw the web grow and the pattern expand
She wove a child's jacket and when it was done
She laid it on the floor and wove another one
She wove a red cloak so regal to see
She's made it for a king's son I said and not for me but I knew it was for me
She wove a pair of bridges and quicker than that
She wove a pair of boots a little cocked hat
She wove a pair of mittens she wove a little blouse
She wove all night in the still cold house
She sang as she worked and the harp strings spoke
But her voice never faltered and the thread never broke
But when I awoke there sat my mother
With the harp against her shoulder looking nineteen and not a day older
A smile about her lips and a light about her head
And her hands in the harp strings frozen dead
And piled up beside her toppling to the skies
Were the clothes of a king's son just my size

[Verse 1]
Well they're building a gallows outside my cell
And I've got 25 minutes to go
And the whole town's waiting just to hear me yell
I got 24 minutes to go
Well they gave me some beans for my last meal
With 23 minutes to go
But nobody asked me how I feel
I got 22 minutes to go
Well I sent for the Governor and the whole dern bunch
With 21 minutes to go
And I called up the mayor but he's out to lunch
I got 20 more minutes to go
Then the sheriff said boy I'm gonna watch you die
With 19 minutes to go
So I laughed in his face and I spit in his eye
With 18 minutes to go

[Verse 2]
Now here comes the preacher for to save my soul
With 13 minutes to go
And he's talking about burning, but I'm so cold
12 more minutes to go
Now they're testing the trap and it chills my spine
11 more minutes to go
And the trap and the rope aw they work just fine
With 10 more minutes to go
Well I'm waiting on the pardon that'll set me free
With 9 more minutes to go
But this ain't the movies so forget about me
With 8 more minutes to go

[Verse 3]
With my feet on the trap and my head on the noose
5 more minutes to go
Won't somebody come and cut me loose
7 more minutes to go
I can see the mountains I can see the skies
With 3 more minutes to go
And it's too dern pretty for a man that don't want to die
With 2 more minutes to go
I can see the buzzards I can hear the crows
1 more minute to go
And now I'm swinging and here I go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

[Verse]
There's a blizzard coming on and I'm wishing I was home
For my pony's lame and he can't hardly stand
Lord my hands feel like their froze and there's a numb that's in my toes
But it's only seven miles to Maryanne
It's only seven miles to MaryAnne
You can bet we're on her mind for it's nearly suppertime
And I know that there's hot biscuits in the pan
Listen to that norther sigh if we don't get home we'll die
But it's only five more miles to Maryanne
It's only five more miles to MaryAnne
That wind's howling and it seems mighty like a women's scream
And we'd best be moving faster, if we can
Dan, just think about that barn with that hay so soft and warm
It's only three more miles to Maryanne

[x2]
Come on Dan get up, you honory cuss or you'll be the death of us
I'm so weary but I'll help you, if I can
All right, Dan, perhaps it's best we'll just stop a while and rest
For it's still another mile to Maryanne
It's still another mile to MaryAnne

[Outro]
Late that night the storm was gone and they found him there at dawn
He'd made it but he couln't leave old Dan
Yes, they found him on the plains his hands frozen to the reigns
He was just a hundred yards from Maryanne
He was just a hundred yards from MaryAnne

[Verse]
A little girl woke up deep in the dark and started crying
The mother brought a light and held her daughter tight
She thought it was so strange to hear a little girl of nine
Cry call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
Her mother wiped the tears and said see honey you're only dreaming
Your dad must work today he has to draw his pay
She left her then but still could hear her cry time after time
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
Then the countryside was shaken by a mighty rumble
And fear for miles around was the trembling of the ground
The little girl was fast asleep yet cried out one more time
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
Ten thousand tears and two weeks later deep in the smoking ground
A dying man was found had survived all those around
He'd quickly crawled to a fresh air pocket barely just in time
When he heard his own child whine call daddy from the mine
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine

[Intro]
(Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei)

[Verse]
Oh, do you remember sweet Betsy from Pike
She crossed the big mountains with her lover Ike
With two yoke of oxen and a big yellow dog
And a tall Shanghai rooster and one spottled hog
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
They soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out
And down in the sand she lay rolling about
While Ike in great tears looked on in surprise
Saying Betsy get up you'll get sand in your eyes
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
Betsy got up in the great deal of pain
She said she'd go back to Pike County again
But I gave a sigh then he fondly embraced
And he traveled along with his arm round her waist
(How can sweet Betsy went out to the dance
And Ike poor a fellow he's down at his pance)
Betsy was dressed up in ribbons and rings
Said Iken you're an angel but where are your wings
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei
Well, the miner said Betsy will you dance with me
She answeres I will if you want make two free
I can't dance too hard do you want to know why
Because I'm so full of that strong out cooli
Ike and sweet Betsy got married of course
But Ike was so jealous he gotta divorce
And Betsy well satidfied said with a shout
Goodbye forever I'm glad you've backed out

[Outro]
Didli ai di ai didl didli ai di ai dei

[Chorus]
Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
Green grow the lilacs when winter is through
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two
Because springtime is here and its here without you

[Verse 1]
As sure as the bluebirds that fly up above
Springtime is sad without someone to love
Yes springtime is sad and it troubles my mind
In a world full of women, not one girl is mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
They say that its best to forget what we had
Then it is to remember and always be said
But still I keep wondering each now and then
If ever Ill see you and kiss you again

[Chorus]

[Verse]
We made camp along Red River
Watched the cattle as they bedded down
Back at the wagons, right after supper
We spread our bedrolls on the ground
And me and Willie, we took the night guard
And the sage never smelled so sweet
The prairie moon, was blazing silver
No chance tonight for a stampede
Way over yonder, off in the distance
Towards the mountains there in the west
Did I see lightning, did I hear thunder
My mind is weary, I could use some rest
Then all at once, the wind shifts directions
The clouds roll in behind the tumbleweeds
These longhorn cattle, are getting restless
God help us all, if they stampede
Smell the rain, hear the thunder
The midnight sky, turns black as death
The lightning crashes, smell the sulphur
It's rank and strong, it's Satan's breath
The cattle rise up, and go to running
I spur my pony on and take the lead
And across the herd, I can hear Willie yelling
Hey Stampede!
Dust clouds rise, as the rain falls
They mix together, turn the air to mud
I feel the longhorns brush against me
And I can feel the demons racing through my blood
Then all at once, my pony stumbles
We hit the ground, I rise up to my knees
In a flash of light, I can see the cattle coming
Lord I know I'm going to die in this stampede
Then I awake, and I look around me
I'm in my bedroll and I'm laying on the ground
Over there's the wagon, and there's the campfire
I was only dreaming, but what's that sound?
Then I feel the earth tremble underneath me
As the midnight sky begins to bleed
And from the blackness I can hear Willie yelling
Hey Stampede

[Intro]
Listen to the angel's story of the Shifting, Whispering Sands

[Verse]
Yes they always whisper to me
Of the days of long ago
When the settler and the miner
Fought the crafty Navajo
How the cattle roamed the valley
Happy people worked the land
Now everything is covered
By The Shifting, Whispering Sands
A miner left his buck board
Went to work his claim that day
And the burrows broke their halters
When they thought he'd gone to stay
How they found that ancient miner
Lying dead upon the sands
And for months they could but wonder
Did he die by human hands?
So they dug his grave and laid him
On his back and crossed his hands
And his secret still is covered
By the Shifting, Whispering Sands
And his secret is still hidden
By the Shifting, Whispering Sands
This is what they always whisper to me
Out on the quiet desert air
Of the people and the cattle
And that miner lying there
So if you want to learn the secret
Wander through this quiet land
And I'm sure you'll hear the story
Of the Shifting, Whispering Sands

[Outro]
And I'm sure you'll hear the story
Of the Shifting, Whispering Sands

[Verse]
Never in this world before or nevermore hereafter
Could a land know such a people as the pioneer the cowboy
His clothes his conversation his unique brand of lingo
All his devil deeds of daring his hat his bandana the dirty boots and ragged chaps
But mainly that sixgun dangling so's his hand could get it quickly
But draw your own conclusions lean to your own understandings
Your beliefs and your convictions
Disprove any fact recorded in these sounds and songs and legends
But I ask you if you do be sure you've walked in many mocassins
Over many many pathways and that you have listened carefully
Really listened to the west wind and to everything it whispers
And then go back and listen listen to this once more to these legends and traditions
They're only one reflection of a tick of time of that time
Just ponder on the things that happened
As we gaze so very deeply in the time and place and persons
Seeing now and then the West as it really was
And to tell you of a little that we saw there
And looking backward through a century
There was the True West there was the Real True West
Not demanding an argument but rather hoping you looked with us
And saw it as we saw it
And heard that west wind screaming shouting almost speaking
Always whispering of these things we sang and spoke of
And you'll hear perhaps the things the we said in the stories
And the legends and traditions
Through the wind that breeze these tales of the ones who never made it
Yet fighting heat and mountains plains and valleys snow and hunger
They went westward westward westward

[Verse]
He's a rodeo hand a dying breed drifting like a tumble weed
Rolling where the urge tells him to go
And all this cowboy really needs is a tank of gas and entry fees
To get him to the next big rodeo
Now most athletes take alfalfa pills and super B's
A cowboy don't need all that motern stuff
A cowboy's got to be lean and mean he trains on caffine and nicotine
And them all night drives help to make him tough
He's underfed and under paid and too damn hungry to be afraid
Some where between the crazy and insane
Cowboys ain't afraid pf dying shoot he'd even ride a red eyed Lion
If you'd show him where to take the rein
Now the only coach a cowboy needs is a growling gut that says come on let's eat
So tonight cowboy you better make a winning ride
Bout the only thing that makes him go
Is that big gold buckle waiting down the road
And a bad case of too much cowboy pride

[Intro]
Southwind

[Verse 1]
You picked her up in Jacksonville
And left me cold and lonesome in the rain
Southwind
You took her off to Nashville
Left me choking in the smoke behind the train
And you go whoooo-wooo-hoo
She's gone again on the Southwind

[Chorus]
Southwind

[Verse 2]
I need a forty-dollar ticket
And about this time tomorrow I'll be gone
Southwind
But if I had forty dollars
I would buy myself a smile to carry on
And you go whoooo-wooo-hoo
She's gone again on the Southwind

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Take her fast and take her far
Сause that's the way she always likes to go
Southwind
I will be waiting for the round trip
If you'll bring her back and I done told her so
Don't you go whoooo-wooo-hoo
She's gone again on the Southwind

[Chorus]
Everybody loves a nut the whole world loves a weirdo
Brains are in a rut but everybody loves a nut

[Verse 1]
There was a hermit named Fred who kept the dead horse in his cave
And everyone said to Fred
Fred how come you keep a dead horse in your cave and he said well

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
A Columbia man named Frank had a tiger named Hank
He tried to put Hank in his tank guess what happened to Frank
When they picked up the teets there and eyeballs
And erected a tombstone that read
Everybody loves a nut
Another Columbia fellow told queen Isabella
I don't think the world is flat and now what do you think about that
And she said you don't and he said no ma'm
And she said he'd get out of my queendom and he said yes ma'm

[Outro]
Everybody loves a nut

[x2]
There once was a musical troupe
A picking, singing folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They were long on musical ability
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist

This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license
Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered
To hear the folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free-for-all

Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear said, "Oh dear"

Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixing politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions
Keep them to yourself

Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all-night deejay
And the guy in the rear got drafted

[Verse]
Man it sure is good to hear you singing and yodeling and picking again Jack Elliot

[Outro]

[Verse]
Now you've heard of folks with a lot of ambition
But I believe just about the biggest case of ambition I ever saw
Was in a bug that I saw crawling along the beach one day
He was a mighty ambitious bug
On the beach one early morning as a day was newly dawning
And the sun again was warmin all the chill through out the land
I saw me a bug a walking and at first I thought he was quaking
Then I found out he was talking while he crawled across the sand
He was crawling mighty straight at a slow but a steady gait
And when I asked him to wait he said oh come on crawl with me
But I said where you going and he said you'll be knowing
For I'm going to make a showing and you'll someday see
Well I stood there by the ocean I suddenly had the notion
That I start this big promotion so this challenge I enfirled said the bug
So I gave my wife a hug and I left my confy rug
So I could be the only bug that ever crawled around the world
Well he seemed mighty small and it was a long way to crawl
And I'm sure he couldn't swim at all so I try to discourage my friend
I said you know the world is round and there's mighty lot of ground
And there some water to be found before you reach your journey's end
And he said now don't you fret there's problems to be met
But I'll make it you can bet and this deed will bring glory to my name
You know they said man would never fly now he's soarin' in the sky
Because he had the will to try so let me win my fame
So he crawled on out of sight as he sought that splendoured height
Neither looking left nor right but slowly marching toward his goal
And my knowing he had started on his journey as we parted
Kept me from feeling too down hearted for he was a mighty ambitious soul
Well I've looked everywhere I've been and seen a lot of bugs since then
But not one quite like my little friend when I think of him I'm filled with pride
Did he make it I don't know he was crawling mighty slow and he had a long way to go
And all I can tell you folks is that he tried he sure was an ambitious bug

[Intro]
Twinkle twinkle little star who's the greatest star what are (Waylon)

[Verse]
Now Waylon is a singer a record selling star the ladies love him and his band
Oh he sings like a bird and he plays a fine guitar
But I doubt that he's a home loving man
You oughta see his woman she's really a queen he buys her the finest of clothes
For you talk about beauties like none you ain't seen
When Waylon's gone she lets me know
When he's gone a singing I'm gone with his queen spreading his money around
But if you'll look for me and I can't be seen you'll know that Waylon's back in town
When Waylon's gone a singing I'm wearing his suit I smoke his imported cigars
I like his woman wear out his boots I chauffeur his limousine cars
When he's making money he has to stay gone but if you should hear that he's around
Go buy his latest record or go see his show help me keep old Waylon out of town
When Waylon's out singing I'm gone with his queen
Starkle starkle little twink Waylon's the greatest star I think
Bring him to your town join his fan club the journal you get the journal every year
A dollar is about all is costs don't you dare miss it come see Waylon

[Verse 1]
They had a warrant out for me all over the country
And I was trying to beat the raps in Idaho
I was breaking into a schoolhouse Sunday morning without warning
When I saw the sheriff coming for me slow from down below

[Verse 2]
His steel grey eyes were blazing when he saw me
His hand was on his gun when he rode up
He said you killed that woman I know you shot her why'd you do it
I'm taking you to Austin then I'm going to lock you up

[Verse 3]
Well he tied me with a plow line the next morning
And he had me deep in Texas the next day
A crazy screaming lynch mob waited in the streets of Austin
But he put me in the jailhouse and he threw the key away

[Verse 4]
A jury found me guilty three months later
Twelve evil men with murder in their eyes
They even took me out and said now show us where you killed her
And that wicked judge said now I here by sentence you to die

[Verse 5]
But here I am far away from Austin prison
My friend the jailer handed me a file
Now all I want between me and there are a lot of friendly people
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles

[Verse]
Well he's not very handsome to look at
Oh he's shaggy and eats like a hog
And he's always killing my chickens
That dirty old egg-sucking dog
Egg-sucking dog
I'm gonna stomp your head in the ground
If you don't stay out of my hen house
You dirty old egg-sucking hound
Now if he don't stop eating my eggs up
Though I'm not a real bad guy
I'm going to get my rifle and send him
To that great chicken house in the sky
Egg-sucking dog
You're always hanging around
But you'd better stay out of my hen house
You dirty old egg-sucking hound

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Man, I be putting in work

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Still getting checks from niggas albums

Still getting checks from Budweiser

So all three of us are gon' hit the bar
To go holla at the bartender
Yall keep on hating on me
You know I don't give a fuck
Cause when I step up in the building
(Haha I don't gotta say it...)

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Way down the mountain I chased a moonbeam
On the beach I built sand castles too
My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled
All of this was meaningless cause happiness is you

[Chorus]
No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you

[Verse 2]
I tried to doubt you and live without you
Tried to deny but I love you like a do
But I realize now and I'll admit it
You'll always be a part of me because happiness is you

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Well I've been from Boston to LA seen Boulder Dam and Frisco Bay
I seen New York City and Washington
Seen Montreal and Saskatchewan and Rhode Island
And I've worked in three all night service stations and I drove a truck
Take me home my heart is heavy and my feet are sore
Take me home I don't wanna roam no more
Well I slept all night in a water trough
Had the flu and the croup and the whoopin' cough
Had the mumps and the measles and the seven years itch
And I can't count the times that I've had a cold and a sore throat
Not to mention all the times that I cut my fingers on a sardine can
Take me home my heart is heavy
Well I can just see them all now just a gathering around
Mama's supper table when the sun goes down
And my good old pappy when the blessing is said
Filling up his plate with black eyed peas and all that stuff and side meat
And a great big hunk of my dear sweet mama's hot buttered cornbread

[Outro]
Take me home my heart is heavy

[x2]

[Verse]
Well I see you got yourself a brand new harmonica
Mail ordered from the Steagal's catalogue
Boy I hope you can learn to play it like Lonnie Glossom
And while you added you to oughta learn a verse or two
Of Red River Valley Oh My Darling Clementine or Salty Dog
Oh but please don't play Red River Valley
And how about Polly Wolly doodle all day and see
You know the only song I ever learned to play on my 2 dollar and 98 cent harmonica
That I got from Wayne Raney in Clint Texas
C-L-I-N-T Clint Texas was Red River Valley
Then she said farewell to my french harp and me
Well I see you're doing pretty good on your new harmonica
But don't you think you ought to learn about one more tune you know
See you hold it like you's going to eat a handful of popcorn
And sometime you suck in and sometimes you blow
But friend now please don't play Red River Valley
And how about Polly Wolly doodle all day
Like I said the only song I ever learnd
On my 2 dollar and 98 cent harmonica that I got from Clint Texas
From Wayne Raney in Clint Texas was Red River Valley
Oh then she said farewell to my french harp and me

[Verse]
I'm getting swallowed by a Boa Constrictor
By a Boa Constrictor by a Boa Constrictor
I'm getting swallowed by a Boa Constrictor and I don't like snakes one bit
What do you know he's swallowed my toe oh gee he's up to my knee
Oh my he's up to my thigh oh yummy he's up to my tummy
Oh fiddle he's up to my middle oh glum he's mashing my lungs
Now look here snake I don't look good with this long tail on me
It's all about I can say sneak except give me a break sneak
My torso's cold and it's starting to mould Boa Constrictor how much can you hold
Oh yes he's up to my chest oh heck he's up to my neck
Nearly all in he's up to my chin oh dread he's swallowed my...excuse me

[Verse]
Last time we were here at Folsom Prison
They were hanging Joe Bean
Is Joe still here...Joe Bean?
Hang the son of a bitch anyways, right?
Well, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning
For killing a man in Arkansas
Funny thing about it
Joe Bean has never been to Arkansas
On top of that, Joe Bean never heard of the man
In fact, today is Joe Bean's twentieth birthday
See through the prison bars
Joe Bean, see where the gallows stand
Just twenty short years from the day you were born
You died by the hangman's hand
Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning
For a shooting that he never did
He killed 20 men, by the time he was 10, he was an unruly kid
Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean for the one shooting that Joe Bean never did
Well, Joe - your mother is at the Capitol
Asking the governor for a stay
And it's hard on her
Because she knows where you were, on that particular day
You were working Joe Bean, hard working, robbing the Santa Fe
Well, the telegraph wires are humming
Here, the governor's words come through
He said, I can't set you free, it's not up to me, but there's much, Joe Bean, I'll do
I'll join your mother in extending Birthday greetings to you
Happy Birthday, Joe Bean

[Verse]
Well you ask me if I'll forget my baby
I guess I will, someday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll get along
I guess I will, someway
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
God gave me that girl to lean on
Then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man
And have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll miss her kisses
I guess I will, everyday
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if I'll find another
I don't know. I can't say
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way
God gave me that girl to lean on
Then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man
And have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it but I guess things happen that way

[Verse 1]
Just walk on out the door it's all over
Forgiving you is just a waste of time
I don't believe that I'll live to regret it
Because you're ancient history to this heart of mine

[Verse 2]
So many times I've heard the same old story
Any fool can learn to read between the lines
And this time honey you've burned all your bridges
You're ancient history to this heart of mine

[Chorus]
I've marked you down as just another lonely page
In the book of heartaches that you'll leave behind
Because I've found out I'm better off without you
You're ancient history to this heart of mine
I've marked you down as just another lonely page
In the book of heartaches that you'll leave behind
Because I've found out I'm better off without you
You're ancient history to this heart of mine

[Verse 1]
I know that you're wondering who I dream about
And if I've met someone who thrills me so
Well I finally met a girl who turns me inside out
I'll tell you about her for you ought to know

[Chorus]
You comb her hair every morning and make sure she dresses just right
You comb her hair every morning and put her to bed every night

[Verse 2]
When she's around me sometimes I can hardly speak
I stammer and I act just like a fool
And just to hold her hand in mine makes me feel weak
You know her honey don't you know it's you

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
She came from the mountains Rocky Mountains eagle-high
She's from where the mountains lean up to the sky
Now she's back among the Rockies where mountain thunders cry
Now the wind from off the mountains wails a sad goodbye
Once in Colorado Springs at the foot of old Pike's Peak
I met a Rocky Mountain girl to my soul her heart let speak
We went to tell her parents and an old grandmother said
If you'll leave these mountains girl you'll wish that you were dead
The next day I took her with me to my far-off Iowa home
Way out on the flatlands where the mountain winds don't moan
Each footstep we took was happy or at least it shoudn't been
But I would find her listening for that same lone mountain wind

[Chorus]
She came from the mountains

[Verse 2]
Months passed as fast as antelopes until one fatal dismal dawn
I walked to see morning sun shine down on where she was gone
I'd known that lately she'd been sad women sometimes get that way
I hadn't guessed how much was wrong until that fatal day
She had left the weeping letter homesick with mountain names
She was somewhere in the Rockies and I knew I'd been to blame
So now in Colorado Springs I wait near old Pike's Peak
Where once I met a mountain girl that mountain girl I seek

[Chorus]

[Verse]
That's what you get for loving me

[x2]
Everything you have is gone that you can see
That's what you get for loving me
I am not the kind to hang around
With any new love that I found
Moving is my stock and trade
I'm moving on
I won't think of you when I'm gone
So don't you shed a tear for me
I am not the love you thought I'd be
I've got a hundred more like you
So don't be blue
I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through
Now there you go you're crying again

[x2]
But then someday your poor heart is on the mend
I just might pass your way again

[Chorus]

[x2]
That's what you get for loving me

[x2]
Everything you have is gone that you can see
That's what you get for loving me

[x3]

[Verse]
Cursed with sorrow pain and woe full of feeling I can't show
Hopeless love what else for me is this my destiny
At night I toss and wonder why I must live while others die
The grave would be escape for me from this my destiny
I know God surely made for every man somewhere a maid
Someone stole my love from me is this my destiny

[Outro]
At night I toss and wonder why

[Verse 1]
Have you found since you turned me down
The one that you were searching for
Are you glad that you made me sad
For you know I vowed to love you ever more

[Chorus]
What did you have in mind when you broke this heart of mine
Are you laughing in my face
Darling what can I do when you say we're through
You've left a wound time can't erase

[Verse 2]
Tell me now are you satisfied
To be foot loose and fancy free
Is it power you want for the things that you've done
What you've gained I guess I'll never see

[Chorus]

[Verse]
This is the 23rd of April no May, 23rd of May and John and I are
Sitting on the veranda of a hotel that is in Tiberias Israel
It is right on the Sea of Galilee
We can see to our left the place where they held the Sermon On The Mount
And across the lake is now the land of Israel
But up until eleven months ago was held by Syria
On down to the right further down the Jordan River joins the Sea if Galilee
And it's a beautiful day with the birds
You can hear the motor boats on the lake only one that I can see
And then a big pleasure boat that is coming across the other side
From the Sea of Galilee
The lake at this point I'd say is about eight miles wide and it's fourteen miles long

[Outro]
Hmm that's right June Israel is really again in it's glory
This is a beautiful place
It's in much greater glory that she was in the days of King Herod
I'm proud to say for the Jews today King Herod gained the throne like a fox
Ruled like a lion and died like a dog

[Verse]
Happy to be with you happy to be with you
Happy to be with you bound to follow you
Somewhere someone above sents you to me for me to love
Hearts can tremble and shake hearts can shutter and break
I give more than I take cause I'm happy to be with you
Happy to be with you happy to be with you
Good times outweigh the bad count the good ones we've had
We have our ups and downs but the good times come around
Nickels and pennies are few don't have a fortune for you
Love you yes I do and I'm happy to be with you
Happy to be with you happy to be with you

[Verse 1]
From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
She climbs a flowery mountains other the hills and by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome she's known quite well by all
She's a regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball

[Chorus]
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

[Verse 2]
Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
She's from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the courts throughout the land
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball

[Chorus]

[Verse]
The beautiful spacious skies, the amber waves of grain
To the majestic purple mountains above the fruited plain
God did shed His grace from sea to shining sea on you and on me
From Sleepy Hollow mountain country to the swamps of Okefenokee
To Guthrie Oklahoma, to Hibbing Minnesota
To Grants Pass Oregon, to Stone Pipe Wells, California
From Texas to Montana, from California to Maine
In the sunny days the winter snow from Arizona sand
To Cherokee North Carolina, to Tarpen Springs Florida
America, it's time to be refreshed, recalled to memory
God did shed His grace on Thee from sea to shining sea
The land is big the best is free
Sand and surf grass and tree from sea to shining sea
God shed His grace on me
And crown Thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea

[Verse 1]
It took a mighty good man with salty hands
And a mighty long raft to keep the fore before the act
You take ten good men and guts and luck
And you might navigate the whirl and the suck
Well the Tennessee River changed its mind at Chattanooga she oughta unwind
She could a run right on the Georgia Sea but she cut right back through Tennessee
Well the settlers come by raft and boat bringing everything that could stay a float
But like a loco horse that'll twist and buck
They hardly ever made it through the whirl and the suck

[Chorus]
It took a mighty good man

[Verse 2]
When General Washington was in his knicker bocks
The Cherokee Indians through the Chattanooga Rocks
And the Chickamagua tribe and the Nickajack
They kept the watch where the river cut back
And if a raft or a boat ever rode the bend
The Indians got them because they had them hemmed in

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I left the field one evening my fingers so cold and sore
From fair to middling cotton 300 pounds or more
Jim McCann was still picking straddle in the row
The sun began to sinking and the wind began to blow
He was bound to get 400 a dragging a twelve foot sack
I hollered out Jim come weight it but I only saw his back
So I went on home to supper and I gathered around my kin
I was thinking of Jim out there picking with winter setting in
Next morning the air was freezing the snow was nine feet deep
I jerked on my long red handles and I left my kids asleep
I got myself a shovel and went to where I seen Jim go
And commenced to a digging for him at the other end of his row
I found his body frozen and I took him in to thaw
I dragged in his sack and I weighed it and I added Jim's marks that I saw
The total was over 400 so he'd picked more than he'd bet
Of fair to middling cotton but Jim hasn't thawed out yet

[Verse 1]
It's not always the land that's the hardest and bitterest
It's the man who has the hard bitter attitude
Toward his fellow man or toward the land
Such is the case that you will find in this following song
About a man's attitude toward his fellow man and toward this land
I walked in the big yard to feel the warm sunshine
A ninety-nine year man stepped over to me
He offered a smoke and he said as I rolled it
Tomorrow I'm going to break out and go free
They watch us by sunlight they watch us by spotlight
But I know a way for a man to go free
Down under my cell I'm digging a tunnel
The walls of a prison will never hold me
I told him that I'd have no part of his scheming
My time would be over one year from today
His eyes blazed with fire and he looked right through me
Bitter but broken again he did say

[Chorus]
They watch us by sunlight

[Verse 2]
Next morning at breakfast the old man was missing
Then we all heard the rifles high up on the wall
He'd gone through the tunnel just like he had promised
And they said he was crying when they saw him fall

[Chorus]

[Verse]
There was an old stone-cutter who lived in a cabin on the mountain side
And the old stone-cutter knew it won't be long before he died
And all around his cabin were statues the man had made
Statues that the buyers said were all of a mediocre grade
With his calloused hands he lit a lamp and laid down his head on his handmade table
And he softly whispered Lord I'm old and shaky and I'm hardly able
But give me strenght and wisdom and give me a week at least
And I'll climb up to the top of this mountain and chisel out a masterpiece
The very next morning he felt new strenght
And he took his brand new hammer and the sharpest chisel
He began to climb the mountain his old feet slipping in the freezing dizzle
When he finally reached the top he shouted to a world that didn't hear
I'll carve my masterpiece out of this marble boulder here
So the hammer beat the chisel and he hammered until an image grew
Then he stopped to look it over to appraise his work when he was through
It was a boy carrying a crippled boy and the old man said it isn't my masterpiece
I'll call it charity and then a masterpiece of mine will be
So the hammer beat the chisel until another image in a marbel grew
Then the wind began to blowing and he sat and rested when he was through
It was the image of a mother holding her child
He said this is love as the world would know
But it isn't my masterpiece and he began again as it began to snow
The hammer beat the chisel as the snow fell harder and the wind grew and grew
He fell to his knees holding a stone and he threw down his hammer and his chisel too
He lay frozen face down in the snow but one hand was held for the world to see
Cut in the marble was his masterpice three neatly carved letters GOD

[Verse]
Like a sweet rippling mountain stream
Goes the sound of the banjo on Cripple Creek
Never beginning never ending just rippling on and on
So does the land just ripple on and on
As a heart gets soft on a woman so can the heart get soft on the land
And to fall in love with a woman as well as the land is to surely be in love
I stayed away too long I know and every day was slow to go
Every night I dreamed I was here it's been a mighty lonely year
Every mile I needed you I kinda hope that you needed me too
Everywhere I saw your face around every town I was in
This old familiar place welcomed me again
Back to where I belonged to be back to you and Tennessee
Back to you and Tennessee
Beside the Cumberland River where the grass is soft and sweet
We ran across the fields of cedar hiding from the noisy streets
And when the leaves fell from the cold the stars were silver the moon was gold
I said it's yours with love from me
I'm planting my roots in this ground and when they look for me I'll be found
With something that is part of me you and Tennessee
Back with you and Tennessee

[Verse 1]
Do they ask you where I am or where I've been
Do they ever say where is the lonely friend
Is my name whispered in your bedside prayers
Do you feel a vacant spot beside you there

[Verse 2]
Well there's always one more path that I must walk
And there's people I should sit down with and talk
And somebody might appreciate the flowers I could bring
So there's always another song to sing

[Verse 3]
Do you tell them I was wilder than the wind
Do you remember that I needed lots of friends
And at other times I'd rather be alone
Where I could not be found when I was gone

[Verse 4]
Well there's always one more canyon to explore
To touch the things left by those gone before
At the top of the tiniest hill I can feel like I'm a king
And there's always another song to sing

[Verse]
While traveling this land from border to border and from sea to sea
There have a few occasions to leave the beaten path and to find the place
And quiet that's good for thought and just walking through a trackless forest
Or exploring ruins of the earliest settlers or walking along a creek bed
Hoping to find a relic such as a tomahawk an axe
Or even an arrowhead left by a race of long since vanished Indians
There's a great thrill and it's a wonderful feeling to find a flint arrowhead
Over fields of new turned sod and in communion with my God I walked alone
In a furrow bed I found an arrowhead chiseled from stone
I don't know how long ago some redman drew his bow on its last fight
Or did he drop it here afraid white men were near to attack at night
I do know this one thing beyond all questioning it was made to kill
And proof of a master trade is in this arrowhead he made fashioned with skill
That I inherited this ground is denied by this stone I've found but when and by who
Come join me in my tracks then let's stop and look back to the vale and through
In love and peace we'll see the shadows and the trees and voices too
But quietly slowly tread this home of the forgotten dead whose bones are dust
I'm proud that their craftsmen's skill survives the ages still left in my trust

[Verse 1]
Turn on the speak it's the first time I get
To talk on the speak because you know okay
Darn those smart alec, crazy cajon boy
Come in to my nice clean kitchens
And get into my pantry, get my blackberry jim jam
That I'd pick blackberries
And make a jim jam in the winter time
To take out on the shrimping boat
And bring in a folding wads
Of wondrous waddy for my little wienies
And they come in to my blackberry jim jam
In the pantry and get them all over
The nice clean kitchen table cloth
The smart alec cajon boy will play the music

[Chorus]
Well, the Gulf it got a grassy bottom setting where the rock is there
And that's where I've been going for the shrimping sailing
Leaping across the grassy moss bringing in a briny bin

[Bridge]
Making folds of wondrous waddy for the living that I'm loving
Where they creep and crawl and flip and flap and flob and dangle dobbing
Sponge a fouler drag them holler more a course the ocean horse

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Of soddy bodies dressed in dandy eating carmel candy
Makin' me and all by babies folding wads of wondrous waddy
For the living that I'm loving in between the shrimping sailing

[Chorus]
Gulf, it got a grassy bottom setting where the rock is there
Leaping across the grassy moss bringing in a briny bin
Making folds of wondrous waddy for the living that I'm loving
Where they creep and crawl and flip and flap and flob and dangle dobbing

[Verse 3]
Sponge a fouler drag them holler more a course the ocean horse
Till it's time to haul them come back in with the briny bin
Of soddy bodies dressed in dandy carmel candy eating chicken
Finger licking, dancing, rancing, mancing, tancing
Making me and all by babies foldin' wads of wondrous waddy

[Verse 1]
There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
But the strangest of em' all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Staring at the wall

[x2]
In his hand was a note that his gal had wrote
Proving crime don't pay
Was the very same gal he robbed and stole for
Wanting their wedding day

[x2]
As he looked at the wall
So strong and tall
I heard him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climed that wall
But I'm going to be the first
I'm going to be the first
Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Because there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall

[x2]
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall
He never made that wall

[Outro]
Well there's never been a man who shook this camp
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide
I know it was suicide

[Intro]
Oh no, no, no, no, no, oh baby

[Chorus]
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right

[Verse 1]
Keep it on a cutie girl cause I'm really into you, yeah
Tell me, is there a way that i can spend some time with you?
So much I wanna know about you
Seems like I can't do without you
You really turn me on, you got it going on

[Pre-Chorus]
Anything you ask, I'll do for you
So baby, don't you see you mean the world to me?
Just one thing I have to know
Baby, can I make it right?

[Chorus]
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right

[Verse 2]
As I'm looking into your eyes, all I see is your lovely face
And there's nothing I like more than to show you I adore
The simple things that you do to me with the sweet little things you say
Baby, when I kiss your lips, it really brightens up my day

[Pre-Chorus]
Anything you ask, I'll do for you
So baby, don't you see you mean the world to me?
Just one thing I have to know
Baby, can I make it right?

[Chorus]
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right

[Bridge]
So baby, don't you see you mean the world to me?
If you just swing my way
I'll make it right
So tell me, where do we go from here?
I'll make it right
There's nowhere that we can go, but take it nice and slow
Baby enjoy the flow
Lots of pleasures I can give, I've got it waiting here
So put away your fears

[Chorus]
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right

[Outro]
So much I wanna know about you
Seem like I can't live without you
So much I wanna know about you
Seem like I can't live without you (I'll make it right)
So much I wanna know about you
Seem like I can't live without you
So much I wanna know about you
Seem like I can't live without you (I'll make it right)
So much...

[Verse 1: Usher]
Every time I look at you
There's so many things that I want to do
I promise you when I'm ready
That I'll spend my life with you
What is love, is it steady?
'Cause I don't know what to do
So tell me, girl, are you ready
To do what we came to do?

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
One day we could be together
Cause you know that I wanna be down, baby
But right now, we can all forget it
You know I gots to get around
I don't have much money (don't have no money)
I can't buy a diamond ring (can't buy a diamond thing)
I ain't trying to be funny (funny)
It's only a sexual thing (only a sexual thing)

[Chorus: Usher]
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring

[Verse 2: Usher]
Please forgive me
'Cause I don't ever want to rush you
I might sound a little hasty
But let's do what we came to do
You know our time is really precious
And you wasted a lot of mine
I'm gonna have to keep on moving
If you can't make up your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
One day we could be together
Cause you know that I wanna be down, baby
But right now, we can all forget it
You know I gots to get around
I don't have much money (don't have none)
I can't buy a diamond ring (and a diamond ring)
I ain't trying to be funny (no)
It's only a sexual thing

[Chorus: Usher]
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring

[Bridge: DeVante Swing & Usher]

Yeah, check me out
Yo, watch this

(Can you get with it
With it)

[Chorus: Usher]

[Verse 1]
I heard on the radio there's rumors of war
People getting ready for battle
And there may be just one more
I heard about an earthquake
And the toll it took away
These are the signs of the times we're in today

[Chorus]
Matthew twenty-four is knocking at the door
And there can't be too much more to come to pass
Matthew twenty-four is knocking at the door
And a day or one more could be the last

[Verse 2]
A great bear from the norther land has risen from his sleep
And the Army ranks in red are near two hundred million deep
The young and old now prophesy a coming
Prince of Peace
And last night I dreamed of lightning in the east

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby

[Verse 1]
I feel so strange thinking about you
After all the wrong you've done to me
I can't go on feeling like I do
'Cause my heart loves you, I'm so confused

[Chorus]
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby

[Verse 2]
Don't waste my time
Cause someone like me you'll never find
I thought we had a good thing
But I was wrong and now I must move on

[Bridge]
To another love, one that I can trust
With my heart, I know she'll never run away
Just can't talk no more, so I'm out the door
Talk to me, why you wanna play love games?

[Chorus]
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more

Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby

To another love, one that I can trust
With my heart, I know she'll never run away
Just can't talk no more, so I'm out the door
Talk to me, why you wanna play love games?

All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby
All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby

[Intro]
Oh baby, my lady
You like what you're hearing, baby?
What's going on?
I've seen you around my way a couple times
You must have just moved around the way, right?
I see all the fellows have been pressing you for your number
I'd like to get to know you, so um...
Maybe we can spend some time and just talk on the phone or something

[Chorus]
I can think of many ways to say "I love you"
And with those many ways, there comes a time
For me to say I'll put no girl before you
So pretty lady, make up your mind

[Verse 1]
Girl, you look surprised, I've got conversation
'Cause you ain't checking for the kids I swing with, no
Girl, can't we please get past impressions?
'Cause what I feel for you, I swear is legit
Your girls tell you watch him, he's an entertainer
They say I'll hurt you and break your heart
They don't know, well, well, just what I'm feeling
From the first time I saw you, I loved you from the very start

[Chorus]
I can think of many ways to say "I love you"
And with those many ways, there comes a time
For me to say I'll put no girl before you
So pretty lady, make up your mind

[Verse 2]
I saw you 'round my way and I had to meet you
But I've got to let you know I'm just somebody
Who wants to care for you with lots of love and patience
So please understand why I'm taking my time
I'm falling deeper and deeper and deeper, yeah, baby
And I'm so glad we had this conversation
Because girl, when it comes to you, there's no confusion
And I can't get it in your head and I'm having a fit

[Chorus]

And with those many ways, there comes a time

Sweet lady (sweet, sweet lady)
The thought of no you cuts just like a knife
Cuts like a knife

[Bridge 2]
Girl, I've learned my lesson
No, we can't let others in
Misery loves some company
They don't see it's from within
It's you for me and me for you
But first we must be friends
I'll keep my love coming and coming and coming
Girl, we can win

That's where you'll find me night and day
A place where we can get away
No one to stop us when we play

Even get down on my knees
Just as long as you believe
Be with me and you'll succeed

[Intro]
Baby, tonight
If you come home, I'll make it right, oh no
Love was here and gone

[Verse 1]
I ask myself
Now, why have I been dreaming
To bring imaginary, real to life
I've done some searching and praying
That you would always be stayinf
And I would learn
Learn to treat you right, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you ask yourself
"Does he really love me?" (Yes I do)
"Will I be true
Throughout the time?" (Ask yourself)
"Do I know how to take good care of you?"
The answer that I truly love you
Will pop right in your mind

[Chorus]
Love was here, but now you're gone
Baby, please, please come home
Love was here, but now you're gone
Baby, please, just come back home
Come on home, come on home

[Verse 2]
If I've given you a reason, let me know
To make your leave, it must have been that I don't show
You love the way you need, so girl, I can't complain
Let's try to work it out, my heart's truly ashamed

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you ask yourself
"Does he really love me?" (Yes I do)
"Will I be true
Throughout the time?" (Ask yourself)
"Do I know how to take good care of you?"
The answer that I truly love you

Baby, please, please come home
Love was here, but now you're gone
Baby, please, just come back home

Girl, just come on home
This time I'll do you right
Let's ignore the fuss and fight
Just come back home
Trying to bring us back girl, so don't you ever leave
I used to love you (but you're gone)
I wanna hold you (so come back home)
I wanna be with you (you and I alone)
So baby, please
I used to love you (but you're gone)
I wanna hold you (please come back home)
I wanna be with you (I wanna be with you, too)

Love was here, but now you're gone

[Intro]
If my heart could speak, you'd know
My heart could speak, baby

[Verse 1]
If I could, I'd tell you (I would tell you how)
I feel, girl, when I'm close to you
At times, I'd wish that my (heart could tell you how)
Much I love you, but my heart speaks in whispers

[Chorus]
If my heart could speak, you'd know
Girl, if my heart could speak, you'd know
That I love you so

Sends signals to each other in whispers

That I love you so

[Bridge]
(I would tell you how I felt)
If i could find the words to describe (the way I feel when you are near)
Whenever you are by my side
What I feel inside is deep
And I just don't know what to say (because my words get in the way)
Every time I try to say

[Chorus]
If my heart could speak, you'd know
Girl, if my heart could speak, you'd know
That I love you so

I'll never let you go
(Never let you go
Oh, never let you go
Never let you go, baby, baby...)

[Chorus]
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you

[Verse 1]
It's not the way that I feel
'Cause I'm really in love with you
You stole my heart, then you ran away
What am I to say? I love you anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
My love for you will never change
My love for you will never change
'Cause I still feel the same way
The love I have for you will never grow old
I will always be there for you

[Chorus]
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you

My life has changed because of you
And I need you right here with me
There's no substitute for you
Far as I can see, you're the one for me

My love for you will never change
My love for you will never change
'Cause I still feel the same way
The love I have for you will never grow old
I will always be there for you

You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through

You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you

[Bridge]
I don't know why you left me all alone
I'm thinking about you, baby
Every night and day, thinking of you by my side
Here with me is where you ought to be
Every night and day, thinking of you by my side
Here with me is where you ought to be

[Chorus]
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away

[Chorus 1]
Smile again
Just smile again
I'll always be there for you
What can I do to make you smile again?
Just smile again

[Verse 1]
I'd like to know what's on your mind
Because I see you crying all the time
I don't understand
Who'd wanna hurt your heart like this
And cause you so much pain
Here's my shoulder
You can lean on me
I wanna see you happy

[Chorus 2]
I want to see you happy
Why not just let me make you smile again?
Just smile again
I'll always be there for you
What can I do to make you smile again?
Just smile again

[Verse 2]
Just wanna see you smile
How can I ease the pain you feel?
What can I do to take the tears away?
Baby, talk to me
You say he's hurt you many times
But now that's over, let me take his place
Your problems, I'll erase
You need someone that you can depend on
To brighten up every day
I am the one
That you've been searching for
And all you have to do is
Smile again

[Chorus 3]
Let me be the one
Let me be the one to make you smile
Just smile again
Just smile again
Let me be the one
Let me be the one to make you smile
Just smile again
Just smile again
Let me love you
I can show you
Just what it means to me
Please smile for me
Let me love you (let me be the one)
I can show you (let me be the one to make you smile)
Just what it means to me (smile again)
Please smile for me (just smile again)
Let me be the one
Let me be the one to make you smile
Just smile again
Just smile again
Let me love you
I can show you
Just what it means to me
Please smile for me
Let me be the one
Let me be the one to make you smile
Just smile again
Just smile again

[Outro]
I wanna see you happy

[Chorus]
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye

[Verse 1]
Is there a reason why our love could not last?
I ask, was it too strong for you to hold on, pretty lady?
I thought we had a master plan
But it takes a stronger man to walk away
Than to watch our love fade away

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I often wonder how and why
I did not cheat, I did not lie
I hope you know how hard I tried
But it's over for now, it's time to say goodbye

[Chorus]
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
I can't believe how suddenly things change
Yesterday, we were in love but all I feel were heartaches and pain
Day and night, I tried deep inside to work things out
But in my heart, I knew I still had my doubts

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I thought we made a symphony
It's over now, no more harmony
I prayed so hard for love to fly
It's time to say goodbye

[Chorus]
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye

[Bridge]
Sorry I gotta leave
Baby, I'm begging, please

[Chorus]
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye

[Outro]

[Chorus]
Beautiful words beautiful words He spoke beautiful words
The wind lay still and the whole world listened as He spoke beautiful words

[Verse]
Blessed are the poor in spirit for their is the Kingdom of Heaven
Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled
Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy
Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the Children of God
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake
For their is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile ye
And persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for My sake

[Verse 1]
Niggas on the inside wishin' for the outside

Playing with Gucci Mane is just like playing with a lighter
Playing games with Gucci Mane is just like touching fire
Got tattoos on my face my neck my arm but I'm not a biker
Got a 4-5-8 Ferrari, bitch i got the title
I'm from East Atlanta Georgia man that shit just like The Wire
You say you from Zone 6 but my nigga you know you lyin'
I'm a lover and a fighter and a motherfuckin striker
These lames keep comin' around me and they know that I don't like it
If I spit dead in this nigga face do you think that I tried him?
If I tell this bitch she ain't my girl then what the fuck is she crying
You would think I'm at the grocery store with the collard greens I'm buying
You would kno that i'm the plug cause of all these niggas i'm supplying
'Wop!

[Hook]

[Verse]
We are in the Holy Land
The ground upon which I stand is sacred to the Jew the Christian Moslem Islam
To millions of people the world over and has been throughout the ages
This is the promised land
The land that God showed to Moses from a top Mount Nebo
Which we can see in the distance
At this place in Galilee the sound of God's voice has been heard
As He spoke to the prophets
Once man heard God's voice when He said of his son Jesus Christ
This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased
Such a blessing to be able to hear the voice of God has been given to very few
But such a blessing was given to the Land of Israel

[Verse]
From the top of Sinai
To the Sea of Galilee
Every hill and plain is home
Every place is dear to me
There the breezes tell the stories
Oh, what stories they do tell
Of the mighty things that happened
In the Land of Israel
Here, where Moses and the prophets
Spoke of One who would be king
Of a Heavenly Messiah
And the blessings He would bring
Oh, to hear the call again
All is peaceful, all is well
Upon every rock and mountain
In the land of Israel

[Verse]
We are in Nazareth within a few feet of this place Jesus lived as a child
With his father Joseph the carpenter and his mother Mary
In Jerusalem the mother of Jesus watched her son die on the cross
She stood by to give him the only thing that she had left a mother's love
It was my mother who first told me of Israel stories of this land
That made it so dear to me that I am draw like a prodigal son to relive these stories
Here's a two thousand year old story that tells of the strength of a mother's love
Once a young man lived with his mother beside a great forest
The young man was in love with a beautiful girl who lived in the forest
He told the girl in the forest that if she would marry him
He would bring her anything that she asked
Knowing that the young man lived with his mother the girl said
Take your dagger and cut out your mother's heart
And bring it to me and I will marry you
Well this made the young man very sad
But he wanted to merry the girl so he killed his mother and cut out her heart
Running through the forest with his mother's heart in his hands
He stumbled and fell and dropped the heart
As he was getting up his mother's heart cried out from the ground
My son did you hurt yourself when you fell

[Verse]
The noises you hear in the background are the different little shops
Here in the market place in Nazareth
There's a man beating out some pans with a hammer there
You know looking at Nazareth especially in this part of Nazareth
You'd be inclined to feel like Nathaniel did when he said to Phillip in the Bible
Can there be any good thing ever come from Nazareth
And John the Babtist preaching repentance down on the Jordan River
Which we'll be seeing later on today
Said there's one coming after me the latchet of whose shoes
I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose
And the prophets had said referring to this place right here
He shall be called a Nazarene

[Verse 1]
Caesar ruled Rome and all its glory
Every land called Alexander Great
But no man can compare in any story
With the one man who controls so many's fate

[Chorus]
Yes along the dusty road came the Nazarene
Baptized by John was the Nazarene
Preaching on the top of the mountain was the Nazarene
Followed by the multitude was the Nazarene
Tried and condemned they laid their stripes on Him
But like He said back from the dead came the Nazarene

[Verse 2]
Nothing good had ever come from Nazareth
An unimportant place in Galilee
But the soul of any man could fall into bondage
And God had promised man could be set free

[Chorus]
And then along the dusty road came the Nazarene
Baptized by John was the Nazarene
Preaching on the top of the mountain was the Nazarene
Followed by the multitude was the Nazarene
Tried and condemned they laid their stripes on Him
But like He said back from the dead came the Nazarene

[Verse]
We are in the Town of Cana
It is a short distance from Nazareth toward the Sea of Galilee
And on his way to Capernaum Jesus stopped at a wedding feast
Here which he was invited to
And when he came to the feast he was told that the family was so poor
That they didn't have wine for the wedding feast
So Christ at this very spot that we are entering right now
On which a church stands over
Jesus ordered the jugs filled with water
And then when they were served at the feast
When the jugs were poured around to the different people
It was wine of the finest wine that was known in Galilee at that time
We are entering now down into a kind of a crypt-like place underneath the church
Where the miracle actually took place
And there is one of the jugs here
That supposedly was one of those he used to pour the wine from that had been water
And the well that the water was drawn from
We are at the place where the water cintern was
It is all undeground as most people lived back then under ground because it was cool
This is where the water came from
He turned the water into wine

[Verse]
We are now up on top of Mount Tabor
And Jacob you're our guide so how about telling us in your own words
Just what happened at this place
I hope the wind is not making too much noise we are at a great height up here
Here we are this is Mount Tabor
We are standing on the highest of the lower Galilee mountains watching around us
A most magnificent view really one can except to see
This of course is the Mountain of Trans-Figuration
Where Christ with his three elder disciples climbed up the mountain
And that is when at the same time they all spoke saying
Master Master can we have three tents made here
The place is so beautiful we want to stay
And at that same moment they saw Christ was conversing
With Moses and Delijah the prophet
A cloud came from which the voice of the Lord was heard saying
This is my son my chosen son Thou shalt obey
They watched to the face of Christ at that time
And saw that there was light around it
He was transfigured His tunic became as white as snow
So it's called the Mountain of Trans-Figuration
This is where it happened

[Outro]
Thank you very much Jacob and you know there was another time that Moses
That you were talking about Moses climbed the mountain

[Verse]
Moses led God's children out to find the promised land
And on the way he'd stop each day and look to Heaven and
Asked God for help as he could not withstand the task alone
And then one day he looked away and thereby lay a stone
God said write upon this stone these words I say to you
And if you all obey my rules I'll see you safely through
God opened Heaven's door and then He guided Moses hands
And then He said go and tell my children these are my commands
Go and climb that mountain Moses climb that mountain now and pray
Climb that mountain now and tell us what our Lord has had to say
Thou shalt have no Gods before me is my great command
And thou shalt not make any graven image by thy hand
Thou shalt not take my name in vain if thou would guiltless be
Remember thou to keep the sabbath day alone for me
Honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not commit adultt try and thou shalt not steal
Love thy neighbor as thyself and show thy neighbor peace
Covet not thy neighbor's house nor anything that's his
Go and climb that mountain
Moses showed these words of God to all the children then
They pulled up stakes and headed out to find the promised land
That Moses had described to them and told of comforts there
The children of oppression thought they'd not find anywhere
But they were soon to part from him and push alone awhile
For it was never meant for him to walk that final mile
The children cried if we must go on Moses without you
Then talk to God just one more time and tell us what to do
Go and climb that mountain
Thou shalt have no Gods before me

[Verse]
We're approaching the Wailing Wall now
Which is all that remains of the ancient temple the holiest place of the Jews
Jews of all sects all tribes from all over the world are coming to the Wailing Wall
You can hear some of the faithful
Praying in the background here before the Wailing Wall

[Intro]
Oh my Lord what a morning oh my Lord what a day
The sound of battle's over and the smoke has blown away

[Verse]
Come to the Wailing Wall come to the Wailing Wall
Thank God you can stand up on this Holy Land
And touch the hallowed rock that God delivered to our hand
Come to the Wailing Wall come to the Wailing Wall
Shout it cross the mountain shout it cross the sea
We have been delivered Israel is free

[Chorus]
Come to the Wailing Wall

[Bridge]
Bring the lost ones homeward lead them to this shore
The city gates are open heaven's blessing over

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Now we are in the city of Bethlehem
At the door of the Church of the Nativity where Christ was born
The gate has been walled up then enters into the church because of the horsemen
That used to come attack the place and sack the church
It's been walled up to where there's just a very narrow opening of about
Three and a half feet where you enter into the Church of Nativity
So now we enter into the place where Christ was born
This is the place where Christ was born to the world over it's a mighty big place
Actually physically it's a small cave underneath the Church of the Nativity
Many other people are here today to see this place
Before me is the actual spot where Christ was born undisputed to the ages
This place was found and confirmed that it was the place of the Nativity
By St Helene mother of Constantine the Emperor of Rome
In the third and the fourth century
Just a few feet away from this place where Christ was born
Where there is a Star of Bethlehem in the manger
Where he was taken wrapped in swaddling clothes
Meaning loose-fitting clothes laid in the manger
Where he was come and visited at this very spot by the three Wisemen from the east
One of the holiest of holy places
In the Christian tradition the Holy Family retreated here
During the massacre of the holy innocence ordered by King Herod
And just as we left the Church of the Nativity a few minutes ago
We saw another cave where so many of the children
That King Herod had killed under two years old were buried

[Verse 1]
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses

[Chorus]
And he walks with me

[x2]
And he tells me I am His own

[Verse 2]
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me

[Chorus]
Within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me

[x2]

[Verse 3]
And he tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
I'd stay in the garden with Him
Though the night around me be falling
But He bids me go; through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling

[Outro]
And He walks with me

[x2]
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

[Verse]
They wouldn't bend
They held on to the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knees to Idols made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the Fourth Man in the fire
They wouldn't bend
They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn
Now the prophet Daniel tells about
Three men who walked with God
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
Before the wicked king they stood
And the king commanded them bound and thrown
Into the fiery furnace that day
But the fire was so hot that the men were slain
That forced them on their way
Now when the three were cast in and the king rose up
To witness this awful fate
He began to tremble at what he saw
In astonished tones he spake
Did we not cast three men bound
Into the midst of the fire
Well, Lo, I see four men unhurt
Unbound and walking down there

[Outro]
There's Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
And the fiery coals they trod
But the form of the Fourth Man that I see
Is like the Son of God

[Chorus]
Wanted man in California
Wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in Kansas City
Wanted man in Ohio
Wanted man in Mississippi
Wanted man in old Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man

[Verse]
I might be in Colorado
Or Georgia by the sea
Working for some man who may not know at all who I might be
If you ever see me coming and if you know who I am
Don't you breathe it to nobody because you know I'm on the lamb
Wanted man by Lucy Watson
Wanted man by Jeannie Brown
Wanted man by Nellie Johnson
Wanted man in this next town
I've had all that I wanted of a lot of things I've had
And a lot more than I needed of some things that turned out bad
I got sidetracked in El Paso
Stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way in Juarez with Juanita on my lap
Went to sleep in Shreveport
Woke up in Abilene
Wondering why I'm wanted at some town half way in between
Wanted man in Albuquerque
Wanted man in Syracuse
Wanted man in Tallahassee
Wanted man in Baton Rouge
There's somebody set to grab me
Anywhere that I might be
And wherever you might look tonight
You might get a glimpse of me

[Chorus]

[Intro 1: Eastbound & Down (Kenny Powers)]
The only thing I'm seein' I'd like to put an amend on, perhaps a little more room here for the fixins, you know what I'm talkin' about? Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins. We gonna have so many fuckin' fixins up in this motherfucker, this shit gon' go through the roof. Got damn I'm shittin' gold these days

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Nigga we made it, ayy

Nigga we made it, ayy

Nigga we made it, ayy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, she said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office
In 2007, I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!" (Go off)
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin' (Go off)
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
I'ma just hand her a business card and say "Nigga we made it!"
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"

[Interlude: Kenny Powers]
Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down. Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Ayy, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it, ayy
Nigga we made it, ayy
We made it

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, if they with me, just know that they wit' it and 'bout it
If I said it, I meant it, there's no way around it
OVO, Reps Up, and P. Reign is next up, watch Gway go crazy
When Baka came home for the holidays, I was like "Nigga we made it!"
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it (Go off)
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience (Go off)
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it
I would just look at you dead in yo' face and say "Nigga we made it!"
I swear that we made it, selloff that ting, I'm the king in Jamaica
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell ya, I don't need no favors (Go off)
(Damn, Soulja Boy stunt on them haters)
And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!
You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'
I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with
That's ignorant, ain't it? Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like "Nigga we made it!"

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Ayy, we made it
Nigga we made it, ayy
Damn, we made it

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
I remember standing in the hood
Tellin' my partner, and my momma, everything gonna be all good
Nigga we made it! Damn, I'm up in Las Vegas
Damn, I never was supposed to have shit, now my life is lavish
Every night, fuckin' a bad bitch, nigga we made it!
Coppin' a Lambo, cash, the Bentley, two times I crashed
Ha, nigga we made it!
Look at them niggas' faces, them niggas, they hate it
I look a nigga in his face and say "Nigga we made it!"
Soulja Boy stunt on them haters
And these days I don't need no favors, ayy
Nigga we made it!

[Outro: Soulja Boy]
You already know man
Phone call back to the old hood, see what's goin' on
Brrt brrt, nigga we made it

[Verse]
We are on the Via Dolorosa the way of the Cross having just left the Praetorium
Where Pilate said to Christ I washed my hands off the matter
And turned him over to the people and told them to do what they would with him
There's no traffic here the streets's very narrow
Little children playing along the street the street's about ten feet wide
You see the third station of the Cross
Where Christ almost fell under the weight of the Cross
He's kneeling and the fourth station of the Cross over there
Over forty or fifty feet farther toward Calvary
Where His mother came up to Him and said my Son what's happened
And she sees Him kneeling under the heavy weight of the Cross too
Continuing on now toward Calvary from the fourth station of the Cross
We left the Praetorium where Christ was sentenced and where he was turned over
To the Jewish people and they were offered Barabbas and they said
No give us Christ we'll crucify him
Following along the stations of the Cross passing station No 5
And they say at this point that Simon a Cyrenean coming out of the country
On him they laid the Cross they made him bear it for Jesus
And they continued on the way of the Cross as we are now
Leaving place No 5 toward Calvary it's a long long way from here
You can see standing here between station No 5 and No 6
Two hundred yards at least up the steps toward Calvary's hill
All along it's a very narrow street ten or twelve feet wide
Shops on each side little children playing old men and women
Carrying their bread dressed in their long robes
Just as they did two thousand years ago
The music here in the background is a radio playing (is that an Arab station)
Still continuing up the way of the Cross toward Calvary
The voices you hear in the background are pilgrims from all over the world
All along the Via Dolorosa here there are beggars (I suppose mostly Arab beggars)
Passing station No 10 continuing on to Calvary they are all along the way
They say that they are all blind
They say that the reason there are so many blind along
This part of the country is because of the dust
Everywhere the wind is blowing and the dust is flying
And of course there are germs in the dust that diseases their eyes
And the dust itself puts them out
On the way to Calvary we pass another beggar sitting along the way
All kinds of shops pilgrims continuing on the same way we're going
Now closer to Calvary the way really gets crowded
It's still the same very narrow street though

[Verse]
Approaching the shrine now where the Cross was where Christ was crucified
Also the place of the Holy Sepulchre where Christ was buried
Entering into the actual church now which is covered not only the tomb
Where Christ was buried but also the place where he was crucified
There is a very interesting story about this place of Golgotha
They say that when Christ was crucified and His blood came down the cross
And incidentally we are climbing the steps right now
Going up to the place where He was crucified
When He was crucified and His blood ran down the Cross
It ran into the ground and His blood touched the skull of Adam
The very first man ever on earth created by God Adam
And that just for an instant the skull of Adam came to life
From the blood of Christ touching it

[Verse]
And now here we stand in the approximate spot where the Cross stood
In this very spot supposedly on this very spot is
Where Christ was nailed to the Cross Laying flat on the ground
I don't think at this time that it really
After what I've seen today and what is just before me now
That it makes a lot of difference whether or not
This was exactly the very spot where Christ was crucified
And I feel proud in that I am able in my lifetime to come and stand
If not in the exact spot within a few feet or a few yards
At least of where it all happened
Where our Christianity began the most holiest of holy spots for the Christians
Now I would like myself to kneel before this place here underneath the table
Where the Cross was supposed to have stood
If it's definitely not the place it's near the place
After Christ was crucified He lay upon the Cross dying
After He was dead Roman soldiers cast lots for His clothes
There was a Roman soldier Marcellus
Who won this purple robe of Christ in a dice game
And legend has it story has it that Marcellus was affected very strongly by this robe
And the effects of having seen the Crucifixion he almost lost his mind
And everywhere he would go for months and years after that he was like a mad man
He would go to this one and that one stand there and say were you out there
Were you there were you there when they crucified Him

[Verse]
When Jesus called to God upon the cross
No answer came for his will must be done
Then how the word trembled at his voice
When he said this is my beloved son
It isn't God but man that's dead
When love is locked outside
Do you deny that there's a God or is God just denied
God is not dead he never died
What man on earth can make one blade of grass
And who can make one seed then make it grow
With all the power and wisdom in our hands
Who can command which way the wind to blow

[Outro]
And who can match the miracle in an eagle's eye
Or hang a rainbow in a cloudy sky
God is not dead he did not die
God is not dead God is not dead

[Verse]
Hand me my guitar there's a song that I was singing
Back when I was young and I had a good time
Looking for love in the misty waters of the seas that roll in a young girl's mind
Only in shadows and lonely at night she turns to you softly you turn on the light
You use her abuse her and you know it isn’t right to treat one who loves you so badly When she's doing the best that she can you know she's doing the best that she can Do you believe in dreams do you believe in dreamers
Hoping that you'll find what you're looking for
You don't have to worry cause there's a bright tomorrow
In the dreams that roll in a young girl's mind
Only in shadows,So hand me my guitar
Of the seas that roll in a young girl's mind
"What's that? Hey, what are you guys drinking in those tall, purple glasses? What is that rotgut stuff? Tea? Hey, a little bit later on in the show, I'm gonna do you a brand new song I wrote yesterday called "San Quentin."

[Applause]

"I'd like to ask my wife, June Carter to come back. Come here, June! I wonder, could we get Carl Perkins back out to help us with this tune too? June and I have been singing this song, our version of a John Sebastian song, "Darlin' Companion."

Darling companion, come on and give me understanding
And let me be your champion, a hand to hold your pretty hand in
Darling companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned
Love will always light our landing, I can depend on you

Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed
Oh, a little bridling down from you is what I need
Darling companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned
Love will always light our landing, I can depend on you

Darling companion, come on and give me understanding
As long as we keep laughing, bear in mind just what could happen
Darling companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm going to stick by you
Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed
Oh, a little bridling down from you is what I need
Darling companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned
Love will always light our landing : I can depend on you

Darling companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gong to stick by you
"Let me get this microphone down here, near my guitar. (Laughs) Let it all hang out! I thought my guitar was out of tune there at first. Sorry son of... It is out of tune. Is that right? Terry, is that right? Well, you tune the son of a bitch."

(Laughter, applause)

"We got all kinds of songs, here's one called "A Boy Named Sue." You wanna hear that one? You wanna hear "A Boy Named Sue?" I do too. I'm anxious to hear it. I don't know how the hell it's going to sound! I'm anxious to hear it. Does that block your camera view there, is that all right? Can I leave it there? I'm gonna put it there, then. Where the hell is my guitar? Oh, here it is..."

"Sorry to say that Luther passed away seven months ago, after being with us thirteen years, Luther Perkins. And the fella who's playing the guitar with us now is doing a wonderful job, but of course, nobody can really replace Luther. How about one big cheer for Luther Perkins?"

(applause)

"Hey, I had a song called "San Quentin that I was gonna do. Where's my - hey, in my kit back there where I got all my dope-I mean, where I got all my things - (laughter). There's a little red notebook back there, would one of the guards bring it to me? Bring me the red notebook and I will... Hey, that briefcase back there of mine, that's got all the songs I stole in it? Tellin' it like it is, ain't I?"

"Wrote a song yesterday. I tried, it takes a lot of imagination sometimes to write a song and put something into it where somebody else can understand it and feel it. We've been in several prisons; San Quentin, Folsom Prison and the Starkville, Mississippi jail, the El Paso jail, and... You wouldn't believe it, one night I got in the Starkville, Mississippi jail for picking flowers. I was walking down the street, I may sing that one for you a little bit later on, I was walking down the street - what? Excuse me, I couldn't hear you, I was talking. I was walking down the street and, you know, going to get me some cigarettes or something, about 2:00 in the morning after a show, I think it was. Anyway, I reached down to pick up a dandelion here and a daisy here, and this car pulls up, said "get it the hell in here, boy, what are you doing?" I said, "I'm just picking flowers." Well, $36 for picking flowers and a night in jail. God damn, you can't hardly win, can you? Damn! No telling what they'd do if you pull an apple or something."

(applause)

"Well, I'd like to do this song for all of you guys at San Quentin to kind of get back at whoever you want to out there. In my case, I'd like to get back at the fella down in Starkville, Mississippi who still has my $36."

Well, I left my motel room down at the Starkville Motel
The town had gone to sleep and I was feeling fairly well
I strolled along the sidewalk 'neath the sweet magnolia trees
I was whistling, picking flowers, swaying in the southern breeze
I found myself surrounded, one policeman said, "That's him
Come along, wild flower child, don't you know that it's two AM
They're bound to get you 'cause they got a curfew
And you go to the Starkville City jail

Well, they threw me in the car and started driving into town
I said: "What the hell did I do?" He said: "Shut up and sit down"
Well, they emptied out my pockets, took my pills and guitar picks
I said: "Wait, my name is..." "Awe shut up." Well, I sure was in a fix

The sergeant put me in a cell, then he went home for the night
I said: "Come back here, you so and so; I ain't being treated right
Well, they're bound to get you 'cause they got a curfew
And you go to the Starkville City Jail

I started pacing back and forth, and now and then I'd yell
And kick my forty dollar shoes against the steel floor of my cell
I'd walk awhile and kick awhile, and all night nobody came
Then I sadly remembered that they didn't even take my name

At 8 a.m. they let me out. I said: "Gimme them things of mine!
They gave me a sneer and a guitar pick, and a yellow dandelion
They're bound to get you 'cause they got a curfew
And you go to the Starkville City Jail

Go to the Starkville City Jail

[Verse 1]
Oh well, I'm tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes

[Chorus]
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me

[Verse 2]
Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes

[Chorus]
(Verse)

Too many bad bitches, couldn’t fit em in my Bentley

A lot of girls want me, theres so many
You wanna talk to me nigga then talk with me
New school so clean, had to untint it
You roll your blunts too skinny but that's yo' business

(Hook)
Last night I had a ball, they were too many
Couldn’t fuck em all, they were so many
Gucci down the draws, it was so many
Got a ball for my dawg, gave him too many
I’m tryna spend it all, nigga no limit
And they say it’s no business like show business
Yea I’m swimming in the money, yea I flow in it
It’s a whole lot of sharks, brought my gun in it
(Verse)
Did a feature with a nigga last week, got a bird out it
Left, banged my rims on the curb, but I ain’t worried bout it
Niggas say the squad getting money, I ain’t heard bout it
Country nigga remix, yea I took 1/3 out it
Gucci Mane swag fuckin nervous, bitch she curious
She skip 3rd period, I fuck her on her period
Tried to the girl to suck my dick, she wasn’t hittin it
Asked her, "do you wanna make a flick?", she wasn’t interested
Asked her do yo man got a car that ain’t limited?
6 car garage, yea the cars, yea they immigrant
This chick got this bitch spyin on me a 

[?]
I’m intrigued, got a rich dick to share with a lot of bitches
Ferrari Spyder itchin down the street like a caterpillar
Too many gas bags, duffle bag like we body builders
He got tattoo, tears, but that boy is not a killer
Not a killer, not a dealer, call that boy not a nigga

(Hook x2)
Last night I had a ball, they were too many
Couldn’t fuck em all, they were so many
Gucci down the draws, it was so many
Got a ball for my dawg, gave him too many
I’m tryna spend it all, nigga no limit
And they say it’s no business like show business
Yea I’m swimming in the money, yea I flow in it
It’s a whole lot of sharks, brought my gun in it

[Verse 1]
And a hundred and eighty were challenged by Travis to die
By the line that he drew with his sword when the battle was nigh
Any man that would fight to the death crossed over
But him that would live, better fly
And over the line went a hundred and seventy nine

[Chorus]
Hey Santa Anna, we're killing your soldiers below!
That men, wherever they go will remember the Alamo

[Verse 2]
Bowie lay dying, but his powder was ready and dry
Flat on his back, Bowie killed him a few in reply
And young David Crockett was singing and laughing
With gallantry fears in his eyes
For God and for freedom, a man more than willing to die

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And then they sent a young scout from the battlements, bloody and loud
With the words of farewell from a garrison valiant and proud
Grieve not little darling, my dying, if Texas is sovereign and free
We'll never surrender and ever with liberty be

[Chorus]
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, Big River
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called

Then you took me to St. Louis later on down the river
A freighter said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you, Big River, more than me

[Break]
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, Big River
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die
"I have to sit down for - okay, we'll do that for you, just a minute, thank you. This young man here at San Quentin tonight that wrote a song that I just saw written down on paper the first time yesterday. He sent me the sheet music on it, and I don't know anybody who reads music, except maybe Helen. And I liked the lyrics so much I started singing my own tune to it, you know, the first thing that came to my mind. Let's try a little bit of it, right here..."

I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound
Whistle's calling me away, leaving at the break of day
And I don't know where I'm bound

Can't stand locks, bars or doors
Mean cops, insanity, and wars
Gotta find a place of peace
Until then, my traveling won't cease
But I don't know where I'm bound

There's got to be a place for me
Under some green growing tree
Clear cool water running by
An unfettered view of the sky
But I don't know where I'm bound

When I die, don't bury me
'Cause then I must be free
Cremate my body with a grin
Throw my ashes to the wind
'Cause I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound
Whistle's calling me away, leaving at the break of day
And I don't know where I'm bound

Got myself a little gal
She has been a downright pal
That old highway's calling me
And free I got to be
But I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound
I don't know where I'm bound

[Verse]
He turned the water into wine he turned the water into wine
In the little Cana town the word went all around that he turned the water into wine
Well he walked upon the Sea of Galilee he walked upon the Sea of Galilee
Shouted far and wide he calmed the raging tide and walked upon the Sea of Galilee
He turned the water into wine
He healed the leper and the lame he healed the leper and the lame
He said go and tell no man but they shouted it through the land
That he healed the leper and the lame
He turned the water into wine
He fed the hungry multitude yes he fed the hungry multitude
With a little bit of fish and bread they said everyone was fed
He fed the hungry multitude
He turned the water into wine

[June Carter Cash]
I hear the train a coming, it's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
Lord, I'm stuck in Folsom prison and time keeps dragging on
And that train keeps a rolling on down to San Antone

"Let's give her a big hand, June Carter! Helen, Anita, Mother Maybelle, the Carter Family!

[The Carter Family]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind
Because you're mine, I walk the line

"Hey alright! Now, the Tennessee Three: Marshall Grant, Bob Wootton, W.S. Holland!"

"The Statler Brothers!

[The Statler Brothers]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
"Yeah Carl Perkins!"

[Carl Perkins]
Well, when I was a baby my mama told me "Son
That I want you to be a good boy, I don't want you to play with guns."
But I shot a man in Reno, I shot him just to watch him die, Lord yeah
Now that train keeps a rolling, I hang my head down and cry

[Johnny Cash]
Johnny Yuma was the rebel, he roamed through the west
Yeah Johnny Yuma the rebel, he wandered alone
He got fightin' mad, this rebel lad
He packed no star and he wandered far where the only law was a hook and a draw
The rebel Johnny Yuma

"I want to thank you for being so good to us. I like to say a special hello to all the men here at the prison that're not with us tonight If they couldn't find the key to the door or something. They couldn't let the bunch of them out here. I wish everyone of you could've be out here with us. All you guys I understand their pipe and the show in for you. Cell somewhere. That supposed... listening... maybe. Is that closed circuit television that you have in here, is it? No. Anyway hello to all you fellers that can't see the show tonight. We wish you could all been here. We've had a ball, have we not?"

Well if they'd freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

[Verse]
I've walked though every town
Saw fortunes lost and found
And when your trail failed i walked holes
In both my soles
But i don't expect you back
You're somewhere making tracks
I crossed the burning bridges
And walked through miles of sand
Met the lawless and the law
But you beat all i ever saw
I dreamed a million miles
About your eyes and smiles
I tried to love the best
And to turn from all the rest
But i'd scan the skies for you
And i only saw your hue
They drew away your mould
You were made of frozen gold
And your heart would never thaw
You beat all i ever saw

[Verse]
Out on a shrimp boat I just dropped the net
When the wind she come to blowing whizzing bad all to get
I look south east and golly me what I see
A black thundercloud with them fuzzy eyebrows
Come a looking  direct towards boudleaux and me
I turned to boudleaux and me I said
Put the sugar to bed put the sugar to bed
Lock up the coffee in the coffee pot
Put the flour in your pillow because it's all we got
Hang the lantern from the ceiling and watch your head
Ho boudleaux put the sugar to bed boudleaux put the sugar to bed
Well the sky she get dark and then she turn dark black
I yell she going to blow one right out of the almanac
A big raindrop smacked me right on the ear
And I hollered hey boudleaux but the way the wind blow
He just as soon be deaf there wasn't no how to hear
I try to call to boudleaux but slid instead
Then me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed
Well the ends of that shrimping boat was switching around
She turned sideways and inners and outers and upside down
The water come in trying to drown the both of us
The closet top open and the shillet went a flying me I hit my head and kinda cuss
But most of all I frowned when she calm that I said
Put the sugar to bed put the sugar to bed
Ain't nothing dry but my railroad watch the salt got soggy but we still can budge
We built a fire for the coffee and we chicory fed
Because me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed
Me and boudleaux put the sugar to bed

[Verse]
I left a little town
A little south of Hudson Bay
I couldn't find a thing, to make a rounder want to stay
I fought the wind across the baren waste in the crystal doom
Going for to marry the girl in Saskatoon
I'm glad I realized that no one could take her place
My heart was beating for her like the winter beat my face
But knowing that I'd see her made my spirit bright as June
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon
South and West and following the cold December sun
I bedded down in the Carragana when my daily trek was done
Then up and pressing onward by the light of the morning moon
A prodical returning to the girl in Saskatoon
Then I found the trail that had packed beneath the snow
I made the final miles where the prairie lillies grow
The steeple on a church glistened by the prairie moon
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon

[Outro]
My journey was forgotten
When I held her in my arms
My wonderlust was stiffled
By possesion of her charms
And even beneath the steeple
Where we couldn't wait till June
I found eternal spring with the girl in Saskatoon

[Verse]
I wish my heart was stone because you're hard on flesh and bone
But even if my heart was stone I couldn't stand that long
Because time and time again you're gone with the wind
And even when you're here I know you're making plans to go
You come back and I take you back but you like the shifting sand
And like the sand you shift right through my hands
Time and time again I got you time and time again
You come back and I take you back but you like the shifting sand
And like the sand you shift right through my hands
Time and time again I lose you time and time again
I want to be your man so I give in all I can
And when I give in all I can I give up time and time again
You take whole of my hand and look at where I stand
Then I say this is my last stand time and time again
You come back and I take you back but you like the shifting sand
And like the sand you shift right through my hands

[Outro]
Time and time again I got you time and time again
Time and time again I lose you time and time again
Time and time again I got you time and time again

[Verse 1]
I got a gal in Dallas, I wave at when I go through
I got a gal in Tulsa, that I toot my whistle to
(Say how do)

[Chorus]
I got them all over the land, I'm a locomotive man

[Verse 2]
Left my heart in Omaha Omaha, and I never did quite get it back
I got a Sue in Sioux City, waiting by the railroad track
(Keeps her money in a 'tater sack)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well, I left a little switch engine, 'bout forty miles south of Bangor Maine
Couldn't keep the wheels a turning, shouldn't try to pull my train

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well, I had a gal in Jackson, and it sure broke my heart to turn her loose
When I checked my time and moved on, she's hooked on my caboose

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Oh, those Wabash Blues
I know I got my dues
A lonesome soul am I
I feel that I could die
Candle light that gleams
Taunts me in my dreams
I'll pack my walking shoes
To lose those Wabash Blues

[Intro]
To Annabel in Memphis it was just another day
But her sweetheart and his buddies died ten thousand miles away

[Verse]
A captain sadly walked the muddy bloody battlefield
The smoke had cleared away and it was terrible and still
In his pocket was a roster of the falling fighting men
And the captain had his orders so the roll call begin
Atkins Baker Carter Calahan Clement Jones Johnson Moran
McCoy Perkins Rivers and Revere Stepherd Thomas Wilson what can of you here
The roll call was completed but no sign of life was there
Not one man had answered not one accounted for
He turned around and he walked away and looked up to the sky
When he heard his own voice echo and the answer from on high
Atkins (here) Baker (here) Carter (here) Calahan (here)
Clement (here) Jones (here) Johnson (here) Moran (here)
McCoy (here) Perkins (here) Rivers (here) and Revere (here)
Stepherd (here) Thomas (here) Wilson (yes sir we're all here)
We are present sir and all accounted for

[Verse]
The years creep slowly by, lorena
The snow is on the grass again
The sun's low down the sky, lorena
The frost gleams where the flowers have been
But my heart beats on as warmly now
As when the summer days were nigh
The sun can never dip so low
Or down affections cloudless sky
A hundred months have passed, lorena
Since last I held that hand in mine
And felt the pulse beat fast, lorena
Though mine beat faster far than thine
A hundred months, 'twas flowery may
When up the hilly slope we climbed
To watch the dying of the day
And hear the distant church bells chime
We loved each other then, lorena
More than we ever dared to tell
And what we might have been, lorena
Had but our lovings prospered well
But then, 'tis past, the years are gone
I'll not call up their shadowy forms
I'll say to them, "lost years, sleep on!
Sleep on! nor heed life's pelting storms
The story of that past, lorena
Alas! I care not to repeat
The hopes that could not last, lorena
They lived, but only lived to cheat
I would not cause e'en one regret
To rankle in your bosom now
For "if we try, we may forget
Were words of thine long years ago
Yes, these were words of thine, lorena
They burn within my memory yet
They touched some tender chords, lorena
Which thrill and tremble with regret
'twas not thy woman's heart that spoke
Thy heart was always true to me
A duty, stern and pressing, broke
The tie which linked my soul with thee
It matters little now, lorena
The past is in the eternal past
Our heads will soon lie low, lorena
Life's tide is ebbing out so fast
There is a future! o, thank god!
Of life this is so small a part!
It is dust to dust beneath the sod
But there, up there, it is heart to heart

[Verse 1]
Go on girl take your chances
See how long you can go on from man to man
I can read the lines between your stolen glances
And I know it's time to fold this loosing hand
Cause you're drawn to the flame by the thrill and the shame
Of the cheating game they taught you how to play
You've got nothing to lose but your soul girl
And you've only the devil to pay

[Chorus]
You've been flying so high you don't know
That you're blind to the writing on the wall
But some day you'll look down
And you'll find you've got no place to fall
When the bright lights are gone you'll be standing alone
Forsaken in the naked light of day
Then you'll know that it's all over but the dying
And you've still got the devil to pay

[Verse 2]
Join your friends while you got them
Cause you know they're gettin' fewer every day
You can't wait to let them take you to the bottom
And I'm getting tired of standing in your way
But when you hit the ground don't come looking around
For the pieces of the love you threw away
That's the price of the high life you're living
And you still got the devil to pay

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I'll sweep out your chimney
Yes and, I will bring you flowers
Yes and, I will do for you
Most anything you want me to
If we live in a cottage
You will feel like it's a castle
By the royal way you're treated
And attention shown to you
I'll be there beside you
If you need a crying shoulder
Yes, and I'll be there to listen
When you need to talk to me
When you wake up in the darkness
I will put my arms around you
And hold you till the morning sun
Comes shining through the trees

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be right beside you
No matter where you travel
I'll be there to cheer you
Till the sun comes shining through

[Chorus]
If we're ever parted
I will keep the tie that binds us
And I'll never let it break
Cause I love you

[Verse 2]
I will bring you honey
From the bee tree in the meadow
And the first time there's a rainbow
I'll bring you a pot of gold
I'll take all your troubles
And I'll throw them in the river
Then I'll bundle down beside you
And I'll keep you from the cold

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Well I knew someday, Ruby would be leaving
That she wasn't happy living quietly, quietly
Сause she would get the bedroom look each morning
And I felt Ruby pull away from me

Yeah, so go downtown at nine o'clock this evening
Walk under that red light and down the hall, down the hall
Look for the highest flying girl, that's Ruby
And if you wait your turn you'll see Ruby fall

Don't let her know that you even know me
She'll be trying to forget it all
And don't tell me how it was tonight, tomorrow
Cause I don't want to see Ruby fall

I didn't hold her back, when she got restless
One man is not enough when she wants it all
Yeah, I let her go when I saw what she wanted
Cause I don't care to see Ruby fall

[Verse]
His dying barely made the morning paper
And they summed it up in twenty words or more
Killed in action leaves wife and baby
At Route 1 Box 144
He grew up on a little farm just a couple of miles out of town
As a boy he worked in his daddy's field
And when his daddy could spare him
He hired out to the neighbors
For whatever they could pay him
He was thought of as just average a good boy
Nothing more the average amount of friends
He married his high school sweetheart
They brought a little plot of ground
Couple of miles out of town on a mailbox it said
Route 1 Box 144
Well back in town there were very few people that really knew him
Because he hardly ever came to town
Except for maybe on Saturdays of course the usual crew was always there
But he didn't spent a lot of times with the usual crew
He took care of his business
Bought what he had to have or could afford for his family
And went back to his little farm
With a baby on the way he went to the army and it was a short while
That the news came that he was killed in action
His body was sent back on a plane and then by train
And then they brought the body from the train station
To Route 1 Box 144

[Outro]
He never did great things to be remembered
He'd never been away from home before
But you'd've thought that he was president or something
At Route 1 Box 144

[Intro]
Flesh and blood

Beside a Singin Mountain Stream
Where the Willow grew
Where the Silver Leaf of Maple
Sparkled in the Morning Dew
I braided Twigs of Willows
Made a String of Buckeye Beads
But Flesh And Blood needs Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need

I leaned against a Bark of Birch
And I breathed the Honey Dew
I saw a North-bound Flock of Geese
Against a Sky of Baby Blue
Beside the Lily Pads
I carved a Whistle from a Reed
Mother Nature's quite a Lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood needs Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
A mockingbird sang just for me
And I thanked him for the Song
Then the Sun went slowly down the West
And I had to move along
These were some of the things
On which my Mind and Spirit feed
But Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need

And when this Day was ended
I was still not satisfied
I knew ev'rything I touched
Would wither and one day die
And Love was all that would remain
And grow from all these Seed;
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need

[Verse]
Hey little girl with tears in your eyes
Don't waste your time now asking me why
I don't know I know I'll just be moving along
You say that home is where my love is at
I said that home is where I hang my head
The time has come to sing a traveling song
You want a house and a lot of close friends
I love the feel of my back to the wind
The two won't match you know the cage they wile would be wrong
You think that love is friends a child and a home
You can't buy love on a twenty year alone
The time has come to sing a traveling song
Someday where we sat in your old porch swing
A tamer man may offer you a ring
A man that wants his friends and neighbors a child and a home
Don't waste your tears on love that never could be
What's right for others just ain't right for me
The time has come to sing a traveling song mhmm mhm

[Johnny:]
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?

[June:]
If you were a carpenter
And I were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby

[Johnny:]
If a tinker was my trade
Would I still find you

[June:]
I'd be carrying the pots you made
Following behind you

[Hook: Both]
Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow

[Johnny:]
If I were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your color blouse
And your soft shoe shining?

[June:]
If you were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
I'd miss my color blouse
And my soft shoe shining

[Hook: Both]
Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow

[Johnny:]
If I worked my hands in wood
Would you still love me?

[June:]
I'd answered you, "Yes I would"
And would you not be above me

[Johnny:]
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady

[June:]
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby

[Hook: Both]
Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow

[Intro]
And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped show me how to beat the devil

[Verse 1]
It was winter time in Nashville, down on music row
And I was looking for a place to get myself out of the cold
To warm the frozen feeling that was eating at my soul
And keep the chilly wind off me and my guitar

[Verse 2]
Well, my thirsty wanted whisky; and my hungry needed beans
But it'd been of month of paydays since I'd heard that eagle scream
So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar

[Verse 3]
Actually, I guess you'd could call it a Tavern
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling, sawdust on the floor
Friendly shadows

[Verse 4]
Well, I saw that there was just one old man, that was sitting at the bar
And in the mirror I could see him checking me and my guitar
An' he turned and said: "Come up here boy, and show us what you are
I said: "I'm dry." He bought me a beer

[Verse 5]
Then he nodded at my guitar and said: "It's a tough life, ain't it?"
I just looked at him and he said: "You ain't making any money, are you?"
I said: "You've been reading my mail"
He just smiled and said: "Let me see that guitar
I've got something you oughta hear"
Then he laid it on me

[Verse 6]
If you waste your time a-talking to the people who don't listen
To the things that you are saying, who do you think's going to hear
And if you should die explaining how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing who do you think's going to care?

[Verse 7]
There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
All the truth remains that no-one wants to know

[Verse 8]
Well, the old man was a stranger, but I'd heard his song before
Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door
When no-one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor
And lonesome was more than a state of mind

[Verse 9]
You see, the devil haunts a hungry man
If you don't wanna join him,  well you gotta beat him
I ain't saying I beat the devil, but I drank his beer for nothing
And then I stole his song

[Verse 10]
And you still can hear me singing to the people who don't listen
To the things that I am saying, praying someone's going to hear
And I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing, hoping someone's going to care

[Outro]
I was born a lonely singer, and I'm bound to die the same
But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul
And if I never have a nickle, I won't ever die ashamed
Cause I don't believe that no-one wants to know

[Verse]
Grit my teeth and face a new day dawning take a deep breath then get up and go
Tie the same old weary shoes and walk the same old pathway
I never see a face that I don't know oh God if I could just pack up and go
Hungry for some other face hungry for some other place
Needing something and I know what God I know what
I'm tired of seeing the same old road tired of carrying the same old load
Hungry for something I ain't got
Her face across that table every morning and lately I don't notice that she's there
Always leave that breakfast table feelin' so damned empty
She knows there's something wrong but I don't care
Oh God how much more of this can I bear

[Verse 1]
I've got great big blisters on my bloodshot
Eyes from looking at that long legged woman up ahead
What she does simply walking down the sidewalk of the city
Makes me think about a stray cat getting fed
He's got a whole lot of motion in her soul, I know
But her soul ain't the place she lets it show

[Chorus]
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
Lord I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah
She done tore my soul apart, put big blisters on my heart
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go

[Verse 2]
I've got great big blisters on my fingertips
From reaching in my pocket book and picking out the bills
And I got tiny white blisters in my throat
From trying to ease my nervous tension taking all them pat and pills
And ever since she started running around from bar to bar
I just can't eat a bite or keep my stomach settled down

[Chorus]

[Outro]
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
Oh I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Blistered, blistered

[Verse 1]
I've got a lot of blues on my mind
And at least a million miles behind me
And all that I've got between me
And pauper's hill
Is a wrinkled, crincked, wadded dollar bill
Lake Michigan wind sure is cold
And I need me a jacket for my shoulders
I could buy one down at the surplus store
Cheap cotton twill
With my wrinckled crinckled wadded dollar bill

[Chorus]
But I'm not bound
And I never will
Be to a wrinkled crinckled wadded dollar bill

[Verse 2]
It sure smells good at the bakery
And I stand and let the smell flood over me
They sell them day old cakes mighty cheeply
I could eat my fill
With my wrinkled, crinkled wadded dollar bill

[Verse 3]
Lake Michigan waves hit the beach
And I stand and let them wash at my feet
And then I throw it just as far as I can
Into the chill
My wrinkled, crinkled wadded dollar bill

[Bridge]
Cause I'm not bound
And I never will
Be to a wrinkled crinkled wadded dollar bill

[Verse]
Train train train I've got a thing about trains
I get a sad kind of feeling when I see a passenger train
In this fast moving world that we live in nobody rides them much these days
Maybe I'm a little sentimental cause I know that things have to change
But I'd still like to go for a train ride cause I've got a thing about trains
Train train train you're fading from the scene
But you've had your days of glory train train train
Train they say you're too slow for traveling but I'm going to miss you some day
When my little boy says daddy what was it like to ride a train
I'll just say it was a good way to travel when things didn't move quite so fast
And I'm sorry son that you can't ride one the trains are the thing of the past

[Outro]
Train train train you're fading from the scene
And I'm going to mourn your passing train train train
I've got a thing about trains

[Verse]
Jesus was a carpenter and he worked with a sow and a hammer
And his hands could form a table true enough to stand forever
And he might have spun his life out in the coolness of the mornings
But he put aside his tools and he walked the burning highways
To build a house from folks like you and me
And he found them as they wandered through the wild Judean mountains
And he found them as they pulled their nets upon the Sea of Galilee
And for a thousand evenings while the day behind him emptied
He walked among the poor and he stopped to touch the dying
And he built his house from people just like these
It was on a shining Sunday when he rode to old Jerusalem
And the palms they cast before him were the crimes they laid against him
It was on a storming Friday when he climbed the streets of Calvary
And where he died today why they're sellin' beads and postcards
And they tell us too that that was long ago
But would he stand today upon the sands of California
Or walk the sweating blacktop in New York and Mississippi
Where the mighty churches rise above the screaming cities
Would he be a guest on Sunday a vagrant on a Monday
With the doors locked tight against his kind you know
Come again now Jesus be a carpenter among us
There are chapels in our discontent cathedrals in our sorrows
And we dwell in golden mansions with the sand for our foundations
And the raging water's rising and the thunder's all around us
Won't you come and build a house on rock again

[Outro]
Jesus was a carpenter and he worked with a sow and a hammer
And his hands could form a table true enough to stand forever
And he might have spun his life out in the coolness of the mornings
But he put aside his tools and he walked the burning highways
To build a house from folks like you and me
Mmm

[Intro]
This Side of the Law

[Chorus]
On this side of the law
On that side of the law
Who is right? Who is wrong?
Who is weak? Who is strong?
Who is for and who?s against the law?

[Verse 1]
You see, I didn't really mean and harm
But I simply couldn't make it on the farm
When the land won't give a lot
You going to do with what you got
And all I got's the muscle in my arm; bum! bum! bum!
Well, I wouldn't ever hurt my fellow man
And it seems to me that you could under stand
I'm just trying to help my self without hurting somebody else
And a man has got to do the best he can

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well, I didn't mean to let my fam'ly down
And I'm not giving you the run a round
I'd much rather be dead than have to beg my daily bread
And to pay my way no matter where I'm bound; bum! bum! bum!
Well, I didn't really think that I did wrong
So long as I stayed here where I belong
I did the only thing I could
Same as anybody would
And I was simply trying to get along

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Better watch what you're doing Henry you better take it easy sheriff
Somebody might be watching and the world's going to fall on you

And the world's going to fall on you

[Verse]
Fingers callus from the plough wrinkled weather beating brow
Streak of silver in the hair mhm face of despair
A back that's bent from years of toil thorns grow in the worn out soil
No one left to really care nhm face of despair
If you should plough old fields like these you'd plough up memories
Don't tell the young to mend their ways you can't show them better days
Their better days are yet ahead your better days have long been dead
Rest easy in your rocking chair mhm and look at your September country
Face of despair
Shoulders weary from the load life is rough as a gravel road
How much of it can you bear mhm look at your September country face of despair
In the September of your years eyes that hide a veil of tears
A look of longing always there mhm face of despair

[Outro]
If you should plough
Mhm if you should plough

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say
But trying to be genuine was harder than it seemed
And somehow, I got caught up in between

Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say
But trying to be someone else was harder than it seemed
And somehow, I got caught up in between

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Between my pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is none

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Let me apologize to begin with
Let me apologize for what I'm about to say
But trying to regain your trust was harder than it seemed
And somehow, I got caught up in between

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Between my pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is none
The only thing that's worse than one is none

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
And I cannot explain to you
In anything I say or do or plan
Fear is not afraid of you
Guilt's a language you can understand

I cannot explain to you, in anything I say or do
I hope the actions speak the words they can

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
For my pride and my promise
For my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is...

[Outro]
Pride and my promise
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come
The only thing that's worse than one is none
The only thing that's worse than one is none
The only thing that's worse than one is none

[Verse]
(Standing on the promises of Christ my King through eternal ages let his praises ring
Glory in the highest I will shout and sing
Standing on the promises of God
Standing standing standing on the promises of God my Saviour
Standing standing I'm standing on the promises of God)

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
Well with everybody trying to tell us what to do
You wonder how are you to know whose word is true
But the preacher just keep on a bringing us a very same word
And from St Paul to Billy Graham the same is heard

[Chorus: Johnny Cash and Billy Graham]
And the preacher said of truth Jesus said
And Jesus said I'm the way the truth and the life

[Verse 2: Johnny Cash and Billy Graham]
Well we can see that the world is full of greed
There's so much hate yet there is so much need
What should we do when no one seems to care
What can we do when there is no love there
And then the preacher said of love Jesus said
Jesus said love Thy neighbor as Thyself

[Bridge]
Well please tell us the road we oughta go in such confusion how are we to know
And if there is a heaven show us to its gates
Oh you'd better tell us preacher before it's too late

[Chorus]
And then the preacher said of heaven Jesus said
Jesus said seek the first the kingdom of God and his righteousness
And all these things shall be added unto you

[Bridge]
Well please tell us we can find a way to climb every mountain that we face every day
And time of troubles what to depend upon to be the truth and help us carry on

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
And the preacher said of trouble Jesus said

[Outro: Billy Graham]
Jesus said let not your heart be troubled if you believe in God believe also in me
In my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you
I go to prepare a place for you
And if I prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself
That where I am there you may be also

[Verse]
From a carny show and a rodeo that shared a three-day stand
A cowboy met a fiery carny queen
In new spring nights amid the lights of the painted carny van
They laughed and loved and shared short-lived dreams
But the carny show and the rodeo went their separate ways
And the carny season bloomed and soon moved on
And I was born on a winter morn to the dark-eyed carny queen
The too-late son of something that was gone
The black-sheep child that grew up wild from the seed the four winds sowed
Unwanted son of ice and fire, an orphan of the road
I was still a child when my mama died of a chill that closed her eyes
So I was left to grow up on my own
Without a name, too wild to tame. No one cared to try
So mostly I was mostly left alone
In dingy bars and cold boxcars, hobo jungle camps
I joined the men who drift from town to town
The surging flood of restless blood flowed inside my veins
I'd never find the time to settle down
The black-sheep child
In the misty rain, I caught the train that slowed down through the town
And I pulled myself into the boxcar door
In a passing light in the deep gray night, I saw the still dark form
Of an old man lying sick upon the floor
And he said "I tried to find her, but they told me that she'd died
And that she'd left an only son behind
And I tried to find him, but I never did, but I know I could rest in peace
If I could just see him once before I die
I found a match and I quickly scratched it into a flicker and flame
Then I held it close and I gently raised his head
My mother, sir," I said of her, "I have her same dark eyes
He smiled a cowboy smile and then was dead
The black-sheep child

[Verse]
And the shining Rocky Mountains looked down on the people coming
Strong and sturdy freedom loving settlers cowboys pioneers
Now no foreign crown would rule them
Now a nation strong was standing even bigger was it growing
Added Iowa, Wisconsin then broke through the shining mountains
Staked a claim on California
Panned the gold out of its rivers irrigated desert valleys
Oregon, Minnesota, Kansas now were added to the total
Making 34 to number of the States now in the Union
And the years 1860 to 65 the history books're full of it
The sadness the heartbreak and the songs of that period
Tell us of a sadness and of a heartbreak when the nation was torn asunder

[Verse]
You've got a new light shining in your eyes
And I can see now right where your beauty lies
And it's showing in your face that your heart has found a place
And I can hear it in your whisper and your sighs
You've got a new way of doing things you do
And it's plain to see there's been a change in you
And I wonder could it be that the change is due to me
For I have felt a certain something too

[Chorus]

[x2]
You've got a way about you now that you never had before
You've got a look you're wearing now like no look you ever wore
I tried to hide it for a while but now I realize
You've got a new light shining in your eyes

[Outro]
You've got a new light shining in your eyes

[Verse]
A broken man moves slowly down the sidewalk
Humbled by the favours he must seek
From those that he encounters on his walk through misery
Who are rich enough to hurt just as they please
If not for love I could be one of these
An old man on a park bench stares with envy
At a couple with their children on their knees
While across the park a young man is caught by the police
Stealing for a habit he must feed
And if not for love I could be one of these

[Chorus]
I could be one of these or so many many more
Always at the beck and call of shame
I'm thankful I was called by love to walk among the happy
But if not for you love wouldn't know my name

[Verse 2]
A man of squander talents vainly calls on
His gift of God now straining through his soul
While in the crowd before him a jealous friend awaits
The moments that he can no longer please
And if not for love I could be one of these

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yes if not for love I could be one of these

[Verse 1]
Hello, cowgirl in the sand (Hello, cowgirl in the sand)
Is this place at your command?
Can I stay here for a while?
Can I see your sweet, sweet smile?

[Chorus]
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game

[Verse 2]
Hello, ruby in the dust
Has your band begun to rust?
After all the sin we've had
I was hoping that we'd turn bad

[Chorus]
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game

[Verse 3]
Hello, woman of my dreams
Is this not the way it seems?
Purple words on a grey background
To be a woman and to be turned down

[Chorus]
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game

[Verse]
Then came Utah, Oklahoma, New Mexico was 47
48 was Arizona and the land was all a Union
Now a proud strong land swelled its chest and kept on growing
She survived many wars but now the great war the war to all the wars
Dealth her a stunning blow
Two million men shipped overseas to help win the great war

[Verse]
One morning at breakfast, I said to my wife
We been everywhere once and some places twice
As I had another helping of country ham
She said "We ain't never been to Vietnam
And there's a bunch of our boys over there
So we went to the Orient: Saigon
Well we got a big welcome when we drove in
Through the gates of a place that they call Long Vinh
We checked in and everything got kinda quiet
But a soldier boy said: "Just wait until tonight
Things get noisy. Things start happening
Big bad firecrackers
Well that night we did about four shows for the boys
And they were living it up with a whole lot of noise
We did our last song for the night
And we crawled into bed for some peace and quiet
But things weren't peaceful. And things weren't quiet
Things were scary
Well for a few minutes June never said one word
And I thought at first that she hadn't heard
Then a shell exploded not two miles away
She sat up in bed and I heard her say: "What was that?
I said: That was a shell, or a bomb
She said: I'm scared.I said "Me too
Well all night long that noise kept on
And the sound would chill you right to the bone
The bullets and the bombs, and the mortar shells
Shook our bed every time one fell
And it never let up; it was gonna get worse
Before it got any better
Well when the sun came up, the noise died down
We got a few minutes sleep, an' we were sleeping sound
When a soldier knocked on our door and said
Last night they brought in seven dead, and 14 wounded
And would we come down to the base hospital, and see the boys
Yes
So we went to the hospital ward by day
And every night we were singing away
Then the shells and the bombs was going again
And the helicopters brought in the wounded men
Night after night; day after day
Coming and a going
So we sadly sang for them our last song
And reluctantly we said: So long
We did our best to let them know that we care
For every last one of them that's over there
Whether we belong over there or not
Somebody over here love's them, and needs them
Well now that's about all that there is to tell
About that little trip into living hell
And if I ever go back over there any more
I hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for
I hope that war is over with
And they all come back home
To stay

[Outro]
In peace

[Intro]
In Australia a bandit or an outlaw was called a bushranger
One of Australia's most infamous bushrangers was a man named Ned Kelly

[Verse 1]
Ned Kelly was a wild young bushranger
Out of Victoria he rode with his brother Dan
He loved his people and he loved his freedom
And he loved to ride the wide open land
Ned Kelly was a victim of the changes
That came when his land was a sprout and seed
And the wrongs he did were multiplied in legend
With young Australia growing like a weed

[Chorus]
Ned Kelly took the blame
Ned Kelly won the fame
Ned Kelly brought the shame
And then Ned Kelly hanged

[Verse 2]
Well he hid out in the bush and in the forest
And he loved to hear the wind blow in the trees
While the men behind the badge were coming for him
Ned said they'll never bring me to my knees
But everything was changed and run in cycles
And Ned knew that his day was at an end
He made a suit of armour out of ploughshares
But Ned was brought down by the trooper's men

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Look for me there in the morning
When the clay of worthless ground
Is baked into the brick to build the church
That doesn't mind to wait with patience till it's found

[Chorus]
He said children look for me look for me
Look for me late in the evening when the honey bear is lost
And hears a buzz of honey bees that leads him on and feeds him
Till his hunger feels at home he said children look for me look for me

[Verse 2]
Look for me look for me love will be there beside you
Love will be there to guide you look for me
He said help me to help you to help yourself to me
He said children look for love look for me

[Verse 3]
Look for me there in the hand
That drops a penny in the cup
And in the hand that lends its strength
To help the lonely through the night and lift the beggar up

[Chorus]
He said children look for me look for me
Look for me there in the chill of dawn and in the newborn eyes
Of a baby left discarded by a girl who could offer nothing more
Than a small back alley prayer he said children look for me look for me

[Verse 4]
Look for me look for me love will be there beside you
Love will be there to guide you look for me
He said help me to help you to help yourself to me
He said children look for love look for me

[Verse]
Dear Mrs though we've never met I know very much about you
I know that you've got hair that shines like the morning sun
You've got eyes that hold the blueness of the sky
And of the deepest sea on a clear day and a smile that has a sparkle of a diamond
I know that because I've heard him say those things about you
These're the thoughts and the words of a man
Who spent many heart breaking years behind prison walls
The father of your children the man who worshipped the very ground that you walk on
He had a picture of you Mrs it was old and faded and torn
But you could tell at a glance that he never exaggerated in his thoughts and visions
He never left his cell without first checking to see if he had your picture with him
He was a young man when he first came to prison
And he talked a great deal about you but as the years passed he talked less and less
And during his last year here I don't believe he ever said a word to anybody
He had the appearance of a man much older than he really was
He walked with his head down and his shoulders sagging
And the walk itself seemed to take a great deal of effort
He never received a letter or had a visitor while he was here in prison
But never did he stop looking and waiting
Every day at mail call you could see him standing close to his bars
With the look of a child awaiting a reward
Even after the mailman had passed his cell his pleading eyes would follow begging
As always he'd feel of his shirt pocket and then just stand there
Staring at the emptiness and as always I could
Somehow feel the lump in his throat
And the burning in his eyes you know Mrs like just before you start to cry
Well I thought you might like to know that they buried his body today
Just outside the prison walls
They buried him there because nobody cared enough to claim his body
You know there was even a couple of old convicts there that actually cried
No not because they cared for him but for what he died from they cared for
Loneliness every prisoner knows loneliness but some know it more than others
The man that they buried today had died many times
Every day he waited hoping and praying for a letter or a card
Or just a note or anything to let him know that somewhere out there
Somebody cared for him
That assurance never came and today he died Mrs
He died from loneliness starved for love a love that nobody ever wanted
You see no man woman or child is immune to the need of love or to be loved
No matter how terrible his crime might have been
The death he died from today was more inhuman
But his suffering is over now and he's resting in a pauper's grave in a prison suit
And in his pocket is an old torn and faded picture of yes of you Mrs

[Verse]
Well you talk about important people that you say you know
Presidents and superstars of big television shows
Well I know someone personally who's bigger than them all
And next to him your superstars look mighty small
And I have a talk with him each day and he's interested in every word I say
No secretary ever tells me he's been called away I talk to Jesus every day
Well now I don't think that I'll ever be in any Hall of Fame
And the social register of wealthy folks might drop my name
But my name is written in the book of life I'm proud to say
And that's all that really matters anyway
And I talk to Jesus every day and he's interested in every word I say
No secretary ever tells me he's been called away I talk to Jesus every day
I talk to Jesus every day

[Verse]
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union
Had to have men like Columbus, De Soto, Lewis and Clark, Kit Carson, Daniel Boone, David Crockett, Eli Whitney, Sam Colt, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford Orville and Wilbur Wright, my grandpa, and Paul Revere

[Verse]
In April of 1775
This great nation started coming alive
Old King George didn't like it one bit
So he proceeded to throw him a royal fit
He told his generals better get them back in line
Make them pay my taxes now America is mine
Stop that Independence cops before it gets around
Or it'll going to be hard to hold them rebels down
Well the King was talking about the men like Paul Revere
And the minute men who held their dream of Independence dear
They kept their eyes on the British they watched them day and night
They knew very soon they'd get their chance to stand and fight
Yes they knew that the British would get moving any hour
So they arranged a signal in the Northern Church Tower
Paul was watching when the tower showed a light
And he started on his midnight ride
He jumped on his horse hoofs started a humming
He screamed out his warning redcoats're coming
Better get your guns and your fighting britches on
They're coming and they're eight hundred strong
Next morning at Concord and Lexington town
The spirit of freedom turned the redcoats around
When we praise the men who made this mighty nation we have here
Then let's remember Paul Revere yes let's remember Paul Revere
I guarantee you something and I want to tell you all
That we never would've been here if it hadn't been for Paul
Yes sir I surely doubt us ever being here
If it hadn't been for that man on that horse named Mr Revere

[Verse]
1776 the thirteen colonies
Broke away from British rule and took a stand
We're on our own, they said
And they looked across the land
With a defiant challenge
They looked across the land
We will conquer you, the colonists said
We see your mighty mountains
We know of your lush green valleys
We're coming to claim you, to tame you
And the Movement Westward started

[Verse]
Yes, went they through the Lehigh Valley
To Lake Erie past Virginia
And the land called out its challenge
Bring your men to match our mountains
See the green Ohio Valley
See the Cumberland, the Wabash
On the Tennessee they floated
On great rafts to the Mississippi
And the Cherokee and Shawnee
And the Creek and The Ojibwa
And the Choctaw and the Quapaw
And all the tribes along the rivers

[Incomprehensible] that they were coming
That the white man was upon them
They built their homes along the rivers
Built their churches, brought their preachers
Came upon the white misery
Stopped before the shining mountains

[Outro]
Many died from the beginning
For the freedom of America
Like that day down in New Orleans

[Verse 1]
In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans

[Chorus]
We fired our guns and the British kept a'coming
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to running on
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Verse 2]
We looked down the river and we see'd the British come
And there must have been a hundred of'em beating on the drum
They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring
We stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Old Hickory said we could take them by surprise
If we didn't fire our muskets until we looked them in the eye
We held our fire until we see'd their faces well
Then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave them ... well

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch them
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
We fired our cannon until the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch them
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

[Intro]
Four score and seven years ago so began the message
Of a war-weary President Abraham Lincoln
A message written on the back of an envelope on a train
On the way to dedicate a battlefield
Where men from the north and south had died at Gettysburg Pennsylvania

[Verse]
Four score and seven years ago our forefathers brought forth on this continent
A new nation conceived in liberty
And dedicated in the proposition that all men are created equal
Now we're engaged in a great Civil War
Testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived
And so dedicated can long endure
We are met on a great battlefield of that war
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field
As the final resting place for those who here gave their lives
That that nation might live
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this
But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate
We cannot hallow this ground
For the brave men living and dead who struggled here
Have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
The world will little notice or long remember what we say here
But it can never forget what they did here
It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work
Which they who fought here have thus so nobly advanced
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us
That from these honored dead we take increased devotion
To that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion
That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died
In vain and that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom
And the government of the people by the people and for the people
Shall not perish from the earth

[Spoken Intro]
But the land was already claimed by a people when the cowboy came and when the soldiers came
The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways a story of tragedy
Like that day at Wounded Knee, South Dakota

[Verse 1]
Big Foot was an Indian chief
Of the Minneconjou band
A band of Minneconjou Sioux
From South Dakota land
Then Big Foot said to Custer
Stay away from Crazy Horse
But Custer crossed into Sioux land
And he never came back across
Then Big Foot led his people
To a place called Wounded Knee
And they found themselves surrounded
By the 7th Cavalry

[Chorus 1]
Big chief Big Foot
Rise up from your bed
Minneconjou babies cry
For their mothers lying dead

[Verse 2]
Big Foot was down with a fever
When he reached Wounded Knee
And his people all were prisoners
Of the 7th Cavalry
Two hundred women and children
And another hundred men
Raised up a white flag of peace
But peace did not begin
An accidental gunshot
And Big Foot was first to die
And over the noise of the rifles
You could hear the babies cry

[Chorus 2]
Big chief Big Foot
It's good that you can't see
Revenge is being wrought
By Custer's 7th Cavalry

[Verse 3]
Then smoke hung over the canyon
On that cold December day
All was death and dying
Around where Big Foot lay
Farther on up the canyon
Some had tried to run and hide
But death showed no favourites
Women, men, and children died
One side called it a massacre
The other a victory
But the white flag is still waving
Today at Wounded Knee

[Outro]

[x2]
Big chief Big Foot
Your Minneconjou band
Is more than remembered here
In South Dakota land

[Verse]
Like a young cold the country was now growing fast
Passenger trains in the east were traveling a hundred miles an hour
People in the country could buy clothes by mail order
And get them back within two weeks
After twenty years or more the South
Was still mending its wounds from the civil war
But with all the country's problems
The union was solid
Red American novelists and poets
Were coming into their own
People were expressing their love
For America in song and in poem
And in South Carolina
A high tone southern gentleman
Expressed his love and admiration
For his president James A Garfield in such a way

[Verse]
I think sir the battle is over, and the young soldier lay down his gun
I'm tired of running for cover, I'm certain the battle is done
For see over there where we fought them, it's quiet for they've all gone away
All left is the dead and the dying, the blue lying long side the grave
So you think the battle is over, and you even lay down your gun
You carelessly rise from your cover, for you think the battle is done
Now boy hit the dirt, listen to me, for I'm still the one in command
Get flat on the ground here beside me, and lay your heart to the sand
Can you hear the deafening rumble, can you feel the trembling ground
It's not just the horses and wagons that make such a deafening sound
For every shot fired had an echo and every man killed wanted life
There lies your friend Jim McKinney, can you take the news to his wife?
No son the battle's not over, the battle has only begun
The rest of the battle will cover the part that has blackened the sun
The fight yet to come is not with cannon, nor will the fight be hand-to-hand
No one will regroup the forces, no charge will a general command
The battle will rage in the bosom of mother and sweetheart and wife
Brother and sister and daughter will grieve for the rest of their lives
Now go ahead, rise from your cover, be thankful that God let you live
Go fight the rest of the battle for those who gave all they could give
I see sir the battle's not over, the battle has only begun
The rest of the battle will cover this part that has blackened the sun
For though there's no sound of the cannon and though there's no smoke in the sky
I'm dropping the gun and the saber and ready for battle am I

[Verse]
Come take a trip in my airship come take a trip round the stars
Come take a sail around Venus come take a sail around Mars
No one to watch while we're kissing no one to see while we spoon
Come take a trip in my airship we'll visit the Man in the Moon

[Verse]
Now the nation moved on wheels
Will Rogers said we hold the distinction on being the only nation
In the history of the world ever to go to the poorhouse in an automobile
Ha ha ha well the country went to the poorhouse all right
Then it got back to its feet
To become the mose powerful nation in the history of the world

[Verse]
Add Alaska and Hawaii make the total half a hundred
Half a hundred states united joined together as one body
Arms that reach across the northland to the far off state Alaska
Arms that reach across the water to the far off state Hawaii
Arms of some two hundred million
Thanking God for having brought us safely thus far in our journey
We're reaching for the stars that beckon reaching for the stars that call us
And we answer back still louder by the power of God that brought us
We are reaching we are reaching reaching for the stars tomorrow

[Verse]
These are my people this is the land where my forefathers lie
These are my people in brotherhood we're heirs of a creed to live by
A creed that proclaims that by loved ones blood stains
This is my land and these are my people
These are my people they were born on and lived by the land
These are my people and their cities were raised by hard working hands
And their faces to tell that they're holding on well
To this their land yes these are my people
These are my people these are the ones who will reach for the stars
These are my people that a light of the earth you can tell they are ours
A new step to take and a new day will break
For this my land yes these are my people these're my people hmm

[Verse]
Silent Night - that means Christmas to some people
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
That means Christmas to some people
A lot of people from different parts of the country and all over the world
Have different ways of celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ
The prophets of old had foretold of his coming for four thousand years
And a lot of people say that the wise men from the East were probably astronomers
That may have studied the stars and knew that the new star that was gonna
To appear in the East the time of it was at hand
A lot of others of course say that they were told by God
That the star was about to appear so they could begin their long journey
From the East and where was the East
Some people say it could have been India some people speculate
That one of the wise men came from as far away as Korea all away cross Asia
And he must have been a coming for many months maybe
Maybe even years to get to the place where that new star
That was to hang over that manger in the town of Bethlehem
Ten miles from Jerusalem
Whatever the shepherds came in from the fields
And you know it's really something that a shepherd would leave his flock
To come in for anything because that was really about a crime for a man to do
That was shepherd to leave his flock of sheep
And come in for anything because the sheep were man's lively hood
The milk and the meat and the wool for the clothing
It really took something for a shepherd to leave a flock
And there were a lot of them that did it and came in to worship the new baby Jesus That was born in the manger
The wise men came bearing gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh
And they brought them and laid them at the foot of the manger where Jesus lay
And you know the voice of God so the scriptures say
According to the scriptures had been silent for four hundred years
There had not been a divinely inspired prophet for four hundred years
And all of a sudden you can imagine what kind of night it must have been
For a new star to suddenly appear out of the heavens
And shepherds to leave their flock and men
Wealthy looking strangers come in from the East
And all of a sudden on top of all that a heavenly choir to start to singing
Singing voices from heaven, singing words that they understood
Words like peace on Earth good will to men - what a night it must have been

[Verse]
He wants to own your heart
He already owns your soul
No matter what you do
He's always in control
And when he calls your name you have to follow
Like moths into a flame, no fear or sorrow will fall upon you
You belong to the King of Love
He wants to know your thoughts
He already knows your mind
No matter where you are
You're someone he'll always find
His very mention brings the slightest shudder
Deep inside you know there is no other as skilled and tender
Just surrender to the King of Love
But when the night falls down, he will not wear a crown
No jewels upon his hands, he is just a man
He wants to rule your world
He already rules your dreams
No matter what you want
He'll never make you Queen
Still when he calls your name you have to answer
And when his music plays you are a dancer for him the only
Never lonely, King of Love
For him the only, never lonely, King o

[Verse 1]

[Johnny]
That's a night we are celebrating at Christmas time
And according to Marshall Grant up in Flatts,North Carolina
They had their own way of celebrating Christmas too
Marshall what did you get for Christmas say when you were six years old

[Marshall]
When I was six years old or there about the biggest present that I could ever remember getting
Was something like a little hatchet or a french harp
I remember one year that I got a hatchet and Odell got a french harp
And he wanted my hatchet and I didn't want his french harp
But he got what he wanted and everything but there was fourteen of us
In that little house up in Flatts North Carolina
There was one thing that we did have and at that time of year and that was love
All of us loved one another and it was cold
Always cold with the little fireplace but the room felt so warm
And it was really warm even though there was a lot of scrambling
Over the gifts that we got swapping backers and forth
From all the brothers and sisters
It was really warm in Flatts North Carolina always on Christmas

[Johnny]
I think probably a lot of people might wonder as I did where is Flatts North Carolina

[Marshall]
Well I tell you Flatts North Carolina it's about eighty miles from Ashville
And you go through Cherokee and Brison City
And you get to a little place called Maddy Hill in North Carolina

[June]
But that isn’t it!

[Marshall]
No

[Johnny]
Then you go up the wind

[Marshall]
You take a little left there at Maddy Hill if you're going east
And you go up the winding stairs for fourteen miles and you round about a dozen bends
And all of a sudden, there is no sign, and if you ask anybody up there
Where Olson Grant lives that's Main Street

[Chorus]

[x2]
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse sleigh hey

[Verse 1]
Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go laughing all the way(ha ha ha)
Bells on bobtail ring making sprites bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 2]
You know I hate the cold
That's why I always go
Down south to drink some rum
On a island in the sun
There's nothing like St. Barts
With the palm trees swaying slow
Or being there on Jost Van Dyke
When the New Year comes and goes

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]

[Johnny]
I remember teaching my brother Tommy shoot fire crackers
Both of us getting our fingers busted you remember that Tom
Daddy started Christmas morning with a stick of dynamite
And he made sure everybody else was up

[Tommy]
When daddy gets up he wants to make sure everybody else in the world is up too

[Johnny]
He did when we were kids remember when he could get dynamite bang Joy To The World

[Don:] What was is like up in the Stanton Virginia about that time of the year Harold

[Harold]
Oh we had I guess about like everybody’s Christmas it's always that Christmassy feeling
I remember one year I had an uncle that came in filled with the spirit
And he was loving all us kids and everything and we are trying to get away from him
And he fell in the Christmas tree and knocked it over
We stood him up in the corner and decorated him
I don't remember what I got that year but I remember what he got
My mama run him out of the house finally

[Verse]
When the days of December are numbered
And the earth begs it's snowflakes to fall
That's the time of the year that Christmas is here
With peace and goodwill for all
How I love that Christmas feeling
How I treasure it's friendly glow
See the way a stranger greets you
Just as though you'd met him Christmas's ago!
Christmas helps you to remember
To do what other folks hold dear
What a blessed place the world would be
If we had the Christmas feeling all year!

[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, heading for the trains
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
Took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time and
Bobby clapping hands we finally sang up every song
That driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedoms just another word for nothing left to lose
And nothing isn’t worth nothing but its free
Feeling good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

[Verse 2]
From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside me through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
The somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
She was looking for the love I hope shell find
Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding Bobbys body close to mine

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Merry Christmas Mary thank you for the child
Thank you for Lord Jesus thank you for the child
Christmas time is here again peace on Earth good will to men
The air is filled with joyful sounds merry wishing all around
Giving and receiving gifts stopping by to thank all of our friends
And we thank you Mary for helping give God's greatest gift to man
Merry Christmas Mary thank you for the child
Thank you for Lord Jesus thank you for the child
Merry Christmas Mary too often we forget
To thank you for your part in giving the greatest Christmas present yet
Merry Christmas Mary

[Verse 1]
Joseph was tired
They'd been traveling all day
And it was almost midnight
Before he found a place to stay
He put the burrow in the stall
Then knelt beside his wife
To comfort her
As she went through
The pain of giving life
And up above a star was shining brightly in the sky
Joseph held the baby child
And showed him to his wife

[Chorus]
And he said
Merry Christmas, Mary
Let me be the first to say
Merry Christmas, Mary
The son of God has come to us today

[Verse 2]
There was someone at the door
And Joseph turned to see
Some plain and simple shepherd men
Down on blended knee
They talked about an angel
Who told them where to come
In the middle of the night to see
God's only son
Then later there came wise men
Bearing gifts and offerings
And Joseph led them all to see
And praise the new born king

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Tears of joy
Were gently flowing
Out of Joseph's eyes
While up above the angels sang
"Glory to God!

[Chorus]
Merry Christmas, Mary
Let us be the first to say
Merry Christmas, Mary
The son of God has come to us today

[x2]

[Verse]
Wish I had someone to love me someone to call me their own
I wish I had someone to live with cause I'm tired of living alone
I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow leaving my little darling all alone
With the cold prison walls all around me and my head on a pillow of stone
(Make that piano cry Larry Butler)
If I had the wings of an angel over these prison walls I would fly
I would fly to the arms of my darling and there I'd be willing to die

[Verse]

[Johnny]
How did how did pop Carter which is June's father
Mama how did he celebrate Christmas when you all were first married

[Maybelle]
When we first married

[June]
Mama he didn't have a great big old copper kettle somewhere hid up in the mountain

[Maybelle]
June can tell you that story John
But I will tell you that he used to go buy a bushel of apples
And a bushel of oranges and fruit like that for the girls
And he'd divided in three three ways and they could do what they wanted to
If they want to give it away okay they couldn't have none of the rest of the others see
Theirs had to last them through Christmas and you know
They couldn't go to one of the other girls and say
Hey give me some of your fruit mine's all gone

[June]
I want to tell you that story about how you asked about the celebrating
Back years ago they didn't have too much to celebrate with
Up in that country unless you made your own
And my father somewhere had him the dandiest copper kettle with little pipes
Going out all over it somewhere up in the hills

[Harold]
My uncle knew him

[June]
And my grandmother Carter was quite a woman
And she never said one word to my daddy
But she was always going into Clinch Mountain hunting wood
And dragging it down on her back
And she came out of there one day dragging that great big old forked stick
With a copper kettle right on the end of it
And she was my father's name was Ezra Carter and she'd say Ezra
She said oh Ezra said look here Ezra
I found the dandiest copper kettle for making apple butter
And he never said a word

[Anita]
And we always had good apple butter

[Chorus]
Christmas time's a-coming, Christmas time's a-coming
Christmas time's a-coming and I know I'm going home

[Verse 1]
Snowflakes are falling, my old home's a calling
Tall pines are humming, Christmas time's a-coming
Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing joy, joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Holly's in the window, home's where the wind blows
Can't walk for running, Christmas time's a-coming
Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing joy, joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
White candles burning, my old heart's a yearning
For the folks at home when Christmas time's a-coming
Can't you hear them bells ringing, ringing joy, joy hear them singing
When it's snowing I'll be going back to my country home

[Chorus]

[Verse]
How bout your Christmas Flute
I think maybe eh that I enjoy Christmas now more than I did back then
Because I think seeing my my family wife and two kids get things that they like
I enjoy that more than anything more than the Christmas years ago is the Christmas we have now
And eh course I know I was real fortunate in not ever having to really want for anything at Christmas time

[Verse]
It's so nice to spend Christmas with you
The times that I've seen Christmas come and go are now two score
I wish you a merry Christmas and I wish you a many more
It's good to see the children laugh with joy the way they do
And it's nice to spend Christmas with you
That old fashioned Christmas is a sweet memory
Except for all the Christmases that you weren't there with me
But now I really feel the spirit cause I love you like I do
And it's nice to spend Christmas with you
I remember Christmas when I little could afford
And I try to remember it's the birthday of our Lord
Well I'll not forget to thank him for his blessing's on me too
And that I can spend Christmas with you
That old fashioned Christmas
It's so nice to spend Christmas with you

[Verse]
Yes times was hard along about that time
We were lucky if we had a radio battery
But as John says in his song
We were all together which meant more than anything else
Well Mama I'll dedicate this to you and ask Mother Maybelle Carter to play it
This is Christmas as I knew it

[Verse]
You know Carl Perkins and I lived right across the Mississippi River from each other
I bet you could have heard my Daddy shooting that dynamite on Christmas morning if you'd been listening Carl
John I probably did cause we didn't have a lot of nothing
I remember we drug one ole firecracker around and wore it out we were afraid to light it
Things in Lake County wasn't too bright but kind of like Marshall said we kind of filled up on love around that time of the year
That's when the crops was all out and eh I remember my folks my mom and dad kind of pinched the pennies
And that's when we got our new overall britches
I kind of strutted around pretty good on Christmas Day with those on
But Christmas to me is a sad and a warm time of the year
We did a lot of singing that's about all we had
And that wasn't too good
But there's a lot of sweet memories over in Lake County for me

[Verse 1]
How I miss that old fashioned Christmas!
Carols being sung by the tree
Window's candlelight shining bright for the whole world to see
Children's eyes of sweet expectations
Wondering what each present will hold
Lying in their beds and impatient
On long Christmas eves of old
It used to be that all the family would gather for this one night
It used to be that special feeling shared together knowing Christmas was here one night a
Year
How I miss that old fashioned Christmas!
Memories that last through the years
Call me sentimental; don't mind if you do
I wish an old fashioned Christmas to you!@song: at the end of a song
They tell me
Somewhere this life isn't crazy
But I've travelled the world far and wide
And I say they're wrong
Don't sell me
Stories that music's a lady
It's not when the singer's alone
At the end of a song

[Chorus]
At the end of a song
There's no one
After the last note is played
Only the memory stays
Then even that fades away
And there's nothing so hard
As convincing your heart
That you should start singing again

[Verse 2]
You told me
Nothing could change perfect lovers
But like every promise you made
It broke before long
It's lonely
Falling away from each other
But we've come to the last of your words
And the end of a song

[Chorus]

[Verse]
You know when I was a kid at the end of that Christmas day like Carl says
We were all tired from chasing somebody else's bicycle
Or running up and down the road or something
But I remember you know one of the biggest blessings
That I can remember from Christmas time was a radio
Like all year you know radio back then you didn't hear Christmas carols on every
There wouldn't every street corners there wouldn't street corners
And there weren't choral groups running up and down the road
In front of your house singing Christmas carols
And it's something that we take for granted now, but when I was a kid
It was a real privilege and a treat to hear Christmas carol
And about the end of Christmas day when we were all tired
And we'd had all we could eat
I remember sitting down and turning on the radio
And hearing the Christmas carols played on the radio stations all around
That we picked up in Northeast Arkansas
And it was a real thrill if we could hear a song like this

[Verse 1]
Well, have you seen my dark-haired girl?
She was set on her love to a hungry world
They got her clothes and the money she took
And they wrote her name in the prison books

[Chorus]
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my dark-haired girl?
She's tired and cold and you got the gold
She took from a hungry world
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my dark-haired girl?

[Verse 2]
Well have seen my green eyed son?
He shot a man down with a sawed off gun
And they fond him down by the Pontchartrain
Where they cuffed his arms with a big iron chain

[Chorus]
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free me green eyed son?
I heard him say as you let him away
Sorry for what he's done
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free me green eyed son?

[Verse 3]
Well have you missed my brother man?
He took a little money with a gun in his hand
Know the kids are hungry and the wife isn't well
And the daddy's locked up in a prison cell

[Chorus]
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my brother man?
I know it's sad but he isn't bad
He's doing the best he can
Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my brother man?
Jacob Green got busted for possession
Next morning early he appeared in court
But he was sent to jail to wait to be trialed at some later date
Next morning early, there came a sad report

At the jail they took away his clothes to shame him
And to make sure Jacob Green had no pride left
They cut of all his hair today they found him hanging there
Afraid to face the day he killed himself

It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen

It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done

Jacob's father hired a team of lawyers
Inspections and long inquiries were held
The sheriff then retired and the papers said two guards were fired
They put a brand new coat of paint on Jacob's cell
But like a tomb that looks so white and shiny
Inside you'll find corruption never seen
And somewhere out there tonight in a dirty cell without a light
There will be locked up another Jacob Green

It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen

It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done
It could be someone that you love gets done
Like Jacob Green got done

[Verse]
Some men spend a lifetime in the hope they can devise
A chart which will an able man then someday analyze
The wretched men who stumble then somehow cannot arise
They'll pay one man to draw the charts another to declare
What secret signs are in the lines but do they really care
That one is long and one is short and one line is not there
For charts or abstract documents that cannot have a soul
They cannot tell why this man fell and that one reached his goal
Nor can they tell why some rebel and lose all self control
I think a thousand years from now as it was long ago
Two roads will be for all to see but which way will man go
Will he arise toward the skies to reach for some new plateau
Will he devise a brave new world a world thus far unknown
Will he plow under all the seeds of greed and hate he sewn
Or will he steal the very field he plants his hopes upon
As long as there are two such roads a man can look upon
As long as some men linger deep within the twilight zone
The weak will always take the road that leads to wall of stone
There should be made a stone blockade torn from the prison stone
And make a wall across all roads man should not walk upon
And let the seeds of bitter weeds grow till that road is gone
Then those who sot in higher power those who hold the might
Could then direct the hordes of men on to the way that's right
And then the men who draw the charts would also see the light

[Verse]
In a vine covered
Shack in the mountains
Bravely fighting
The battle of time
There's a dear one
Who's wept
Through life's sorrows
It's that silver
Haired daddy of mine

[Chorus]

[x2]
If I could recall
All the heartaches
Dear old daddy
I've caused you to bear
If I could erase
Those lines from your face
And bring back
The gold to your hair
If God would but
Grant me the power
Just to turn back
The pages of time
I would give all
I own just to put a tone
To that silver
Haired daddy of mine

[Verse 1]
You gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
You gave me a song I learned to sing
You showed me some beauty through the windows of your soul
And you showed me a world I've never seen

[Chorus 1]
Each giving to the other love and giving it away
We spent the precious time we knew was borrowed
Because you gave me the courage to live with yesterday
And you gave me tomorrow

[Verse 2]
You brought me a candle to light my way to bed
You erased those shadows I'd been seeing
You brought me a pillow to rest my weary head
You taught me a gentle way of dreaming

[Chorus 2]
And even if you leave me I'll be richer when you go
I'm richer with the loving gift you gave me
Because you gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
And you gave me a baby

[Intro]
City jail, city jail like an old scared dog, I tuck my tail
Bow my head and not a careless word is said
Got to sleep on the floor once more at city jail

[Verse 1]
Well I was hanging round the bus station
Minding my own business like I always do
When I saw this waitress in this bus station cafe
And I thought I check out the action like I always do
I'd give her the bad eye and made a few choices personal comments
About what I thought mine and her possibilities could be for a team
When she called the badge on me
The badge grabbed me by the arm and he said
What are you doing hanging around here for
And I said for whatever's going around

[Chorus]
City jail, city jail

[Verse 2]
He said no what I mean is what are you doing
Saying things like that to that lady
And I said what's that lady's doing with purple hair
Well the badge said, you're smart Alec and I said, no I am not, I'm just hungry
And he said you're acting like a smart Alec
And I said, no that's how I act when I get hungry

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well he put me outside in a dark corner
And before you could say hypocrite he hit me on the head
And I said, oh don't hit me on the head
I can't protect myself with the handcuffs on
Please don't hit me on the head then he hit me again, he hit me again, he hit me again
And I said, oh oh oh oh oh please, don't stand on my feet when you hit me
I break my ankles when I fall

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Well about that time they threw me in the wagon
And that waitress walked out with a sailor
I said, hey you, not you I'm talking to the purple people eater
Yes you lady, quote, you're the cause of it all, unquote
Then she said to that sailor said get me away from that horrible man, Harry

[Outro]
City jail, city jail
Well as they hauled me away I said, everybody have a nice evening

[Verse 1]
He drinks a cup of coffee and way before the sun he's up and going
Out on a work detail cause he knows soon the morning whistle will begin to blowing
All day out in that hot sun with no reward for any work he'll do
And then he'll come back in the evening
And dreams a lot of dreams that can't come true

[Chorus]
This is the life of a prisoner forgotten man that's there to stay
He lives on faith and hope and courage and a few old dreams of yesterday

[Verse 2]
Well no one cares about him or it seems at way to him as time goes by
One day is like the other and every time he prays he prays to die
He's been there for so long now he wouldn't know how to talk to men outside
And though it's the life he lives for he fears the day the gates swing open wide

[Chorus]
This is the life of a prisoner
He lives on faith and hope and courage and a few old dreams of yesterday

[Verse 1]
A cold bitter mist covers your eyes torment is raging in you
But you can't change the smallest part of all the wrongs you've done
Looking back in anger like you do

[Chorus]
I'm not preaching I'm just talking but I believe in what I say
That look of anger that you keep flashing won't
Accomplish you anything today
Reach out your hand someone will take it
Someone took mine then I saw a different view
I saw it'd take take a lot more loving
And a lot less looking back in anger like you do

[Verse 2]
You're still a victim of the pornographic past
The smutty face of evil showing through
But you can't take away the scars that you put on that face
Looking back in anger like you do

[Chorus]
Now I am not preaching I'm just talking but I believe in what I say
That look of anger that you keep flashing won't accomplish you anything today
Reach out your hand someone will take it
Someone took mine then I saw a different view
I saw it'd take take a lot more loving
And a lot less looking back in anger like you do
I got a crib full of corn and a turning plow
But the ground's too wet for the hopper now
Got a cultivator and a double tree
A leather line for the haw and gee
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
I'm doing alright for country trash

I'm saving up dimes for a rainy day
I got about a dollar laid away
The wind's from the south and the fishing's good
Got a potbelly stove a cord of wood
Mama turns the left-overs into hash
I'm doing alright for country trash

I got a mackinaw wand a hunting dog
A cap I ordered from the catalog
A big tall tree that shades the yard
A big fat sow for the winter's lard
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
I'm doing alright for country trash
Well there's not much new ground left to plow
And crops need fertilizing now
My hands don't earn me too much gold
For security when I grow old
But we'll all be equal under the grass
And God's got a heaven for country trash
And God's got a heaven for country trash
I'll be doing alright for country trash

[Verse 1]
It all started out in Illinois with a woman that I thought was just my own
She saw a new tie and a new shirt kicked her heels and flipped her skirt
Slammed that door and left me standing all alone
They had a love nest in his new club there went my wife all over town
As I watched it I got green and with my drinking I got mean
Stuck a match and burned that club right to the ground

[Chorus]
And I spent nine months in the hole lying there in solitaire
And nobody cared nobody cared nobody cared

[Verse 2]
There was a screw out in the hall that had me backed up to the wall
Escorting me with a water pistol in that 36 degrees
With me shivering to my knees I am not going to forget about that water pistol
If I've been bad you think that'll make me better
If I've been a sinner you think that'll make me a saint no it isn’t
Freedom come and I found him made him take off
All his clothes and socks and shoes
Had him scrambling on the floor trying to make it to the door
Crying crawling screaming bloody murder too
Well I didn't really kill him though over his whole world there hung a paw
I made him bend over on his knees and to his screams of Owen please
Took my turpentine water pistol and I let him have it all

[Chorus]
Because I spent nine months
And nobody cared nobody cared nobody cared

[Verse 1]
Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Laying soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Until the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night

[Chorus 1]
I don't care what's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend

[Chorus 2]
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
Lord, it's bad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

[Verse 1]
Lord, she's restless
Like cotton candy clouds that sail the day
Slow an' free
And she possesses
A mind that can't resign itself to stay
For long with me
Thought I've tried and tried to keep her tied and satisfied
Until she really needs me
Yes I do
But when that certain look comes on her face
I can't replace it, and she leaves me

[Chorus]
She's a butterfly in mid July
Who just can't wait to try her brand new wings
On brand new things
And she needs no rhyme or reason, when she goes
Her mind is on what lies beyond that wall of blue horizon
I suppose
And heaven knows
She'll go sailing off on any old wind that blows
Yes she will, yes she will
She'll go sailing off on any old wind that blows

[Verse 2]
I know she needs me
About as much as I need someone else
Which I don't
And if need be
I swear someday I'll up and leave myself
Which I won't
Even if she loved another man, I'd understand it more than I do
Mmm
But I know the only reason
That she ever had for leaving, is she wants to

[Chorus]
She's a butterfly in mid July
Who just can't wait to try her brand new wings
On brand new things
And she needs no rhyme or reason, when she goes
Her mind is on what lies beyond that wall of blue horizon
I suppose
And heaven knows
She'll go sailing off on any old wind that blows
Yes she will, yes she will
She'll go sailing off on any old wind that blows

[Intro]
Up in Kentucky they make a whiskey
They call a Kentucky straight whiskey
And up in Kentucky I married a woman
That I bet she is a better woman
Than that whiskey is whiskey
I call her my Kentucky straight

[Verse 1]
I've rambled round the countryside, I've drifted near and far
I've been off to seek my fortune, I've been following every star
I've rode the devil's highway, the hellbound interstate
But now I'm back at happy shack with my Kentucky straight

[Chorus]
And we rise up every morning with the chicken
And every minute we're alive we're living
She's a little bit old fashioned, but her lovin's up to date
And I'm happy here with my Kentucky straight

[Verse 2]
I had looked for satisfaction in the arms of quite a few
And I've done everything that I was big enough to do
But everywhere I see her face from Maine to golden gate
And I knew that this is where it's at with my Kentucky straight

[Chorus]
And we rise up every morning with the chicken
And every minute we're alive we're living
I love her so she knows that it was worth a while to wait
Cause I'm happy here with my Kentucky straight

[Verse 1]
The good earth swallows up the seed and swallows life as well
From long before the day you're born till heaven comes or hell
It binds your hands with chains of clay that are so hard to break
But when I left good earth behind I made a big mistake

[Chorus 1]
I've traveled far and traveled wide, I've seen a lot of things
But looking back on all the years, I don't know what they mean
Like steel I'm probably stronger from going through the fire
I kept on climbing lower, digging deeper to get higher

[Verse 2]
I turned around one evening when the sun was going down
I heard the Bible told a preacher who just pulled into town
At last I'm back on good earth where I should have always been
Lord forgive me if I ever try to leave good earth again

[Chorus 2]
Well the good earth was my mama and my daddy too
Now I'm working my hands in soil trying to pay my due
And when I'll breathe my last breath which may not be too long
Just shovel a little good earth over my head
Tell everybody to open up the hymn book and sing a happy song

[Bridge]
Shall we gather at the river in the sweet by and by
Just as I am Jesus loves me one of these days I'll fly
I'm standing on the promises Lord build the place for me
In the good earth over Jordan by the Sea of Galilee

[Verse 1]
An old man on his deathbed once said to me
You are the master of your destiny

[Chorus 1]
A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
But a man's not all good nor all bad
When the chips are all down and your back's at the wall
You're the best friend that you've ever had
You're the best friend that you've ever had

[Verse 2]
So you laugh when it's time to laugh
And you cry when it's time to cry
Live while it's time to live
'Cause you'll die when it's time to die
Then he closed his eyes and he left me alone
This old man's wisdom brought his meaning home

[Chorus 1]
A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
But a man's not all good nor all bad
When the chips are all down and your back's at the wall
You're the best friend that you've ever had
You're the best friend that you've ever had

[Verse 3]
So you laugh when it's time to laugh
And you cry when it's time to cry
Live while it's time to live
'Cause you'll die when it's time to die
Well now that I'm older I found this is true
The thing that remains is the good that you do

[Chorus 1]
A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
But a man's not all good nor all bad
When the chips are all down and your back's at the wall
God's the best friend that you've ever had
God's the best friend that you've ever had

[Verse 2]
So you laugh when it's time to laugh
And you cry when it's time to cry
Live while it's time to live
'Cause you'll die when it's time to die

[Intro]
I dedicate this song to the working man
For every man that puts in
Eight or ten hard hours a day of work and toil and sweat
Always got somebody looking down his neck
Trying to get more out of him
Than he really ought to have to put in

[Verse 1]
After twenty-nine long years of working in this shop
With Oney standing over me
Today when that old whistle blows
I'll check in all my gear and I'll retire
The superintendent just dropped by
And said they'd planned my little get together
Then he said I'd never a made it
If old Oney hadn't held me to the fire

[Verse 2]
I've seen him in my dreams at night
And woke up in the morning feeling tired
And old Oney don't remember
When I came here, how he tried to get me fired
With his folded hands behind him
Every morning Oney waited at the gate
Where he'd rant and rave like I committed murder
Clocking in five minutes late

[Verse 3]
But today they'll gather 'round me
Like I've seen them do when any man retires
Then old Oney's going to tell me
From now on I'm free to do what I desire
He'll present me with that little old gold watch
They give a man at times like this
But there's one thing he's not counting on
Today's the day I give old Oney his

[Verse 4]
I've been working, building muscles
Oney's just been standing around a getting soft
And today about four-thirty
I'll make up for every good night's sleep I've lost
When I'm gone I'll be remembered
As the working man who put his point across
With a right hand full of knuckles
Because today I show old Oney who's the boss

[Outro]
Hmmmm! What time is it? Four thirty!
Hey, Oney!
Oney! Ha ha ha ha!

[Spoken Word Intro]
One time I went down to Jamaica, to a place called Rose Hall Plantation. They grow a lot of sugarcane and tomatoes and things at Rose Hall now. It used to be just a sugarcane plantation back in the days of slavery. And they tell stories about the place and about the great house at Rose Hall, that many, many years ago, there came from the country of Haiti a lady named Annie Palmer who lived in that great house there. And she was the mistress of the plantation. She was the boss. Her word was law. Well, they tell a lot of tales about Annie. They say she had three husbands, one at a time, I guess. But they also tell tales about Annie and the slaves. There were about 5,000 slaves on the plantation. She had her favorites and she had the ones that weren't her favorites. Well, down on the sea, there are three tall palm trees waving in the breeze, and they say that maybe Annie Palmer's three husbands are buried under those palm trees...

[Verse 1]
On the island of Jamaica, quite a long long time ago
At Rose Hall Plantation, where the ocean breezes blow
Lived a girl named Annie Palmer, the mistress of the place
And the slaves all lived in fear to see a frown on Annie's face

[Chorus]
Where’s your husband Annie, where's number two and three?
Are they sleeping beneath the palms beside the Caribbean sea?
At night I hear you riding and I hear your lovers call
And I still can feel your presence round the great house at Rose Hall

[Verse 2]
Well if you should ever go to see the great house at Rose Hall
There's expensive chairs and china and great paintings on the wall
They'll show you Annie's sitting room and the whipping post outside
But they won't let you see the room where Annie's husbands died

[Chorus]
Where’s your husband Annie, where's number two and three?
Are they sleeping beneath the palms beside the Caribbean sea?
At night I hear you riding and I hear your lovers call
And I still can feel your presence round the great house at Rose Hall

[Verse 1]
So you're feeling numb about me being gone
So you see now you're half alive when you're alone
Well I just hope the pain will ease a little as you wait
You gave me love but too little too late

[Chorus]
Dark days are coming now you see
Hard times for you as well as me
All time low is coming under your front gate
You gave me love but too little too late

[Verse 2]
So you got plans about some fine affair
Well think about it a little while while you're lying there
Love long and hard and don't make your lover wait
You gave me love but too little too late

[Chorus]
Dark days are coming now you see
Hard times for you as well as me
All time low is coming under your front gate
You gave me love but too little too late

[Outro]
You gave me love but too little too late

[Verse 1]
If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the morning
I'd hammer in the evening all over this land
I'd hammer out danger, I'd hammer out a warning
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

[Verse 2]
If I had a bell, I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening all over this land
I'd ring out danger, I'd ring out a warning
I'd ring out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

[Verse 3]
If I had a song, I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening all over this land
I'd sing out danger, I'd sing out a warning
I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

[Verse 4]
Well I've got a hammer and I've got a bell
And I've got a song to sing all over this land
It's the hammer of justice, it's the bell of freedom
It's the song about love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

[Verse 1]
Well I used think the color of love would be a
Rosy red or a pretty pink And I thought it would
Be a thirsty man crawling home to get a big old
Drink And I thought love was spelled like a bell
B-E-double L bell that you ring Stead of wham bam
Hit your man with a pan Hit him on the head hear
The birdies sing

[Chorus]
Oh you heart breaking love making cut
Me-a-piece-of-bacon man of mine And you money
Shifting flour sifting nose lifting rose of woman
Kind Just keep on doing what you're doing what
You're doing suits me just fine And love I tell
You something else you blow my mind

[Verse 2]
Well I used to think the color of love would be a
Soft green like a pea in a pod And I thought love
Would strike like a light flashing down a big old
Lightning rod And I thought love was spelled
W-E-double L well that would never run dry Stead
Of choke choke I'm so broke and dry I can't afford
A little bitty tear to cry

[Chorus]
Oh you money turning egg churning butter burning
Baby of mine You half crazy lean and lazy pretty
As a wilted daisy man of mine Just keep on
Doing... You blow my mind you blow my mind you
Blow my mind you blow my mind

[Verse]
When the sun goes down in Nashville go out that Memphis highway
Between Centerville and Dickson on the gravel roads and byways
They'll be running off the shine that will be bringing in the bounty
Saturday night in Hickman County
At the beer joint on the black top country music's playing steady
And the working men are drinking and they're rough and they are ready
And the girl behind the counter who has all the boys a buzzing
Will be leaving with her husband Saturday night in Hickman County
Down upon the Piney River parked beside the pretty water
In the backseat of a Chevy is your next door neighbor's daughter
They have split up into pairs the four that went off dating double
Getting that poor girl into trouble Saturday night in Hickman County
All the farmers in the valley will be sitting by the fire
Watch the late news on the TV then they'll quietly retire
Thankful just to be a living thankful that tomorrow's Sunday
Sorry that the next day's Monday Saturday night in Hickman County
Saturday night in Hickman County

[Verse 1]
How she got that junk car running guess I'll never know
It never ran but once and set to winters in the snow
Well imagine running out on me when I lay sound asleep Allegheny
Well my big mistake was thinking she was something I could keep
She stole my winter's food supply and something else I fear
My saving’s in the mattress have strangely disappeared
Now those who know me best knows he who robs me best beware Allegheny
I'm going to call up the dogs and hunt you down drag you back here by the hair

[Chorus]
Oh Allegheny something tells me you're dis-satisfied
Well could it be because I've been your mail-order bride
There's a half of you that's French yeah and I need to crave a better style
And a half of you is Cherokee yeah and I've gone wild Allegheny

[Verse 2]
She's got a head start on me as a crow flies half a day
And unless I miss my guess she'll stop to rest in Monterey
But if I take the Knoxville Highway thirteen hours it will be Allegheny
Well she forgot I knew the shortcut I'll be there in less than three

[Chorus]
Oh Allegheny something tells me

[Verse 3]
I signaled for my dogs to wait outside the hotel door
I described her to the desk clerk he said try the second floor
And then he mentioned she's got company
And that marks the stranger’s doom Allegheny
I wish I was her so I could see my face when I bust into the room

[Chorus]
Oh Allegheny something tells me
Allegheny Allegheny come back here Allegheny Allegheny

[Verse 1]
I don't know how to tell her I didn't get that raise in pay today
(That's all right John)
Because I know how much she wanted that dress in Baker's window
And it breaks my heart to tell her she'll have to wait
And cancel all the plans we made to celebrate
But I just know that she can take it with a smile and not a frown

[Chorus]
Because she knows life has its little ups and downs like ponies on a merry-go-round
And no one grabs a brass ring every time but she don't mind (I don't mind)
She wears a gold ring on her finger and it's mine

[Verse 2]
Those new house plans we've had so long I guess will gather dust another year
And the daffodils are blooming that she planted way last fall upon the hill
And over by the gate God knows I hate to say again we'll have to wait
But I just know that she can take it with a smile and not a frown

[Chorus]
Because she knows life has its little ups and downs like ponies on a merry-go-round
And no one grabs a brass ring every time but she don't mind (No I don't mind)

[Outro]
She wears a gold ring on her finger and it's mine

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
15 cars and 15 restless riders
Three conductors, 25 sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out of Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passing graves that have no name, freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of rusted automobiles

[Chorus]
Good morning America, how are you?
Don't you know me? I'm your native son!
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

[Verse 2]
Dealing cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point, no one is keeping  a score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels grumbling underneath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep, rocking to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Night time on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
But all the towns & people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still have not heard the news
The conductor sings his song again
"The passengers will please refrain:
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse]
This is the story of Tweedle-O-Twist
And a cowboy that I knew named Tony
From Blithe Fresno old Sant Joe Washoe go rodeo
Pendleton Santa Ana Baker Bozeman and Burley
From Chambers to Payson Rapid City to Akron
We'd sing just to ease all the hurts that we gained
A bandage to wrap the aches and a few turns of tape
Held us together and stopped the blood stains
Well sometimes we'd draw bad and the stock wouldn't buck
And there was times when the luck wasn't going our way
But a credit card that I'd found would get us to the next town
With just a switch of his Montana plates
I remember at Evanston when a bull broke his arm
And we had to make it on into Beulah the next day
I broke out the CB and the only doctor Tony seen
Was me and a can of ether
There in the Beulah shoot gates
And it was at Louisville that I went down in the well
And a suicide wrap I held in my hand
The clown just shook his boom while I dangled near doom
It was Tony that saved my life then
Then a year from that week we pulled up at Mesquite
Where I drew number twelve from the herd
And Tony my side kick pulled Tweedle-O-Twist
That bull's famous from Prairie to Evansburg
All right now cowboys kind of clear the way
Let that ambulance through there let that ambulance on through
Looks like a pretty bad wreck out there folks
Hold up folks we go one more ride left down there in the shoots
Wait a minute it looks like they're turning ole number twelve out
So that's all for today folks
I'll finish the story of Tweedle-O-Twist
And the cowboy that I knew named Tony
From Sterling to Abilene Loveland to New Orleans
I've got a new partner traveling with me
But I never could explain why I called him the wrong name
When I get drunk I call him Tony
And sometimes he'll ask me why I pass Montana by
You know at Butte they got money
But that's where I met him my side kicking friend
I've got more than enough of his memories
For down in Mesquite there's a cowboy sleeping
Where bulls aren't a bucking isn’t a bucking old Tony

[Verse]
I lean my back against you thinking you were an oak
I knew the wind could bent you but I can't believe you broke
Now the wind could never break me only your false love
Honey I've been true I swear by God above
I thought you were a willow but you never wept for me
You went roaming in the wildwood like a ship that roams the see
The willow tree is fickle and it weeps in the morning dew
My love is a pine tree cause that's the only tree that's true
If I was mistaken then take my eyes away
You made a bed in the wildwood and that's where I saw you lay
Honey your eyes deceived you it's true I touched the ground
But I never slept there I never let my long hair down mhm
Love is like a thorn bush touch it and you will find
You'll prick your fingers and leave the sweetest flower behind
Love oh love oh what you done to me
You set me a drifting like a ship upon the sea
Yes a ship there is I see you and you belong to me
My love is the ocean and deeper love cannot be
Yeah well I guess I was mistaken and woman I want you back
You never have left my heart now honey baby that's a fact
Come to me pine tree and we will never part
We'll put our roots down in each other's heart
Come to me pine tree

[Verse]
I'm for you I'm for you I'm for anything that starts with us
You're for me you're for me that makes both of us for love
And if we're for each other we won't be bothered
By how much the world may push and shove
It makes no difference who stands against us
As long as you and I are both for love
I'm woman all over when you're around me honey I can't seem to get enough
Let's stay together like this forever and show the world that we're for love
And if we're for each other
As you and I are both for love

[Verse 1]
Well a light from the sun comes shining
Oh happy day oh happy day
And then along come a big old moon to light my way
And then the stars kind of twinkle and they light this path of mine
And mine
I can't see a thing in his world without a little Godshine

[Chorus]
Well Jesus is the beam on the left of me
Coming right through the shadow on the right
Lord all the dark corners within my soul need you fire day and night
Well the sun and the moon and the stars wouldn't even hold a candle in my life
I'm in the dark when the sun is high
I need just a little bit of Godshine

[Verse 2]
Well Jesus died and there's a lot of folks feel regret
But on the other hand there are people that are laughing yet
Laughing about a man that lived and died divine
He could have lived on but he wouldn't stop spreading that Godshine

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
I'm in the dark when the sun is high I need just a little bit of Godshine

[Verse]
I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench, an old man was sitting there
I said "Your old court house is kind of run down"
He said "Naw, it'll do for our little town"
I said "Your old flag pole is leaned a little bit"
And that's a ragged old flag you got hanging on it
He said "Have a seat", and I sat down
"Is this the first time you've been to our little town?"
I said "I think it is"
He said "I don't like to brag, but we're kind of proud of
That Ragged Old Flag
You see, we got a little hole in that flag there
When Washington took it across the Delaware
And It got powder burned the night Francis Scott Key sat watching it
Writing Say Can You See
It got a rip in New Orleans, with Packingham & Jackson
Tugging at its seams
And It almost fell at the Alamo
Beside the Texas flag
But she waved on though
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
There was Robert E. Lee and Beauregard and Bragg
And the south wind blew hard on
That Ragged Old Flag
On Flanders Field in World War I
She got a big hole from a Bertha Gun
She turned blood red in World War II
She hung limp, and low, a time or two
She was in Korea, Vietnam, She went where she was sent
By her Uncle Sam
She waved from our ships upon the briny foam
And now they've about quit waving back here at home
In her own good land here She's been abused
She's been burned, dishonored, denied an' refused
And the government for which she stands
Has been scandalized throughout out the land
And she's getting thread bare, and she's wearing thin
But she's in good shape, for the shape she's in
Because she's been through the fire before
And I believe she can take a whole lot more"

[Outro]
So we raise her up every morning
And we bring her down slow every night
We don't let her touch the ground
And we fold her up right
On second thought
I do like to brag
Because  I'm mighty proud of
That Ragged Old Flag

[Verse 1]
Your mama used to worry about that big muddy river
Honey do you remember
You let the screen door slam when you stepped off the front porch
Then your mama calling don't be late
And I'd hear your daddy holler, Son she's my only daughter
You'd stick your nose in the honeysuckle down by the gate
I could still hear your mama calling, don't go near the water

[Chorus]
We fell right in
Went over our head
But we didn't go near the water
Nothing beats the young and sweet
And the nights got hotter and hotter
We were sure enough getting our feet wet mama
But we didn't go near the water

[Verse 2]
We'd hear the rocking chair squeaking
As you sneaked up the back stairs
Mama waiting like a grizzly bear
Had to get the honeysuckle out of your hair
But in the morning light
You'd look her right in the eye
It wasn't a lie
We didn't go near the water

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Your mama used to worry about that big muddy river
She should have worried about me

[Outro]
Because we were sure enough getting our feet wet, mama
But we didn't go near the water
Didn't go near the water
Didn't go near the water yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, I asked an old truck driver
About life out on the road
If he does a lot of singing
When he's bringing in his load
If there's a pretty waitress crying for him
Every hundred miles
If he gets a lot of loving
If he has a lot of smiles
And I asked him if those trucking songs
Tell about a life like his
He said, if you want to know the truth about it
Here's the way it is

[Pre-Chorus]
All I do is drive, drive, drive
Try to stay alive
And keep my mind on my load
Keep my eye upon the road

[Chorus]
I got nothing in common with any man
Who's home every day at five
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive

[Verse 2]
Well, we shared a cup of coffee
Then I had to warm it up
And his greasy fingers trembled
As he held onto the cup
And I said, don't you hear a lot of music
See a lot of sights
But if you'll tune into the Grand Ole Opry
Saturday night
I will dedicate you a trucking song
To which you can relate
He said, you just do the singing
And I'll do the driving mate

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If I can get the fuel
Fuel

[Verse 1]
I've been a thrill seeking rambler
And often came into this town
But the thrills were too high for my little sky
So I dug in and I've settled down
And I got a good job in Nashville
No way they can pay me enough
For grinding up tobacco leaves
Making brute and snuff

[Chorus]
Southern comfort is killing me

[Verse 2]
I'm slowly choking in Tennessee
I shovel the snuff until late afternoon
Then I crawl with the traffic and I choke on its fumes
And fall on the face when I get to my room

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I met a woman in Nashville
For a while we were carrying on
She'd washed snuff out of my shirts every night
And keep me with clean ones on
But I guess she got tired of tobacco
At least of the regular kind
Now I'm still working where nicotine
And memories are burning in my mind

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
The Cumberland cannot inherit each bee
I'm sniffing and dipping and living alone
I smell funny smoke and I know where she's gone
She's in some other county now proving her own

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Chorus]
If you going to be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill

[Verse 1]
If you going to be king of the hill
You can't make it at the cotton mill
Get put on at the Harlan mine
Be the last one out at quitting time
You already working when the whistle blew
Never complain about a job to do
When they say who can, you say I will
If you ever going to be king of the hill

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You need a good woman to share your bed
To keep you loved and to keep you fed
To help you to face another day
To get you up and on your way
Where the golden rule don't rule out true
You do to them before they do to you
Watch out for yourself or nobody will
If you ever going to be king of the hill

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Saturday night you go to Harlan town
You shoot some pool and you fool around
You watch the girls and you drink bootleg
Get starved to death before you beg
You trust in luck till your luck is gone
Then jump right in and you hang right on
There may be times you would have to kill
If you ever going to be king of the hill

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
When the last of the coals out of every vein
Had long been gone on the northbound train
Walk up to the top and if you're standing still
You can call yourself king of the hill
But if you fall like a lot have done
By accident or knife or gun
When they lay you high on the mountain still
You can call yourself king of the hill

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
From the day of your birth
It's bread and water here on earth
To a child of light, to a child of light

[Chorus 1]
But there'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright

[Chorus 2]
There'll be pie in the sky
By and by when I die
And it'll be alright, it'll be alright

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I doubt in fear
That I've really gained salvation here
For it's out of sight, for it's out of sight

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
He said if I do His will
There's a promise He'd fulfill
And He's gone now to prepare
Me a mansion out there

[Chorus 2]

[x3]

[Outro]
There'll be pie in the sky

[Verse 1]
On the park bench I slept on
Raindrops are falling on the newspapers covering me
I hear early morning motors
And I know the world is waking for the dawn
But my mind's down a dark alley
Somewhere last night you loved me
And in the early morning chill, my arms remember still
But I'm dropping like a stone lonesome to the bone

[Chorus]
The sun is roughly rising on the roofs of Stagger town
The time for sweating poison out is just now coming around
The high time of last midnight is over with and gone
Leaving me to be lonesome to the bone

[Verse 2]
I walked away the wind blows
And any way the wind goes will be good enough for me
The streets are loud and crowded
But I walk my weary way lost and alone
Your hot breath and your laughter
Keep flashing through my mind to warm me
But the naked light of day soon makes it fade away
And I'm dropping like a stone lonesome to the bone

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Laying around home with a ball game on
Feeling fairly fine
Blackberry jam is cooking in the pan
And the jam and the cook are mine
I like my honey from the hives of home
And berries from my old vine

[Chorus]
And I like to get my loving
While I got it on my mind

[Verse 2]
My dog is asleep at my bare feet
It's a good day for laying around
Just her and me and it's Saturday
Everybody's gone to town
We've been working hard and she gets tired
That puts me in a bind

[Chorus]
Because I like to get my loving
While I got it on my mind

[Verse 3]
Then she looks at me and I can see
That old familiar look
And the jam is sweet as she lowers the heat
To give it time to cook
Then I lock the door and across the floor
To my queen of woman kind

[Chorus]
Yeah, I like to get my loving
While I got it on my mind

[Verse 4]
Now boys don't you be ramble and free
And leaving the girls to cry
Because  the nights get cold and there isn’t no gold
That'll ever satisfy
And there isn’t no joy that'll come to you boys
Like the kind I've known at times
When I go right on in that lover
While I got in on my mind

[Outro]
Yeah, I like to get my loving
While I got in on my mind

[Verse 1]
He's not on some golden throne way off and out of space
He's not hiding out in some big secret hiding place
I can guarantee he'll be your friend to touch and hold
And I'm qualified to tell it cause I've got it in control

[Chorus]
Good morning friend good morning friend
Every day's a brand new morning since the morning you will din
Good morning friend good morning friend
Yes I'm feeling like a million since I've got you living in

[Verse 2]
He'll stand and knock upon your door do you let him inside
He'll be a constant comforter and keep you satisfied
He will make himself available no matter who you are
He'll light your darkest night and be your bright and morning star

[Chorus]
Good morning friend good morning friend
Yes I'm feeling like a million since the morning you moved in
Good morning friend good morning friend
Ask me how I feel this morning and I'm proud to say again
Good morning friend good morning friend
Yes I'm feeling like a million since I've got you living in

[Intro]
(Worried man) (Papa is a worried man)
(Worried man) (Papa is a worried man)

[Verse 1]
The place I go to draw my pay
Closed the door on me today
Told me just to stay away
And don't come back again
Ah: I told my Mama: Baby, don't you cry
I'll get a job before the day go by
I don't know where, and that is why

[Chorus]
I'm a worried man. (Worried)
Worried man, a worried man
(Worried) (Worried)
I'm a very worried man

[Verse 2]
Hungry babies don't understand
And their Papa is a worried man
Papa is a worried man. (Play it, Johnny) (Yeah)
There is no way that I can see
That I can feed my family, (That's sad)
I don't own a money tree
An' I don't own no land
Now listen: I've got muscle and I've got brains
I don't mind the sun an' the rain
I got to make a little change

[Chorus]
As I'm a worried, worried, worried man, ooh. (Worried)
Worried man, a worried man
(Worried.) (Worried.)
I'm a very worried man. (Worried man)

[Outro]
Hungry babies don't understand
And their Papa is a worried man
Their Papa is a worried man. (Take it: take it)
(That's it, (That's it, that's it, that's it)
(Ok, do it: go Willie)
(Worried man, worried man)
(Papa is a worried man)
(Worried man, worried man)

[Verse]
I've been in jail eleven years and parole has just come through
The gates will soon swing open wide but I'm not going through
Jail's the only home I know or care to know about
Please let me stay where I belong please don't let me out
How could I tell those friends of mine they've seen the last of me
Can't I make you understand I never can be free
Because that's a big unfriendly world and I don't know the route
That leads to where I may belong please don't let me out
I had to learn to get along without a lot of things
And I had to learn to live with the loneliness confinement brings
And I learnt to take no mail from home or whatever came about
Now I'm dug in and I'm happy here please don't let me out

[Outro]
How could I tell those friends of mine
Yes that's a big unfriendly world

[Verse 1]
Did you walk another mile, turn a frown with a smile?
Did you lift the lowly heart about to break?
Would you also give your cloak to one who took away your coat?
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake?

[Chorus]
Did you feed the poor in spirit and befriend the prosecuted?
Will you show the bounds that all the chains can break?
Did you sow the proper seed? Are you keeping out the weeds?
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake?

[Verse 2]
Will you be one of the meek, did you turn the other cheek?
Would you give a little more than you would take?
Did you shine your little light upon the children of the night?
What on earth will you do for heaven's sake?

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Turpentine and dandelion wine
I've turned the corner, and I'm doing fine
Shooting at the birds on the telephone line
Picking them off with this gun o' mine
Got a fire in my belly and a fire in my head
Going higher and higher until I'm dead
Sister Sue is short and stout
She didn't grow up, she grew out
Mamma says she's plain, but she's just being kind
Papa thinks she's pretty, but he's almost blind
Don't let her out much except at night
But I don't care because I'm all right

[Chorus]
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Young folks roll on the floor
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Keep them hard times away from my door

[Verse 2]
Brother Gene is big and mean
And he don't have much to say
He had a little woman who he whooped each day
But now she's gone away
Got drunk last night, kicked mamma down the stairs
But I'm all right, so I don't care

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Turpentine and dandelion wine
I've turned the corner, an' I'm doing fine
Shooting at the birds on the telephone line
Picking them off with this gun o' mine
Got a fire in my belly and a fire in my head
Going higher and higher until I'm dead

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times, come again no more

[Chorus]
It’s the song, the sign of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh hard times, come again no more

[Verse 2]
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times, come again no more

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
With a worn heart, whose better days are o'er
Though her voice it would be merry, its sighing all the day
Oh, hard times, come again no more

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Intro]
The lady came from Baltimore and all she wore was lace
She didn't know that I was poor, she never saw my place

[Chorus]
I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none

[Verse]
The lady's name was Susan Moore, her daddy read the law
She didn't know that I was poor, and lived outside the law
Her daddy said I was a thief and didn't marry her for love
But I was Susan's true belief, and I married her for love
I was there to steal her money, to take her rings and run
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none
The house she lived in had a wall to keep the robbers out
She never stopped to think at all, that that's what I'm about

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Then I fell in love with the lady and got away with none

[Verse 1]
Virgil Caine is the name, and I served on the Danville Train
Until Stonemason cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
By May the tenth, Richmond had fell, it's a time I remember, oh so well

[Chorus]
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down, and the people were singing they went
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 2]
Back with my wife in Tennessee, when one day she called to me
Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E. Lee!
Now I don't mind chopping wood, and I don't care if the money's no good
You take what you need and you leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Like my father before me, I will work the land
Like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave, but a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat

[Chorus]
You're so close to me your body and your soul are now a part of me
We are one now, no one could ever know just what you are to me
You're so close to me your deepest, darkest secrets all belong to me
I am you, you are me, you're so close to me

[Verse 1]
And in the morning I can look into your eyes and know your feelings
We can talk to one another without speaking
And if it's loving that you're going to know it
Your sweet eyes show it every morning

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
And in the evening I can feel your gentle softness without touching you
I don't need another thing I've got so much in you
And if it's loving that you're going to give it
I'm going to live it every evening

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Well now she isn’t exactly what you'd call your all American girl
And some too many truckers took her home
And I'll admit her life would read just like a paperback
And some of what she's done I've said it's wrong
But I said clean your own tables boys and bring out your beer
Because she isn’t going to do it this time
And drink to a use to be barmaid because she's a lady I choose to be mine
And I am not exactly been what you call your all American boy
I've done my time in Frisco in LA
How some of youth are taking pride in what I am
I heard you cussing this decision that I've made
But I said clean your own tables
And I'll admit her life would read just like a paperback
And some of what she's done well I say is wrong
But I said clean your own tables
Boys if you're able clean your own tables and let me take care of mine

[Verse 1]
Wagon wheels are turning with cobble colored sound
When me and little Tommy rode the first load in the town
The cotton gin was ginning out the pennies for the pounds
Like a giant vacuum cleaner sucking let up off the ground

[Chorus]
Our freckled faces sparkled then like diamonds in the rough
With smiles it smells of snaggleteeth and good old Garett snuff
If I could I would be trading all this fat back for the lean
When Jesus was our Savior and cotton was our king

[Verse 2]
This kind of life we're living beats all I've ever seen
Seems some of us was born for picking things and eaten beans
Still I reckon girl or digging fairly well in our means
Because Jesus was our Savior and cotton was our king

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

[Chorus]
Someone like you makes it hard to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
Never think about myself

[Verse 2]
If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd try to leave all the past behind
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

[x3]

[Verse 1]
Morning found me lying on a floor in New Orleans
Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans
Feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues
And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina
Met her on an ocean liner, called her Cocaine Carolina
She was quite a lady then and I was twenty two
God knows how much I adored her, I just never could afford her
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?

[Chorus]
So goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag, she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?

[Verse 2]
Oh someone said if I was lucky I could go back to Kentucky
Lexington was famous for it's bluegrass and its hills
Carolina, we should get up, don't you know we'll have to split up?
Maybe I should go to California

[Chorus]
So goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag, she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?

So goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag, she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?

Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag, she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey
Cocaine Carolina, how did I get hooked on you?

Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina, you and I are through
I'm going back to Sandy Scag, she knows just what to do
She don't love me for my money

[Verse 1]
Early in the misty misty morning heading for another freeway jam
Sleepy eyed and shivering waking up and wishing it was Sunday I wish it was Sunday
On the radio they're playing love songs songs that make me want to turn around
Factory gates are up ahead. I wished that I was home in bed
With you, right now, back home with you, right now

[Chorus]
But I work to make a living and I work without a break
And I work when I am sleeping and I work when I'm awake
Yes and I'd like to leave the city but I can't afford to move
And I think I'm going under with them way down lowdown smokey factory blues

[Verse 2]
I was born a lover not a worker
Money doesn't smell like sweet perfume
Some of us feel out of place-engine oil upon our face
Believe me you better believe me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yes. I work to make a living and I work without a break
And I work when I am sleeping and I work when I'm awake
Yes and I'd like to leave the city but I can't afford to move(Fade)

[Verse]
You shined your light so I could see that life was more than a chore
When I came up against the wall you said I am the door
You gave me reason to believe in you now I believe it even more
I've never met a man like you before
You gave me back my pride so I could wear it for all the world to see
You told me if my yesterdays were paid for tomorrow is free
From now until I die I know I won't be lonely anymore
I've never met a man like you before
And if all of my dreams turn to dust before my eyes
And all of my songs remain unsung
If all the world can offer me just emptiness and lies
I know I'll still have your perfect love
Stormy weather comes and goes some of my old friends got washed away
But you're an Island of refuge on your solid rock I found my place
If worldly riches failed me but I have you how can I be poor
I've never met a man like you before

[Verse]
Nigga I'm young as a muhfucka
But money a muhfucka
Young Money muthafucka, get it in blood puddles
Shit, I'm in the south where we living in mud puddles
Shit is a drug struggle when you niggas upping prices
I hug the Glock like a turn buckle
Can't get stop by the vices, no license
Rolling like dices on the streets
Where the odds is high
Where the crime is life
And the life is time, and the time is jail
And in the jail you stressin
The judge probably hit me with an algebraic expression
But I get away free like Ocean's Eleven
And I motion the metal, like a pro-fe-ssional
And when I'm rolling especially, like a pimp suppose to
Watch how you sit down somethings in that sofa
If she with me, you know that something's in that ho bra
She's a foreigner so she say coca
I get broke off and they get brok-er
They like so what, i'm like so when?
We going know then how the turn in turn out
Cause we going shoot back till the burners burn out
Till the burning burn down every house the block hold
I'm hollering at you niggas with every shot the Glock hold
You can't see me there's a thousand blind folds
And my mind state is put a thousand on top of those
Chea, I do school and do lunch at Pappadeaux's
They want beef I turn that to that to sloppy joes
Copy cats brrrrrrat, copy those
Had a strong relationship with expensive clothes
This stuntin shit is extensive and intense
Like pulling up in something Americans can't invent
Chea, I make them fall back, they gotta indent
Like a paragraph, the first sentence, shit
I'm way smarter man, I'm more gifted
Straight from the womb to pro, prolific
I'm so, I'm so so, I'm so lifted
High in the sky, me and pops taking pictures
That’s my vision, until my vision is vivid
Ima give it all I got we good jigga you bitches”

[Intro]
Being six years old I had seen some trains before
So it's hard to figure out what I'm at the depot for

[Verse 1]
Trains are big and black and smoking steam screaming at the wheels
Bigger and anything there is least that's the way she feels
Trains are big and black and smoking louder July 4th
But everybody's acting like this might be something more
Than just picking up the mail or the soldiers from the war
Something even old man Wyman's never seen before
And it's late afternoon on a hot Texas day
Something strange was going on and we are all in the way
There are fifty or sixty people just setting on their cars
And the ole men left their dominoes and come down from the bars
And everybody's checking old Jack Kittrell checks his watch
And us kids put our ears to the rails to hear them pop
So we already know it when they finally said train time
You'd have thought that Judgment Day was rolling down the line
Because things got real quiet and mama jerked me back
But not before I get the chance to lay a nickel on the track

[Chorus]
Look out here she comes she's coming look out there she goes she's gone
Screaming straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone
Big and red and silver she don't lay no smoke
She's a fast rolling streamline come to show the folks
I said look out here she comes she's coming look out there she goes she's gone
Screaming straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone

[Verse 2]
Lord she never even stopped
She left fifty or sixty people still setting on their cars
Wondering what it's coming to and how it got this far
And me I got a nickel smashed flatter than a dime
By a mad dog runaway red silver streamline train

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
This time last year there sure was
A lot of sad faces around this old house
Our papa died without fulfilling his life's dream
Of producing one of the best crops in Grimes County
Though papa died with that dream still in his head
A desire in his heart, a promise on his lips, calluses on both hands
And two dollars in his pocket
Papa didn't live long enough to see his dreams come true
So he died from too much work, broken spirit, I guess
But I promised our mama that if it was a last thing he'd ever do
He'd live long enough to see just one good crop come through
But you see we can't plan on things without first talking to God
Because we don't know his plans
And if we don't include him my friends the way can get mighty hard
They say that every time a good and righteous person
Is buried in God's good earth it's just fertilizer for the soil
And I guess there must be some truth to that
Whether we believe it or not
I just wish that papa was here right now
So that he could see this good crop that we finally got

[Chorus]
Hey look at that beans and look at that corn
And I bet them watermelons must be three feet long
Man look at them tomatoes and look at them peas
Well I know if papa was here right now he'd sure be pleased

[Verse 2]
And papa would sure be proud of his children too
My brother's famous now got his own show on the road
Traveling in customized bus imported from Europe
That boy always did love music and he loves to travel
I got a sister that's got a good job in a beauty shop
Making money, making other people look good
Isn’t nobody here at a house now but me and mama
And mama she's getting weaker and she's getting older every day
And she talks softly about joining papa in his heavenly home
But that woman sure did love that man
She worked beside papa for forty some odd years
Trying to produce a good crop and never could grow a single bean
But I just wish that papa was here right now
To see this good crop that we finally got

[Chorus]
Man, look at that beans and look at that corn
And I bet them watermelons must be three feet long

[Chorus]
Man, look at them tomatoes and look at them peas
Well, I know if papa was here right now he'd sure be pleased
And papa, if you can hear me look at them beans

[Verse 1]
Our little boy came up to his mama in the kitchen this evening
While she was fixing supper
And he handed her a piece of paper he'd been writing on
And after wiping her hands on her apron she read it and this is what it said
For mowing the yard 5 dollars
For making my own bed this week 1 dollar
For going to the store 50 cents
For playing with my little brother while you went shopping 25 cents
For taking out the trash 1 dollar
For getting a good report card 5 dollars
And for raking the yard 2 dollars
Total amount owed 14 dollars and 75 cents
Well as mama looked at him standing there expectantly
And I could see the memories flashing through her mind
And so she picked up the pen and turning the paper over
This is what she wrote and I read it to him

[Chorus]
For the nine months she carried you growing inside her no charge
For the nights we sat up with you doctoring you praying for you no charge
For the time and the tears that you've caused through the years there's no charge
When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge
For the nights filled with dread and the worries ahead no charge
For advice and for knowledge and the cost of your college no charge
For the toys food and clothes and for wiping your nose there's no charge
When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge

[Verse 2]
Well when I finished reading he had big tears in his eyes
And he looked up at his mother and he said mama I sure do love you
Then he took the pen and in great big letter he wrote Paid In Full

[Outro]
When you added all up the cost of real love is no charge

[Chorus]
I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
And when they play them cheating tunes I never sing along
I never ever sing the blues I've forgotten born to lose
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs

[Verse 1]
I hardly ever walk the floor and cry
And I don't think I've ever said I feel like I could die
I don't ever lay awake I never think my heart will break
I hardly ever walk the floor and cry

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I never call your name out in my sleep
You never make me worry and you never make me weep
I never wonder if you're true I spend a night curled up with you
And I never call your name out in my sleep

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I guess there's not much I can do or say saw my baby with another guy today
Though I love her and I tried to tell her so it's hello blues and down the road I go
I've never seen that guy before today he held my baby in the closest way
And the way she snuggled close to him I know it's hello blues and down the road I go
Well it seems our thoughts were much alike our likes were much the same
We even had our future plan till into town he came
I've never seen that guy
Well it seems our thoughts

[Verse 1]
Just a broken down cowboy all down on his luck
He's been through the best of his friends
On a long lonesome highway in an old pickup truck
Crossed Texas with a hot dusty wind

[Verse 2]
He was all around cowboy 1959
From the top it's been a long way down
Since the whiskey and ladies started winning his time
They rode him high and hard to the ground

[Chorus]
But he remembers the thrill of being a winner
And the feeling of being a beginner in the days of his first rodeo
But there was something about winning that didn't last forever
But tomorrow it's bound to get better he'll be the all around cowboy again

[Verse 3]
The windmills are  turning on the west Texas plains
But he's dry as an old river bed
He's just like the dust that's a searching for rain
But he knows he'll be riding again

[Verse 4]
So he rolls up a smoke and he sips his Old Crow
Wipe the whiskers that cover his chin
He grins as he dreams of the next rodeo
To be the all around cowboy again

[Chorus]
'Cause he remembers the thrill of being a winner
And the feeling of being a beginner in the days of his first rodeo
There was something about winning that didn't last forever
But tomorrow it's bound to get better he'll be the all around cowboy again

[Verse 1]
I'm on the hill by Friscio Bay
Hawaiian winds blow my past away
There's a freighter there that is southern bound
I'm on my way out of this town

[Chorus]
There's Alcatraz and the man that has
Bills love and pills and drink and wine and song
Stand in line and fight and wind and roam
Kids and yard and I'm a man that's tired and gone

[Verse 2]
There was a time when things were good
We had it better than we ever should
But things got hard and love got old
I got tired and love grew cold

[Outro]
There's Alcatraz and the man that has

[Verse 1]
Campers bikes and mobile homes cars and pickup trucks
Slacks and '59 hairdos sideburns spears and ducks
There's lone star pearl and fried chicken and one big cloud of smoke
Plug it in and turn it on and the music goes for broke

[Chorus]
Down at Dripping Springs down at Dripping Springs
There's Willie and Waylon Kris and Tom have you heard Gatlin sing
Down at Dripping Springs down at Dripping Springs
Duncan's on and Linda's next time many did Joel Gray down at Dripping Springs

[Verse 2]
Well the Texas sun is low and hot upon the chaparral
It would be one ideal spot for God to put his hell
The most beloved cowboys songs echoed cross the plains
T Texas Tyler isn’t forgotten next year you all come again

[Chorus]
Down at Dripping Springs Down at Dripping Springs
There's Russell Bush and Kris and Coe have you heard Gatlin sing
Down at Dripping Springs down at Dripping Springs
There's Willie and Waylon Kris and Tom have you heard Gatlin sing
Down at Dripping Springs down at Dripping Springs
Duncan's on and Rita's next how many did Joel Gray down at Dripping Springs

[Verse]
Precious memories unseen angel sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me and the sacred past unfolds
Precious memories how they linger how they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight precious sacred seems unfold
Precious father loving mother fly across the lonely years
And the old home scenes from my childhood in fond memory appear
Precious memories how they linger
Precious memories flood my soul

[Verse 1]
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

[Chorus]
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
Until my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
And exchange it some day for a crown

[Verse 2]
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true
Its shame and reproach gladly bear
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share

[Chorus]
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
Until my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
(Rugged cross)
And exchange it some day for a crown
And exchange it some day for a crown

[Verse 1]
Softly and tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See on the portals, he's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me

[Chorus]
Come home, come home
You who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, oh, sinner come home

[Verse 2]
Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading
Pleading for you and for me
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies
Mercies for you and for me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, for the wonderful love he has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinned, he has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Just as I am without one plea but that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bid’s me come to Thee oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am and waiting not to rid my soul of one dark blot
To Thee who's blood can cleanse each spot oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am Lord Thou tossed about with many a conflict and many a doubt
Fighting’s fears within and without oh lamb of God I come I come
Just as I am Thou wilt receive will dwell come pardon cleanse relieve
Because Thy promise I believe oh lamb of God I come I come

[Verse 1]
Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong

[Chorus]
Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by

[Verse 2]
When death has come and taken our loved ones
It leaves our home so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
When the saved diverse shall gather over on the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder I'll be there

[Chorus]
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there

[Verse 2]
Let us lay before the Master from the dawn till setting sun
Let us talk of all his wondrous love and care
And when all of life is over and our work on earth is done

[Chorus]
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
When the roll is called up yonder
(When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there)

[Verse 1]
Alas and did savior bleed and did my sovereign die
Would he devote that sacred head for such a worm as I

[Chorus]
At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day

[Verse 2]
Was it for crimes that I have done he groaned upon the tree
Amazing pity grace unknown and love beyond degree

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
But drops of grief cannot repay the debt of love I owe
Here lord I give myself away it's all that I can do

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse]
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Thou art the Potter, I am the clay
Mold me and make me after Thy will
While I am waiting, yielded and still
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me, Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now
As in Thy presence humbly I bow
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary, help me, I pray!
Power, all power, surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me, Savior divine
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Hold o'er my being absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit until all shall see
Christ only, always, living in me

[Verse]
Mountain lady do you sit on your front porch in the cool of the day
Mountain lady did you think your kids would ever come back to stay
Mountain lady does the columbine still twine around your door
And did you ever get a rug
To cover the cracks where my diaper drug on your wooden floor
Oh you Appalachian lady once i was your little baby
And you rocked me in your homemade rocking chair
Since i heard the wild goose calling i have done a lot of falling
Mountain lady someday I’ll come to you there
Mountain lady does the country church bell ring on Sunday morn
Mountain lady do you still wear that old apron ragged and torn
Mountain lady on winter nights before our old fireplace
As you look into the flame do you ever call my name and do you see my face
Oh you Appalachian lady
Mountain lady

[Verse 1]
Nasty Dan was the meanest man I ever knew
He's stomp and scream and be real mean the whole day through
He'd frown a bunch he ate nails for lunch and he'd never laugh
He'd growl and yell and I hard tell that he never took a bath

[Chorus]
Nasty Dan was a nasty man
Hard to understand that Nasty Dan

[Verse 2]
Now Nasty Dan was a nasty man the whole day long
He'd go where he could he'd try real good to make things go wrong
He'd jump for joy when a little boy would trip and fall
And the only words that he ever said were, "I don't like you at all!"

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now a real interesting thing that I want you to know about is this here
Because it's the most important thing it concerns a girl and things like that
Now Nasty Pearl was a nasty girl that met Dan somehow
She said you like me rotten as can be let's get married now
So they went and they did and had a nasty kid
And I must confess that Dan pretty much leaves everyone alone now
And he doesn't bother anybody anymore cause he just lives in his nasty old house
With his nasty old wife and his nasty od kid in nasty happiness

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Oh the number one is not my favorite number
Because one means only me and there's no you
But one plus one you see makes two that's you and me
And it's more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one makes two at least I'm pretty sure they do
Oh yes it's true one and one makes two

[Chorus]
Now let me show you what I mean
Now you say you want to play upon a seesaw
You're all alone and you don't know what to do
Well just go and find a friend and sit him on the other end
You'll have more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one

[Chorus]
Now you say you want to play a game of baseball
And you look around and there's no one but you
Well just find someone you know and he will catch the ball you throw
You'll have more fun when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one

[Verse 2]
Now there's the best reason of all that I like to number two right here
Now everyone needs somebody to share with
To love and help and care for through and through
And there's no one that I've known who can share or love alone
It's a lot nicer when one and one makes two
Oh yes one and one
I said it's true one and one makes two

[Chorus]
I got a boy and his name is John
You ought to see little John tag along
Going where his daddy goes
Learning what his daddy knows

[Chorus]
We got a boy and his name is John
You ought to see little John tag along
Going where his daddy goes
Learning what his daddy knows

[Verse 1]
He's got a friend and her name is Kay
And Kay goes with him everyday
Going to take Kay along
Going to teach Kay this song

He's got a friend and his name is George
But he's not the one from Valley Forge
And he's never been President
That ain’t the George we meant
He's got a friend and his name is Gibs...

June 

[spoken]:
It's, it's a dog

John

John

A dog name Sergeant too...

John 

[spoken]
He's his friend

[singing]
Watch out, he might bite you!

[Chorus]
I got a boy and his name is John
You ought to see little John tag along
Going where his daddy goes...

June 

[spoken]:
No, his mommy

[singing]
Learning what his daddy knows

June 

[spoken]:
And his mommy, he'll be going with his mommy

[singing]
I got a boy and his name is John
You ought to see little John tag along
Going where his daddy and mommy goes
Learning what his daddy and mommy knows

John 

[spoken]:
Okay, he can go with both of us. You can go with me, and he can go with us, alright?

June 

[spoken]:
That'd be nice
John 

[spoken]:
Together

[singing]
I got a boy and his name is John
You ought to see little John tag along
Going where his daddy and mommy goes
Learning what his daddy and mommy knows

[laughter]

June 

[spoken]:
Just as long as he goes

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I wish I had a pair of little magic glasses
That I could see the future just by looking through
Then I could know what road tomorrow's going to take me down
And I could see if I'll be walking down that road with you
I would keep my little magic glasses hidden
I would let nobody else see what I see
And everyone would want to know how I can know what lies ahead
And they'll wonder when I say tomorrow I see you with me
But if I see into the future that I'm on the road alone
And where the way was sunny, now there's only rain
I'll put them in a box and seal it with a lock
And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again
I will put them in a box and seal it with a lock
And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again

[x2]

[Verse]
Where are you going Miss Tara, Miss Tara?
Where are you going Miss Tara Joan?
Yesterday when you played on the swing and the trampoline
You're already thinking of a life of your own
And I turned around twice and you're already gone
Who will you marry Miss Tara, Miss Tara?
Who will you marry Miss Tara Joan?
Will he have wealth and will he have fame?
I'm sure too you're wondering just who he will be
Well, that's your decision, it's not up to me
I hope you'll be happy Miss Tara, Miss Tara
I hope you'll be happy Miss Tara Joan
And that you will stay with me till you're a woman
And wise to the world before you're off on your own
You're my last baby girl and I'll be so alone

[Verse]
Dinosaurs lived a long time ago
They were terrible lizards, don't you know?
Some ate plants and some ate meat
Some ate fish and some ate beasts
One was called Diplodocus
One was bigger than your school bus
One was called a Triceratops
Three horns to stop anything that hops
Now can't you just see yourself walking along
Leading your pet Trachadon or feeding your Brontosaurus Rex?
Or scratching your Diplodocus neck
Or riding on a Stegosaurus back or swimming in a Brachiosaurus track
Oh what a time and oh what a fun
Play and tag with your Iguanodon
And if we had dinosaurs
Now could they get along with a horse and a cow?
Well, I wish they hadn't become extinct
Dinosaurs would be nice pets and friends
To have around to run outside
And play with everyday, don't you think?

[Verse]
Well Johnson van dyke Grimsby was paroled in '89
He never walked on a carpet never tasted dinner wine
His old eyes were slowly fading as he walked out of the gate
And he breathed the first free air he'd breathed since 19-0-8
Howdy do Michigan city you're sure pretty sight
But I know there's bigger cities and more exciting nights
But I think your girls are  pretty and I love your children too
Michigan city Indiana howdy do Michigan city Indiana howdy do
Michigan city Indiana howdy do
Filled with the joy of freedom he didn't know that he was old
Because time don't really matter when it's bubbling in your soul
Well I don't think he was bitter because he sure had a smile
And down the streets of Michigan city he walked his first free miles
Howdy do Michigan city

[Chorus]
Wild blackberries blooming in the thickest on the mountain
Sheep shire and watercress are growing round the fountain
Where a big black bear is drinking, lappin' water like a dog
Tiger Whitehead's in the bed sleeping like a log
But tomorrow he'll see bear tracks seven inches wide
And by sundown he'll be bringing in the hide

[Verse]
Pretty Sally Garland coming down the mountainside
Where Tiger Whitehead's trying to nap a mill at the mill
She sits down on a bearskin and she says you'll be my man
I'll have me the best bear hunter in the hills
A wild child was Tiger Whitehead and they say he killed
Ninety-nine bears before he went to rest, went to rest
Once he left two bear cubs orphaned but he brought them right on home
And Sally nursed the two bear cubs upon her breast

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Tiger now is eighty-five and he lay upon his bed
And the bears he killed now numbered ninety-nine, ninety-nine
Some fellers trapped the bears but Tiger said just let him go
If he ain’t running wild he won't be mine
But at night when the wind howls cross the hills of eastern Tennessee
And when the lightning flashes there's the strange thing that the people say they see
An old grey-headed ghost running through the mountains there
It's Tiger Whitehead after his one hundredth bear

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Bayou bayou bayou bayou
Now here's a little tale about a flock of geese
Looking for a home and looking for a peace
But before they're safely in the southern sand
They got to watch out for the critter called man
There's a goose and a gander and a gosling child
Heading on south at the call of the wild
Honk and holler as we go going to see the Gulf of Mexico
Way up high don't fly low the long toms will get you from the old bayou
Well the wind from the north it chills you to the bone
And the call of the wild is calling me come home
I'll lead my band of geese a marry trip we'll navigate that mighty Mississippi
Honk and holler as we go
Bayou bayou bayou bayou
Honk and holler as we go
My pappy led this band of twenty-three and the second in command included me
He made one fatal slip and he flew too low the long tom's got him from the old bayou
Honk and holler as we go

[Chorus]
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water

[Verse 1]
Oh, the water is cool and the water is blue
A drink for me and a drink for you
Yes, the water is cool and the water is blue
A drink for me and a drink for you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Oh, the water is cool and the water is deep
Take off our shoes and cool our feet
Yes, the water is cool and the water is deep
Take off our shoes and cool our feet

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Come along with me to the pasture now
We'll watch the wind blow on the cows
Come along with me to the pasture now
We'll watch the wind blow on the cows

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse]
When I was a lad
And old sheep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd play
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way
I remember the time at the old swimming hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old sheep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out
As the years fast did roll
Old sheep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him
With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at sheep’s faithful head
I just couldn’t do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead
He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see
Old sheep he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old sheep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
There is one thing I know
Old sheep has a wonderful home

[Verse 1]
Many, many years ago
When this land was young
A lot of our country was covered
By big tall beautiful trees
And men had to have the trees
To make wood, to build houses
Make furniture with, to make boats
Even to make paper with
So as more and more people came
More wood was needed
So more and more trees
Were cut down
And the man that lived in the forest
And cut down the trees
Was called the Timber man
Well, my world is green and dark and dumb
My home is in the logging camp
All week I cut down the mighty trees
Saturday I get to do as I please
I give the man more than his hire
And he'll never know it if I tire
Show me the toughest tree around
The Timber man will bring it down

[Chorus]
Swing it hard, cut it clean
No halfway or in-between
Move when the axe is in my hand
Make way for the Timber man

[Verse 2]
Yeah, he was a mighty big tough man usually
That Timber man that lived in that forest
And cut down those big trees
Well, they say there's sawdust in my brain
And don't get caught out in the rain
I got stump water in my blood
The sweat from my brow turns the ground to mud
When the men don't know how to fell a tree
The one they'll come and ask is me
I'll mark my spot and I'll take my stand
The tree's going to fall for the Timber man

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And when they're cutting on a tree
And it's just about ready to fall
The man yells out timber, timber

[Intro]
Illie Nelson's getting grey and Faron Young don't care
But the young ones keep on coming on the old are slow to go

[Chorus]
Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song

[Verse 1]
No one picks like Bill Monroe and don't George Jones sing great
I can tell that the people care by the people at my gate
Webb Pierce invites the tourists in and Ray keeps them away
Let there be country and let the country play

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ernest Tubb's got all of the soul he's had for all these years
Porter Wagoner's recitation still bring me to tears
And when they do play Kitty Wells you know she's still the Queen
Let there be country and keep the country green

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Little Jimmy Dickens still sends shivers through the crowd
Mother Maybelle whispers now but the heart comes through real loud
Gene Autry don't sing no more good old Tex Ritter's gone
And somewhere downtown Nashville a young man just got off the bus
With a guitar in his hands a pocket full of songs
A lot of talent and a heart full of hope
And he's going to be the next big country star and the country wheels roll on

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
And went to Detroit working on assembly line
The first year they had me putting wheels on Cadillacs
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
Because I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now getting caught meant getting fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand

[Chorus]
I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'd know it's me when I come through your town
I'm going to ride around in style
I'm going to drive everybody wild
Because I'll have the only one there is around

[Verse 2]
So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox, and with help from my friend
I left that day with a lunchbox full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, and bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home
Now, up to now my plan went all right
Until we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help from an a-daptor kit
We had that engine running just like a song
Now the headlights, they was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of them come on
The back end looked kind of funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said "Honey, take me for a spin"
So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughing for blocks around
But up there at the courthouse they didn't laugh
Because to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds

[Chorus]
I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm going to ride around in style
I'm going to drive everybody wild
Because I'll have the only one there is around

[Outro]
Uh, yeah, Red Ryder?
This is the Cotton Mouth
In the Psycho-Billy Cadillac, come on
Huh? This is the Cotton Mouth
And negatory on the cost of this mo-chine, there, Red Ryder
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
Uh, what model is it?
Well, it's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56
'57, '58, '59 automobile
It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67
'68, '69, '70 automobile

[Spoken]
Test, testing, testing
This, hmmm, Grace is my name
And and I was...um
It was that phot... a fading photograph of a patch..., a patchwork quilt
And they've put me on these
Ramona put me on
These interest drugs
So I'm thinking very too bit too fast like a brain hatch
And ah they won't let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes ... and I ask
I can still hear some pop...popular musics and aftershocks. (Ahhh-choo)
See I've been watching a television of um
In the homelands
That's the new homelands and um that's all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horrid

[Verse]
I walked down past the courthouse square three blocks or maybe four
Run into my old friend there who runs a handy hardware store
I said morning Lon what's the good word
He said Abraham Lincoln Lone Ranger Mickey Mouse and I'm sold out of flagpoles
I popped the top off a soda pop laid a quarter on the bar
I said inflation is a dirty dog my payday sure isn’t going far
Liberty said Lonnie E Pluribus Uni in God we trust and I'm sold out of flagpoles
I said hey Lonnie did you see Evel Knievel jumping on TV
Jumped 13 buses with his machine reckon he could jump 14
No doubt said Lonnie winners keep on winning
Even losers win sometimes and I'm sold out of flagpoles
Isn’t this been a year I said for frost and blight and flood and drought
Twice as many tornadoes reckon it's all caused by fallout
No it's the season said Lonnie they change
Wind's going to blow always did and I'm sold out of flagpoles
Hey what do you think about the sheriff's daughter
Running' off with the preacher's son
The sheriff's wife had to hold him back from going after them with his gun
Boys and girls said Lonnie will get together
Everything's normal and I'm sold out of flagpoles
And I'm sold out of flagpoles sold out of flagpoles sold out of flagpoles

[Verse]
There's a man across the hall who sits staring at the floor
He thinks he's Hank Williams; hear him singing through the door
There's a girl in 203, who stops by to visit me
And she talks about her songs and the star that she should be
There are lots of special people staying in or passing through
And for one thing or another, committed to Parkview
There's a girl in 307, coming down on Thorazine
And a superstar's ex-drummer trying to kick Benzedrine
There's a boy just down below me, who's the son of some well-known
He was brought in by his mother, because his daddy's always gone
There's a bum from down on Broadway and then a few quite well-to-do's
Who have withdrawn from the rat race and committed to Parkview
There's a girl who cries above me, loud enough to wake the dead
They don't know what she has taken that has scrambled up her head
There's a writer and a singer who has tried and tried and tried
They just brought him in this morning, an attempted suicide
There are those that never made it, those that did but now are through
Some came of their own good choosing: some committed to Parkview
They wake us about 6: 30, just before the morning meal
While they're taking blood pressure, they ask us how we feel
And I always say: "Fantastic! There isn’t nothing wrong with me
And then they give me my injection and I go right back to sleep
And my days are kind of foggy and my nights are dreamy too
But they're taking good care of me: committed to Parkview

[Verse]
Leaving in a cloud of burning cinders cinders from a fire of love gone out
Never looking back when she's high balling
She's the daughter of a railroad man no doubt
Waking in a new bed every morning breaking in a new heart every night
Up and running while the world is sleeping
She's the daughter of a railroad man alright She is long and sleek and made for moving she's outward bound at any time she can She won't be staying long in any station she's the daughter of a railroad man Cries out in the night when she gets lonely you can bet she won't be lonely long On down the line someone waits her arrival and the daughter of a railroad man is gone She is long and sleek

[Verse]
I guess we're over and it's all been said before
But I still want you though there's no reason anymore
I can't remember when you and I began
It makes no difference cause love has lost again
If there's a reason we forgot it long ago
And if there's an answer it's one I'll never know
The price of giving I just don't understand
But it's collected and love has lost again
All that's left now is the closing of the door
It sounds so final but I don't listen anymore
It's not the last time that I'll break instead of bend
But for the moment love has lost again
It's not the last time that I'll break instead of bend
But for the moment love has lost again

[Verse 1]
Go on blues go on lonesome
Get your dark clouds off of me
Go on blues go on troubles
Turn loose of me set me free

[Chorus]

[x2]
I've been down through that valley with you
Now I've found me somebody who loves me too
Go on blues go away from me
Go on by me go on blues

[Outro]
Yeah go on blues go on by me
Get away from me go on blues

[Intro: 3OH!3]
Black dress with the tights underneath

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I've been feeling some type of way about her
Wanna wife her
Borderline I don't really like her
Cause she like to play around and she know she got it
In turn and make a kid not really want it
A bad bitch, who know she a bad bitch

Worst type in the world if you ask me
Worst thing in the world is emotions
So I'm sitting here trying to go through the motion
Get along but it'd be better if we boned
You don't understand, I don't need you honey
I beat my dick like I don't need money
She get around probably fuck yo homie
She text me then she probably gonna text Drake
Cause it be the ones man, with the pretty face
I guess it be the moon man who cracked the case

[Hook: 3OH!3] 

[x2]
She wants to touch me 

[Woah]
She wants to love me 

[Woah]
She'll never leave me 

[Woah, woah, oh, oh]
Don't trust a ho
Never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho
Won't trust me

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
She's a freshman, with a cup in her hand
She tries her best to pretend she doesn't know who I am
Her and her best friend, I seen em pull up they skirts
They got a wager to see who can hook up with me first
The threesome, like you ain't done it before
Oh you're a good girl, from high in his port
Well tell your boyfriend, if he even exists
He shouldn't trust you, because I'm stealing his bitch

[Kid Cudi]
Hey hater, sign language
Middle finger, middle finger
Let me tell you now
Intergalactical
I see them rockin the pole
I see them 304

[Hook: 3OH!3]

[x2]
She wants to touch me 

[Woah]
She wants to love me 

[Woah]
She'll never leave me 

[Woah, woah, oh, oh]
Don't trust a ho
Never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho
Won't trust me

Get Familiar!

[Chorus]
I sang your song before you ever came along but that doesn't mean I'll sing along
I've never waltzed the home sweet home but I will dance with you

[Verse]
I'd spread my wings before you ever learned to fly like flocks of wild geese in the sky
See one more shore before they die I will fly with you
With you I'll dream before we ever fall asleep the dreams you always hope to keep
And though they may fall to our feet I will dream with you
I'd drink your wine and taste the sweetness of your fine
And if I haven't aged with time before the days begin to twine I will age with you

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

The old gunfighter stood on the porch and stared into sun
And relived all the old days back when he was living by the gun
When deadly games of pride were played and
Living was mistakes not made

And the thought of the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
The thought of the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

And it's always keep your back to the sun
And you can almost feel the weight of that gun
And it's faster than snakes or a blink of the eye
And it's a time for all slow men to die
His eyes get squinty and he's straight as log
And he empties his gun at the dirty dog

And he's hit by  the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Hit by the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Now the burn of a bullet is only a scar
And he's back in his chair in front of a bar
And the streets are empty and the blood's all dried
The dead are dust and and the whiskey's inside
So buy him a drink and lend him an ear
He's nobody's fool but he's the only one here

Who remembers the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
Remembers the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

Son I stood in that street before it was paved
I learned the shoot or be shot before I could shave
And I did it all for the money and the fame
Noble was nothing but feeling no shame
And nothing was sacred but staying alive
And all that I learned from a Colt 45

Was to cuss the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
To cuss the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

Now he's just an old man that nobody believes
Says he's a gunfighter, the last of this breed
And there's ghosts in the street seeking revenge
Calling him out to the lunatic fringe
He's out in the traffic now checking the sun
And he's killed by a car as he goes for his gun
So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

[Verse 1: Johnny]
I believe my steps are growing wearier each day
Still I've got another journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me want to stay
And my one regret is leaving you behind

[Verse 2: June]
But if it proves to be His will that I am first to cross
And somehow I've a feeling it will be
When it comes your time to travel likewise, don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see

[Chorus: Johnny & June]
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming, I will rise up with a shout
And come running through the shallow water, reaching for your hand

[Verse 3: Johnny]
Through this life we've laboured hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes

[Verse 4: June]
So I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come, then we'll see paradise

[Chorus: Johnny & June]
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming, I will rise up with a shout
And come running through the shallow water, reaching for your hand

[Outro: Johnny & June]
I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming, I will rise up with a shout
And come running through the shallow water, reaching for your hand, hmm

[Verse 1]
Well I woke up this morning I had something on my face
It was still there when I brushed my teeth still there when I shaved

[Chorus]
I showed it to my neighbor and he broke into a grin, I gave it away, I gave it away
Smiles don't cost money give it away, give it away
Maybe all you have is just a kind word you can say give it away, give it away

[Verse 2]
I woke up this morning with a song in my heart
I hummed it all through coffee and it gave my day a start
I took my song to work with me and I sang it for my friend

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't think people do not care I know they care a lot
Don't be bashful of somebody give it all you've got

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
In a southern town where I was born
That's where I got my education
I worked in the fields and I walked in the woods
And I wondered at creation

[Verse 2]
I recall the sun in a sky of blue
And the smell of green things growing
And the seasons changed and I lived each day
Just the way the wind was blowing

[Verse 3]
Then I heard of a cultured city life
Breath taking lofty steeples
And the day I called myself a man
I left my land and my people

[Verse 4]
And I rambled north, and I rambled east
And I tested and I tasted
And a girl or two, took me round and round
But they always left me wasted

[Verse 5]
In a world that's all concrete and steel
With nothing green ever growing
Where the buildings hide the rising sun
And they blocked the free winds from blowing

[Verse 6]
Where you sleep all day and you wake all night
To a world of drink and laughter
I met that girl that I was sure would be
The one that I was after

[Verse 7]
In a soft blue gown and formal tux
Beneath that lofty steeple
He said, Do you Barbara, take this man
Will you be one of his people

[Verse 8]
And she said, "I will" and she said, "I do"
And the world looked mighty pretty
And we lived in a fancy downtown flat
Because she loved the noisy city

[Verse 9]
But the days grew cold beneath a yellow sky
And I longed for green things growing
And the thoughts of home and the people there
But she'd not agreed to going

[Verse 10]
Then her hazel eyes turned away from me
With a look that wasn't pretty
And she turned into concrete and steel
And she said, I'll take the city

[Verse 11]
Now the cars go by on the interstate
And my pack is on my shoulder
But I'm going home, where I belong
Much wiser now and older

[Verse 1]
I woke up this afternoon looked into your eyes
And something was as wrong as if the sun forgot to rise
I picked up a road map and I checked a few good places that I know

[Chorus]
And if you're no longer giving, I believe I'll hit the road and go

[Verse 2]
I just got the feeling that the fire was burning out
Because the air was turning colder every time you came about
And a flame won't take a fanning if the last reserve of love is running low

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Country road 6-40 state highway 45, life out of the interstate is very much alive
There's magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Good morning to you sunshine, good morning to you rain
The windshield wiper's rhythm keeps me singing down the pain
Today I'm going to miss you less, if I miss you at all, you'll never know, you'll never know

[Chorus] 

[x 2]

[Verse 1]
Fish aren't biting but I don't really care and don't hurry
Like that Wabash River there I'd be drinking
Or laying dead somewhere if it wasn't for the Wabash River
If it wasn't for the Wabash River and this willow tree and my pole and a line
I'd be going crazy as an Indiana cyclone
Drowning memories of her and crying, crying, crying
If it wasn't for the Wabash River I'd be going out off my mind

[Verse 2]
It's so peaceful sitting here beneath my tree, Lord I need her
Like she often needed me, life isn't worth it
Just as far as I can see if it wasn't for the Wabash River
If it wasn't for the Wabash River

[Rambler]
Look out man alive
Fifty-five miles an hour, they want us to go on this Interstate
And you go fifty-five and you get run over by a truck so what do you do

[Fisherman]
Man I must be nuts, I just got back from California
All that time out there chasing after her

[Rambler]
Well she must be worth a round trip

[Fisherman]
Worth it
You know there was a time I'd run naked through the snow just to touch that woman

[Rambler]
But you wouldn't now ha

[Fisherman]
Where we're at anyway

[Rambler]
I don't know, I believe that's the Platte River, you want to go fishing again

[Fisherman]
I had enough fishing

[Rambler]
It's still a long way to California you know

[Fisherman]
You know, I just might change my mind before we get there

[Rambler]
You sound like you got no control over whether you go or not

[Verse 3] 

[Fisherman]
That's just it, what is it about a woman that makes such a dummy out of a man
She was wild even when she was loving me, man
I knew tomorrow it'd likely be somebody else she would be with
But you know just that idea that the next day she could be loving me again
That's what kept me on her tail chasing after all the time
She really was poison, but I guess it was good poison
Look at me here I go again, hoping for another dose of that sweet poison she had, man
Did you ever have a woman like that

[Rambler]
Yeah, I guess I have

[Fisherman]
You know what I mean

[Rambler]
My woman's a lady

[Fisherman]
A lady

[Verse 4] 

[Rambler]
A lady will give you the best loving you ever had
I don't care what you had in California but even a lady's love can burn out though
But what I mean is a good woman a kind, sweet, considerate, understanding woman
That likes to be treated like she treats you
And if that isn't bull, the better she gives love the more she wants to give
I know what I'm talking about, a lady
Loving's better is a loving heart's going to give another and a lady loves to give
Mine did for a little while

[Verse 1]
Lady your arms are always warm and your bed was always ready when I came
Lady in the middle of the night
You would open up when you'd hear me call your name
And you were always there to see the turning of my key
And your laughing voice to me was like a song
Lady your spirit's sweet and free it's hanging on with me now that I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Lady you spoke softly and kind and you never had a word to criticize
Lady you know I love you so even more than I ever let you be alive
And day or night I knew that I could bring it all to you
And if I was wrong you'd never put me down
Lady so much I could say but I can't find the way to write it down
Can't find the way to write it down

[Verse 3]
The days and the miles roll by
In Denver the Rambler and the Fisherman are tired of the road
And ready for whatever the city and the night have to offer
They check into a cheap hotel and go right to the bar downstairs
It's Saturday night and the city's alive
They've been in the bar four hours now and it's nearly closing time

[Fisherman]
Hey give me another Coors how about you Angie

[Bar girl 1]
I don't like beer

[Fisherman]
Wow man I believe the little lady here wants champagne

[Bar girl 2]
Hey, yeah could I have champagne

[Rambler]
Do you think we're a couple of bankers here or something

[Bar girl 1]
I like that

[Fisherman]
Abracadabra, abracadabra, Coors you're no longer Coors, you're champagne

[Rambler]
Man, I've had enough of this

[Bar girl 1]
Hey, where are you going

[Rambler]
Good night

[Bar girl 2]
Hey, you're not going are you? You were buying me a drink

[Fisherman]
Hey, give me another Coors

[Bar girl 1]
But I don't like beer

[Fisherman]
That isn't beer honey, that's Coors

[Verse 4] 

[Rambler]
Well the barman's right
Beer, the bar girls, too much beer, I must be seeing things
I saw you sitting on a bar stool, lady, and I looked up and you were gone
You didn't like beer either did you, lady liked champagne neither did you, lady
In Denver, Colorado fancy town for a fancy lady like you
Hey, maybe she's out there somewhere, hey lady hahaha
Hey, I ran, maybe she ran, maybe I did see her downstairs
Maybe she's drowning her blues like I did
Hey, maybe I did see her down there having a ball, somewhere coming up to me
Yeah maybe she'll be coming, yeah maybe she'll be coming

[Verse 1]
I hear people laughing on the corner by the square
The neon flickers on my wall and I know you're out there
I'm in your bed and listening for your footsteps down the hall
And I'll be waiting for you after the ball

[Chorus]
After the ball is over, after the ball
If you cannot stand I've got a place for you to fall
The blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock face to the wall
I'll be waiting for you, after the ball

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Loving you is sweet addiction, I need only you
Just as long as you come back, go do what you want to do
Give the night your laughter but I'll have you after all
I'll be waiting for you, after the ball

[Chorus]
After the ball is over, after the ball
If you cannot stand I've got a place for you to fall
The blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock face to the wall
I'll be waiting for you, after the ball
After the ball is over, after the ball
If you cannot stand I've got a place for you to fall
The blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock face to the wall
I'll be waiting for you, after the ball

[Verse 1]
Come hear me good brothers, come here one and all
Don't brag about standing or you'll surely fall

[Chorus]
You're shining your light, yes and shine if you should
You're so heavenly minded and you're no earthly good
No earthly good, you are no earthly good
You're so heavenly minded, you're no earthly good
You're shining your light, yes and shine if you should
You're so heavenly minded and you're no earthly good

[Verse 2]
Come here me good sisters, you're salt of the earth
If your salt isn't salted, then what is it worth

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If you're holding heaven, then spread it around
There are hungry hands reaching up here from the ground

[Chorus]

[Verse]
The assembly line is running slow on Monday
They've been living it up and laying up Saturday and Sunday
On Tuesday they're about to come around
But they still feel bad and they're kinda down
And mad cause they've got four more days before the weekend rolls around
On Wednesday they're feeling fine again
And they're working like a dog and digging in
Trying to do everything they should putting the cars together good
And I got myself a car that was made on Wednesday, on Wednesday
If you're going to buy yourself a new car
You just better hope you're lucky enough to get one made on Wednesday
On Thursday the weekend is in sight
And they're in a hurry and they don't do nothing right
Friday is the worst day of the week, that's the day they make lemon dogs and freaks
If your car was made on Friday, friend, you'll soon be in the creek
Because it's payday and the loafing has begun
Lord, them Friday cars just hope you don't get one
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday
Are all bad days and the only try day is Wednesday
And my car was made on Wednesday, on Wednesday
If your car wasn't made on Wednesday, I'd advise you not to even leave home any

[Verse 1]
The cowboy's lady is crying tonight because the cowboy is out on the range
Running and rambling and chasing some stray and good cowboys don't ever change
I tried to hold him in the home corral, but the grasses were greener outside
So I'm going to sit here in front of this door
And I've loaded up my cowboy's forty-four
When the smoke clears there'll be a new brand on his eyes

[Chorus]
This is my cowboy's last ride
Oh I hate to see him go but I won't be staying home crying
I hate to watch him die but this is my cowboy's last ride

[Verse 2]
Cowboy remembers the old trails we rode and he's back in the saddle tonight
This time I'm letting the home fires burn out and I'm leaving when I blow out his light
Because I still remember good watering holes and the places that are open and wide
And I have decided he won't put me down a filly should be free for horsing around
And I will no longer be hobbled and tied

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Well I'm finally going back to Louisiana
Running and thumbing all the way
That started out way out in California
I've been making about five hundred miles a day
I covered all the beaches on the West Coast
From Mexico Crason City Bay
But Calilou was not in California
That's where her daddy came from by the way
And by the way her mother was a Cajun
She came from New Orleans I've heard her say
And it's just like a girl to want to see her mama
So I might find her there along the way

[Chorus]
Calilou, Calilou well they should have called you restless
Well, they should have called you drifter
Yeah, they should have called you trouble instead of Calilou

[Verse 2]
I recall the first time that I saw her
I picked her up near Phoenix in my car
Just another beauty seeking fame and fortune
And I told her if she should be a movie star
The next time I saw her was Tucumcari
She served my bowl of chili with a smile
I said it's been a year since I last saw you
Wonder how'd you like to share a few good miles
Well the justice of the peace was very sleepy
I held her in my arms a whole night long
I whispered words like settle down and family
And when I woke up my Calilou was gone

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 3]
It's a long way to New Orleans
Well I got plenty of time
Me too, you know, it's a lot of fun just seeing what the next day has to offer
You never know what's around the next bend
Or what we're going to find either
Do you know what I just wonder how long a man has to look before he finds himself
I just got the feeling that the fire was burning out
Because the air was turning colder every time you came about
And a flame won't take a fanning if the last reserve of love is running low
So since I've got to button up, I believe I'll hit the road and go
Country road 6-40 state highway 45
Life out of the interstate is very much alive
There's magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below
And my song isn't through playing yet so I believe I'll hit the road and go

[Verse]
I was sitting here thinking about old times, some old times, some old friends
And suddenly it crossed my mind that I would like to see you again
Remember how we used to walk and talk walk and talk holding hands
Said we loved each other, I recall made a lot of future plans
But the years have come and gone and a whole lot has happened since then
But tonight babe, your memory's awfully strong on my mind
And I would like to see you again
It's funny how an old flame comes back, come on back make you blue
But I just saw a picture of a railroad track and some old shack and me and you
Guess I'd better straighten out my mind, straighten it out, go to bed
And pray that I don't dream about old times, some old times, gone and dead
But the years have come and gone

[Verse]
Lately I've been thinking that you don't love me at all
Lately I've been reading and the writing on the wall
Is saying, looks like you'll be going and I've no sure way of knowing
But somehow that's what I've been thinking lately
Lately you've been saying things that I don't understand
Lately you look through me as if I'm another man
Instead of your old one and only I'm beginning to get lonely
I've been feeling you'll be leaving lately

[Outro]
You might as well just stop it now because I already know
You wouldn't hurt me less if you just go ahead and go
You know your heart's already gone so you might as well go on
Things have not been working for us lately, things have not been working for us lately

[Intro]
Whoopi tai ai oh, rocking to and fro
Back in the saddle again

[Verse 1]
My little boy said, Daddy, who's Gene Autry
His old movie was coming on TV
And I said, let me tell you about him, son
And I took him upon my knee
Why, when I was a little boy about your size
And just about every Saturday night
When I could scrape up a dime for the movies
And when my Daddy said alright
I'd be right downtown at the picture show
Like everybody else that could
To see a handsome man
On a big fine stallion going about, doing good

[Chorus]
Singing, Whoopi tai ai oh, rocking to and fro
Put him back in the saddle again
Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
Back in the saddle again

[Verse 2]
Well, he could ride his horse and play his guitar
And sing all at the same time
And I was riding right along there beside him
On that broomstick pony of mine
And you know his pistol never ran out of bullets
When the bad guys had to be stopped
And somehow his bullets never drew any blood
But the bad guys dropped when he shot
Yeah, old Gene was an image of justice
And goodness and purity
And in the eyes of a poor, little country boy
He made the world look better to me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And you know the way
He rescued the rancher's daughter
He'd sent a thrill right up the aisle
And the ending would always send us home
With a good victorious smile
Now you ask me, Who's Gene Autry
Well, son, go ahead and watch the show
And then ride off into the sunset with him
Like I did forty years ago

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Pre-Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end

[Chorus]
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

[Spoken]
My name is Mr. Touchshriek
Of Touchshriek Mail Over and Fantasy
My shop sells eggshells off the seashores and
Empty females
I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide Internet
He's a broken man
I'm also a broken man
It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric
Some of the houses around here
Still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone
Or that sort of thing
If I had another broken man
Oh, I dream of something like that

[Verse]
Now you don't have to worry about me, babe
Just hook them up and head on out to the places where you've been
Go ahead and fly like an eagle in the sky
And when you land, you'll find I'm still your friend
But I don't think I could take you back again
There's no need to bother about me, babe
Someone will come along and she will take me by the hand
Together we will walk where the grass is green and new
And I'll even think about you now and then
But I don't think I could take you back again
Hey where you going you can't get there without me so goodbye, go on, goodbye
And remember though I'm setting you free I won't cry, cry, cry
I've seen you toss and turning in your sleep, babe
Now your dream bags are packed you've got your ticket in your hand
When you love someone you want what's best for them
That's how it is and that's how it's always been
And I don't think I could take you back again
Hey where you going

[Verse 1]
Every town has its town bum
I guess ours had one
Here's a song about him, I remember him fondly
Well his name was Abner Brown
I knew an old drunk named Abner Brown
And nobody knew when he came to town
But he spread good will to his fellow men
And they let him sleep in the cotton gin
He could drink more brew than an army could
But he had more friends and he did more good
Than a lot of fine, fancy people in our town
So they tolerated Abner Brown
And all us kids were on his side
Because he told us tales until our eyes grew wide
And he made us feel about ten feet tall
Because he had no kids but he claimed us all
And after school and on weekends
You could find me down at the cotton gin
The truest friend that I ever found was
A good old drunk named Abner Brown
Abner Brown, I wish that I could see you once again
I believe that you'd stack up with all the mighty men
I've met and known in all the low
And higher places that I've been

[Chorus]
Thinking of you picks me up when I'm feeling down
I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown

[Verse 2]
Lord, take me back to the cotton land
To Arkansas take me home again
Let me be the boy that I once have been
Let me walk that road to the cotton gin
He's probably dead many years ago
And gone the way that old drunks go
But I'd still like to sit down
Talk to my old friend, Abner Brown

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I feel so good come payday
I think of all the things I'm going to
Buy when I pick up my pay
Don't you know, but then they hand me
That little brown envelope
I peep inside, Lord I lose all hope
Because from those total wages earned
Down to that net amount that's due
I feel the painful sense of loss between the two

[Chorus]
There goes that bracelet for her arm
There goes that new fence for my farm
There goes that brand new Pontiac
There goes the shirt right off my back

[Verse 2]
You can dream about a honeymoon for two
You can dream but that's about all you can do
Because by the time old Uncle Sam gets through with you
You can buy her a pair of hose
A little powder for her nose
And take her down to Sloppy Joe's for beer
And stew them are the facts after tax
You can dream about vacation in the sun
You can dream but you can never have you one
Because by the time your good old Uncle Sam gets done
You've got just enough for gas
To see them city limits pass
And if you get back home fourth class
I'd say you won

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Bet it isn't raining back home
Bet your sister's still on the phone
Bet Mamma's in the kitchen, cooking fried chicken
Wishing that I hadn't done wrong
Yeah, Mamma, don't you worry about it none though
Everything's going to be all right, Mamma
They're teaching us a lot of new things in here Mamma
Things like

[Chorus]
There is no good in an evil-hearted woman
And I'm not cut out to be no Jesse James
And you don't go writing hot cheques down in Mississippi
And there is no good chain gang

[Verse 2]
Papa's reading yesterday's mail
Wishing that the hay was all baled
I bet he's wishing we could go fishing
And here I am laying in jail
Well, Papa, don't you worry about it none now
Everything's going to be all right, Papa
They're teaching us a lesson a day we're learning pretty well too
We've already learned a whole lot of stuff already
Things like

[Chorus]
There is no good in an evil-hearted woman
And I'm not cut out to be no Jesse James
And you don't go writing hot cheques down in Mississippi
And there is no good chain gang
There is no good in an evil-hearted woman
And I'm not cut out to be no Jesse James
And you don't go writing hot cheques down in Mississippi
And there is no good chain gang
There is no good in an evil-hearted woman
And I'm not cut out to be no Jesse James
And you don't go writing hot cheques down in Mississippi
And there is no good chain gang
There is no good in an evil-hearted woman
And I'm not cut out to be no Jesse James
And you don't go writing hot cheques down in Mississippi
And there is no good chain gang

[Verse 1]
Remember back in school we learned the golden rule
Do unto others as you'd have done to you
You're supposed to love me as much as I love you

[Chorus]
It's a shame that isn't the way it is

[Verse 2]
Lovers in a movie on that great big screen
He treats her like she's a queen, she treats him like a king
Wouldn't that be nice if life is lived that way

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'd like to start each morning with good morning dear
And end each night with the goodnight kiss
But all I have is your memory with me laying here

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
A love song tells a story of a good love going bad
Then paints a pretty pictures of that same love coming back
I wish that I could sing it, I wish that I could paint it

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I've been a rambler, I've been a gambler
I've been in trouble a time or two
I known a lot of good looking women
But Lord, bless the day that I found You

[Chorus]
I'm alright now, I'm alright now
I was riding on the devil's train but I got off somehow
I'm alright now, I'm alright
Gabriel, let your trumpet blow, I'm alright now

[Verse 2]
I've been demented, been discontented
I've been in jail pretty close to hell
I've been frisky on sipping whiskey, yeah
And I done a few other things that I'll never tell

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
She is deliciously tall sort of a long girl
She is delightfully small sort of a song girl
She freely admits to the world that she was a wrong girl
That's nothing compare to the fact that she is a gone girl

[Chorus]
Gone like a knock on the door, gone with yesterday and before
Gone with the wind for ever more

[Verse 2]
She'd never laid claim to the fact that she was a strong girl
So why should I loudly proclaim that she was a wrong girl
I'd rather think of her name as some sort of song girl
And think poetical things to think of my gone girl

[Chorus]
Gone like a knock on the door, gone with yesterday and before
Gone with the wind for ever more

[Verse 1]
They used to call me Rockabilly, all of us ran through
When Elvis opened up the door with a pup-and-pup-and-boo
I didn't ever play much rock and roll because I got so much country in my soul

[Chorus]
But I'm a different man for loving you and I take a shot at what you ask me to
And baby I will rock and roll with you if I have to

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Memphis 1955 on Union Avenue
Carl and Jerry and Charlie and Roy and Billy Riley too
A new sun rising on the way we sing and a world of weirdos waiting in the wings

[Chorus]
But I'm a different man for loving you and I take a shot at what you ask me to
And baby I will rock and roll with you if I have to
He slowly raised the trembling hand
Gently brushed the silver strand of hair from his wrinkled brow
Lips that used to talk so free the eyes that used to beckon me were silent now
He listens to a passing train, gives into an old familiar pain, familiar pain
They retired him twenty years ago, gave him a watch made of gold and took his train
His woman's name was Margaret
He loved her but she went away and left his heart undone
He called this train the Diplomat, she's the only other lady that he ever loved
Some forty years he made the steam
From Memphis down to New Orleans but now he's off the line
And the closest that he ever gets Margaret or the Diplomat is in his mind
He said, take me to the station, the Diplomat is bringing Margaret home
Can't you hear that whistle blowing? They both know I've been alone for much too long
Let's not keep them waiting, we'll talk about the good times later on
Right now take me to the station, the Diplomat is bringing Margaret home
They say he talks crazy when
He sees the passing train or when he hears Margaret's name
But the only things he ever loved, he lost before he loved enough he's not to blame
So who's to say he's right or wrong
Reaching out and hanging on to dreams he can't let go
He threw the watch of gold away but keeps tracks of memories where he belongs
He said, take me to the station
They retired him twenty years ago, gave him a watch made of gold
And took daddy's train

[Chorus]
Come and take me to the airport come and bore me on that plane
Because I've got no expectations to ever pass this way again

[Verse]
Well once I was a rich man but now I am so poor
Never in my weary life have I felt like this before
Your love is like a diamond and you cast your pearls to swine
And as I see you leaving me it drags my peace of mind

[Chorus]
Come and take me to the airport come and bore me on that plane
Because I've got no expectations to ever pass this way again

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Your love is like the water it's sparking on the stone
Your love is like the music first it's here and then it's gone

[Chorus]
Come and take me to the airport come and bore me on that plane
Because I've got no expectations to ever pass this way again
Come and take me to the airport come and bore me on that plane
Because I've got no expectations to ever pass this way again

[Verse 1]
I've been up and down and out and I have been around
And I felt good more times than I felt bad
Loving you felt better than I've never known before
Losing you is the worst thing that I've had

[Chorus]
But it comes and goes
It's like a blue wind blows
Yes it goes and comes
But now I'm living some

[Verse 2]
And today my high didn't get any lower
And my low didn't fall anymore
But sometimes when I drop my guard
Everybody knows
Because I can't control my feeling
And there isn't much sign of healing
Because when the pain is there it always shows
But it comes and goes
In my mind I'm holding you and loving you again
I hear you laugh and feel you cling to me
Although it's over I'm still holding on a little bit
And there's a lot of pain in the memories

[Chorus]
But it comes and goes
It's like a blue wind blows
Yes it goes and comes
But now I'm living some

[Verse]
If anyone ever finds a better way to love, it'll be her loving me
If anyone ever goes out of their way to show they care, it'll be her loving me
She's every woman that I've ever known rolled up in one
And if I'm ever loved any more she'll be the one
To get it done the way it should be, it'll be her loving me

[Outro]
If ever I'm down and out and need someone to care, it'll be her loving me
If ever I'm in the cold and I need someone warm to hold, it'll be her loving me
She's every woman
She's every woman

[Verse 1]
About twenty years ago on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with The Gambler we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns staring through the window at the darkness
Until boredom overtook us and he commenced to speak
He said, Son, I've made a life out of reading people's faces
And knowing what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
And if you don't mind my saying I would say you're out of aces
And for one taste of your whiskey I will give you some advice
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette then he bummed a light
The night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
He said, If you're going to play the game, boy, you better learn to play it right
Because every gambler knows that the secret to survival
Is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep
And every hand's a winner just like every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

[Chorus]
You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them
Know when to walk away, know when to run
You don't ever count your money while you're sitting at the table
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing is done
You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them
Know when to walk away, know when to run
You don't ever count your money while you're sitting at the table
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing is done

[Verse 2]
And when he finished speaking
He turned back toward the window
Put out his cigarette
Faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler, he broke even
But in his final words
I found an ace that I could keep

[Chorus]
You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them
Know when to walk away, know when to run
You don't ever count your money while you're sitting at the table
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing is done
You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them
Know when to walk away, know when to run
You don't ever count your money while you're sitting at the table
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing is done
You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them
Know when to walk away, know when to run
You don't ever count your money while you're sitting at the table
There'll be time enough for counting when the dealing is done
Left pretty Jo. I was born on the bayou, thirty miles out of Lafayette
My daddy was a Cajun man and he taught me how to plow
I remember mama's breakfast goosh-goosh in the caye
Steam syrup upon the banje, I wish I had some now
I'm a Cajun born, I'm a Cajun bred and when I die I'll be Cajun dead
If I die in Alaska if I die in Ohio, my soul will find it's way back to the bayou
Went to church every Sunday, had a French talking preacher man
We kids joked about the preacher man because we thought he wore a dress
After church we had a party, Cajun music on the phonograph
Harry Short singing Jole Blon made a singer out of me
I'm a Cajun born
When I get enough to marry, get myself a Cajun lady
Something sort of like my mama because I'm not another kind
And wherever fortune takes me with the breaks or makes me
Memory won't forsake me, got Louisiana on my mind
I'm a Cajun born

[Chorus]
Isn't it good babe?
You and me
We sail the stormy waters
We calm the angry seas
We knew we could babe
You and me
Just as long as we have you and me

[Verse 1]
What more could a man want
Than a woman there beside him
To hold his hand
And understand
That everyday is not the same
Sometimes it's going to rain
You are my sunshine
And I'm your man

[Chorus]
Isn't it good babe?
You and me
We sail the stormy waters
We calm the angry seas
We knew we could babe
You and me
Just as long as we have you and me

[Verse 2]
What more could a woman want
Than a man there beside her through
The bad times
We had good times
You've always been a pillow
A shoulder and a friend
And I thank God that you are mine

[Chorus]
Isn't it good babe?
You and me
We sail the stormy waters
We calm the angry seas
We knew we could babe
You and me
Just as long as we have you and me

[Verse 1]
I don't drink the way that I used to
Lately that just isn't my style
And the hard times don't hurt like they once did
They pass more quickly like when I was wild

[Chorus]
And somehow I've learned how to listen
To a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground

[Verse 2]
The mid summer days aren't too heavy
They just flow like a breeze through my mind
And nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for some old lost times

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Pre-Chorus] 

[Johnny Cash and June Carter]
I'm a fair to middling man
And these are cotton picking hands
I'm a fair to middling man
And these are cotton picking hands

[Chorus] 

[Johnny]
My woman asks for little
And nothing she demands
Except to hold these cotton picking hands

[Verse 1] 

[Johnny]
The bloom is white and then it's red
Then it falls to leave a bowl instead
The leaves fall and the field is white
We pick the pods from dawn to night

[Pre-Chorus] 

[Johnny and June]

[Chorus] 

[Johnny]

[Verse 2] 

[Johnny]
My woman cooks and sweeps the yard
And that old rug board is rough and hard
Her face is pretty though it's tanned
And I love those cotton picking hands

[Pre-Chorus] 

[Johnny and June]

[Chorus] 

[Johnny]

[Pre-Chorus] 

[Johnny and June]

[Verse 1]
Don't turn around, don't call out my name
Like the breeze, it would fan a dying flame
I've got someone, I wanted you to know

[Chorus]
So close the door lightly when you go

[Verse 2]
Who was the one that stole my time
Who was the one that broke my mind
Who was the one that made me be unkind
It was you, so fare thee well, sweet love of mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Save the tears for someone else's eyes
Mind of glass
They cut just like your lies, they fall like rain
And drift away like snow

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Tears keep rolling down your cheek
Your voice gets choked so you can't speak
Every day seems like a week

[Chorus]
And that's what it's like to be lonesome

[Verse 2]
You get too blue to stay at home
But in a crowd you're still alone
You lose the will to carry on

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Everyone has a hope that's died
Everyone cries a tear inside
Everyone has a cross to bear
But I've got more than my share
Your mind is built with memories
Your heart cries out for sympathy
An empty blue eternity

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
There is a rumble in the sky and all the world can hear it call
They shudder at the fury of the mighty Thunderball
The power of her engines, now, has drowned in the sea
But the deadly force from within her is somewhere running free

[Chorus]
Thunderball, your fiery breath can burn the coldest man
And who is going to suffer from the power in your hand

[Verse 2]
Somewhere, there is a man who could stop the thing in time
He is known by very few but he's feared by all in crime
By courage and by fighting, he has not been known to fall
But neither has the fury of the mighty Thunderball

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Money hungry minds need a thread to launch a scheme
But those, who hold the Thunderball, could rule the world, it seem(s)
Cannot the peaceful world find the clue to where she's gone
The silent sea won't answer now but terror lingers on

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Down the street the dogs are barking
And the day is getting dark
As the night comes in falling
The dogs will lose their bark
And the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind

[Chorus]
For I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

[Verse 2]
From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes they start to fade
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
And I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's a restless hungry feeling
That don't mean no one no good
When everything I'm saying
You can say it just as good
You're right from your side
I'm right from mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Oh, I hate but you made it
Your running, jumping, laughing filled with glee
Oh, I told you that I hold you

[Chorus]
Just how did you get away from me

[Verse 2]
I had bars on the windows had you chained to the floor
And a moss covered monster at the door (12 feet tall, that isn't all)
Had a bottomless moat with a hole in the boat
And a big rattlesnake, if you tried to make the break
Had a swarm of bees, a gorilla in the tress

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Aw, where did you get the sense to get through the electric fence
Your handcuffs are gone you're running free
What happened to my sniper with his high powered rifle

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Is it true that you really did make it through
How bout the tiger in the car (And the dynamite you planted in the jar, in the car)
Did you go like a mole through a hole
Or did you sail like a quail on the pole
Give it to the news on TV (So I can see)

[Chorus] 

[x 2]

[Chorus]
Adios, aloha, hasta luego, and buenas noches to you
Adios, aloha, hasta luego, and buenas noches to you

[Verse 1]
You said au revoir, ma te chérie
Which means that you’re leaving me
(I guess)
Well, comme bon toi à moi sont, yes
I tell you to get along
I’m finally getting out of this mess
And that’s not all I got to say

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You said j'ai l'intention de partir demain
Which means you’re leaving right away
(Olé)
Well, c’est la vie, that’s life
I didn't want to be your wife
I didn't love you anyway
And that’s not all I got to say

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Oh you sit there and smile and you hold him by the hand
You'll make him a failure and break him as a man
You know, he was mine, yes you took the things, I claimed
Look into the mirror, woman, aren't you ashamed

[Chorus]
Aren't you ashamed that you took all I owned
You lured him away from me with your sweet lies and song
Your comment, I'm a dozen, and things that I can't blame
Look into the mirror, woman, aren't you ashamed

[Verse 2]
These gray hairs, I wear, are not put there by age
In my book of life, your name's on many a page
Our fire of love was burning but you lured him from the flame
Look into the mirror, woman, aren't you ashamed

[Chorus]
Well, the whole town listened to the radio
For the Smiling Bill McCall Show
Everyone in Nashville
Was listening to Bill

I don't want to be laying in bed
When they pronounce me dead

He'd stand and breathe in the microphone
With his guitar hanging to his knee bone
All the girls just sat and dreamed
When Bill began his song

I don't want my hat to be hung
When my last song is sung

But he never let fame go to his head
This is Smiling Bill McCall, he said
Going to pick and sing a song or two
You all listen until I'm through
And if you're at the house or in your car
Tune in this time tomorrow

To all the boys he was a big hero
They'd glue their ears to the radio
Then talking a most unusual drawl
Imitating Bill McCall

Daddy, can I get a guitar
Cause I want to be a star

The girls would say of Bill McCall
Why I bet he's over six feet tall
Handsomest man in Nashville
They said of Smiling Bill

He won't be planting potato slips
When he cashes in his chips

Then one day Bill didn't make the show
Didn't even show up for a week or so
The station's boss said to city hall
Find Smiling Bill McCall

It won't be hard to track him down
He's got the biggest feet in town
Well, there's a creek that runs through Nashville
And on the bank they found Smiling Bill
He's committing suicide
But they grabbed him before he tried

Turn me loose, I want to jump, he screamed
Because I can't stand that theme
Let this be my final breath
Because I'm scared to half to death
The big brave Smiling Bill McCall
Is only four feet tall
I'd rather be in the river dead
Than to hear them laughing at my bald head

[Verse 1]
When I was a curly headed baby
My daddy sat me down on his knee
He said, son, go to school and get your letters
Don't you be a dusty coal miner, boy, like me

[Chorus]
I was born and raised at the mouth of hazard hollow
The coal cars rolled and rumbled past my door
But now they stand in a rusty row, all empty
Because the L & N don't stop here anymore

[Verse 2]
I used to think my daddy was a black man
With script enough to buy the company store
But now he goes to town with empty pockets
And his face is white as a February snow

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I never thought I'd learn to love the coal dust
I never thought I'd pray to hear that whistle roar
Oh, god, I wish the grass would turn to money
And those green backs would fill my pockets once more

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Last night I dreamed I went down to the office
To get my pay like a had done before
But the old kudzu vines were covering the door
And there were leaves and grass growing right up through the floor

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Well first you got to want to get off bad enough to wanna get on him in the first place
And you better trust in your lady luck
Pray to God that she don't give up on you right now

[Chorus]
Live fast, die young bull rider

[Verse 2]
One hand hold is all you got it's you and the bull against the clock and a cross crowd
And once upon a spinning to nothing else you've ever done can pull this way
You're just outside the bucking shoot
Lose a spur, you lose your seat and you lose yourself
By now he's bucking mean and dirty
Slinging mud and cowboy boots and kicking clowns

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You've got to feel the way he's moving, you've got to watch his head
And brace yourself for anything that a friend of you might dread
You know the art of hanging loose, hanging just as tight
Well there's something like a hurricane who's dancing with the kite
Well, the rodeo is more than rough
It's a fact of life it's tough to cut his fever ass
It's drinking beer and pulling trailers
Tighten may on barreled razors and horse's buck

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 1]
I've never been in prison
I don't know much about trains
My favorite singer cooks my breakfast
I like her fancy and I like her plain
I love bright and flashing colors
Like hot pink and Dresden blue

[Chorus 1]
But if they ask me if it's true
That I still love you, I'll say it's true

[Verse 2]
I'd be happy in a mansion
Or in an old rundown shotgun shack
I like the feel of silk and satin
So I don't know why I wear black
I love New York City
Bet your cowgirl boots I do

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
I'll say it's true
So don't let it bother you
Just let them old tales all stay twisted
I will set them straight about you

[Verse 3]
I have not been in the army
I'm an Indian from years ago
When they ask if I know Waylon
I tell them, I think so
I do not plan on retiring
From anything I do

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
I got plans to keep right on singing
And I do know Emmylou

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies, and up a cloudy draw

[Verse 2]
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny, and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard, and he heard their mournful cry

[Chorus]
Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 3]
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

[Verse 4]
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
"If you want to save your soul from Hell, a-ridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today, or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies"

[Chorus]
Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 1]
Mary, grab the baby, river's rising
Muddy water taking back the land
Old frame house, she can't take one more beating
It's no use to stay and make a stand
Well, the morning light showed water in the valley
Daddy's grave just went below the line
Things to save, you just can't take them with you
The flood will swallow all you leave behind

[Chorus]
Won't be back to start all over
Because what I felt before is gone
Mary, take the child, river's rising
Muddy water taking back my home

[Steel Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
The road is gone, there's just one way to leave here
Turn my back on what I've left below, oh
Shifting lands, broken farms around me
Muddy waters changing all I know
Hard to say just what I'm losing
I've never felt so all alone
Mary, take the child, river's rising
Muddy water taking back my home

[Fiddle Solo]

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I built her a castle of perma stone
But I should have reigned more with her
Too often I left my queen alone
And that was no way to leave her
I rode out in quest of song and wine
And that was no way to treat her
I kept her hanging like grapes on the vine
And that was no way to keep her

[Chorus]
Reds Good guy rode by on his milk white steed
And casually mentioned my misdeeds
He promised her love far greater than mine
Thus pulled out and plucked my grapes from the vine

[Verse 2]
I built her a castle with patios
But I seldom cooked out upon it
I bought her a TV with stereo
But I never listened much to it
Now I have a castle but the queen's not home
And that is no way to have her
I have the vine but the grapes are gone
And that's no way to run a vineyard

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been leaning toward to blues
The lazy loafing good for nothing no count knock around
It hasn't been worth a honky dime since country come to town
I'll tell you boys this waiting up for something's got me down to nothing left to lose

[Chorus]
And lately I've been leaning toward to blues
I said lately I've been leaning toward to blues
I've been leaning lately toward the blues
I've done held on until I can't turn loose

[Verse 2]
Everything is everything and everybody knows
We can't get nowhere by stepping on each other's toes
And when it comes to Cotton Corners baby, anyway you get here is just fine
Because lately we've been doing double time

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I'm going to sit on the porch and pick on my old guitar
I'm going to lay on my back and laugh at my lucky star
And then I'm going to fly away and never come back someday
Unless I thought I was going to land right close to where you are
Well, if I thought anybody cared I'd send back word
Strapped to the leg of a trans celestial bird
I wonder if I really ever did leave, how many would there be to grieve
How would they react to the word
Well, I wouldn't ever want to hurt a solitary soul
I have still got all 6 foot 2 in control
But when my obligation's low is a greasy uphill road
And pleasing everybody but me is my first goal
I want to sit on my porch and pick on my old guitar
And just hope you're hanging loose where ever you are
And for the joy you brought to me this song I sung for thee
While I sit on my porch and pick on my old guitar

[Chorus]
It isn't nothing new babe, it's just a dream that fell through babe

[Verse]
And the plans that you have to make will be made here and now
With your head slightly bowed
You can see life goes on girl and the weak must grow strong girl
On your journey through this old world
You will soon understand that the love of your man
Was a shoulder to cry on and a friend to rely on but it wasn't worth dying for
When he told you goodbye, when he told you goodbye
There's just one thing for certain the pain won't stop hurting
Until you go back to working with something left that you love
Because the push and the shove of the everyday now has become such a hassle
And your only dream castle disappeared in the sky when he told you goodbye

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Oh, the hell I
Put myself through
The fights I
Didn't need to fight
This thick head of mine
You couldn't get through
Had to do it wrong
Just to get it right
Just to get it right

[Chorus]
I learned the Hard Way
The hard way taught me well
The hard way
Sure put me (this boy) through some hell
The hard way
Taught me how to tell
The right way from the wrong
And on which side I belong

[Verse 2]
Deep are the memories
As a young boy
Of the lessons
That I learned
My mama warning me
That fire is no toy
You play with fire boy
And you get burned
Oh I got burned

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Designer shades just to hide 

[x8]

[Chorus]
Designer shades to hide your face
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say hey
Or remember my name
Its probably cuz
You think you're cooler than me

[Verse 1]
If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used to pull all my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me

[Chorus]
You got designer shades
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say hey
Or remember my name
It's probably cuz
You think you're cooler than me

[Outro]
Designer shades just to hide 

[x3]
Cooler than me

Now you say we're over
I wasted all that time on you

Cause I'm just gonna hit that, hit that

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
The scene was a small roadside cafe
The waitress was sweeping the floor
Two truck-drivers drinking their coffee
And two okie-kids by the door
How much are them candies, they asked her
How much have you got, she replied
We have only a penny between us
Them's two for a penny, she lied

[Chorus]
And the daylight grew heavy with thunder
And the smell of the rain on the wind
Isn't it just like a human
Here comes that rainbow again

[Verse 2]
One truck driver called to the waitress
After the kids went outside
Them candies are not two for a penny
So what's it to you, she replied
In silence they finished their coffee
Got up and nodded goodbye
She called, hey, you left too much money
So what's it to you, they replied

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
I haven't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load

[Verse]
There is no change in the weather
There is no changes in me
Well there is no change in the weather
There is no changes in me
And I am not hiding from nobody
Nobody's hiding from me
Oh, that's the way its supposed to be
Well I got that green light baby
I got to keep moving on
Well I got that green light baby
I got to keep moving on
Well I might go out to California
Might go down to Georgia
I don't know
Well I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
Well now I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
But I don't love me no one woman
So I can't stay in Georgia long

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
That old wheel is going to roll around once more
When it does it will even up the score
Don’t be weak: as they sew, they will reap
Turn the other cheek and don’t give in
That old wheel will roll around again

[Verse 1]
When love is gone and the one you thought would stay
Does you wrong, and you are left alone to pay
The price is high
But somehow you’ll survive, don’t give in
That old wheel will roll around again

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
There’ll be times, hard to control
And you’ll find you’ll hurt down in your soul
There’ll be those who’ll be glad to see you down
But don’t give in, that old wheel will roll around again

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I wake up early in the morning
You go to sleep late at night
I kinda front like I don't want you
Inside, I'm losing my mind (Losing my mind)

[Chorus]
Do you wanna be my baby?
Do you wanna be my girl?

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me that you got a boyfriend
Don't tell me I'm not your type
Let's do a little less talkin'
And a little more little more little more feelin' right (Hey, right)

[Chorus]
Do you wanna be my baby?
Do you wanna be my girl?
Do you wanna be my baby?
Do you wanna be my girl?

[Bridge]
Let it breathe, let it breathe (Oh, oh)
Let it breathe, let it breathe (Oh, oh)

[Verse 3]
I like to play hard to get
I walk around talkin' shit (Yeah)
But you know just what I need
See, I don't got time for games
And I can't afford diamond rings
But you know, you know, you know you should be with me (Be be with me)

[Chorus]
Do you wanna be my baby? (Say it, baby)
Do you wanna be my girl?
Do you wanna be my baby? (Would you be my baby?)
Do you wanna be my girl?

[Intro]
Fuck that club (Shit)
They want that thug (Shit)
But I ain't no thug, bitch
And I ain't no gangsta, bitch
I'm a hustler, ho
And I got no problem
If you want it, you can get it
Boy, I bust you

[Verse 1]
Anybody wanna test? Hi, who? Me
P-I to the motherfuckin' T
It's not my fault that your bitch chose me
Now her and her girlfriend wanna do me
This is for those boys in those Chevys, sittin' on them King James
Them 2-3s
And if you got a problem with me, holler at my lawyer
Bitch, sue me
I'm tired of the fuck-boy rap, fuck-boy this, fuck-boy that
Watch a couple movies and they put it in they rhyme
Those wanna be fiddlers
I'm straight, you get shot nine times
Ten years in the game, since 99, I was speakin' my mind (Yes, sir)
And then shit changed, if you got a problem
Bitch, cross Dade County line

[Chorus]
I'ma give 'em what they ask for
What they want, that street talk
I'ma give 'em what they ask for
What they want, that chopper talk
I'ma give 'em what they ask for
What they want, that dope talk
I'ma give 'em what they ask for
That trap-boy jackboy shit

[Verse 2]
I'ma tell y'all boy, y'all boys got me fucked up (Yeah, straight up)
Better duck when them things buck
I ain't nigga boy, nigga what? Nigga who? Who the fuck is you?
Talkin' to me like you know me
Ain't your dog, ain't your buddy, ain't your homie
Nah brah, not me
And if you spit it, better live it, better in fact, better show me
I'ma make em say uhh, not even Master P could crack like this
And you ain't never seen a chico in the gang this raw since pawn that could rap like this (TS)
I hear them and they raps about the coke and the crack
And the click to the clack, but to me, it's chit-chat
Blam, motherfucker, take that, now

[Chorus]
I'ma give 'em what they ask for
What they want, that street talk
I'ma give 'em what they ask for
What they want, that chopper talk
I'ma give 'em what they ask for
What they want, that dope talk
I'ma give 'em what they ask for
That trap-boy jackboy shit

[Verse 3]
I'ma spit it, flip it, rip it for them boys
Makin digits off the coke when they whip it
Ride a stick, double clip it
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississipi
Cock back, click it, blam
Poppin' what you think is last
What you wanna do is get found in a trunk in a lake and stankin'
I took my money from the shoebox, now I bank it
Foolish, ain't it?

[Chorus]
I'ma give 'em what they ask for
What they want, that street talk
I'ma give 'em what they ask for
What they want, that chopper talk
I'ma give 'em what they ask for
What they want, that dope talk
I'ma give 'em what they ask for
That trap-boy jackboy shit

[Outro]
Fuck that club (Shit)
They want that thug (Shit)
But I ain't no thug, bitch
And I ain't no gangsta, bitch
I'm a hustler, ho
And I got no problem
If you want it you, can get it, 'fo I bust you

[Verse 1]
Jesus, I don't wanna die alone
Jesus, oh, Jesus, I don't wanna die alone
My love wasn't true, now all I have is you
Jesus, oh, Jesus, I don't wanna die alone

[Verse 2]
Jesus, if you hear my last breath
Don't leave me here, left to die a lonely death
I know I have sinned but Lord, I'm suffering
Jesus, oh, Jesus, if you hear my last breath

[Verse 3]
Jesus, I don't wanna die alone
Jesus, oh, Jesus, I don't wanna die alone
My love wasn't true, now all I have is you
Jesus, oh, Jesus, I don't wanna die alone

[Outro]
Jesus, Jesus, all my troubles
All my pain will leave me once again
All my troubles, all my pain
It's gonna leave me once again
All my troubles, all my pain
It's gonna leave me once again
Gonna leave me once again

[Verse 1]
Back in 1899, when everyone was singing auld lang syne
A century took a long, long time for every boy and girl
Now there's only one thing that I'd like to know
Where did the 20th century go
I'd swear it was here just a minute ago

[Chorus]
All over this world

[Verse 2]
And now the 20th century is almost over
Almost over, almost over
The 20th century is almost over

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 3]
Does anyone remember the great depression
I read all about it in true confession
I'm sorry I was late for the recording session
But somebody put me on hold
Has anybody seen my linoleum floors
Petroleum jelly, and two world wars
They got stuck in the revolving doors

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
The winter's getting colder, summer's getting hotter
Wishing well's wishing for another drop of water
And mother earth's blushing because somebody caught her
Making love to the man in the moon
Tell me how you're going to keep them down on the farm
Now that outer space has lost it's charm
Somebody set off a burglar alarm
And not a moment too soon
Because
Old father time has got his toes tapping
Standing in the window, grumbling and a rapping
Everybody's waiting for something to happen
Tell me if it happens to you
The judgment day is getting nearer
There it is in the rear view mirror
If you duck down I could see a little clearer

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I took a tour to Texas
And from Waco I called you
But day by day no answer
And I'm Big Bluebonnet blue
I'm singing and they're dancing
But I'm feeling Big D bad
I'm Sweet water beat
And I'm Texas City sad

[Chorus]
The rhythm keeps me living
But have you heard the news
There's a sad song singer coming
With the rockabilly blues

[Verse 2]
It's hard to keep on singing
When you're lonesome to the bone
10,000 happy people but I'm San Antone alone
One night stands and the man demands
That I get up and go
I'm Odessa desperate
And San Angelo low

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's the same old tune in Temple
About the loving I haven't had
I'm getting Beaumont bitter
And Amarillo mad
I'm giving up on calling you
Because you're evading me
I'm coming home and if you're gone
I'm going to be Tennessee free

[Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[x2]
I’m a newborn man

[x3]
I’m a newborn man and on a rock I stand
I’m a newborn man

[x4]
I’m a newborn man and on a rock I stand
I’m a newborn man

[Chorus 2]

[x2]
He put a light on me

[x3]
He put a light on me so now I can see
He put a light on me

He loves me all the time

[x3]
He loves me all of the time, I’m His and He’s mine
He loves me all the time

[Chorus 1]
I’m a newborn man

[x3]
I’m a newborn man and on the rock I stand
I’m a newborn man

[Verse]
I was dying and the time was flying
And I heard Him calling me
My will was bent and I did repent
And His sweet love set me free

[Chorus 1]
I’m a newborn man

[x3]
I’m a newborn man and on a rock I stand
I’m a newborn man

[x4]
I’m a newborn man and on the rock I stand
I’m a newborn man

[Verse]
Children go where I send thee
How will I send thee
I'm going to send thee one by one
Because the one was the little bitty baby

[Verse]
Wings in the morning and license to fly
Straight to the portals of never more die
Never more pain in them old aching bones
Wings in the morning to carry us home
My grandfather lived by the book all his life
On rich bottom land with twelve kids and a wife
He never saw TV, nor rode a jet plane
But he knew that heaven was holding his claim
The salt of the earth, yet with faith in the Lord
They all got together in that one accord
And what could be greater than God's guarantee
That we can have heaven for eternity?
Rocks in the road and we stumble and fall
Lights getting low, so we don't see at all
But I promise you, on that getting up day
Wings in the morning, we'll fly away

[Chorus]
Well, now, everybody's going to have religion and glory
Everybody's going to be a-singing that story
Everybody's going to have a wonderful time up there
Oh, glory hallelujah
Brother, there's a reckoning a-coming in the morning
Better get ready because I'm giving you the warning
Everybody's going to have a wonderful time up there

[Verse 1]
Now listen, everybody because I'm talking to you
The Lord is the only one to carry you through
Ya better get ready because I'm telling you why
The Lord is a-coming from his throne on high
Going down the valley, going one by one
We're going to be rewarded for the things we've done
How you going to feel about the things you'll say on that judgment day?

[Chorus]
Well-a, well-a, well-a
Well, now, everybody's going to have religion and glory
Everybody's going to be a-singing that story
Everybody's going to have a wonderful time up there
Oh, glory hallelujah
Brother, there's a reckoning a-coming in the morning
Better get ready because I'm giving you the warning
Everybody's going to have a wonderful time up there

[Verse 2]
Now you get your Holy Bible in the back of the book
The book of Revelations is the place you look
If you understand it and you can if you try
The Lord is a-coming from his throne on high
A-reading in the Bible about the things he said
He said he's coming back again to raise the dead
Are you going to be among the chosen few?
Or will you make it through?

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse]
By the way the land is laying
I think I'd be safe in saying
That over the next hill we'll be home
It's a straight and narrow highway
No detours and no byways
And over the next hill we'll be home
From the prophets I've been hearing
I would say the end is nearing
For I see familiar landmarks all along
By the dreams that I've been dreaming
There will come a great redeeming
And over the next hill we'll be home
By the turn the tide is taking
I would say there's no mistaking
That over the next hill we'll be home
There's a place that we are nearing
That so many have been fearing
And over the next hill we'll be home
When we get there we're all hoping
That we'll find the gate is open
And there'll be a refuge from the coming storm
For the way's been long and weary
But at last the end is nearing
And over the next hill we'll be home

[Chorus]
One of these cold lonesome mornings, you're going to kill me

[Verse 1]
I'm going to lay there and I'm going to die
You will soon give me pain enough to fill me
Because I'm gone past doing any good to cry
And the warm sunshine is like a stranger
There's a cruel violation with the dawn
Lord, my pain can't stand illumination

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 2]
Before a wild bird sings I'm going to fly
While it's still dark and I'm still reaching for you
I'll wake up and I can't cry
But I know my heart can't stand another tremor
Now it's holding together I don't know
But just before the dawning's first glimmer

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse]
Well, I think that I should tell you she's a go-er
And when she goes, she won't come back anymore
There isn't anything like it when you've got her all alone
And there's not anything that can replace her when she's gone
Oh, I envy you until the day she walks back out your door
And that she's going to do because she's a go-er
Now don't let her stay too long, she'll take the heart
Right out of your song, you'll pay the price for her one time
But she won't be back anymore, I just thought I'd tell you she's a go-er
Yes I guess, I should have told you she's a go-er
I should have told you that way back long before
But I was trying to overcome the pain she put me through
I was fighting to forget her when she got around to you

[Outro]
Oh, you'll be Heaven high until she doesn't want you anymore
Then she'll be gone again cause she's a go-er
Now don't let her stay
The gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And jumped at every sound
Half in hopeless sorrow
And half in fear that day
Would find the soldiers breaking through
And drag us all away

Just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers feet

But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
And John stood there beside me
As she told us where she'd been
"They've moved Him in the night
And none of us knows where
The stone's been rolled away
And now His body isn't there"
(stone's been rolled away and now His body isn't there)
We both ran toward the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell

Something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
I had seen them crucify Him
And I saw Him die

Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I had promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choice
I had denied I knew His name
And even if He were alive
I know it wouldn't be the same
Suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
I fell down on my knees
And I clung to Him and cried
(Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah)

He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into His eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt and my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I ever had
Just melted into peace

[Chorus] x3
He's alive, He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide

[Outro]
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive, He's alive

[Verse]
Without love, I am half human
Without love, I'm all machine
Without love, there's nothing doing
I will die without love
Without love, I am an island all by myself in a heartbreak sea
Without love, there's no denying I am dying without love
For there is nowhere I can run and there is no hiding place
Sticking out like a sore thumb by that gloomy look upon my face
Without love, I'm incomplete
Without love, I am not whole
Without love, I'm barely on my feet
I am dying without love

[Outro]
For there is nowhere I can run
I am dying without love

[Chorus 1]
I’ve got Jesus in my soul
It’s the only way I know
Watching every move I make
Guiding every step I take
I’ve got Jesus in my soul

[Chorus 2]
I was lifted one night by God’s blinding light
And it shook me right out of my sleep
As His love entered in it washed away my sin
And I praise Him down on my knees

[Chorus 1]

[Verse]
Even though as a sinner I was no beginner
And I’m glad that I never made the grave
Yes I’m thankful everyday for the prayers that were made
They were answered and my soul was saved

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse]
I just want to tell you baby, if I can I need my W-O-M-A-N
A M-A-N needs a W-O for love or dirty boogie or the do-se-do
And the F-E-M-A-L-E can turn a B-O-Y into a M-A-N
Well I can take a failure I can take a flop
I've survived at the bottom better than the top
I take it day by day and I can do alright if my W-O-M-A-N is in at night
I'm not talking good or bad or lust or sin, oh I'm just talking W-O-M-A-N
I can get along without a dog or a cat and luxury is not where happiness is at
I can do without tobacco coffee or tea
And I turn down lots of money making deal offered to me
I can make it through the hills without a jeep or a van
But I've got to have my W-O-M-A-N
I need you, woman, W-O-M-A-N, man, man
I need you and I'll keep you just as long as I can, because you are my W-O-M-A-N

[Verse 1]
Come on, come on
Its going to get crazy in the city
Asking God is he really coming back to get me
Or playing with yeaa
And everything I ever learned as a child
Revelations the whole worlds going wild
Lord come now yeaa
Got my pistol, got my bottle, got my warface
And if the church is the only place I feel safe
But I got faith and I mean real faith
Not Faith Evans I'm talking about the faith that places you in heaven
When I see the Lord I'm a bow down and shoot a bird at them devils because its on
Now
It's on now

[Chorus]
When he comes
No where to run
On that day
The world going to pay
When he comes

[Verse 2]
Yea
I can see Jesus in all white riding on a stallion like a night
Ready to fight yea
And I'm going to to be right beside him
Got my a-k cocked right beside him
Behind him yeaaa
Nothing but thugs on the Lords side
And I was sent to heaven where we reside
Ready to ride isn't no more nickles and dimes primetime
Captured for my savors blood yea the wine
Believe it now time to come to take over
Better watch your language son God's Jahovah
And when it all over and I am acknowledge
To show that I did it and did in college I followed
My own, my own soul, the Lion of Judaaa

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Heavenly father
I pray right now
For everyone under the
Sound of my voice
That they come to know you
As Lord and Saviour in there lives
Help us Lord
To understand that you are soon
To come for your people
And we won't have time to get ready
But must already, be ready
For in the bosom of an eye
You shall appear to receieve Your all
Unto Yourself
Our hearts desire Oh Lord
Is to be ready when You come
Help us Lord to forgive one another
Just as you forgave on Calvirage cross
Help us to love one another
Just as you loved and gave your only son
That we shall not perish but shall have
Everlasting lives
Help us Lord to stand in your righteousness
And to 

[?] every barrier of racial, and ethnic, and social, and economic devision
Help us to see

[Verse]
The legs on the lady walking
Was tanned to a dark berry brown
Her body was made like a song to be played
To the tune of a million a pound
She was a wonder of a woman, I reckon
And she's who screwed her head on right
The toast of the world was a long legged girl
And the cowboy who started the fight
He'd just pulled into town in an old green 1953 Chevrolet pickup truck with whiskey bumbs all over it and the right front fender falling off He coasted on into a no parking zone, got out and took the keys and chunked them down a gutter, turned around and just walked off
He allowed how his time had been wasted
On drinking and running around
He spent half his life searching bar rooms at night
For the sweetheart that he never found
It was plain from the moment their eyes met
They'd wind up in each others arms
The lady's young life was laid open that night
And the cowboy drank deep from of her charms
Singing hey-h-ide-he from the depths of the sea
To the mountains so hollering high
I've found the best one under God's given sun
Yeah the cowboy got lucky tonight
While the angel beside him lay sleeping
He silently thanked God above
For being a kind-hearted father
And blessing his life with her love
For one night of love with that woman
Was more than he knew he deserved
So he found all he had left worth giving
And he gave all he had left for her
He slid back inside his old Levis
And filled up his boots with his feet
While the subways beneath New York City
Screamed through the veins of the street
For the lady gave up without question
The trophy she saved all her life
Then she curled up beside
His old weather worn hide
And the cowboy just laid down and died
Hey-hi-de-he when a whoop through the street
As his soul slowly winged out of sight
The lady was torn from the child being born
And the cowboy found heaven that night
The lady was torn from the child being born
And the cowboy found heaven that night

[Verse]
I'm going to try to be that way
Once upon a time there lived a man
Many years ago in a foreign land
Knew how to live right, tried to be a light
Gave everybody a helping hand
I'm going to try to be that way
I'm going to try to be that way
Do the kind of things a man oughta do
Say the kind of things a man oughta say
I'm going to try to be that way
He never done anybody wrong
He tried to help everybody along
He brought a better land to make a better man
Out of the rich or the poor
Or the weak or the strong
And he preached love and brotherhood
He went around doing good, doing good
Everywhere he went
They knew that he was sent
And the people started acting like they should

[Verse]
I'm just an old chunk of coal
But I'm going to be a diamond some day
I'm going to grow and glow
Until I'm so blue pure perfect
I'm going to put a smile on everybody's face
But I'm going to kneel and pray everyday
Lest I should become vain along the way
I'm just an old chunk of coal, now Lord
But I'm going to be a diamond some day
I'm going to be learn the right way to talk
I'm going to search and find a better way to walk
I'm going to spit and polish my old rough-edged self
Until I get rid of every single flaw
I'm going to be the world's best friend
I'm going to be go around shaking everybody's hand
I'm going to be the cotton-picking Rage of the Age
Yes I'm going to be a diamond some day

[Outro]
I said I'm just an old chunk of coal now Lord
But I'm going to be a diamond some day

[Verse]
Lay me down in dixie
And let the world forget me
I'm going to stay right here till Gabriel calls
Then pull the dream around me
Wrap me in a memory
Because Lord, I love Dixie most of all
For, somewhere far away a warm sun is shining
Somewhere someone's singing in a soft, southern drawl
Lay me down in Dixie where they understand me
Because Lord I love Dixie most of all
Have you ever seen the glory
Of the first warm glow of morning
When that soft Kentucky rain begins to fall?
Then watch the dawn come sliding
Round the corner of the Smokies
That's when I love Dixie most of all

[Chorus]
Darling the seasons are changing, see now the leaves how they die
Love needs no reason for ending, come kiss your baby goodbye

[Verse]
Darling the last time you lied, was it really the last time
Have all the tears that you've cried simply dried up and gone
All in the world, you can hurt anymore is my feeling
Whatever love ever was, never lasted too long
Maybe the best of our life was a beautiful dream babe
That conscience was destined to crumble like castles in sand
All there is left of our love is a little girl's laughter
Let her keep making believing as long as she can
Now and again I still hear some old songs I don't want to
Is it the same over there where you found your new friend
Sometimes at night I still wake up and feel something missing
Maybe I'll never believe in forever again

[Chorus]

[Verse]
My latest sun is sinking fast
My race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past
My triumph is begun
Oh, come, angel band
Come and around me stand
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my eternal home
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my eternal home
I know I'm near the holy ranks
Of friends and kindred dear
I hear the waves on Jordan's banks
The crossing must be near
I've almost reached my heavenly home
My spirit loudly sings
Thy holy ones, behold, they come!
I hear the noise of wings
Oh, bear my longing heart to Him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin
And gives me victory

[Verse 1]
We're going ride the Bible train now
No some won't ride, but we're going get on the Bible train
Some ride but not all the way
The Bible train is in the yard now and it's waiting and oh it looks so good
But you might get bored and impatient waiting like those two good brothers over there
They pass around the bottle in the car before they got on the train
Just want to take one more for the road and then, that leads to something else
Well they aren't on the train no more and maybe 9 or 10 got off with them
There's a sister in the church and she says to her friend your husband works at night and so does mine, why don't we just
Get together sometime when they're gone and go downtown and find us some action, well then they got to get off the Bible train
And then another man he's sitting over there looking at a woman in the corner and he's gives her that eye, you know and they
Meet later, secretly, so they got to get off, this train's got a rule against adultery
And while all this is happening the train is getting ready to go, but there's a lot more to get off than different reasons
Just before the train pulls out, but listen its starting to move now, listen to it
Here we go

[Verse 2]
As it leaves the man on the caboose with a long white beard says
This train is bound for glory, this train
This train is bound for glory, this train
This train is bound for glory nobody rides it but the righteous and holy
This train is bound for glory, this train

[Verse 3]
This train is a free train, this train
This train is a free train, this train
This train is a free train
Everybody rides in Jesus' name

This train is a free train, this train

[Verse 4]
This train it don't pull no liars, this train
This train don't pull no liars, this train
This train don't pull no liars
No false pretenders and no backbiters
This train don't pull no liars, this train

[Verse 5]
This train is a clean train, this train
This train is a clean train, this train
This train is a clean train
Everybody rides it in Jesus name
This train is a clean train, this train

Do you want to ride it children, this holy train
Do you want to ride it children, this righteous train

[Outro]
Get on board
Get on board
Get on board
Get on board this holy train
Get on board
Get on board
Get on board this holy train

[Verse]
I have always had my heroes I've loved a lot of legends
Many men in my mind are riding tall
But my cowboy hero hats off to the man who rode a donkey
He's the greatest cowboy of them all
He loves all his little doggies he speaks to them kind and gently
And he'll lift up any maverick that falls
He sees every stray that scatters like it's the only one that matters
He's the greatest cowboy of them all
Once he rode into the sunset but some returning sunrise
He'll call up all the riders in the sky
I gotta get my roll together gettin' ready for that sunrise
That winds up where old cowboys never die
The trail he rides is narrow but it's straighter than an arrow
And he rides point for all the great and small
He will take us through the wire onto that plain that's higher
He's the greatest cowboy of them all

[Outro]
Once he rode into the sunset
He's the greatest cowboy of them all

[Verse 1]
Ow, you're off and running
Run just like you're scared
Run just like a grey dog
Run just like a deer
Something in the bushes
Staring out at you
Staring at your feelings
Feeling like you do

[Chorus]
One way rider
One way down the road
Baby, I'm right beside you
Everywhere you go

[Verse 2]
Lovers save your secrets, trust not into fools
Don't go look for trouble, it will come to you
Like some long lost passage, fly in broken lines
Here in the fleeting moment, really gone this time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Once upon a victim circumstance is due
Tend to take a hold on everything you do
First we follow leaders
Next we follow fools, now we follow
Footsteps sneaking up on you

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse]
Away in a manger
No crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky
Looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
The cattle are lowing
The poor Baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle
Till morning is nigh
Be near me, Lord Jesus
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me, I pray!
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care
And take us to heaven
To Live with Thee there

[Chorus]
I wish I had of known you when you were a little younger, around me you might have learned a thing or two
If I'd known you longer you might be a little stronger
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do, maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do

[Verse 1]
As he walked into the poolroom you could tell he didn't fit
In his hand made boots, custom suit, pearl handled shooting stick
Tonight there'd be a showdown then everyone would know
Who shoots the meanest game around, The Baron or Billy Joe
Billy Joe looked edgy, about to lose his cool
But the Baron's hands were steady as the two began to duel
Yeah, he was like a General on a battlefield of slate
And he would say to Billy Joe each time he sunk the eight, he'd say

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now Billy Joe was busted but he hadn't felt the sting
And from the far end of the table he threw his Mother's wedding ring
And he said, You won my money but it isn't going to do the trick
I'll bet this ring on one more game against your fancy stick
The Baron's eyes grew foggy as the ring rolled on the felt
And he almost doubled over like he was hit below the belt
Twenty years ago it was the ring his wife had worn
And he didn't know before he left that a son would soon be born
It sounded just like thunder, when the Baron shot the break
But it grew quickly quiet as he lined up the eight
Then a warm hand touched his shoulder and it chilled him to the bone
When he turned and saw the woman who had loved him for so long
The game was never finished, the eight ball never fell
The Baron calmly picked it up and put it on the shelf
Then he placed the ring in the hand that held him long ago
And he tossed that fancy shooting stick to his son Billy Joe
And he said

[Chorus]

[Verse]
O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven
No ear may his His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive him still
The dear Christ enters in
O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel

[Verse 1]
We were gathered around the garbage can, passing around the bottle
We were cold and burning anything, that was dry enough to burn
A shaking man said he had left his family back in Boston
And I knew I'd hear a whole lot more, before it came my turn
A bearded man in his army coat said the answer boys is Jesus
The one called Joe, said all I know is isn't January hell
One guy said let's have a drink to Flagstaff Arizona
And I thought I might freeze to death before I'd get to tell

[Chorus]
About Mobile Bay, magnolia blossoms, cool summer nights
Warm rolling seas, and all my dreams, somewhere I'd lost them
Mobile Bay, magnolia leaves, sweet Rosalee

[Verse 2]
The sun was barely coming up on the wrong side of Chicago
And I was cold and hungry and all the wine was gone
People passed and pointed, said, there's another wino
They didn't know that one more time my dreams would take me home

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse]
It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heaven's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing
Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, over all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever over its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing
O ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing
For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their King
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing

[Verse 1]
Hark! The herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all you nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem

[Chorus]
Hark! The Herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King

[Verse 2]
Hail the Heaven born Prince of peace
(Hail the Son of righteousness)
Light and life to all He brings
(Risen with healing in His wings)
Mild He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth

[Chorus]
Hark! The Herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King
Hark! The Herald angels sing
Glory to the new born King

[Intro]
His daddy said, son you ought to quit dreaming
Put your feet on the ground and your future in the hands of the Lord
But the boy said, no, that isn't enough dad

[Chorus]
All you got here is a ceiling, four walls and a floor

[Verse 1]
He left his home in Buckalou County
He went thumbing and sleeping on the roadside living in jeans
Along about Pittsburgh he got him a good job
Bought him a brand new Malibu Chevy that was part of his dreams
He met a pretty girl, she was thinking of a family
He bought a lot of tapes for his Malibu Chevy, but he didn't want more
And the pretty girl said, boy you ought to slow down

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
He did a little drinking, he did a little gambling
Shot a little nine ball, bet a little money on the football games
He picked up a habit, he got it on the sidewalk
His habit got bigger, but his weekly paycheck stayed the same
His daddy wrote letters but he never answered
The pretty girl begged him to give up the habit and to work on a change
It was a real small gun and a real small robbery
They locked him up and they traded him a number for his name
It isn't big news, it isn't a big story
You didn't see it in the paper, so I guess we ought to put it in a song
The boy got hooked and he couldn't get unhooked
And it's happening somewhere now and maybe that's what's wrong

[Outro]
His daddy said son you ought to quit dreaming

[Chorus]
O come all you faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come you, o come you to bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
O come let us adore him

[x3]
Christ the Lord

[Verse 1]
Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultations
Sing, all you citizens of heaven above
Glory to god
Glory in the highest
O come let us adore him

[x3]
Christ the Lord
See how the shepherds
Summoned to his cradle
Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze
We too will thither
Bend our joyful footsteps

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yea, lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus, to thee be glory given
Word of the father
Now in flesh appearing
O come let us adore him

[x3]
Christ the Lord

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Hey porter! Hey porter
Would you tell me the time
How much longer will it be until we cross
That Mason Dixon Line
At daylight would you tell that engineer
To slow it down
Or better still, just stop the train
Because I want to look around
Hey porter! Hey porter
What time did ya say
How much longer will it be until I can
See the light of day
When we hit Dixie will you tell that engineer
To ring his bell
And ask everybody that isn't asleep
To stand right up and yell
Hey porter! Hey porter
It's getting light outside
This old train is puffing smoke
And I have to strain my eyes
But ask that engineer if he will
Blow his whistle please
Because I smell frost on cotton leaves
And I feel that Southern breeze
Hey porter! Hey porter
Please get my bags for me
I don't need anybody to tell me now
That we're in Tennessee
Go tell that engineer to make that
Lonesome whistle scream
We're not so far from home
So take it easy on the steam
Hey porter! Hey porter
Please open up the door
When they stop the train I'm going to get off first
Because I can't wait no more
Tell that engineer I said thanks a lot
And I didn't mind the fare
I'm going to set my feet on Southern soil
And breathe that Southern air

[Verse]
It happened one day near December's end
Two neighbors called on an old friend
And they found his shop so meager and lean
Made gay with thousand bows of green
And Conrad was sitting with face a-shine
When he suddenly stopped as he stitched a twine
And he said "Old friends, at dawn today
When the cock was crowing the night away
The Lord appeared in a dream to me
And said "I'm coming your guest to be."
So I've been busy with feet astir
Strewing my shop with branches of fern
The table is spread and the kettle is shined
And over the rafters the holly is twined
Now I'll wait for my Lord to appear
And listen closely so I will hear
His step as He nears my humble place
And I'll open the door and look on His face
So his friends went home and left Conrad alone
For this was the happiest day he had known
For long since, his family had passed away
And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas Day
But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas Guest
This Christmas would be the dearest and best
So he listened with only joy in his heart
And with every sound he would rise with a start
And look for the Lord to be at his door
Like the vision he had had a few hours before
So he ran to the window after hearing a sound
But all he could see on the snow covered ground
Was a shabby beggar whose shoes were torn
And all of his clothes were ragged and worn
But Conrad was touched and he went to the door
And he said, "You know, your feet must be frozen and sore
I have some shoes in my shop for you
And a coat that will keep you warmer too."
So with grateful heart the man went away
But Conrad noticed the time of day
And wondered what made the Lord so late
And how much longer he'd have to wait
When he heard a knock, he ran to the door
But it was only a stranger once more
A bent old lady with a shawl of black
With a bundle of kindling piled on her back
She asked for only a place to rest
But that was reserved for Conrad's Great Guest
But her voice seemed to plead "Don't send me away
Let me rest for awhile on Christmas Day"
So Conrad brewed her a steaming cup
And told her to sit at the table and sup
But after she left he was filled with dismay
For he saw that the hours were slipping away
And the Lord hadn't come as he said he would
Then Conrad felt sure he had misunderstood
When out of the stillness he heard a cry
"Please help me and tell me where am I?"
So again he opened his friendly door
And stood disappointed as twice before
It was only a child who'd wandered away
And was lost from her family on Christmas Day
Again Conrad's heart was heavy and sad
But he knew he should make the little girl glad
So he called her in and he wiped her tears
And quieted all her childish fears
Then he led her back to her home once more
But as he entered his own darkened door
He knew the Lord was not coming today
For the hours of Christmas had passed away
So he went to his room and knelt down to pray
And he said "Dear Lord, why did you delay?
What kept you from coming to call on me?
For I wanted so much your face to see."
When soft in the silence a voice he heard
"Lift up your head for I kept my word
Three times my shadow crossed your floor
And three times I came to your lonely door
I was the beggar with bruised, cold feet
And I was the woman you gave something to eat
I was the child on the homeless street
Three times I knocked, and three times I came in
And each time I found the warmth of a friend
Of all the gifts, love is the best
And I was honored to be your Christmas Guest

[Verse]
I dreamed I woke up and you were gone
I reached out but no one was there
I called your name and nobody answered
And I wondered if I cry would you care
I had said I love you so many times
But they're just words that you hear people say
And I never knew just how much I loved you
Until suddenly you'd gone away
Now who'd stand by me the way you did
When I was weak it was you that made me strong
And you had a way of touching my heart
Like the words in a beautiful song
Aw we had good times and we shared the bad
So I'll take whatever comes
Because you were the best years of my life
And we shared the cake and we shared the crumbs
Then just before the hurt had built up in my heart
To a mountain that I knew I could never climb
I woke up I woke up to a beautiful world and you were there
You were there all the time
I love you America, I love you America
And if I sail a stormy sea
Please be there to shelter me
I love you America, I love you America
So just keep holding me close and I will care
And we'll show the world that what we share
Is still the greatest love affair
And I love you America
I love you

[Verse 1]
He rode easy in the saddle, He was tall and lean
And at first you'd have thought nothing but a streak of mean could make a man look so down right strong
But one look in his eyes and you knew you were wrong
He was a mountain of a man, and I want you to know
He could preach hot hell or freezing snow
He carried a Bible in a canvas sack and folks just called him The Reverend Mr. Black
He was poor as a beggar, but he rode like a king
Sometimes in the evening, I'd hear him sing

[Chorus]
I've got to walk that lonesome valley
I've got to walk it by myself
Oh, nobody else can walk it for me
I got to walk it by myself
You've got to walk that lonesome valley
You've got to walk it by yourself
Oh, nobody else can walk it for you
You've got to walk it by yourself

[Verse 2]
If ever I could have thought this man in black was soft and had any yellow up his back
I gave that notion up the day a lumberjack came in and it wasn't to pray
Yeah, he kicked open the meeting house door and he cussed everybody up and down the floor
Then, when things got quiet in the place, he walked up and cusses in the preacher's face
He hit that Reverend like a kick of a mule and to my way of thinking
It took a real fool to turn the other face to that lumber jack
But that's what he did, The Reverend Mr. Black
He stood like a rock, a man among men and he let that lumberjack hit him again
And then with a voice as quiet as could be, he cut him down like a big oak tree when he said

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's been many years since we had to part
And I guess I learned his ways by heart
I can still hear his sermon's ring, down in the valley where he used to sing
I followed him, yes, sir, and I don't regret it and I hope I will always be a credit to his memory
Because I want you to understand, the Reverend Mr. Black was my old man

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox holding my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wondering
Matchbox holding my clothes
I am not got no matches
But I sure got a long way to go

[Verse]
I'm an old poor boy
I'm a long way from home
I'm an old poor boy
And I'm a long way from home
I've never been happy
Because everything I ever did was wrong
Well, if you don't want my peaches
Honey please don't shake my tree
If you don't want any of those peaches
Honey, please don't mess around my tree
I've got news for you baby
Leave me here in misery, all right!
Well let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
Watch how your puppy dog runs

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I'm the bad man in the movies that always bites the dust
I'm a Cadillac that sits outback gathering the rust
And you're the sheriff's lady in a custom Thunderbird
I'd love to tell you how I feel but I can't find the words

[Chorus]
Because the blues keep getting bluer
And the pain won't go away
Yes, the blues keep getting bluer
I miss you more, everyday
Um hum hum hum hum hum

[Verse 2]
I'm the bad boy in the corner whose faced against the wall
But I know enough to know that I don't know it all
Sometimes I go crazy sometimes I go sane
But mostly I spend lots of time somewhere in between

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Some glad morning when this life is o'er
I'll fly away
To that home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

[Chorus]
I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away

[Verse 2]
Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To that land where joy will never end
I'll fly away

[Chorus]
I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away

[Outro]
Oh, I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away

[Verse]
I was thumbing a ride one Saturday morning
Out of Nashville toting my sack
I lent my car to a girl that lived in Chattanooga
And she hadn't brought it back
She was drinking pretty heavy when I let her have it
I hope she knows it was only a loan
There's no telling what I might have told her back at the time
But that old car was also my home
About five miles out I was getting kind of tired
Sweating hard and feeling kind of weak
I woke up with no cigarettes and nothing to drink
And I hadn't had a bite to eat
My nerves were so quick I couldn't tell where I was shaking
Then a set of brakes sang my song
Some fellow stuck his head out a '57 Chevy
And hollered, hey man come on
I told them I was heading down to Chattanooga
They said, hop in we're going there too
And the way they took off in a cloud of smoke
I still can't believe it was true
They had their windows down and I was sitting in the back
With my tongue still hung in my throat
He was hitting just about a hundred and ten
And he said, man what do you think of this boat
Well there was two semis struggling up ahead
One trying to pass the other
They had the whole road blocked so he passed them on the right
And let me tell you something brother
I was so nervous that my teeth was clicking
There wasn't any way my head could think
Then the one that was sitting on the passenger side
Turned and said, hey man you want something to drink
I just shook my head because I couldn't talk
He said okay and then he said cheers
The fools were drinking whiskey and wine
And chasing it down with beer
Well I started sweating that old sticky sweat
And I know I was white as a sheep
Then one turned the radio on wide open
And said, hey man check that beat
By the time we reached the top of Monteagle
I thought I heard a rumbling sound
And then I saw a sign that said falling rock
And right there I was floorboard bound
I was rolling and squirming on the old floorboard
Too weak to sit or stand
And then the driver said we're doing a hundred and twenty
Look, here man no hands
I got up enough nerve to raise up and look
And by now there couldn't be no surprise
But his hair was blowing all over my face
And dandruff blew in both eyes
He never did drive on the right or left
He just kept on riding that line
I rubbed my eyes and saw the prettiest thing
The Chattanooga city limit sign
He slowed down and I said
Mister, please I'd like to get off right here
He said, aw ride on into town with us
We're gonna go down and pick up some more beer
I said, please, once more and he stopped the car
And then he handed me my sack
Said they'd look for me on the road later on
In case I wanted to catch a ride back
I got out and sat down by the side of the road
Feeling sick and looking mighty pale
I don't remember anything much after that
But next morning I woke up in jail
I didn't know anybody in my cell
And didn't want to ask why was there
But they all kept grinning and turning their heads
And it was more than my head could bear
So I called the jailer and I asked him to tell me
Why I was there if he'd be so kind
He said for stopping the traffic while I was hugging and kissing
The Chattanooga city limit sign

[Chorus]
From 1492 to 1998
I threw a rock 'n' roll party on my last birthday
Feels good, rocking my life away
I'm moving and grooving and I'm having fun night and day

[Verse]
Streamline, fleet line, military brat
I got the general's daughter, taught her where it was at
I'm rocking, rocking my life away
I'm moving and grooving and I'm having fun night and day
I know a girl from Texas, she chilli pepper hot
She knows hot to reel it and knows how to rock
I'm rocking, rocking my life away
I'm moving and grooving, having fun night and day
You know, I like to party and I like to have fun
I'd like to kill her, I've got-a rock on
Come on, rocking my life away
Moving and grooving, I'm having fun night and day
How about you girl?
You know, I like some long and I like some lean
I like the way that you shake that thing
I'm rocking, rocking my life away
I'm moving and grooving, I'm having fun night and day
I got to have it one more time girl

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'm rocking
Rocking
I'm rocking, rocking my life away
I'm moving and grooving, I'm getting some night and day

[Verse 1]
I sat at home on Friday last waiting for your call
Thinking as the hours pass, were you worth it all
As the tears begin to fill my head
It's then I thought to write instead
Another hit song full of heartache thanks to you

[Chorus]
Thanks to you I'm getting the applause
Thanks to you and all the pain you cause
Credit must go where credit is due
So I tip my hat and I toast to you
For all the hit songs full of heartache, thanks to you

[Verse 2]
Days go by and weeks will pass with not a word from you
And I don't mind when people ask how's you know who
Because when the tears begin to fill my head
It's then I start to write instead
Another hit song full of heartache, thanks to you

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Well it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready now go babe go
But don't you, step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Chorus]
You can knock me down, step on my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you going to do
But uh, uh, honey lay off of my shoes

[Chorus]
Now don't you, step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Verse]
You can burn my house, Steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
But uh uh honey lay off of my shoes

[Chorus]
Now don't you, step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Well it's blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes

[x3]
You can do anything but lay off of my blue

[x2]
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Verse 1]
I was standing by the window
On one cold and cloudy day
When I saw the hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away

[Chorus]
Will the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky Lord, in the sky

[Verse 2]
I said to the undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this lady you are carrying
Lord I hate to see her go

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I went back home, the home was lonesome
Since my mother, she was gone
All my brothers and sisters crying
What a home so sad and alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
We sang songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that mother maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
On a rainy, windy morning that's the day that I was born on
In the old sharecroppers one room country shack
They say my mummy left me, same day that she had me
Said she hit the road and never once looked back
And I just thought I'd mention, my grandma's old age pension
Is the reason why I'm standing here today
I got all my country learning, living and a churning
Picking cotton, raising hell, and bailing hay

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
And now sweet Caroline, I don't guess I'll ever find
Another woman put together like you all
With your wiggle and your walking, and your big city talking
Your brand new shiny Plymouth rag-top car
Yeah it's hurry up and wait, in this world of give and take
Seems like haste makes for waste every time
And I pray to my soul, when you hear those ages roll
You better know I'm going to get my share of mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my Dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light

[Chorus]
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

[Verse 2]
Just like a blind man I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the Lord - I saw the light

[Chorus]
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

[Verse 3]
I was a fool to wander and stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

[Chorus]
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

[Verse]
Most of the favorite memories of my boyhood days in Arkansas
Are scattered around an old wood stove at a place we call John's
It was just an old tar paper shack
With a pump out front and some junk out back
But inside there was always a hot cup of coffee
And a warm place around the fire for anyone
John pumped gas for a living and he fixed tires on the side
And I guess old John could fix most anything
If you didn't push it he'd try
And he gave me my first charge account for some gas
And financed my first date
Even fixed my old radio just in case I got lucky
And wanted to park down by the lake
And among the carburetors and the re-built generators
I spent the whole night picking on an old flattop guitar
John would play the fiddle and I'd always sing a little
No there is no place to get filled up the way you could at John's
John taught me a whole lot about country music because he loved it
We'd sit up and listen to the Grand Ole Opry every Saturday night
Nobody would ever say a word, not even during Martha White
And I was awfully young back then, but still I knew just why
That John closed the shop the whole day
When we heard that Hank had died
There was something else special about ole John
He had a way of making us kids feel important
Simply by giving us a good clean place to hang out
Well I can still hear him saying pumping gas is a fever boys
It'll get in your blood and it'll make your face break out in a grin
Just to check old lady Hanson's oil or to help a stranded friend

[Outro]
And among the carburetors and the re-built generators

[x2]

[Chorus]
Fair weather friends, fair weather sailors
Will leave you stranded on life's shore
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart endures

[Verse 1]
We never know which way the wind will blow
Nor when or where the next turmoil will be
But he's a solid rock when troubles grow
And he's holding out a saving hand for me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
He'll be a refuge in the storm
He'll be a beacon in the night
In the chilly winds of doubt he'll keep you warm
When you can't find your way he'll be your light

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn

[Chorus]
And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the green river where paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

[Verse 2]
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with paradise waiting
Just five miles away from wherever I am

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Mad is the captain of alpha centauri
We must be out of our minds
Still we are shipmates bound for tomorrow
And everyone here's flying blind

[Chorus]
Oh, we must believe in magic
We must believe in the guiding hand
If you believe in magic
You'll have the universe at your command

[Verse 2]
Mad is the crew bound for alpha centauri
Dreamers and poets and clowns
Bold is the ship bound for alpha centauri
Nothing can turn it around

[Chorus]

[x4]

[Verse 1]
You may live alone and close your eyes
Some folks do
You may dream a dream that's twice your size
All night through

[Pre-Chorus]
But when the morning comes and who's to tell
Your dreams to only you

[Chorus]
Only love, love, only, only love will do
Only love, love, only, only love comes true
Nothing else you see there's nothing else
Only love, only love

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I have known a love within my heart
One or two
When one love would end one would start
I never knew
If love should come your way you learn to say
I love you, I love you

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I'm longing to ride on a freight train
And pull a slouch hat down low on my ears
I'm yearning to leave this old town on the fly
And lose all my troubles and cares
In this day of airplane and highways
The slow way is sometimes the best

[Chorus]
So I'm longing to ride on a freight train
And be a good old American guest

[Verse 2]
Well the pressures of life they got to me
And they got down way deep in my soul
I'm tired of the rat-race want to go back to the slow pace
And hear a fast freight rattle and roll
I want to live out my days like a hobo
And take myself that long-needed rest

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I want to live off the land that I love and I've labored for
And spend a few days headed west

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
My name is Joe Roberts, I work for the state
I'm a sergeant out on Perenville barracks number 8
I've always done an honest job, honest as I could
Got a brother named Frankie, Frankie isn't no good
Ever since we were young kids, it's been the same come down
I'd get a call on the short wave, Frankie's in trouble downtown
Well, if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away
But sometimes when it's your brother, you look the other way

[Chorus]
Yeah, me and Frankie laughing and drinking, nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria while the band played "The Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's straying, like any brother should
Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no good

[Verse 2]
Well, Frankie went into the army back in 1965
I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife
But them wheat prices kept on dropping, until it was like we's getting robbed
Frankie came home in '68, and me, I took this job

[Chorus]
Yeah, me and Frankie laughing and drinking, nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria while the band played "The Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's straying, teach him how to walk that line
Man turns his back on his family, ain't no friend of mine

[Verse 3]
The night was like any other, I got a call about a quarter to nine
There was trouble at a roadhouse out on the Michigan line
There was a kid on the floor, looking bad, bleeding hard from his head
There was a girl crying at a table, it was Frankie, she said
I ran out and I jumped in my car, then I hit the lights
I must have done about a hundred and ten to Michigan County that night
It was down by the crossroads, out by willow bank
Seen the Buick with Ohio plates, behind the wheel was Frank
Well, I chased him through them county roads, until the sign said Canadian border five miles from here
Pulled over to the side out the highway, watched the taillights disappear

[Chorus]
Yeah, me and Frankie laughing and drinking, nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria while the band played "The Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's straying, like any brother should
Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no good

[Verse]
Until the false and the fair see the light who's to care
That you live or you laugh or the sun
Came to shine in a sweet drop of dew at your feet
Such as my heart lately has done

[x2]
I'll cross over Jordan someday
I'll sing on that beautiful shore
If God loves me like I love you
I'll go to heaven for sure

[x2]
Oh the love that was not on the lips I forgot
Nor in hearts I remember as cold
Was down in the grace of your loving embrace
Never to die but to ever unfold

[x2]

[Outro]
I'll cross over Jordan someday

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Well here I am, a hobo with my hobo's pots and pans
In an Alberta rail yard with my red-faced hobo friends

[Chorus]
Here comes a train east bound for Nova Scotia shore
It's my last ride my friends aren't going to hobo anymore

[Verse 2]
So long BC Benning, you have been a real good friend
And goodbye Boxcar Willie, I guess I won't see you again

[Chorus]
Here comes a train east bound for Nova Scotia shore
It's my last ride my friends aren't going to hobo anymore

[Verse 3]
No one loves a hobo and I need some love
Yes I'm always so hungry and I never get enough
And no one wants a hobo hanging round their doors

[Chorus]
Here comes a train east bound for Nova Scotia shore
It's my last ride my friends aren't going to hobo anymore

[Verse 4]
There's a man in Halifax that will give this bum a job
I'll use the money to find a woman I can love

[Chorus]
Here comes a train east bound for Nova Scotia shore
It's my last ride my friends aren't going to hobo anymore
Here comes a train east bound for Nova Scotia shore
It's my last ride my friends aren't going to hobo anymore

[Verse]
Saw a girl in Tampa I asked her for a date
She said baby I'm a sailor this thing better wait
I said I don't believe you would you show me some proof
She showed me her tattoo then I knew that that's the truth
Met a woman on a highway by the exit sign
You'd bet your last dollar that she was forty-nine
But she swored to me that she was still in her youth
When I turned down the lights I knew that that's the truth
Had a girl on the border I guess she was shy
Never spoke a word in years not even hi
But one night she said honey we're going to raise the roof
She put on some dancing shoes then I knew that that's the truth
I knew a preacher's daughter in fact I knew her well
He said son you better ramble unless you've got something to sell
It's an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
He pulled out a fourty-four now I know that that's the truth
That's the truth

[Verse]
When Robert E Lee surrended the Confederacy
Jefferson Davis was upset about it
He said how dare that man resent an order
Form the president of the Confederate States of America
Then somebody told him that General Lee had made the decision himself
In order to save lives because he felt that the battle coming up
Would cost about 20 000 lives on both sides
And he said 240 000 dead already is enough
So this song is not about the North or the South but about the bloody brother war
Brother against brother father against son the war that nobody won
And for all those lives that were saved I gotta say God bless Robert E Lee
Well the mansion where the General used to live is burning down
Cottonfields are blue with Sherman's troups
I overheard a yankee say yesterday Nashville fell
So I'm on my way to join the fight General Lee might need my help
But look away look away Dixie I don't want them to see
What they're doing to my Dixie God bless Robert E Lee
Sherman's troups burned Atlanta and the flames lit up the sky
And those of us who survived it are watching my Dixie die
But today at Appamattox General Lee sat down
And surrended to the yankees and Ulysees S Grant
So look away look away Dixie

[Outro]
I won't ever stop loving you my Dixie till they put me in the ground
And the last words they probably hear from me are God bless Robert E Lee

[Verse]
Hold on honey I'd like to say I'm busting out and breaking away
I'm letting you go like a hot horseshoe I can't take another heartache from you
Think about how it's going to be when you start back to needing me
When your dancing shoes have lost their shine I'm going to be gone in mine
I'm leaving now I'm leaving now
Get outta my face get out of my place I'm leaving now
Adios I'm leaving now
Yeah the time they come when you trim the fat
Feed the kitchen scraps to the front seat cat
Bye bye baby when the bills come due
You might have to give up a jewel or two
Eat your heart out anyway it's hard as your head
And it's cold as clay
It's all over now you won't have me
Your sugar daddy or your money tree
I'm leaving now yeah I'm leaving now
Get out of my space get out of my face
I'm leaving now hey I'm leaving now
Pull up the collar on my traveling coat
Sell that miserable pleasure boat
I wouldn't give a nickel for another buck
I'm living on muscle guts and luck
If anybody asks where did I go
Tell them I went where the wild goose go
They won't even have me an area code
Don't have a number don't need a row
I'm leaving now (me too) I'm leaving now
Get out of my face get out of my space
Leaving now adios I'm leaving now

[Verse]
Coleman Bonner was a fiddle playing fool
He's a backwoods rounder and a breaker of mules
Coleman Bonner's got a wore out bow
He's been playing all day down the new cut road
Coleman's little sister said you better act right Coleman
Daddy's gone to Louisville he'll be back tonight
He's going to get another wagon and a good pair of mules
And we going to move to Texas we just waiting on you
Coleman's daddy pulled up in the yard
He said pack up your lives kids it's getting too hard
Kentucky's alright but there's too many people
Well just the other day I thought I saw a church steeple
Coleman said daddy don't you worry bout me
I'm going to stay here in Kentucky till the day I d
I'm going to drink that sourmash I'm going to race that mare
And find that woman with the fox red hair
Now you all been moving west since the day you got married
Well I'm getting off the wagon daddy I'm too old to be carried
Going to stay here in Kentucky where the bluegrass grow
I'm going to play it all night down the new cut road
Coleman's daddy said now what's it all comn' to
Young people these days they just as stubborn as mules
You can't make him go naw he's too old for that
It's that damned ole fiddle and that bolder hat
Coleman's mama said let the boy stay
Because he's raised up solid he can find his own way
But as for me honey I'm with you
I always thought Kentucky was just passing through
Coleman's little sister then she started into a crying
And his daddy shook his head for the very last time
Coleman's mama said somebody's got to do it
Wouldn't be no Kentucky less you didn't stick to it Coleman
Coleman Bonner stood on the porch of that cabin
Watched them all go to Texas in a covered wagon
He pulled out his fiddle and he rosined up his bow
And he played a little tune called the new cut road
Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late last month
Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none
He came home too drunk from mixin' Tanqueray and wine
He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call'm Johnny 99

Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop
Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top
When an off-duty cop snuck up on him from behind
Out in front of the Club Tip Top, they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99

Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown
He came into the courtroom and stared poor Johnny down
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime
Prison for ninety-eight and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99
A fistfight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away
His mama stood up and shouted "Judge don't take my boy this way"
Well, son, you got any statement you'd like to make
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away

Now judge, judge I had debts no honest man could pay
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they were gonna take my house away
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man
But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand
Well, your honour, I do believe I'd be better off dead
So if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head
Then sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time
And let them shave off my hair and burn Johnny 99

[Verse]
I've drank wine with winos in the alleys dim I've sipped wine with kings
I've seen wino's harlots making love to them I've seen kings with queens
But I find there is no difference to me they are all the same
Except their name for they all need wine and they all need love
To me they are all the same
I've seen the need for just one drink cause the tears to fall from the winos' eyes
I've seen the need for love make a kingdom fall even rich men cry
But I find there is no difference to me they are all the same except their name
For they all need wine and they all need love
To me they're all the same
I watched the weeds grow higher on a pauper's grave where the wino lies
I saw a grave attended by a hundred slaves even rich men die
But I find there is no difference to me they are all the same except their name
For they all need wine and they all need love
To me they are all the same

[Verse]
I'm feeling a little restless James
Warm up my limousine take me to the top of some ole mountain
And let me out
Aw I will be alright it's just that things got tough on Easy Street tonight
It's hard on Easy Street some time blue on Easy Street some days
I thought our place in the sun was made in the shade
But it ain't no bed of roses up on Easy Street these days
Don't worry about the gold my heart's not that cold
I'm only taking two things when I leave
One life so I can live it
One love so I can give it where I please
It's hard on Easy Street some time blue on Easy Street some days
I thought our place in the sun was made in the shade
But it is not bed of roses up on Easy Street these days

[Verse]
Well I tell you a story about a good man
Who had many a problem before he reached dry land
It isn't easy for a good man to go down no it isn't easy for a good man to go down
On the earth there was trouble sorrow and pain
So the Lord said to Noah I'm going to make it rain
It isn't easy for a good man to go down no it isn't easy for a good man to go down
Noah gathered his sons and the ark it was raised
Two by two came the animals that they might be saved
It isn't easy
Well it rained forty days and it rained forty nights
All the earth it was covered the mountains out of sight
It isn't easy for a good man to go down no it isn't easy for a good man to go down
When the waters receded and the earth it was dry
The Lord said to Noah go forth and multiply
It isn't easy for a good man to go down no it isn't easy for a good man to go down
Yes the Lord made a rainbow way up in the sky
He promised no flood would ever murder you and die
It isn't easy for a good man to go down no it isn't easy for a good man to go down

[Verse 1]
Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, and it's been coming for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, shining down like water

[Chorus]
I Want to know, have you ever seen the rain?

[x2]
Coming down sunny day?

[Verse 2]
Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
Until forever on it goes
Through the circle fast and slow
I know, and it can't stop, I wonder

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
In an Appalachian, Greyhound station
She sits there waiting, in a family way
Goodbye brother, Tell Mom I love her
Tell all the others, I'll write someday

[Chorus]
From an teenage lover, to an unwed mother
Kept undercover, like some bad dream
While unwed fathers, they can't be bothered
They run like water, through a mountain stream

[Verse 2]
In a cold and gray town, a nurse
Say's Lay down
This is no playground, and this isn't home
Someone's children, out having children
In a gray stone building, all alone
On somewhere else bound, Smokey Mountain Greyhound
She bows her head down, humming lullabies
Your daddy never, meant to hurt you ever
He just don't live here, but you have got his eyes

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Well, they run like water
Through a mountain stream

[Verse]
Cane standing in the field getting old and red
Lot of misery in Georgetown three men laying dead
Joshua head of the government he said strike for better pay
Cane cutters are striking but Joshua gone away
Joshua gone Barbados staying in a big hotel
People on St Vincent got many sad tales to tell
The sugar mill owner told the strikers I don't need you to cut my cane
Bring me another bunch of fellas your strike be all in vain
Get a bunch of tough fellas bring them from Zion Hill
Bring them in a bus to Georgetown know somebody could kill
Sunny Child the overseer I swear he's an ignorant man
Walking through the canefields pistol in his hand
Joshua gone Barbados just like he don't know
People on the island got no place to go
Police giving protection new fellas cutting the cane
Strikers can't do nothing strike be all in vain
Sunny Child cussed the strikers wave his pistol round
They're beating Sunny with the cutless beat him to the ground
There's a lot of misery in Georgetown you can hear all the women bawl
Joshua gone Barbados he don't care at all
Cane standing in the fields getting old and red
Sunny Child in the hospital pistol on his bed
I wish I could go to England Trinidad or Curacao
People on the island got no place to go
Joshua gone Barbados staying in a big hotel
People on St Vincent got many sad tales to tell

[Verse 1]
In a cozy little restaurant for lovers
It seems so out of place for you and me
We used to play around under the covers
But now its just a place to watch TV

[Chorus]
So love me like you used to
When our love was brand new
And darling when we are through
You can love me again
And hold me like you want to
Instead of like you have to
Love me like you used to love me
When you used to love

[Verse 2]
Maybe we could use a long vacation
But the trouble here is bound to tag along
We used to be each others inspiration
When it only took my touch to turn you on

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well we used to sit and talk about forever
But now we hardly ever talk at all
We walked a lot of tight ropes together
We always caught each other when we fall

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Love me like you used to love me
When you used to love

[Verse 1]
The girl from the canyon smiled a smile that brought me home
As sick and bleeding as I was she took me on her own
Brought me to the canyon where the sun poured down like rain
Her smiling eyes and the mountain light I thought myself insane
These hills have seen me running till my horse could hardly stand
Hiding by day in the mountains moving with the moon on the land
I'm hoping to find my freedom in a world that wants me dead
The girl from the canyon took and healed my wounds instead

[Chorus]
The girl from the canyon she don't need to know what I done
She laughed with me in the moonlight till the morning brought the sun
The girl from the canyon the girl from the canyon she was the only one

[Verse 2]
An outlaw is a hunted one with a price upon his head
We're all outlaws in a way that is what she said
And so I left the canyon when I was strong enough to ride
The girl from the canyon she was riding by my side

[Chorus]
The girl from the canyon she don't need to know what I done...
She was the only one

[Verse]
Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following the footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speaking to a soul
The poisoned air he's breathing has the dirty smell of dying
Because it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clicking of the turnstile and the rattle of his chain

"Oh," she said, "Casey it's been so long since I've seen you"
"Here," she said, "just a kiss to make a body smile"
"See," she said, "I've put on new stockings just to please you"
"Lord," she said, "Casey can you only stay a while"

Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home
Standing in the corner, Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
"Oh!" she said, "I suppose you seldom think about me"
"Now," she said, "now that you've a family of your own"
"Still," she said, "it's so blessed good to feel your body"
"Lord," she said, "Casey it's a shame to be alone!"

[Verse 1]
Baby you're tired I can see in your eyes I know how you feel
We've been together too long to conceal
What's in our hearts maybe we should part but after so many years
That would only bring loneliness sorrow and tears and anyway

[Chorus]
I never could never would never will ever kill what's between us
So let's try again we'll start a brand new dance between old friends

[Verse 2]
There will always be days when it don't seem to pay when it just doesn't rhyme
Well it's bound to happen some of the time
Our best days aren't gone we don't need to move on well maybe we could try
But I don't think you could make it and neither could I and anyway
I never could
Baby come here love hasn't disappeared you're just feeling low
And let me tell you my darling it's a feeling I know
It don't mean too much we just got out of touch well that's easy to change
Because loving you isn't too hard to arrange and anyway

[Chorus]
I never could never would never will ever kill what's between us...

[Verse]
As usual you just wouldn't listen waiting for your turn to talk while I explain
You just wouldn't stop and listen so you got your heart run over by a mystery train
I tried to warn you from the start you must be careful of my kind
Not quite crazy not quite sane right on the borderline
How many times I told you it's got nothing to do with you why can't you see
But there's a difference in our music you've got yours but mine's got me
I stay up day and night for nothing putting words on paper I can't find
Not quite crazy not quite sane right on the borderlin
It's a musical whodunit you know how people love a mystery
There is no knot untangable the only thing unchangeable is me
So if you are going to stay get ready to go through this from time to time
I'm not quite crazy I'm not quite sane right on the borderline

[Chorus]

[x4]
I've stood on the bank by the weeping willow
With another wide river to cross
Another wide river to cross
With another wide river to cross
I believe I can make it to the other side
Because I feel a hand on me
Helping me with another wide river to cross

[Verse]
Well I've come here to tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right
I'm a tramp and a gambler I stay out late at night
But a porterhouse steak three times a day for my board
That's more than any loafer in this big town can afford
Well I got an electric fan to keep me cool while I sleep
A little baby boy playing around at my feet
I'm a rambler and a gambler and I've lead a dirty life
Well I tell you folks
I'm ragged but I'm right
Well then I got married I knew I'd settle down
And I built a little love nest right here in my hometown
Now I've got a family one that I'm proud of
I know that we'll be happy because they're the ones I love
Got a big electric fan to keep me cool while I sleep
I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right

[Outro]
I'm a rambler and a gambler I've lead a dirty life
Well I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right

[Verse 1]
There's so much I don't know

[x2]
I don't understand why the summer's so hot
I don't understand why an apple core rots
And I have no idea when I'll see a rainbow
But there's one thing I do know

[Chorus]
I know that God isn't a stained glass window
And I believe there is a Holy Ghost
I know that God isn't a stained glass window
Because He never keeps His window closed

[Verse 2]
There's so much I don't see

[x2]
I don't see how hair can turn silver-grey
I don't see why my prayers can't get answered right away
I don't see why some folks keep a load in their mind
With a sharp axe to grind
And I don't understand why the truth takes a twist
I don't understand why there is loneliness
I don't know why they claim some men have no soul
But there's one thing I do know

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I prayed to feel more joy in my salvation
A selfish prayer I finally came to know
For the greatest joy while living comes to me when I am giving
Giving children bread of life and watch them grow

[Chorus]
And my greatest joy is knowing that my children walk in truth
And that they are giving you Lord of their fire and strength of youth
Yes, I've found the greatest joy in my salvation
Is knowing that my children walk in truth

[Verse 2]
It's hard to feed someone else when you're hungry
And don't try to teach when you don't understand
No one will follow you if you don't live it each day through
And a frightened child won't hold a trembling hand

[Chorus]

[Spoken]
Old Touchschriek was the main name server suspected of being a shoulder surfer. But he didn't know from shit about challenge response systems
Now Ramona A Stone we know was selling interest drugs. She got males all hung up on her mind filters
She was, if you don't mind me saying so, an update demon. Now Leon he couldn't wait for 12 o'clock midnight... He jumps up on the stage with a criss criss machete and slashes around cutting a zero on everything. I mean a zero in the fabric of time itself
Was this a suspect?
I says to myself: "Whoa! Quelle courage!"
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself
Let me take you back to when it all began

[Verse 1]
Well, I had a little feeling to have a big night
And I woke up feeling small and not so brave and not quite right
I had to face the where was I and who was she, what did I do
Worst of all, I had to face the big light

[Chorus]
The big light came through my window and it opened up my eyelids
And it snapped them up like roller blinds and it told me things that I did
I can't face another day and night of good ideas and complications
And I'm thankful that I didn't open another bottle of inspiration

[Verse 2]
When the hangover this morning had a personality
And I cast my shattered mind over selected memories
Didn't even touch the light switch, cause I didn't want to see
That haggard face that was staring back at me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yes, I had a little feeling to have a big time
And I woke up to alarm bells like a big church chime
Had to face the where was I and who was she, what did I do
Worst of all, I had to face the big light

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh it's nice to go out and have a big night
But sooner or later you're got to face the big light

[Verse]
All your life you've lived a sinner the bright way you've never trod
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
When you come to cross the river and you haven't met with God
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
On down the dark river, I'm sorry to say
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
Don't wait too long to let Jesus hear you pray
You won't give up your earthly treasures to enter the promised land
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
You can hear Jesus calling and you won't accept his hand
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
When you come to the river Jesus, don't give thee command
You're drifting away, you're drifting away
And the dark rolling river takes you to the sinking sand
You're drifting away, you're drifting away

[Verse 1]
Well the Bible tells about a man
Who ruled Babylon and all it's land
Around the city he built a wall
And declared that Babylon would never fall
He had concubines and wives
He called his Babylon "Paradise"
Upon his throne he drank and ate
But for Belshazzer it was getting late

[Chorus]
For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand

[Verse 2]
Well the people feast and drank their wine
And praised the false gods of his time
All holy things were scorned and mocked
Suddenly all their mocking stopped
On the wall there appeared a hand
Nothing else, there was no man
In blood the hand began to write
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well no one around could understand
What was written by the mystic hand
Belshazzar tried but couldn't find
A man who could give him piece of mind
Daniel the prophet, a man of God
He saw the writing on the wall in blood
Belshazzar asked him what it said
And Daniel turned to the wall and read

[Chorus]
(O-U-T-K-A-S-T)

[André 3000]
Live, from the center of the Earth
Seven light-years below sea level we go
Welcome to Stankonia, the place from which all funky things come
Would you like to come?

[Girl moaning]

Bounce, baby. (We're bouncing!)
Bounce. Bounce. (We're bouncing!)
Two times: bounce, bounce. (We're bouncing!)
We're bouncing. (We're bouncing!)
Bounce. (We're bouncing, baby!)
(We're bouncing!) Come on, bounce
(Bouncing! Bounce, baby) Bounce!
Bounce, bounce. (Hey, baby!) Bounce, bounce
(Let's bounce) Come on, bounce. (Everybody let's bounce)
(Let's bounce) We bouncing now

[Big Boi]
All that bouncing... (Phsh)
Niggas ain't even from the A-Town
We got Bankhead right here, southwest Atlanta too strong

(Break!)

[Intro]
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(Prettiest girl we've ever seen)

[Verse 1]
There's a story in our town
Of the prettiest girl around
Golden hair and eyes of blue
How those eyes could flash at you
(How those eyes could flash at you)
Boys hung around her by the score
But she loved the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(Prettiest girl we've ever seen)

[Verse 2]
She was tops in all they said
It never once went to her head
She had everything it seems
Not a care, this teenage queen
(Not a care, this teenage queen)
Other boys could offer more
But she loved the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(You should be a movie queen)

[Verse 3]
He would marry her next spring
Saved his money, bought a ring
Then one day a movie scout
Came to town to take her out
(Came to town to take her out)
Hollywood could offer more
So she left the boy next door
Working at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(See you on the movie screen)

[Verse 4]
Very soon she was a star
Pretty house and shiny car
Swimming pool and a fence around
But she missed her old home town
(But she missed her old home town)
All the world was at her door
All except the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen)
(Saddest girl we've ever seen)

[Verse 5]
Then one day the teenage star
Sold her house and all her cars
Gave up all her wealth and fame
Left it all and caught a train
(Left it all and caught a train)
Do I have to tell you more
She came back to the boy next door
Who worked at the candy store

[Outro]
(Now this story has some more
You'll hear it all at the candy store)

[Verse]
As long as I live if it be one hour or if it be one hundred years
I'll keep remembering forever and ever I'll love you dear as long as I live
It was easy said the night we parted that we'd forget we'd ever met
I haven't forgotten I wonder if you have or if your heart is full of regret
I never thought the night we parted that life without you could be so bad
I know it sounds funny but I can't forget you the only happiness I've ever had

[Verse 1]
Just as far as I can remember
She'll remain the rose of my heart
Mom took sick along in December
February brought us broken hearts
The reason we have not called a family reunion
We knew - she wouldn't be there
But since we have thought it all over, Mama
We know that your spirit is there

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I can't forget the hours
You are the onliest one Mom and sweeter than the flowers
Oh, no, there is no need to bother
To speak of you now would only hurt Father

[Verse 2]
Well, it looked so good to see us together
But I had to look after Dad
Oh, no, Mama, when I passed by your coffin
I didn't want to remember you dead
They all gathered around, I stared at their faces
All heads were bowed mighty low
But that was one time we all had to face it
Though it hurt us so bad, you know

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, no, Mama, we'll never forget you
And someday we'll meet you up there

[Verse 1]
One night after a concert
I walked through the streets of the town
And came upon a little church
The service was over but the testimonials had just begun
People caught up in the spirit of the night
Just didn't want to leave
So I stepped inside the door
And sat down by a little old lady in the back
A man stood up in front and said
I just want all of you to know that
I'm going straight to heaven as fast as I can go
Like an arrow shot from a bow and he sat down
Another man stood up and said
I'm sailing right straight into heaven
Like a giant clipper ship, sailing on a sea of blue
And nothing's going to deter me or keep me from that safe harbor
He sat down and another man stood up and said
I'm flying into the portals of heaven on silver wings
Sailing over all the troubles and trials down below
Straight on in and he sat down
The little lady beside me made it to her feet slowly
And all got quiet as she raised her face
Not to the preacher or the congregation
But toward heaven and prayerfully said
I'm coming, Lord for my heavenly reward
I'm on my way to You, can You see me coming through
Through clouds of persecution and stumbling on the way
But I expect I'm making about a half a mile a day

[Chorus]
The road to Heaven doesn't have a rapid transit plan
It's one way with no changes going to the promised land
But I believe that if I'll heed the things He had to say
Even I might get to Heaven at a half a mile a day

[Verse 2]
Lord, when I let You lead, I don't make any speed
Because I have to stop and touch the ones who need so much
And then sometimes others pull me off of Your narrow way
And by my mistakes I barely make a half a mile a day

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
In a world where everybody's falling apart
One by one, heart by heart
You and I stay together and we never even try
Side by side in a world turned upside down

[Chorus]
Our love keeps spinning around
And you know it makes me wonder
As a restaurant for their lives
Where did we go right?
Where did we go right?

[Verse 2]
At a time when all the world is searching for truth
His love for you will even prove
And what we have is what everybody's trying to find
Peace of mind in a world turned upside down

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So many wrongs, so many lovers
I wish they all could know
What we've found in one another
In a world turned upside down
Our love keep spinning around
And you know it makes me wonder
As a restaurant for their lives
Where did we go right?

[Verse 1]
I'm the last of the babies of the World War 2
World War 2 and that's the one we didn't lose, I heard that
I was raised on biscuits, Spam and powdered eggs
DiMaggio's baseball and Marilyn's legs

[Chorus]
And I'm the last of the drifters
Last of the drifters, yeah

[Verse 2]
I remember when the great train, they used to run on coal
And they would run on coal and I would be ready to go, me too
Old white shirt and a tired overall
Sometime I think my daddy knew it all

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I remember Louisiana in a hot steamy night
Hot steamy night and she was holding me tight
An old red Chevy with a big back seat
I had me some two tall shoes off my feet

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I'm a world war baby holding mama's hand
Mama's hand and how my daddy knew the land
Truck bearing music and poverty and wealth
I got some great big scars on myself

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
I'm the last tie roller with the last good hand
Last good hand and I'm a gambling man
All them bombs and people waking on that boom
Sometimes I reckon I got here too soon

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Verse]
I'd rather go to a rodeo than shopping on rodeo drive
I'd rather lay on the grass with you and watch the planes than to have to fly
I'd rather have you than ringling and barnum & baily circus with all three rings
And the high trapeze and the lady on the horse and the train that carries them through
Stacked up against all the gold in Africa, I'd rather have you
I'd rather share a hotdog with you than dinner with the president
Offer me a castle on a mountain top, I'll take you in a tent
I'd rather be alone with you than to have my very own satellite
To talk and sing and say everything to everybody, do whatever i wanna do
And to be number one on who is who, I'd rather have you
I don't crave applause and praise or holidays with my way paid
I don't want to incorporate nor to be top rate nor a head of state
I don't want to play the digery-do nor the sitar or the kazoo
Just the two of us alone will do, I'd rather have you
I'd rather have tickets to the movies with you than the one that wins the lottery
Rather walk on the beach with you than to own all the ships at sea
I'd rather have you than the qe2 and the Eiffel tower, the royal jewels

[Outro]
And the Brooklyn bridge, and the toll pay to go through
And throw in a Texas well or two, I'd rather have you

[Chorus]
One of these days I'm going to sit down and talk to Paul

[x2]
I'm going to ask him about his traveling
And he will tell me about it all
One of these days I'm going to sit down and talk to Paul

[Verse 1]
I'm going to tell him I read all his books

[x2]
And that is sure was hard to follow down the same road that he took
But I'm going to tell him I read all his books

He'll introduce me to Luke and Timothy
He will introduce me to Luke and Timothy
I will be so glad to meet them and they will be glad to meet me
He will introduce me to Luke and Timothy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
One of these days I'm going to shake that healing hand

[x2]
That hand that raised up Uticus, that old sleeping, fallen man
One of these days I'm going to shake that healing hand

[Bridge]
I know just how he felt locked in that jail

[x2]
And I bet that him and Silas will have quite a tale to tell
I know just how he felt locked in that jail

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Let him roll, boys let him roll
I bet he's gone to Dallas rest his soul

[Verse 1]
Now he was a wino, tried and true
Done about everything there is to do
He worked on freighters, he worked in bars
He worked on farms, and he worked on cars
Now it was white port wine, that put that look in his eye
That grown men get when they need to cry
And we sat down on the curb to rest
And his head just fell down on his chest
He said "every single day it gets
Just a little bit harder to handle and yet
Then he lost the thread and his mind got cluttered
The words just rolled off down the gutter
He was a elevator man in a cheap hotel
In exchange for the rent on a one room cell
And he's years old before his time
No thanks to the world, and the white port wine
So he said "son", he always called me son
He said, "life for you has just begun
And then he told me the story that i heard before
How he fell in love with a Dallas whore
He could cut through the years to the very night
That it all ended, in a whore house fight
And she turned his last proposal down
In favor of being a girl about town
Now it's been seventeen years right in line
And he ain't been straight none of the time
It's too many years of fighting the weather
And too many nights of not being together
So he died

[Chorus]
Let him roll, boys let him roll
I bet he's gone to Dallas rest his soul
Let him roll, boys let him roll
He always thought that heaven
Was just a Dallas whore

[Verse 2]
When they went through his personal affects
In among the stubs from the welfare checks
Was a crumbling picture of a girl in a door
An address in Dallas, and nothing more
Well the welfare people provided the priest
And a couple from the mission down the street
Sang amazing grace, and nobody cried
Accept some lady in black way off to the side
We all left and she's standing there
The black veil covering her silver hair
And one-eyed John said her name was Alice
She used to be a whore in Dallas

[Chorus]

[Intro]
With the Campbells and McDonalds, it was in their blood to fight
With each passing generation it became a mans birthright
But they always had a common enemy
Never would the English crown take Scottish independency

[Verse]
Oh the battles rage in Glasgow and majestic Edinburgh
And they came with war machines and in the highlands shots were heard
Then the people rose in union and the forces moved as one
And the Clans all joined together to see English on the run
And in a tiny croft in Clachan sat a mother, Peg Macdunn
And she sewed the cords together for her 16 year old son
And she cried as he was leaving, donâ
And come you back to Clachan when the English are all done
Now Rob Macdunn was ready as the left the croft behind
And he joined the highland pipe brigade with one thing on his mind
That to keep his home and freedom he must face it like a man
So he marched in common union with his musket in his hand
And he met the hill of battle in the highlands and the low
And the reason for the fighting long within his blood to know
In the middle of the rumble he was forward gaining ground
And the bagpipes still were piping as the dead lay all around
Then he moved in no direction till he faced the winds of North
And he boldly climbed the highlands, further from the Firth of Forth
Then one freezing, blowing morning, came the cry of Peg Macdunn
Back to my croft in Clachan God has sent me home my son
And in another croft in Clachan cross the way from the Macdunnâ
With her face against the window sat a young girl, tired and worn
And she smiled a secret knowing as she breathed a prayer alone:
"I thank thee, Lord, for bringing Rob Macdunn back safely home"

[Outro]
Back to the croft in Clachan, he returned to peace again
He had gone a boy of 16, but he came back as a man

[Intro]
Hello I'm Johnny Cash
One night, I had a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson Show

[Verse]
There were wackos and weirdos and dingbats and dodos
And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe
There was leather and lace and every minority race
With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson Show
Kristofferson got an offer for a movie promoters closed another deal or two
Waylon got a call from his son Shooter and he went home the minute he was through
I moved with the mob at intermission
To the green room where you see who you can see
There were has-been's and would-be's and never-were's
Paupers punks and millionaires and me
And there were wackos
Hell's Angels blocked the traffic to the building
In order for the beer truck to come through
And waiting in the wings to sing with Willie were hopeful stars of flickering magnitude
There was a singer Willie knew back in the fifties
Who once paid him fifty dollars for a song
There were women who once did and some who still would
I heard one ask did Connie come along
And there were wackos
I wish you could have been there, well, maybe you were

[Chorus]
There's a new moon over Jamaica
And the new year just got here, you see
There's a new moon over Jamaica
And I'm living with an old memory

[Verse 1]
So won't you come back to Jamaica?
You know it isn't so far
Look up in the sky where you left me that night
I'll be standing right under that star

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I said good evening to Venus
She said good evening too
Out there somewhere, you know I could swear
She sent a message of true love from you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
A new moon makes someone feel happy
A new moon makes someone love-sick
I'm thinking of you, but what can I do?
New moons and new years and old loves don't mix

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
There's a stool along the road to freedom
Like a gipsy in a guilty cage
But rising has not always been bright
Destiny dreams are made
My days all run together
Like a timeless honeycomb
I find myself wishing I could drink again

[Chorus]
Water from the wells of home
Water from the wells of home
Water from the wells of home

[Verse 2]
I've seen all your shining cities
Lean against the yellow sky
I've seen the down, and I'll get better
I've seen many of strong men die
Well the troubled hearts in the worried men
Things that I've been showed
Keep me always returning to

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I want to come back some day to the water from the wells of home
Lord take me back someday to the water from the wells of home

[Verse]
I'm an easy rider, the wind is at my back
I'm an easy rider, the white line is my track
Every lane is a passing lane and the ride away is mine
Let me on that straight-away and I'll be fairly flying
I'm an easy rider, my wheels love to roll
I'm an easy rider, I ride a new road every day
I'm an easy rider, I will see you on my way
I got a number down in every town in my little black book
And they understand that I'm a traveling man
So they don't think they got hooked
I'm an easy rider, I love that gray highway
I'm an easy rider, oh Lord, I love to roll
I'm an easy rider, movin's in my soul
I know a lady down in Little Rock and I stopped for a little while
But I had to go because another I know is waiting for my smile

[Verse]
Harry Truman was our president
A coke an burger cost you thirty cents
I was still in love with Mavis Brown
On the night Hank Williams came to town
"I Love Lucy" debuted on TV
That was one big event we didn't see
Сause no one stayed at home for miles around
It was the night Hank Williams came to town
Mama ironed my shirt and daddy let me take the truck
I drove on out to Grapevine and picked old Mavis up
We hit that county line for one quick round
On the night Hank Williams came to town
A thousand people sweltered in the gym
Then I heard someone whisper, "Hey, that's him"
That's when the crowd let out this deafening sound
It was the night Hank Williams came to town
On and on he sang into the night
"Jambalaya", "Cheating Heart", "I Saw the Light"
How'd they get Miss Audrey in that gown
On the night Hank Williams came to town
Mavis had her picture made with Hank outside his car
She said, "He sure is humble for a Grand Ole Opry Star"
Mavis said: "Why don't we hang around?
It ain't often that Hank Williams comes to town"
While Hank signed his autograph on Beaulah Rice's fan
Mavis got acquainted with the Drifting Cowboys Band
The effect on all our lives was quite profound
On the night Hank Williams came to town

[Verse 1]
Peterbilt drivers don't pick up low riders
They don't slow for the curves in the road
They hate to keep logs, they hate riders on hogs
Watch out for a shift in your load

[Chorus]
When I was young, I had Gene Autry guns
But I never had a Lionel train
Now I've got a truck, if I keep payments up
And it weighs thirty tons in the rain

[Verse 2]
I wear Frisco jeans with riveted seams
My money is chained to my belt
I wear a Cat cap just like my pap
He drove till it ruined his health
Now, Georgia Bill Smith wore thick glasses and boots
He could see about as far as he could walk
He came up too fast on that bridge overpass
Lord, the preacher sure gave a fine talk

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've read a few lines from the poets
And sometimes, I might cross the line
I don't know the answer to the mystery of life
But a woman sure helps pass the time

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
A child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talking before I knew it
And as he grew he'd say, I'm going to be like you dad
You know I'm going to be like you

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you coming home dad? I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

[Verse 2]
My son turned ten just the other day
He said, Thanks for the ball come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw? I said, Not today
I got a lot to do. He said, That's okay
He walked away but his smile never dimmed
He said, I'm going to be like him, yeah, you know I'm going to be like him

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you coming home dad? I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

[Verse 3]
Well he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
Son I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while
He shook his head and then he said with a smile
What I'd really like dad is to borrow the car keys
See you later can I have them please

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you coming home dad? I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

[Verse 4]
I've long since retired my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, I'd like to see you if you don't mind
He said, I'd love to dad if I could find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you dad
It's been sure nice talking to you

[Outro]
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me

[Verse]
I couldn't hear you for the TV, I didn't know you said goodbye
I saw your cancelled check for the airfare, didn't know flying got too high
Beans for breakfast once again, hard to eat them from the can
I've run out of clean utensils, I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man
I heard the crows outside my window, guess it's me they are talking about
The fire you lit has burnt to cinders, every good things fizzled out
Beans for breakfast once again, hard to eat 'em from the can
Wish you'd come back and wash the dishes, I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man
Caught a cold with the window open, crow droppings o my window sill
Probably got histoplasmosis, got no gun or I would kill them crows
Beans for breakfast once again, hard to eat them from the can
Plastic forks are a dime a dozen I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man
Finally made it to the mailbox, felt so bad I thought I'd die
All I got was a bill from my doctor, well I guess flying isn't so high
Bean for breakfast once again, hard to eat 'em from the can
Blue tick mattress cold and greasy, I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man
The house burned down from the fire that I built, in your closet by mistake
After I took all them pills, but I got out safe in my duck head overalls
Beans for breakfast once again, I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man

[Verse 1]
You can see it in the movies and the paper and the TV news
Somebody's army is always on the move
There's going to be a battle the lines have been drawn
They have got guns and tanks and planes
The wells are gone dry and the water is bad and the air is acid rain
There's war after war and rumors of war from the east
There's a rumbling in the ground and they are talking about the beast
Good mothers cry cause the rivers run high
With the blood of too many sons
Some people say peace is on the way
But the worst is still to come

[Chorus]
Because the prophets wrote about it
And Jesus spoke about it
And John got to take a look
And he told us what he saw when it's easy to see
It's going by the book

[Verse 2]
There's armies in the cities and the missiles stand ready for flight
A pale horse rides like the wind across the night
And that rumbling in the desert like thunder getting closer
Are the trumpet's getting ready to blow
There's going to be a shout that will wake the dead we better be ready to go

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
Well, you're my friend
And can you see
Many times we've been out drinking
Many times we've shared our thoughts
But did you ever, ever notice
The kind of thoughts I got?
Well, you know I have a love
A love for everyone I know
And you know I have a drive
To live, I won't let go
But can you see its opposition
Comes rising up sometimes?
That its dreadful and position
Comes blacking in my mind

[Chorus: Johnny Cash & Will Oldham]
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
And that I see a darkness
Did you know how much I love you?
Is a hope that somehow you
Can save me from this darkness

[Verse 2: Johnny Cash]
Well, I hope that someday, buddy
We have peace in our lives
Together or apart
Alone or with our wives
And we can stop our whoring
And pull the smiles inside
And light it up forever
And never go to sleep
My best unbeaten brother
This isn't all I see

[Chorus: Johnny Cash & Will Oldham]
Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Oh no, I see a darkness
Did you know how much I love you?
Is a hope that somehow you
Can save me from this darkness

[Verse 1]
Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bone
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 2]
I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said "Well, a-bless my soul"

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 3]
I was born one morning, it was drizzling rain
Fighting and trouble are my middle name
Raised in the canebrake by an old mama lion
Can't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 4]
If you see me coming, better step aside
A lot of men didn't and a lot of men died
The one fist of iron and the other of steel
If the right one don't a-get you
Then the left one will

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 1]
A way out on the mountain near the sky
Hiding from the cold realities of life
Shaking that old road dust off my heels
I give my heart and mind a chance to heal

[Chorus]
Then I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again
More than likely ride back to the places that I've been
In fairness to my music and my friends
I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again

[Verse 2]
A raccoon stole my minnows in the night
Thought I appreciate his need and his appetite
But unlike me he doesn't have to roam
And it's true that man can't live on bread alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It feels so good to have a simple wish
Where life and death is me and some old fish
Poor king sits with a cold beer in his hand
And surveys a clear blue kingdom on the sand

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I want to thank you for all of the letters
That you’ve been sending to me
For it’s good to lean on the strength of my family
To help me get through every day

[Chorus]
Without these letters from home to carry me on
My life would fall to pieces
Every word that I read brings comfort to me
I love my letters from home

[Verse]
And it’s good to hear from the woman who raised me
Some things in life never change
When I was in trouble, she was always praying
And sending her blessings my way, thank you, ma

[Chorus]

[Verse]
And the next time you write, maybe you could send a picture of yourself
It would really be another ray of light in this miserable place
And be great to see your face every day

[Chorus]

I love my letters from home

[Verse 1]
Well, the farmer prayed for a better year
And the crops were good, for the Lord did hear
But, his barn burned down with winter near
The Answer came in white and black
In the Farmers' Almanac, it says
If a man can have half his wishes, he can double his trouble
A sweet old lady was 84
When her kinfolks came for a month, or more
Now, from overwork, she's on the other shore
Much too late, she said, Now you all come back
And, it says in the Farmers' Almanac
Visitors, and fish, smell after 3 days
Our leader was a silver tongued man
He deceived the people of the land
And when he got caught
He couldn't stand
It's a little of beat, and a little off track
But, it says in the Farmers' Almanac
In rivers and bad government, the lightest things float to the top
Rod said, I don't believe in God
Rod died, and now he lays beneath the sod
For God did not believe in Rod
Life is a trouble and a weary track
But, it says in the Farmers' Almanac
Feed your faith, and your doubts will starve to death
The little boy followed the honey bee
And it went straight to the honey's tree
He got stung, but got the honey free
Consolation for the things you lack
Is in the Farmers' Almanac
It also says
God gave us the darkness, so we can see the stars
He came home, three hours late, from work
He said, I had a flat, and I fell in the dirt
She said, Well, you have lipstick on your shirt
Well, it turned out like Jill and Jack
And, it says in the Farmers' Almanac
Lies have to be covered up, Truth can run around naked
He said, Honey, you know I'm true. I just look at other women, that's all I do
Then, she caught him with her best friend, Peggy Sue
Sometimes, some women DO look back
And it says in the Farmers' Almanac
There is a LOT of difference, between shopping and shoplifting
I sat down at a shoeshine stand
I had a very slow shoe-shine man
I said, You sure don't pop that rag, like some of them can
He looked at me, and answered right back
It says in the Farmers' Almanac
The trouble with the world today, is there is too much 'popping' and not enough 'shining
My father's father was the wisest man I ever knew
Sixty years of education
Seven years of school
Farming kept his body strong
At night the only books he owned
Kept his mind sharp as a tack
The family bible and the Farmers' almanac

[Chorus]
When to plant
When to harvest
How you weed, just what you sow
When to look for rain, and who to turn to when it don't
There was a plan for early frost
Salvation for the lost
Words to live and die by front to back
The family bible and the Farmers' Almanac

[Verse 2]
One came from his mother
Handed down the day she died
The co-op sent the other
Every year at Christmas time
He knew the seasons to the day
Knew Paul and Peter by first name
He could answer any question he was asked
With the family bible and the Farmers' Almanac

[Chorus]

[Outro]
He knew the way to get
Through this life, and to the next
While others spoke of faith
He found the facts
In the family bible and the farmers' almanac
The family bible and the farmer's almanac

[Verse 1]
There was a time when lonely men would wander
Through this land rolling aimlessly along
So many times I've heard of their sad story
Written in the words of dead men's song
Down through the years many men have yearned for freedom
Some found it only on the open road
So many tears of blood have fell around us
Cause you can't always do what you were told

[Chorus]
Please tell me where have all the hobos gone to
I see no fire burning down by the rusty railroad tracks
Could it be that time has gone and left them
Tied up in life's eternal traveling sack

[Verse 2]
Last Sunday night I wrote a letter to my loved one
I signed my name and I knew that I stayed away way too long
There was a time when my heart was free to wander
And I remember as I sing this hobo song

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
There was a man whose deeds were dark as night
And quite by chance he rode into the light
A man, wild as a dust devil with no place to run
Living by his wits and by his gun

[Verse 2]
He met a girl like none he'd ever known
She cared not for the wild oats he had sewn
And, so, he laid his gun down and set his spirit free
Began living in respectability

[Verse 3]
But his old ways of thinking wouldn't die
Could not forget the old creed he lived by
And the good and bad and the right and wrong kept fighting for his soul
'Til his heart and mind both went out of control

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
But now the old saloon had lost its spell
What once was laughter now was living hell
And the hookers, guns and drinking in his life were out of place
And in his mind he saw an Angel's face

[Verse 5]
So, he burned all his bridges in a day
And the Devil deeds were done and laid away
And he rode out a better man than when he first rode in
And the Angel got the Badman in the end

[Chorus]
In the town of Tulsa, about thirty years ago
At King's Old Calloway, down in Old Oklahoma
Where the dust was blowing but the music was right
And Doug Lee O'Daniels played all night

[Verse]
For The Light Crust Dough Boys and Doug Lee O'Dan
We drove eighty miles through the blowing sand
My thirty-seven Chevy was shooting steam
Coming up the hills, just East of Pawnee
But I wouldn't miss a dance on a Saturday night
For all of them Chevys in the Detroit Line
I can hear that music in my ears
I'm ready to go and I'm shifting my gears
So, just pass me the biscuits and give me your hand
You know, you're my Honey and you know, I'm your man
Listen to that fiddler, making it sing
And hear the pretty hot mix of a guitar, ring
(Ah, pick it Boy - whoo - hoo, whoo - hoo)
Well, I got no trouble and I'm feeling no pain
Got all that good music, blowing in my veins
Let the Light Crust Dough Boys, and Old Pappy Dan
Play us a song that we'll never forget
Now they say, times are rough and that money is time
But I don't care on a Saturday night
I got no money, but I can sing blues
When I feel like dancing, way down in my shoes

[Chorus]
Was in the town of Tulsa, about thirty years ago
At King's Old Calloway, down in Old Oklahoma
Where the dust was blowing but the music was right
And Doug Lee O'Daniels played all night

[Outro]
(Play it back again - whoo - hoo - hoo)

[Verse 1]
I went out walking through the streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones
Saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walking under an atomic sky
Where the ground won't turn
And the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye

[Chorus]
Yeah I went with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering
I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk
Or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in

[Verse 2]
I stopped outside a church house
Where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I went out with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering
I went out walking
Down that winding road
Where no one's trusting no one
And conscience a too heavy load
I went out riding, down that ol'eight lane
I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I went with nothing
But the thought you'd be there, too
Looking for you
I went out there in search of experience
To taste and to touch and to feel's as much
As a man can before he repents
I went out searching, looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who could sit at his father's right hand
I went out walking with a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up
Jesus, I'll be home soon
Yea I went out for the papers
Told her I'd be back by noon
Yeah I left with nothing
But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you
Yeah I left with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering

[Verse 1]
Somedays I think this old machine is out to get me
Somedays she does what I tell her
It's like dancing with a widow-maker forty hours a week
I'm talking about a big old D-10 caterpillar

[Chorus]
I don't know why I like to drive them like I do
It isn't nothing but a hundred seventy-five thousand pounds of steel
Could be the money babe, could be the power
Could be I love the way it feels
Could be I love the way it feels

[Verse 2]
But you know she's mighty unforgiving then you gotta pay attention
Cause the D-10 can be the death of you
But I get her all fired up and I can feel it in my soul
And it's hard to tell just who's driving who
I can move Alaska all the way to Beirut
I can bulldoze a beeline from here to Peru
I can push the Rocky Mountains into the sea
You know Heavy metal don't mean rock and roll to me
I'm like a modern day mule skinner driving ten thousand mules
So I say a little prayer every day
Lord just let me get her turned around
Without falling off this mountain
You know the boss man don't like me treating his D-10 that way

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I don't want no aggravation when my train has left the station
If you're there or not, I may not even know
Have a round and remember things we did that weren't so tender
Let the train blow the whistle when I go

[Verse 2]
On my old guitar sell tickets so someone can finally pick it
And tell the girls down at the Ritz I said hello
Tell the gossipers and liars I will see them in the fire
Let the train blow the whistle when I go

[Chorus]
Let her blow, let her blow
Long and loud and hard and happy, let her blow
No regrets, all my debts will be paid when I get laid
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow

[Verse 3]
You will be left without excuses for the evils and abuses
Down to today from years and years ago
And have yourself another toke from my basket full of smoke
And let the train blow the whistle when I go

[Chorus]
Let her blow, let her blow
Long and loud and hard and happy, let her blow
No regrets, all my debts will be paid when I get laid
Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
The beast in me is caged by frail and fragile bars
Restless by day and by night rants and rages at the stars
God help the beast in me

The beast in me has had to learn to live with pain
And how to shelter from the rain
And in the twinkling of an eye, might have to be restrained
God help the beast in me

Sometimes it tries to kid me
That it's just a teddy bear
And even somehow manage to vanish in the air
And that is when I must beware of the beast in me

That everybody knows
They've seen him out dressed in my clothes
Patently unclear if it's New York or New Year
God help the beast in me

[Chorus]
I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied

[Verse 1]
Life is just a passing moment
On an neverending trail
Though my pathway wanders for awhile
Someday my ship will sail

[Chorus]
And I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied

[Verse 2]
There's eternity before me
Just beyond the darkening veil
O my spirit hungers to go on
Someday my ship will sail

[Chorus]
And I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
I will walk this road awhile
I will walk it with a smile
(fading out)I will take...

[Verse 1]
I got a friend named Whiskey Sam
He was my boonierat buddy for a year in 'Nam
He said is my country just a little off track
Took them twenty-five years to welcome me back

[Verse 2]
But, it's better than not coming back at all
Many a good man I saw fall
And even now, every time I dream
I hear the men and the monkeys in the jungle scream

[Chorus]
Drive on, it don't mean nothing
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man, drive on
It don't mean nothing, drive on

[Verse 3]
I remember one night, Tex and me
Rappelled in on a hot L.Z
We had our 16's on rock and roll
But with all that fire, I was scared and cold

[Verse 4]
I was crazy and I was wild
And I have seen the tiger smile
I spit in a bamboo viper's face
And I'd be dead but by God's grace

[Chorus]
Drive on, it don't mean nothing
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man, drive on
It don't mean nothing, it don't mean nothing, drive on

[Verse 5]
It was a real slow walk in a sad rain
And nobody tried to be John Wayne
I came home but Tex did not
And I can't talk about the hit he got

[Verse 6]
But I got a little limp now when I walk
And I got a little tremolo when I talk
But my letter read from Whiskey Sam
You're a walking, talking miracle from Vietnam

[Chorus]
Drive on, it don't mean nothing
My children love me, but they don't understand
And I got a woman who knows her man, drive on
It don't mean nothing, it don't mean nothing, drive on

[Intro]
Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages cleft for me

[Verse 1]
There's a family bible on the table
Each page is torn and hard to read
But the family bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memories
At the end of day when work was over
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one

[Chorus]
I can see us sitting around the table
When from the family bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages cleft for me

[Verse 2]
This old world of ours is full of troubles
This old world would oh, so better be
If we had more bibles on the table
And mothers singing Rock of Ages cleft for me

[Chorus]
Why me, Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one of the blessings I've known?
Why me, Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth love from you or the kindness you've shown?

[Chorus]
Lord help me, Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me, Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand

[Verse 2]
Try me, Lord, if you think there's a way
That I can try to repay what I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I could show someone else
What I've been through myself on my way back to you

[Chorus]
Lord help me, Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me, Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand

[Verse 1]
Bad luck wind been blowing at my back
I was born to bring trouble to wherever I'm at
Got the number "Thirteen" tattooed on my neck
When the ink starts to itch, then the black will turn to red

[Chorus]
I was born in the soul of misery
Never had me a name
They just gave me the number when I was young

[Verse 2]
Got a long line of heartache, I carry it well
The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell
Bad luck wind been blowing at my back
I pray you don't look at me, I pray I don't look back

[Chorus] 

[x2]
I was born in the soul of misery
Never had me a name
They just gave me the number when I was young

[Verse]
Lord, I've never lived where churches grow
I loved creation better as it stood
That day you finished it so long ago
And looked upon your work and called it good
I know that others find you in the light
That sifted down through tinted window panes
And yet I seem to feel you near tonight
In this dim, quiet starlight on the plains
I thank you, Lord, that I'm placed so well
That you've made my freedom so complete
That I'm no slave to whistle, clock or bell
Nor weak eyed prisoner of Waller Street
Just let me live my life as I've begun
And give me work that's open to the sky
Make me a partner of the wind and sun
And I won't ask a life that's soft or high
Let me be easy on the man that's down
Let me be square and generous with all
I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when I'm in town
But never let them say I'm mean or small
Make me as big and open as the plains
And honest as the horse between my knees
Clean as a wind that blows behind the rains
Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze
Forgive me, Lord, if sometimes I forget
You know about the reasons that are hid
You understand the things that gall or fret
Well, you knew me better than my mother did
Just keep an eye on all that's done and said
And right me sometimes when I turn aside
And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead
That stretches upward toward the great divide

[Bridge]
Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
These words came low and mournfully
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay
On his dying bed at the close of day

[Outro]
Oh, bury me not and his voice failed there
But we took no heed to his dying prayer
In a shallow grave just six by three
We buried him there on the lone prairie

[Verse]
Harley didn't have no education, he could hardly read and write
He was locked into a dead-end occupation, his future didn't look too bright
He worked eighteen years on the assembly line
Just getting by with a little bit of overtime
And that could be the end of this story of mine but it's just the beginning
Late one night when he was working on the graveyard, Harley got himself this big idea
All he'd have to do is change one little screw, save millions of dollars a year
So he worked and he saved until he could open his own shop
Money started rolling in like it wasn't going to stop
So Harley bought a mountain, built a mansion on top
So the losers could see whom was winning
Only in America with nothing but a dream, only in America where every man's king
First Harley's daughter, Janet, found a guru she gave him everything she owned
Then Harley junior joined some kind of rock band
And walked around all day about half stoned
His wife watched TV all the time because she got bored
Then one day she found a TV preacher she adored
And she gave all of Harley's hard earned money to the Lord
Harley started drinking, wound up in Betty Ford to see if he could buy a happy ending
Then some kid who worked in Harley's factory, he got himself this big idea
Figured out how to do it with computers, drove Harley out of business in a year
Now Harley's back working the assembly line
Just getting by with a little bit of overtime
But don't count Harley out because he isn't the quitting kind
He stares at that computer with one thing on his mind
How to make them more user-friendly
Only in America
Only in America
Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
Like a fish on a hook
Like a knight in some old-fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee

And if I have been unkind
I just hope that you will let it go by
And if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
By all that I have done wrong
I'll make it all up to thee

I saw a young man leaning on his wooden crutch
He called out to me, "Don't ask for so much"
And a young woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried out to me, "Why not ask for more?"
Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
Back about eighteen and twenty-five
I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would've made it through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been riding on a Tennessee stud

Had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Fud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud

[Chorus]
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee stud

Drifted on down into no man's land
I crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with a Spaniard's foe
'Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold
Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud

[Chorus]
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee stud

I rode right back across Arkansas
I whipped her brother and I whipped her Pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
She was riding on a Tennessee mare

Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
Little horse colt playing 'round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare

[Chorus]
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee stud
There's a place I know where the train goes slow
Where the sinner can be washed in the blood of the lamb
There's a river by the trestle down by sinner's grove
Down where the willow and the dogwood grow

You can hear the whistle, you can hear the bell
From the halls of heaven to the gates of hell
And there's room for the forsaken if you're there on time
You'll be washed of all your sins and all of your crimes

[Chorus]
If you're down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slow

There's a golden moon that shines up through the mist
And I know that your name can be on that list
There's no eye for an eye, there's no tooth for a tooth
I saw Judas Iscariot carrying John Wilkes Booth

[Chorus]
He was down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slow

[Verse 3]
If you've lost all your hope, if you've lost all your faith
I know you can be cared for and I know you can be safe
And all the shamefuls and all of the whores
And even the soldier who pierced the side of the Lord

[Chorus]
Is down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slow

[Verse 4]
Well, I've never asked forgiveness and I've never said a prayer
Never given of myself, never truly cared
I've left the ones who loved me and I'm still raising Cain
I've taken the low road and if you've done the same

[Chorus]
Meet me down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slow

[Chorus]
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there by the train
Down there where the train goes slow
From his hands it came down, from the side it came down
From the feet it came down and ran to the ground
Between heaven and hell, a teardrop fell
In the deep crimson dew, the tree of life grew

[Chorus]
And the blood gave life to the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price that set the captives free
And the numbers that came through the fire and the flood
Clung to the tree and were redeemed by the blood

From the tree streamed a light that started the fight
'Round the tree grew a vine on whose fruit I could dine
My old friend Lucifer came, fought to keep me in chains
But I saw through the tricks of six-sixty-six

[Chorus]
And the blood gave life to the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price that set the captives free
And the numbers that came through the fire and the flood
Clung to the tree and were redeemed by the blood
From his hands it came down, from his side it came down
From his feet it came down and ran to the ground
And a small inner voice said "you do have a choice"
The vine engrafted me and I clung to the tree

[Chorus]
I love you, love you
I love you
Just in case you care, you know I do

[Verse 1]
I've done everything I know to do
To catch your eye and get a rise from you
I've said everything I know to say
Until I'm afraid that I'll scare you away
I've tried everything I know to try
And if you won't love me I'm going to die
I'll be anything I need to be
To make you want to bring your love to me

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 2]
I'll quit anything I need to quit
Or I'll change anything to make it fit
I'll start anything I need to start
If that would mean you're giving me your heart

[Chorus]

[x4]
With the twilight colors falling and the evening laying shadows
Hidden memories come stealing from my mind
And I feel my own heart beating out the simple joy of living
And I wonder how I ever was that kind

But the wild road I was rambling was always out there calling
And you said a hundred times I should have died
Then you reached down and touched me and lifted me up with you
So I believe it was a road I was meant to ride

[Chorus]
I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
I don't have to do that anymore
I'm like a soldier getting over the war

There are nights I don't remember and pain that's been forgotten
And a lot of things I choose not to recall
There are faces that come to me in my darkest secret memories
Faces that I wish would not come back at all
But in my dream's parade of lovers from the other times and places
There's not one that matters now, no matter who
I'm just thankful for the journey and that I've survived the battles
And that my spoils of victory is you

[Chorus]
I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
Every day gets better than the day before
I'm like a soldier getting over the war

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry to say that you don't know me
I'm sad in ways you never understood
Each time I try to tell the ugly truth
You always let it pass you by
You said I'd never tell you a lie
Just because I could
Did you really think I was a bad man
You always said that that should be my middle name
But you don't know the half of it
You don't know how that name fits
You don't know my hidden shame

[Chorus]
Hidden shame, shame, shame
That I can't get free
From the blame and the torture
And the misery
Must it be my secret for eternity
Until you know my hidden shame, you really don't know me

[Verse 2]
Well, there's a different kind of prison
And it don't even have to look much like a cell
It's already on your mind
Boy, we can see it in your eyes
So, here's the bars and walls as well
Well, you know I'm never coming home, babe
You said you'd stand by me until I cleared my name
Sure, it's easy to be strong
When you know the charge is wrong
But the days and weeks get long
When you've got a hidden shame

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I had a friend when I was just a boy
We were like brothers, we would run and hide
And we went walking on a high hillside
And I really don't how it happened
He turned to me and had this strange look in his eye
And not a single word was spoken
I must have pushed him, but I don't remember why
And all at once, he lay there broken
And I walked down without him and I didn't even sigh

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
They say you always hurt the one you love
And I'm not saying if I did or if I didn't
But like my shame, that kind of love is always hidden
They locked me up here for the ideas in my head
They never got me for the thing I really did

[Chorus]
There once was a man who just couldn't cry
He hadn't cried for years and for years
Napalmed babies and movie love stories
For instance, could not produce tears

As a child he had cried as all children will
Then at some point, his tear ducts ran dry
Grew to be a man, it all hit the fan
Things got bad but he couldn't cry

His dog was run over, his wife up and left him
After that he got sacked from his job
Lost his arm in a war, was laughed at by a whore
Ah, but still not a sniffle or sob

His novel was refused and his movie was panned
His big Broadway show was a flop
He got sent off to jail, you guessed it, no bail
Oh, but still not a dribble or drop

In jail he was beaten, bullied and buggered
And made to make license plates
Water and bread was all he was fed
Not once did a tear stain his face
Doctors were called in, scientists too
Theologians were last and practically least
They all agreed sure enough, this was no cream puff
But in fact an insensitive beast

He was taken from jail and placed in a place
For the insensitive and the insane
He made a lot of friends and he played a lot of chess
And he wept every time it would rain

Once it rained forty days and it rained forty nights
And he cried and he cried and he cried and he cried
On the forty-first day, he passed away
He just dehydrated and died

He went up to heaven, located his dog
After that, he rejoined his arm
Below, all the critics, they took it all back
Cancer robbed the whore of her charm

His ex-wife died of stretch marks, his ex-employer went broke
The theologians were finally found out
Right down to the ground, the old jailhouse burned down
And the earth suffered perpetual drought

[Verse 1]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

[Chorus]
You said one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

[Verse 2]
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

[Chorus]
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

[Verse 3]
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

[Chorus]
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, and we're doing it again

[Bridge]
You say love is a temple, love the higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you've got
When all you've got is hurt

[Final Chorus]
One love, one blood
One life, you've got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
One

[Verse 1]
There's a stretch of Highway on Interstate 24 between Nashville and Chattanooga
That's claimed many trucker's life
And your life is in your hands when you start down that long steep grade
On Monteagle Mountain
I just rolled out of Nashville in my big rig heading south
My eyes are on fire feels like cotton in my mouth
My whole body's aching but I got to make them big wheels roll
I got to be in Florida by tomorrow morning with a full heavy load
I got to get past Atlanta as soon as I can tonight
I got to try to dodge the scales and stay out of Smoky's sight
But there's one big thing standing like a nightmare in my way
I got to top Monteagle Mountain a little bit later today

[Chorus]
Going down Monteagle Mountain on I-24
It's hell for a trucker when the devil's at your door
He'll tempt you and tell you come on let her roll
Because the mountain wants your rig and trucker, I want your soul

[Verse 2]
When I started down Monteagle the brakes just wouldn't hold
I knew I was in trouble and about to lose control
The runaway ramp was waiting I saw the warning sign
I said Lord help me make it, have mercy on this soul of mine
Well I ploughed into that runaway ramp and I could feel that big truck groan
My life flashed right before my eyes and for a minute I thought I was gone
But when the smoke cleared I thanked God that I was still alive
Because when there's a runaway on Monteagle some truckers don't survive

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah many a good man had lost his life on Monteagle Mountain it's a long steep grade
Many good hard working boys have gone over the side, watch out for Monteagle

[Verse 1]
Well I won't back down, no I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down
Going to stand my ground, won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from dragging me down
Going to stand my ground and I won't back down

[Chorus]
Hey baby, there is no easy way out
Hey I will stand my ground and I won't back down

[Verse 2]
Well I know what's right, I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushing me around
But I stand my ground and I won't back down

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Oh, pour me another drink
And punch me in the face
You can call me Nancy
Every man wears a symbol
And I know I have mine
I've got my right hand stamped
In the concentration camp
Where my organs scream
"Slow down, man!"

[Chorus]
Ooh, how was I to know
Milk and honey flowed
Just a couple states below?
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Oh, hook me up to the tank
And roll me to the door
I'm going where my body leads me
I can fend for myself
With what looks I have left
I'll put away a few
And pretty soon I'll be breaking things like Howard Hughes

[Chorus]
Ooh, how was I to know
Milk and honey flowed
Just a couple states below?

[Outro]
Ooh, give me how it was
Our place under the sun
Before the devil made me run
"Run, boy"
"Run, boy"
Ooh

[Verse 1]
There was a showdown at high noon reputations on the line
It was the good guys and the bad guys I was eight and he was nine
And I forgot to keep my back to the wall in Dodge that day
And from somewhere behind me I heard him say

[Chorus]
That's one you owe me, I let you slide
I can't back shoot a buddy, it goes against my pride
So like two desperadoes we'll ride off in the sun
But just remember you owe me one

[Verse 2]
It was high school and football on two different teams
I was good but he was better than I would ever be
And when I finally crossed the goal line ahead of him that day
As the crowd was going wild I heard him say

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
She was long and lean and pretty and soon to be his bride
When she strayed into my arms one day with loving on her mind
Well I was almost tempted by her soft touch and her sigh
But the next time I saw him I could look him in the eye

[Chorus] 

[x 2]

[Verse 1]
Belinda was mine until the time that I found her
Holdin' Jim
And loving him
Then Sue came along, loved me strong, that's what I thought
Me and Sue
But that died, too

[Chorus 1]
Don't know that I will but until I can find me
A girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
A solitary man

[Verse 2]
I've had it to here - being where love's a small word
A part time thing
A paper ring
I know it's been done having one girl who loved me
Right or wrong
Weak or strong

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Don't know that I will but until love can find me
And a girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
A solitary man

[Verse 1]
Well I used to hang out down at the VFW hall
And stare at the photographs up on the wall
Of the neighborhood boys that died in the wars we've been through
And the hand lettered sign that said remember Jimmy McGrew
Well Jimmy went to Nam back in 1965
But there's a lot of men here that think Jimmy McGrew's still alive
Though they carved his name on a stone in Washington DC
His brother said, that stone doesn't prove a thing to me

[Chorus]
It's veteran's day and the skies are gray
Leave the uniforms home because there isn't going to be a parade
But we'll fill up a glass for the ones that didn't make it through
And leave a light in the window tonight for Jimmy McGrew

[Verse 2]
There's a hot rain falling on the back streets of Saigon
There's an old soldier stumbling down the alley with his mama
Lord his eyes are cloudy and his arms are black and blue
He's just hanging by a thread and he looks like Jimmy McGrew

[Chorus]
Up in the morning, out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven all day

Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven all day

Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Lift me to paradise

Show me that river, take me across
Wash my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, gimme nothing to do
But roll around Heaven all day

Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Lift me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around Heaven all day

[Verse 1]
When life seems full
Of clouds and rain
And I'm full
Of nothing but pain
Who soothes my thumping, bumping brain?
Nobody
When Wintertime comes
With its snow and sleet
And me with hunger
And cold feet
Who says "Here's two bits, go and eat"?
Nobody

[Chorus]
Well, I have never done nothing to nobody
I have never got nothing from nobody, no time
And until I get something from somebody, sometime
I don't intend to do nothing for nobody, no time

[Verse 2]
When Summertime comes
All warm and clear
And my friends see me
Drawing near
Who says "come on in and have a beer"?
Nobody
Well one time when things was
Looking bright
I started to whittling on a stick one night
Who said "Hey! That's dynamite!"?
Nobody

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Produced by John Carter Cash and Rick Rubin]

[Intro-Johnny Cash]
It all began when they took me from my home
And put me on Death Row
A crime for which I am totally innocent, you know

[Verse 1--Johnny Cash]
I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood

[Chorus--Johnny Cash]
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

[Verse 2-Johnny Cash]
I hear stories from the chamber
Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
He died upon the cross
Might I say, it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told
My kill-hand's
Tatooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist
In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold
It's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away
Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied

[Chorus-Johnny Cash]
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

[Verse 3-Johnny Cash]
And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hopin'
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief
A life for a life
And a truth for a truth
And I've got nothing left to loose
And I'm not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is smoking
And I think my head is melting
And in a way that's helping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way I told the truth
But I'm afraid I told a lie

[Verse 1]
I found him by the railroad track this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said
He said they let me out of prison out in Frisco
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

[Chorus]
Give my love to Rose please, won't you mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

[Verse 2]
Won't you tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
Because it ain't right that she should live alone
Mister here's a bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
Now don't forget to give my love to Rose

[Chorus]
Give my love to Rose please, won't you mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

[Verse 1]
Would you lay with me in a field of stone?
If my needs were strong, would you lay with me?
Should my lips grow dry, would you wet them dear
In the midnight hour if my lips were dry?

[Chorus]
Would you go away to another land?
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand?
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand
If I give myself to you?

[Verse 2]
Will you bathe me with me in the stream of life?
When the moon is full will you bathe with me?
Will you still love me when I'm down and out?
In my time of trial, will you stand by me?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Would you lay with me in a field of stone?
If my lips grow dry, would you wet them dear?
Would you bathe with me in the stream of life?
Will you still love me when I'm down and out?

[Outro]
Would you lay with me in a field of stone?
When the moon is full, will you lay with me?

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

[Verse 2: Johnny Cash]
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls, so hard
I will comfort you

[Verse 3: Johnny Cash & Fiona Apple]
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

[Chorus: Johnny Cash & Fiona Apple]
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

[Verse 4: Johnny Cash]
Sail on, silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come, to shine
All your dreams are on their way

[Verse 5: Johnny Cash & Fiona Apple]
See how they shine
Oh, If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

[Chorus: Johnny Cash & Fiona Apple]
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind

[Verse 1]
I know that hearts were loving
Long before I was here
And I'm not the first to ever cry
In my bed or in my beer
There were songs before there was radio
Of love that stays and love that goes
They were writing meloncholy tunes
And tearful words that rhyme

[Chorus]
Before my time

[x2]

[Verse 2]
There were songs in old dusty books
Of love thats always been
Sweet lovers in their glory
Who are now gone with the wind
Old fashion love words spoken then
Keep coming back around again
Nothings changed except the names
Their love burns just like mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And in the dim of yesterday
I can clearly see
That flesh and blood cried out to someone
As it does in me
And there was some old song that said
I love you 'til I die

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
But what the old time masters had
Is what I feel for you
Love is love and doesn't change
In a century or two
If someway they had seen and knew
How it would be for me and you
They'd wish for love like yours
And they would wish for love like mine
Before my time

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim
My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head

[Verse 2: Johnny Cash]
I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head in my hands
The sheriff, he asked me
"Why had I run?"
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head

[Verse 3: Johnny Cash]
Here in the courthouse
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
"Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find"
I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my

[Verse 4: Johnny Cash]
Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on the hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain
And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'll ride together
To kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy
For soon I'll be dead

[Chorus: Johnny Cash]
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head

[Verse]
It was on one cold winter night
When the wind blew across the wild moor
When Mary came wandering home with a child
Till she came to her own father's door
"Father, dear father," she cried
"Come down and open the door
Or the child in my arms will perish and die
From the winds that blow across the wild moor."
But her father was deaf to her cry
Not a sound of a voice did he hear
So the watchdog did howl and the village bells tolled
And the wind blew across the wild moor
Oh, how the old man must have felt
When he came to the door the next morn'
And he found Mary dead but the child still alive
Closely grasping its dead mother's arms
In grief, the old man passed away
And the child, to it's mother, went soon
And no one, they say, lives there to this day
And the cottage, to ruin, has gone
But the villagers point out the spot
Where the willows grew over the door
Saying, "There Mary died, once the gay village bride
From the wind that blow across the wild moor"

[Verse]
The first time ever I saw your face, I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless sky, my love
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move through my hands
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command
And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I know our joy would fill the earth
And last till the end of time, my love

[Outro]
The first time ever I saw your face

[Verse 1]
I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through this world below
There's no sickness, no toil, nor danger
In that bright land to which I go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm going there to see my Father
And all my loved ones who've gone on

[Chorus]
I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home

[Verse 2]
I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is hard and steep
But beauteous fields arise before me
Where God's redeemed, their vigils keep

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm going there to see my Mother
She said she'd meet me when I come

[Chorus]
So, I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home

[Pre-Chorus]
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there

[Chorus]
Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer
Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

[Pre-Chorus]
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone to care

[Chorus]
Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

[Verse]
There are places I'll remember
All my life
Though some have changed
Some forever
Not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life
I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one
Compares with you
And these memories
Lose their meaning
When I think of love
As something new

[Chorus]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life
I love you more
In my life
I love you more

[Verse 1]
Oh, lord, help me walk
Another mile, just one more mile;
I'm tired of walking all alone
And lord, help me to smile
Another smile, just one more smile;
Don't think I can do things on my own

[Chorus]
I never thought I needed help before;
Thought that I could get by - by myself
But now I know I just can't take it any more
And with a humble heart, on bended knee
I'm begging You please for help

[Verse 2]
Oh come down from Your golden throne to me, to lowly me;
I need to feel the touch of Your tender hand
Release the chains of darkness
Let me see, Lord let me see;
Just where I fit into your master plan

[Chorus]

[Outro]
With a humble heart, on bended knee
I'm begging You please for help

[Verse 1]
It should be a while before I see Dr. Death
So it would sure be nice if I could get my breath
Well I'm not the crying nor the whining kind
Until I hear the whistle of the 309

[Chorus]
Of the 309, of the 309
Put me in my box on the 309

[Verse 2]
Take me to the depot, put me to bed
Blow an electric fan on my gnarly old head
Everybody take a look, see I'm doing fine
Then load my box on the 309

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hey sweet baby, kiss me hard
Draw my bath water, sweep my yard
Give a drink of my wine to my Jersey cow
I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for my journey now
On the 309, on the 309
I hear the sound of a railroad train
The whistle blows and I'm gone again
It will take me higher than a Georgia pine
Stand back children, it's a 309

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
A chicken in the pot and turkey in the corn
Ain't felt this good since jubilee morn
Talk about luck, well I got mine
Asthma coming down like a 309
Write me a letter, sing me a song
Tell me all about it, what I did wrong
Meanwhile I will be doing fine
Then load my box on the 309

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
You been out riding fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasing you
Can hurt you somehow

[Chorus 1]
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the things that you can't get

[Verse 2]
Desperado, oh, you aren't getting any younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're driving you home
And freedom, oh freedom
Well, that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking
Through this world all alone

[Chorus 2]
And don't your feet get cold in the winter time
The sky won't snow, the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losing all your highs and lows
Isn't it funny how the feeling
Goes away

[Verse 3]
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences, and open the gate
It may be raining, but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late

[Verse 1]
If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains around my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as there's a ghost that you can't see

[Verse 2]
If I could read your mind, love
What a tale your thoughts would tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstores sell
When you reached the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail
You won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take!

[Verse 3]
I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now, love, let's be real
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back

[Verse 4]
If you could read my mind, love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
But stories always end
If you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just trying to understand
The feelings that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back

[Verse 1]
Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed
Where the gun is cocked and the bullet's cold
Where the miles are marked in the blood and gold
I'll meet you further on up the road


Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring
My lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing
I got a song to sing, it keeps me out of the cold
And I'll meet you further on up the road

[Hook]
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Where the way is dark and the night is cold
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road

[Verse 2]
Now I been out in the desert, just doin' my time
Searchin' through the dust, lookin' for a sign
If there's a light up ahead, well brother I don't know
But I got this fever burnin' in my soul

[Bridge]
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Further on up the road

[Hook]
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
And I'll meet you further on up the road

[Verse]
I heard the laughter at the depot
But my tears fell like the rain
When I saw them place that long white casket
In the baggage coach of the evening train
The baby's eyes are red from weeping
Its little heart is filled with pain
Oh Daddy cried they are taking Mama
Away from us on the evening train
As I turned to walk away from the depot
It seemed I heard her call my name
Take care of my baby and tell him darling
That I'm going home on the evening train
I pray that God will give me courage
To carry on until we meet again
It's hard to know she's gone forever
They're carrying her home on the evening train

[Verse 1]
I couldn't manage the problems I laid on myself
And it just made it worse when I laid them on somebody else
So I finally surrendered it all brought down in despair
I cried out for help and I felt a warm comforter there

[Chorus]
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I
I came to believe that I needed help to get by
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I

[Verse 2]
Nothing worked out when I handled it all on my own
And each time I failed it made me feel twice as alone
Then I cried, "Lord there must be a sure and easier way
For it just cannot be that a man should lose hope every day."

[Chorus]
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I
I came to believe that I needed help to get by
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I

[Chorus]
I have been a rover
I have walked alone
Hiked a hundred highways
Never found a home
Still in all I'm happy
The reason is, you see
Once in a while along the way
Love's been good to me

[Verse 1]
There was a girl in Denver
Before the summer storm
Oh, her eyes were tender
Oh, her arms were warm
And she could smile away the thunder
Kiss away the rain
Even though she's gone away
You won't hear me complain

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
There was a girl in Portland
Before the winter chill
We used to go a-courting
Along October hill
And she could laugh away the dark clouds
Cry away the snow
It seems like only yesterday
As down the road I go

[Chorus]

[Verse]
If heartaches brought fame in love's crazy game
I'd be a legend in my time
If they gave gold statuettes for tears and regrets
I'd be a legend in my time
But they don't give awards, and there's no praise or fame
For hearts that are broken for love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time

[Verse 1]
On Jordan's stormy banks I stand
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan's fair and happy land
Where my possessions lie

[Chorus]
I am bound for the promised land
I am bound for the promised land
Oh, who will come and go with me
I am bound for the promised land

[Verse 2]
Over all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day
There God, the Son forever reigns
And scatters night away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
No chilling winds or poisonous breath
Can reach that healthful shore
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death
Are felt and feared no more

[Chorus]

[Outro]
When I shall reach that happy place
I'll be forever blessed
For I shall see my Father's face
And in His bosom rest

[Verse]
I'm going to write a tear stained letter
I'm going to mail it straight to you
I'm going to bring back to your mind
What you said about always being true
About our secret hiding places
Being daily satisfied
I can see you sitting and reading it
While you hang, you head and cry
I just hope you're not so sad
You're going to go down suicide
I'm going to write a tear stained letter
Put it special delivery
Because it's gonna be full of stuff
That's only known to you and me
About how every time I get turned on
You turn me off and bring me down
It'll be about the darkest news
That ever did arrive in your hometown
It'll be about the saddest thing
Your mailman ever did bring around
I'm going to write a tear stained letter
I'm going to tell you one more time
That you still could reconsider
And come back to being mine
And if you think about what I'm saying
It'd be hard to refuse
Just be sure you think a long time
On the answer that you choose
It will be a most important piece
Of personal, private news
I'm going to write a tear stained letter
Mark it "Personal Private News"
And I hope you'll keep it to yourself
And don't go around crying the blues
Giving off a bad impression
As to what went really wrong
When what it was was that suddenly
The music was all gone
And this man and this woman got cut off
In the middle of our song
I'm going to write a tear stained letter
I'm going to put it to a tune
So I'll be sending with it
A sweet melody for you
And not some red-hot, upbeat zinger
That'll set your body on fire
But a hunk of love included
Meant to take you a little higher
And to settle on your sweet, sweet mind
At night when you retire

[Outro]
I'm going to write a tear stained letter

[Verse 1]
We're the best partners this world's ever seen
Together as close as can be
But sometimes it's hard to find time in between
To tell you what you mean to me

[Chorus]
You are the rose of my heart
You are the love of my life
A flower not fading nor falling apart
If you're tired, rest your head on my arm
Rose of my heart

[Verse 2]
When sorrow holds you in its arms of clay
It's rain drops that fall from your eyes
Your smile is like the sun come to earth for a day
You brighten my blackest of skies

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So hard times or easy times, what do I care
There's nothing I'd change if I could
The tears and the laughter are things that we share
Your hand in mine makes it good

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Chorus]
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change, come what may
Well our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

[Verse 1]
Think I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall
Got some friends that I can go to working for
Yet I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are looking good
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare
But by then it would be winter, not much for you to do
And the winds can sure blow cold way up there

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll meet again
Some sunny day

[Chorus 1]
Keep smiling through
Just like you
Always do
Until the blue skies drive
The dark clouds
Far away

[Chorus 2]
And will you please say hello
To the folks that I know
Tell them that I won't be long
And they'll be happy to know
That when you saw me go
I was singing this song

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll meet again
Some sunny day

Yeah We'll meet again
I Don't know where
I Don't know when
But I do know
That We'll meet again
Some sunny day

[Chorus 1]
So honey
Keep on smiling through
Just like you
Always do
Until the blue skies drive
The dark clouds
Far away

[Chorus 2]
And will you please say hello
To the folks that I know
Tell them that I won't be long
And they'll be happy to know
That when you saw me go
I was singing this song

[Outro]
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll meet again
Some sunny day

[Verse 1]
It's a long and dusty road, a hot and a heavy load
And the folks I meet aren't always kind
Some are bad and some are good
Some have done the best they could
And some have tried to ease my troubled mind

[Chorus]
And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

[Verse 2]
I've been wandering through this land just doing the best I can
Trying to find what I was meant to do
And the people that I see look as worried as can be
And it looks like they are wondering too

[Chorus]
And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

[Verse 3]
We, I had a little girl one time, she had lips like sherry wine
And she loved me until my head went plumb insane
But I was too blind to see she was drifting away from me
And my good gal went off on the morning train

[Chorus]
And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

[Verse 4]
If you see me passing by and you sit and you wonder why
And you wish that you were rambling too
Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor, lace them up and bar the door
Thank your stars for the roof that's over you

[Chorus]
And I can't help but wonder
Where I'm bound, where I'm bound
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound

[Chorus]
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down

[Verse 1]
When I
