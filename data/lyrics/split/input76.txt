ds above us
Feels like someone liftin' me
We peakin'
Arms like covers
Feels like someone sent for me
We peakin'

[Verse 1]
Don't be ashamed, don't close the door
Oh, trust me, baby, I've been there before
And I know you think it can't get lower than the floor
Walk out the basement, let's take a tour

[Pre-Chorus]
It happens to everyone
You're not the only one, girl
This is called growin' up, sugar
Be careful, but still have fun, yeah

[Chorus]
You're my twilight when it's awfully dark and I lost my way
'Cause when my life feels off the mark, you put me back in place

[Verse 2]
I'm just another annoyin' voice (Annoyin' voice)
You've heard it so many times, you could make a chorus (Make a chorus)
And I know you wonder where that magic is stored (Magic stored)
Your mind is a stairway, knock on Heaven's door

[Pre-Chorus]
It happens to everyone
You're not the only one, girl
This is called growin' up, sugar
Be careful, but still have fun, yeah

[Chorus]
You're my twilight when it's awfully dark and I lost my way
'Cause when my life feels off the mark, you put me back in place
You're my twilight when it's awfully dark and I lost my way
'Cause when my life feels off the mark, you put me back in place

[Pre-Chorus]
It happens to everyone
You're not the only one, girl
This is called growin' up, sugar
Be careful, but still have fun, yeah

[Chorus]
You're my twilight when it's awfully dark and I lost my way
'Cause when my life feels off the mark, you put me back in place

[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak & Nate Dogg]
It's the rap singer, the hook master
Real life convict, son of a gambler
Heart made of stone, and he move so cold
'Cause my girl up and gone, she'll be back in the morn'
Go lil' mama, take your drama
Seems like I can't live without it
I ache and moan
'Cause my heart is broke
'Cause my love went wrong
Yeah, another bag and she'll love me in the morn'
While the bubble over stove
As I was dreaming of a bag, then I woke
You were starting to snore, wake your ass up
Layin' in a bed full of cash
You slowly rolled over and whispered back to me
"That's just the way things have to be"
Hey

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Anderson .Paak]
What can we do? (Yeah, what can we do?)
What can we do? (What can we do, baby?)
What can we do? (Hey, what can we do?)
What can we do? (Do)

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg, Anderson .Paak & Both]
That's when the change comes
That's when the game's done
That's when the walls come tumbling down
Ah, ah, ah, yeah
They see me gettin' action
Started, it ain't no fun
Time to grow up and turn it around
Ah, ah, ah, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Anderson .Paak]
Hey, what can we do? (Yeah, what can we do?)
What can we do? (What can we do, baby?)
What can we do? (Ooh, what can we do? Yeah)
What can we do? (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Nate Dogg & Anderson .Paak]
To make it feel just like it used to feel
If my cup was empty, you could fill it (Yeah, yeah)
I feel you, yeah, yeah, I hear you
To make it feel just like it used to feel
If my cup was empty, you could fill it (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Nate Dogg & Anderson .Paak]
What can we do, what can we do, what can we do?
(Yeah, what'cha sayin', Nate?)
What can we do, what can we do, what can we do? (Yeah)
What can we do, what can we do, what can we do? (Like that)
What can we do, what can we do, what can we do?

[Outro: Anderson .Paak & Nate Dogg]
Damn, Nate, you sound good than a motherfucker, man
I need a blowout in my voice, man
Keep singin' that shit
Yeah, you can erase all that, man
Hell naw, we already paid for this studio session, my nigga, hold on
It sound good, bro, where you goin'?
Living gone
Ayy, Nate
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nate
Mmm, ah, ah yeah

[Intro: Crooks]
Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Crooks]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Bridge: Billie Eilish]
(Ahh)
(Ah-ahh)
End me
End me
End me
(Ahh)
End me
End me
End me

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Crooks]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 3: Billie Eilish & Crooks]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish]
For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Outro: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Post-Chorus]
So make a wish
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I'll be your gift
Give you something good to celebrate

[Outro]
Happy birthday...
I don't really want to drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
In Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
In Oakland, in Oakland

Foot on the gas
I'm just tryna pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go

[Intro: T.I.]
Uh, hmm, okay

[Chorus: T.I.]
Now when the players in the house, we gon' turn shit out
Like you came home not guilty on all counts
Keep some drink in your cup and a joint in your mouth
You bet not do no goofy shit, caught out there running your mouth
Boy, this the playa ball, uh, yeah (Yeah)
Uh, little bitch you're welcomed to the playa ball
Yeah (Alright)
Yeah (Well, alright)
Uh, hah

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm blowing reefer in the ride, Mike Jackson the vibe
With a pretty young thing on the passenger side
The forty-five in the cut, in case nigga nut up
Police get behind me, I'ma pass it to her
Mink coat to the floor since I did it with Puff
Showed a lot of y'all what getting it was
Hey listen, ain't no sense in getting in your feeling, lil' cuz
'Cause I don't wanna drag you out the building, lil' cuz
Plus, I think she just spiked my drink 'cause I'm feeling a buzz
Enjoying the high, don't you go to blowing it now
Come from a long line of players, generation in my DNA
Pull up to the playa ball like I'm at the VMA
In a stingaling color of a hundred dollar bill face
Diamonds over cash, mil, twice as much as last year
I see your bitch using on me, tell her bring her ass here
You know how it goes
Stick to the G code, she chose, yeah, uh (Yeah)
Stick to the G code, she chose, yeah (Yeah)
Heh, you know how it goes
Stick to the G code, she chose (Yeah)

[Chorus: T.I.]
Now when the players in the house, we gon' turn shit out
Like you came home not guilty on all counts
Keep some drink in your cup and a joint in your mouth
You bet not do no goofy shit, caught out there running your mouth
Boy, this the playa ball, uh, yeah (Yeah)
Uh, little bitch you're welcomed to the playa ball
Yeah (Alright)
Yeah (Well, alright)
Uh

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Why you looking at me sideways? Let me get my point across
Geometrically, mental telepathy
My Cripping and pimping is sold separately
Sabrina, Katrina, Mina, and Bethany
Do it carefully
Bite the bullet while killing a fucking bear for me
I'm fly as the fuck, jump in the air for me
I don't do singles, go get a pair for me
And put it there for me
Proper preparation, prepared, perfected
My mellow, my metal is undetected
Run tell that Martin lie
Playas ball, bitch, I'm in the starting five
Fun in the joint
See, I see running the joint
Iree, Kyrie and I be running the point
Up and down like a elevator
And I'm having a hard time holding down these alligators
You haters been watching and running your mouth like a hawk
Never mind me, know my mink on the floor
The cameras flash as I tip through softly
I let my bottom bitch go collect my trophy
Picture that like a mack in a pimp pose
Yeah, nigga, she chose (She chose)
Yes sir, she chose
Yeah, nigga, she chose

[Chorus: T.I.]
Now when the players in the house, we gon' turn shit out
Like you came home not guilty on all counts
Keep some drink in your cup and a joint in your mouth
You bet not do no goofy shit, caught out there running your mouth
Boy, this the playa ball, uh, yeah (Yeah)
Uh, little bitch you're welcomed to the playa ball
Yeah (Alright)
Yeah (Well, alright)
Uh

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder
Because the years of fretting days is right behind you now
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds

[Pre-Chorus]
I will show you a game where the winner never wins

[Chorus]
Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

[Verse 2]
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free

[Pre-Chorus]
I will hold a lighted lamp and we shall walk together

[Chorus]
Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

[Bridge]
Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you?

[Pre-Chorus]
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'd like to hear

[Chorus]
Let your hair hang down
Wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Let me sleep beside you

[Verse 1]
The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I watched them sink before your gaze
Señorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love
Like a little soldier catching butterflies

[Chorus]
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn’t you like to love me too
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

[Verse 2]
I’ll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organize the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend
I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh, I'm so much in love
Like the ragged boy who races with the wind

[Chorus]
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I’ll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I’ll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

Oh yeah, all day, all the way

[Intro]
You know what it is, it's Gucci Mane LaFlare
You rocking with the trillest
Been trill
Stop playing with these lame ass niggas, man
Drop that shit
Brr!

[?] (Mike WiLL Made-It)
Been trill

[Verse 1]
All of the sudden these niggas pussy, so I wanna be your buddy
If I had a cousin was a pussy ass nigga, I'd say that it wasn't my cousin
I was robbing niggas in my black tee, I ain't even have no bungee
On 3rd street at 13 but I ain't even have no Cutlass
My nigga tried to rob him but got a Glock on me, I'm ugly
Then the droptop deep in the 

[?] tree, and it look like the car got crutches
I'd murk a nigga then smoke a blunt, man I ain't even think nothing of it
Got duct tape all on your husband, nigga should've paid my money
I don't drive by, I slide by
Watch me glide by
Never seen a nigga in a 'Rari do a drive-by
Yea the choppa with some bullets longer than a french fry
Man you 

[?] ass niggas need to sell a baked pie

[Chorus]
I got ten chains on, I do a lot of flexing (Flexing)
Richard Mille home, rich watch ain't on her guest list (Guess list)
I got ten chains on, I do a lot of flexing (Flexing)
Richard Mille home, rich watch ain't on her guest list (Guess list)
(Chorus)
I'm just an item on the shelf and you just can’t help yourself
Put me in your shopping cart, then put me back and break my heart
You've got to boost your confidence
So you cross me off your shopping list
Lift me up and let me drop, you're just here to window shop

(Verse 1)
You said you yearned for me, but you turned out to be
Just like everyone else, and now I’m by myself
From the way you treated me, I thought you needed me
I'm just an empty bottle to you, you used me up and now you're through

(Chorus)
I'm just an item on the shelf and you just can't help yourself
Put me in your shopping cart, then put me back and break my heart
You've got to boost your confidence
So you cross me off your shopping list
Lift me up and let me drop, you're just here to window shop

(Verse 2)
I'm thinking about how you make me glow, you’re thinking about different ways to say no
I really should have looked ahead, and ignored all the things you said
Take my hand and then drop it
Blow my bubble then pop it
Hold me tight and then stop it
Hold me tight and then stop it
(Chorus)
I’m just an item on the shelf and you just can't help yourself
Put me in your shopping cart, then put me back and break my heart
You’ve got to boost your confidence
So you cross me off your shopping list
Lift me up and let me drop, you're just here to window shop
I'm just an item on the shelf and you just can't help yourself
Put me in your shopping cart, then put me back and break my heart
You’ve got to boost your confidence
So you cross me off your shopping list
Lift me up and let me drop, you're just here to window shop
Scientists say they’re all untrue
Could it be 

[?]
Could it be solved

[?]
They could be just a fool
They could be just a fool
What will it be?

The perfect summer with 

[?]
For it will be crisp

[?]

[?] will say they’re untrue

[?]

What will it be?
What will it be?

Scientists say they’re untrue

[?] say they are true

[?]
(Verse 1)
Sittin’ there looking at a picture
I swear I saw it move
It’s been so many days now
And I’ve always known that you die more everyday
But here I really feel it
And sometimes I find myself staring into the face of my best friend
Just happens to be my toothbrush

(Chorus)
That empty feeling of Motel Sadness
That lonely feeling of Motel Sadness

(Verse 2)
And I want to tell that depressed man that there’s more to life than pulling that lever
And I want to buy a hooker and just take her out to dinner
But I don’t think it’ll matter in this place
Where the people forgot that the homeless have names and the roadkill has a face
Take off your neon mask
Let me see how you really feel
I’m homesick for a place where I only feel homesick
(Chorus)
That empty feeling of Motel Sadness
That lonely feeling of Motel Sadness
That empty feeling of Motel Sadness
You know it really is quite insane
How one second will rip you apart like a hurricane
So now that everything of mine is destroyed and wrecked
I want you to get out your wand and start writing me a check

I’m not going to say the word “permanent" because it’s not the truth
I’m learning that everything is about as permanent as a loose tooth
But it is the truth that until I’m dead
The worst part of sleeping is getting out of bed

Unfortunately it’s that kind of pain that covers you like cellophane
And for now, I think I should abstain from standing under that cloud of rain
Yes, I’ve been fooled by empty words
But I’ve never been fooled by major or minor thirds

I think I should get in my car and turn off my phone
Or else I’ll just be scratching itches until I reach the bone
And ill sit there and I'll smile and I won’t complain
As the words rip through my heart like a hurricane

Like a hurricane
Like a hurricane
Like a hurricane
Like a hurricane
Like a hurricane
Like a hurricane
Like a hurricane
Like a hurricane
Time is standing still on the sixth floor
No need to wish anymore
Look at the crowd of people moving along
To do the same thing they always do
Sharing your treasure, you think to yourself
“This is it”

You’re talking louder than you ever have
But your mouth is closed
How is it possible that you exist
On this night

On this night
If I wait any longer I'll blow a vein
I was tossed from a plane or train
The restaurant thought I wanted a burger with fries
I was interested in a McShake with lime

In this wide arena corn wears a disguise
In this order we will eat some home-grown pies
I looked down to admire the work I had done
But to my horror there was none

The gift was given, of this I swear
I know in my heart there was nothing there
Even as the road unraveled, I saw no tire tracks
I got up and left the river and turned my back

[?] Susie are losing their trust
The faith in me is covered in dust
My shoes have been filled in, the socks are being filled
The night they found out that

I wasn’t real
I wasn’t real

Got to Johnny’s place through a passage of bricks

[?] my backbone tricks
But the look on his face could only reveal
That he realized

I wasn’t real
I wasn’t real
I wasn't real
I wasn't real

I took three A beasts to make one more stop
My 

[?] was met with neither call nor drop
Your parents 

[?] conceal
The night you found out that
I took 

[?] to make one more stop

My 

[?] was met with 

[?] drop
Your parents 

[?]
The night you found out that

I wasn’t real
Do you sit when you’re off this cubicle
Thinking about how life is beautiful?
Your face is made of concrete
And you sold your smile to a pawn shop down the street

Hang up your telephone
Someone that you know is on a hospital bed

Now when you open your backdoor
The air has never felt so cold before
Did you choose the moments you lived inside
When you could have been out under that blue sky

They’ll be wishing that I were dry
But you know the clouds in the sky
Part of these clouds of flies

Use the blue sky
Use the blue sky
Use the blue sky
Use the blue sky
Use the blue sky
Use the blue sky
Use the blue sky
Use the blue sky
Use the blue sky
Use the blue sky

For some strange reason
You’re done pleasin' me like it's okay
Like a perm that’s been left too long (it's starts to burn)
The result is it just won't take (I can see)
Now it's all coming so clear to me now (I can see)
Misinterpreted all my naiveness
Was just thinking if I had no you than I can't do
My stock just went up over 2 million

Cause it gets no stronger
Ladies y'all know (yeah girl, ya'll know)
This pimp shit gets no older
Is that a threat? (What's another threat?)
Yep! (that’s another threat)
I’m immune, you can get no colder
You got the green light, you the king, right?
You holdin' up traffic, green means go!

Go, go, red light, green light

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I gave all I could give
My love, my heart
Now we're facing the end
From what you did
From the start, my love

[Verse 3: Young Buck & Beyoncé]
I’ve been sittin' at this Red Light, ready to go
You know I slowed down once but I won't no mo'
Baby girl hold on, better buckle your seat belt
I told you to holla when he left
I know he tried to buy your heart with a black car
Big old mansion with a big old backyard
But if he was that smart, homeboy would already know
Put a queen of your team, the hoes got to go
Shorty lets roll if you ready to ride
He've been parked to long, let me put it in drive
Ain't nothin' like thug love, and thats real
I'm a lay back, you grab the wheel
I can handle it, Get the candles lit
Got to take advantage of every chance you get
So if ya'll ain't hear me, B. let'em know
You're holdin' up traffic, green means go!
OOOH!!!

[Hook 2: Beyoncé]
So if you want to (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh), you got the green light (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh)
So if you want to (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh), you got the green light (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh)

So why not move along? (Go, go, go. Oh, Oh)
You got the green light so you can go (Go, go, go. Oh, Oh)
Go, go, red light, green light
Years, days, makes no difference to me babe
You look exactly the same to me
Ain't no time, crossing your legs inside the diner
Raising your coffee to your lips, the steam

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

You whisper to a restless ear, “can you get me out of here?
This place smells like piss and beer, can you get me out?”
You were asking me, how to get you free
I only know the recipe to roam

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

Old stars
Filling up my throat
You gave ’em to me when I was born
Now they're coming out
Laying there on the hospital bed
Your eyes were narrow, blue and red
You took a draw of breath and said to me
You say the masterpiece, she looks a lot like me
Wrapping my left arm round your right
Ready to walk you through the night

Old friends, old mothers, dogs and brothers
There's only so much letting go you can ask someone to do
So I’ll keep you by my side, I will not give you to the tide
I'll even walk you in my stride, Marie

Cause I saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping your left arm round my right
Ready to walk me through the night

[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, yeah, block

Pull up in the drop
Yeah, this likely got so hot
Yeah, this block it got so hot

[Chorus]
Pulled up flexin' (Flexin’), ice on my necklace (Yeah)
Droppin' bricks, Tetris
Cuban link necklace (Flexin')
All I do is flex cause I’m young (Young) and I'm reckless
All I do is flex cause I'm young and I'm reckless
Pulled up gettin' guap (Guap), the block is so hot
The block is hot (Hot), the block it got so hot (Hot)
The block is hot (Hot), the block is hot (Hot-hot-hot)
The block is hot (Hot), the block hot (Hot)

[Verse]
The block hot now, gotta watch out for cops now
I'm the hottest rapper in the game, pull up with my top down
Bust down Rollie, Peter Marco jewelry, that's a bust down
All these girls up on me, yeah, I call that girl a touchdown
All froze, all diamonds, no gold
I'm the man, already know
Xan with the lean, my diamonds froze, diamonds froze
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, ayy

[Chorus 2]
The block is so hot (Hot)
Yeah, the block is hot (It’s hot)
The block is hot (Block hot)
The block is hot (It’s hot), I've got the block hot (Got the beans)
The Glock is hot, the Glock is hot
The block is hot, the Glock is hot
Gotta watch for 12, gotta watch the trap spot
The Glock hot, Gang got the block hot
Catching’ bodies, serving blocks
On the Glock, the Glock is hot

[Verse 2]
I pull up in a twin turbo V12
I'm getting money, yeah I might as well
Ayy, five million mansion, throw it in a wishing well
I been getting gas, all I want you to do is wish me
Wish me well, money on the scale
I've been getting cash, make it rain in the air
Pull up on the plug, get the work and disappear
I put a hundred thousand dollars in my ear

[Verse 1]
Woke up to a rainy day
Sun dried all of the rain away
Turned the sky from blue to grey
Love if our things work out that way
So I flipped through the pages of this old photo book
I had to take a second look
Of where we’ve been and where we’ve come from
And will we miss each other in the long run

[Chorus]
Time and time again
I wanted to please you
I didn’t think I could leave you
But I did
Time never really was a friend
I didn’t want it to end
But it did
Put it back together again
(C’mon) Put it back together again

[Verse 2]
Now some hang on to “use to be’s”
I’m talkin' bout you and me
I know everything was changed
It’s like a rolling down memory lane
So my mind says yes and my heart says no
Tears roll like rivers flow
Like waves that toss and then turn rough
Wonder why a brother kicked a sister so tough (humph)

[Chorus]
Time and time again
I wanted to please you
I didn’t think I could leave you
But I did
Time never really was a friend
I didn’t want it to end
But it did
Put it back together again
(C’mon) Put it back together again

[Bridge]
Face to face, it seems so long ago
But do we really know how far love light(life?)) travels
Anybody could tell this train would derail
Feel my heartstrings unravel
Ask me do I do, do I still love ya
Although we’ve been through all of the pain we’ve been through
But only time will tell if we’ll go through more hell
Or will we love each other better than we used to

[Chorus]
Time and time again
I wanted to please you
I didn’t think I could leave you
But I did
Time never really was a friend
I didn’t want it to end
But it did
Put it back together again
(C’mon) Put it back together again

[Outro]
Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby
Come on baby
Put it back together again
I’m waiting, and I’m waiting, and I’m waiting on ya baby
Waiting, baby and I’m waiting
I can’t stop loving you
I cannot, cannot, cannot

You know like I know that we should (You know like I know that)
You know like I know that we should (You know that like I know that we should. You know!)
You know like I know that we should (Baby baby baby you know like I know)
You know like I know that we should (Oh yeah. Maybe one of these old days)
You know like I know that we should (Maybe one of these old days we put it back together again)
You know like I know that we should (Oh yeah)
You know like I know that we should (You know like I know that we should, yeah baby)
You know like I know that we should (Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby)
You know like I know that we should (You know that I know, we should put it back together)
You know like I know that we should (Oh yeah, I’m waiting, I’m waiting and I’m waiting)

[Verse 1]
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
Waiting for the time when the earth can be as one

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Verse 2]
Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when the earth can be as one

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Verse 1]
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the sound of thunder threatens everyone

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Outro]
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

[Verse 1]
You came along when I needed a savior
Someone to pull me through somehow
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So I'm counting on you now

[Chorus]
Somebody already broke my heart
Somebody already broke my heart

[Verse 2]
Here I am
So don't leave me stranded
On the end of a line
Hanging on the edge of a lie
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So be careful and be kind

[Chorus]
Somebody already broke my heart
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play
Somebody already broke my heart
No, no I can't go there again

[Verse 1 repeated]
You came along when I needed a savior
Someone to pull me through somehow
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So be careful and be kind

[Chorus]
Somebody already broke my heart
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play
Somebody already broke my heart
No, no I can't go there again

[Outro]
It's never as good as the first time
(It's never as good)
It's never as good as the first time
(No, no)
It's never as good as the first time
(It's never as good)
It's never as good as the first time
(No, no, never as good)

[Verse 1]
You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer
If you were mine
If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go to heaven

[Chorus]
I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
You're ruling the way that I move
You take my air

[Bridge]
You show me how deep love can be

[Verse 2]
You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me

Won't run away

You show me how deep love can be
You show me how deep love can be
This is my prayer

I cherish the day

Won't run away
Won't shy
I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid, no
As long as I'm here with you

[Outro dialogue]
Thank you, thank you
Especially in these times, I feel really privileged to be up here on this stage
And to sing for you is a real privilege

[Verse 1]
When I found out this love's undone
I was like a gun
Sure as it was over
Felt like nothing good could come
Sure as it's gonna play and play
Like Michael back in the day
I'm gonna peel you away

[Chorus]
Now as I begin
To wash you off my skin
I'm gonna peel you away
'Cause you're not right within

[Verse 2]
I love you so
Sometimes love has to let go
So this time don't think it's a lie
I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Now as I begin
To wash you off my skin
I'm gonna peel you away
'Cause you're not right within

Now it's time
To wash you off my skin
Now as I begin
It couldn't be right 'cause you're not right within
I say goodbye

[Verse 1]
Diamond life, lover boy
He move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights

[Pre-Chorus]
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

[Chorus]
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator

[Post-Chorus]
Coast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male
Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale

[Verse 2]
Face to face, each classic case
We shadow box and double cross
Yet need the chase

[Pre-Chorus]
A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold

[Chorus]
No need to ask
He’s a smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator, smooth operator
Smooth operator

[Verse 1]
Jezebel wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth
She probably had less than every one of us
But when she knew how to walk she knew
How to bring the house down
Can't blame her for her beauty
She wins with her hands down
Jezebel, what a belle
Looks like a princess in her new dress
How did you get that?
Do you really want to know, she said
It would seem she's on her way
It's more, more than just a dream
She put on her stockings and shoes
Had nothing to lose - she said it was worth it

[Chorus]
Reach for the top
And the sun is gonna shine
Every winter was a war, she said
I want to get what's mine

[Verse 2]
Jezebel, you're the belle
Won't try to deny where she came from
You can see it in her pride
And the raven in her eyes
Try and show her a better way
She'll say, You don't know what you've been missing
And by the time she blinks you know she won't be listening

[Chorus]
Reach for the top, she said
And the sun is gonna shine
Every winter was a war, she said
I want to get what's mine
I want to get what's mine

[Saxophone solo]

[Outro]
She said I wanna get what's mine
I wanna get what's mine
Yeah, I wanna get what's mine

[Spoken Intro]
I don't know what's happening outside but it feels like sunshine up here
You give me the kiss of life

[Verse 1]
There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly led me to you
Look at the sky
It's the color of love
There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you
He led me to you
He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tons of love inside
I can't say

When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
You wrapped me up in
The color of love

[Chorus]
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life

Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Wasn't it clear from the start
Look the sky is full of love
Oh yeah the sky is full of love
He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tons of love inside
I can't say

[Chorus]
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life, oh yeah yeah
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life

[Bridge]
You wrapped me up in the color of love
Must have been an angel come down from above
Giving me love, yeah
Giving me love, yeah
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life, oh yeah yeah
You gave me the kiss of life
The kiss of life
You gave me the kiss of life
You gave me the kiss of life
I see them gathered, see them on the shore
I turned to look once more
And he who knows me not
Takes me to the belly of darkness

The tears run swift and hard
And when they fall
Even, even the comfort of a stone
Would be a gain
There was a time when I thought
I would have to give up
But I'm thankful that I’m
Strong as I am and I'll
Try to do the best I can

Tears will run swift
And tears will come that fall like rain
I pray that it's swift though
Tears will fall as cold as pain

I pray to the almighty
Let me not to him do
As he has unto me
Teach my beloved children
Who have been enslaved
To reach for the light continually
So many times I prayed
So many times I’ve prayed for you
Prayed for you

The tears run swift and hard and cold as pain
Even, even the comfort of a stone would be a gain
Had I not had the strength and wisdom of a warrior
I would have to give up
But I'm thankful that I'm
Strong as I am and I'll
Try to do the best I can

Tears will run swift
And tears will come that fall like rain
I pray that it's swift though
Tears will fall as cold as pain

I pray to the almighty
Let us not do as he has unto us
Teach my beloved children I've been a slave
But reach for the light continually

Wisdom is the flame
Wisdom is the brave warrior
Who will carry us into the sun
I pray that it's swift though
Tears will come that fall like rain
So many times, so many times

[Verse]
Quietly while you were asleep
The moon and I were talking
I asked that she'd always keep you protected

She promised you her light
That you so gracefully carry
You bring your light and shine like morning

And then the wind pulls the clouds across the moon
Your light fills the darkest room
And I can see the miracle
That keeps us from falling

[Outro]
She promised all the sweetest gifts
That only the heavens could bestow
You bring your light and shine like morning
And as you so gracefully give
Her light as long as you live
I'll always remember this moment
Thank you very much

[Verse 1]
If I tell you
If I tell you now
Will you keep on
Will you keep on loving me
If I tell you
If I tell you how I feel
Will you keep bringing out the best in me

[Chorus]
You give me, you give me the sweetest taboo
You give me, you're giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

[Verse 2]
There's a quiet storm
And it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm
That is you
There's a quiet storm
And it never felt this hot before
Giving me something that's taboo
(Sometimes I think you're just too good for me)

[Chorus]
You give me the sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love with you
You give me the sweetest taboo
You're giving me the sweetest taboo
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me

[Bridge]
I'd do anything for you, I'd stand out in the rain
Anything you want me to do, don't let it slip away

[Verse 3]
There's a quiet storm
And it never felt like this before
There'a a quiet storm
I think it's you
There'a a quiet storm
And I never felt this hot before
You're giving me something that's taboo

[Chorus]
You give me the sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love with you
You give me, you're giving me the sweetest taboo
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
You've got the biggest heart
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me
Every day is Christmas, and every night is New Years Eve
Will you keep on loving me
Will you keep on, will you keep on
Bringing out the best in me

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
We just got lucky tonight, I know we did
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me

[Verse 1]
I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Mmm, feels fine

[Chorus]
Feels like
You're mine
Feels right
So fine
I'm yours
You're mine
Like paradise

[Verse 1]
I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love
Didn't I tell you
What I believe
Did somebody say that
A love like that won’t last
Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give, baby

I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love

I keep trying for you
There’s nothing like you and I, baby

Keep flying for you
Keep flying and I'm falling
And I'm falling

All, I couldn't love you more
All, I couldn’t give you more
No no, no, not if I tried
Don’t you know, baby
Don't you know, baby, I couldn’t love you more
Couldn't love you more, no no
Couldn't love you more than I do
Oh, more than I do right now

[Verse 1]
You think I'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
You think I’d leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I’ll tell you you're right when you want
Ha ah ah ah ah ah
And if only you could see into me

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me

[Verse 2]
When you're on the outside, baby, and you can`t get in
I will show you you're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone and you can’t get back again
I will find you, darling, and I will bring you home

[Bridge]
And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time
You’ll be fine

[Verse 3]

I could really love you the way I do
Is it possible I could feel this good
I could really love you the way I do

[Chorus]
See me (Within the light)
Flowing (Take me to you)
Like the river to the sea
You come down (I'm in the light)
You cover (Pull me to you)
And the waves rush over me

[Bridge]
I feel a love light rush over me
I feel the love turn to me
And then your love just creeps over me
Over me

See me (Within the light)
Flowing (Take me to you)

This love's not a liar
To cold, it's a fire
I'm on the run
And it's a comfort to me
I won't let you go
Take up your love
Take up your love
Take up your love
And come to me
This love's not a liar
To cold, it's a fire
I'm on the run
And it's a comfort to me

I won't let you go
I won't let you go
I won't let you go
I won't let you go
I won't let you go

Hey, yeah
This may come, this may come as some surprise
But I miss you
I could see through all of your lies
But still I miss you

He takes her love, but it doesn't feel like mine
He tastes her kiss, her kisses are not wine, they're not mine

He takes, but surely she can't give what I'm feeling now
She takes, but surely she doesn't know how

Is it a crime
Is it a crime
That I still want you
And I want you to want me too

My love is wider, wider than Victoria Lake
My love is taller, taller than the Empire State

It dives and it jumps, and it ripples like the deepest ocean
I can't give you more than that
Surely you want me back
Is it a crime
Is it a crime
I still want you
And I want you to want me too, oh yeah

[Instrumental break]

My love is wider than Victoria Lake
Taller than the Empire State

It dives and it jumps

[Instrumental break]

It dives and it jumps
And it ripples like the deepest ocean
I can't give you more than that
Surely you want it back
Tell me
Is it a crime?

[Verse 1]
There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly led me to you
Look at the sky
It's the color of love
There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you
He led me to you
He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tons of love inside
I can't say

When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you
Ayy, ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy, ayy ayy
You wrapped me up in
The color of love

[Chorus]
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
Kiss of life

Baby you, I know that love, love is found
Love is found

[Verse 1]
You'd be surprised, girl
Soon they'll mean nothing to you
They'll fall into their brew
And take down some of the boys with them too
There's nothing
Nothing that you have to do

[Chorus]
In another time, girl
Your tears won't leave a trace
In another time, girl
In another place

[Verse 2]
You've been down, girl
Their whispers are hailstones in your face
You're so tired of waiting
For something to change
They don't know what to do with
Something so good
That you wouldn't hurt them
You wouldn't hurt them if you could

[Bridge]
One of these days
They're gonna fall into their brew
And they'll know exactly what they did to you
Darling, I just want you to know
Your tears won't leave a trace

[Chorus]
In another time, girl
In another time, girl
In another place

[Outro]
Darling, I just want you to know
Your tears won't leave a trace

In another time, girl
In another time, girl

In another time, girl

[Verse 1]
It's all about our love
So shall it be forever, never ending

[Refrain]
After all this time
After all is said and done

[Verse 2]
We have seen some suffering, baby
It has not always been perfect

[Refrain]
After all this time
After all is said and done

[Bridge]
Darling, we know it
Whatever may come
We can get through it
As if it's just begun
(As though it's just begun)

[Outro]
It's all about our love
So shall it be forever, never ending
Darling, we know it

After all this time
After all is said and done

After all this time
After all is said and done

[Verse]
How could you
You are the river
Pour out of this life
How could you
You are the morning bird
Who sang me into life every day
Fly away

[Outro]
You are the blood of me
The harvest of my dreams
There's nowhere I can find peace
And the silence won't cease
Nothing's quite how it seems
The ghost of my joy
Won't let me be
If you set me free I will not run
I will not run
I will not run

[Verse 1]
I was the one
I who could
Pull in all the stars above
Lay them on your feet
And I gave you my love

[Pre-Chorus]
You are the one that got me started
You could have let me
Love anyone but I only wanted you
So why did you make me cry?
Why didn't you come get me one last time?

[Chorus]
You'll always know the reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know the reason why this love
Reason why this love
Ain't gonna let you go

[Verse 2]
You lay me down and left me for the lions
A long, long time ago
You left me there dying
But you'll never let me go

[Chorus]
You'll always know the reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know the reason why this love
Reason why this love
Ain't gonna let you go

[Bridge]
You'll always know the reason why
The song you heard
Will stay on your mind
It ain't gonna let you go, no
'Cause you were the moon
And I the endless sky

[Chorus]
You'll always know the reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know the reason why this love
Reason why this love
Ain't gonna let you go
Ain't gonna let you go

[Outro]
You had the keys to the car
You had every star
Every one of them twinkling
Baby what were you twinkling
Baby what were you thinking
We had the moon and the sky above
And I gave you my love

[Verse 1]
I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love

Didn't I tell you
What I believe
Did somebody say that
A love like that won’t last
Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give, baby

I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep crying (I keep crying)
I keep trying for you
There’s nothing like you and I, baby

[Chorus]
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary Love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary Love

[Verse 2]
Didn't I tell you
What I believe
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last
Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give, baby

[Chorus]
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love

[Bridge]
Keep trying for you
Keep crying for you
Keep flying for you
Keep flying and I'm falling
And I'm falling

[Outro]
I gave you all the love I have
I gave you everything
All, I couldn't love you more
All, I couldn’t give you more
Oh no, not if I tried
Don’t you know, baby
Don't you know, baby, I couldn’t love you more
Couldn't love you more, no no
Couldn't love you more, more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn’t love you more
Oh, more than I do right now
More than I do right now

[Verse 1]
You think I'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
You think I’d leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I’ll tell you you're right when you want
Hah hah, hah, ah ah, ah oh
And if only you could see into me

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me

[Verse 2]
When you're on the outside, baby, and you can`t get in
I will show you you're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone and you can’t get back again
I will find you, darling, and I will bring you home

[Bridge]
And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time
You’ll be fine

[Verse 3]
You think I'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
You think I’d leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you’re right when you want
Hah hah, hah, ah ah, ah oh
And if only you could see into me

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
(To me, yeah)
Oh when you're low
I'll be there
By your side, baby
(By your side, baby)

Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
(To me, yeah)
Oh when you're low
I'll be there
By your side, baby

[Outro]
I will always be by your side
Remember, I will always be there by your side
Always by your side
Always

[Outro dialogue]
Thank you so much

I'm going to talk about the troops now

Now, this man, if he spent as much time practicing his bass as he does dressing up, then we'd be up there with one of the leading bands in the world. It's probably better we're not 'cause we got him, and if you're lucky and you stick around, you may see the last living cowboy who still likes to wear bondage and a skirt, yes. You know I wouldn't lie to you. His name is Paul Spencer Denman

And this guy, he's been with us for a long time, this tall, handsome man. He could sing like a bird. He sang at my wedding, in fact. He sang "A Song for You." And my marriage didn't last, but thankfully, this one did. This is Leroy Osbourne

Now this is part man, part rock. He's our mountain. Without him, we're a car with no wheels, yes. He's our heartbeat. Without him, we're flatlined. This is Pete Lewinson

Now this man, if you knew, you probably got a glimpse of it tonight, could charm the birds out of the trees. He's a star who came down to earth so that we could bask in his light. His name is Tony Momrelle

He has lived with the spirit of Michael Caine within him for many years. We've accepted him that way, but he thought for a while he was going to go off and do the remake of Italian Job. He didn't know whether to stay with us. When he knew we were coming here tonight, he decided to stick around and I think he made the right choice. Andrew Hale, he has more magic in his hands than the whole of Disneyland. He's Andrew Hale

Now, me and this man, we've been driving each other crazy for years. We're brother and sister, me and Stu, and without you, Stu, what would we do? Stuart Matthewman

And this man, he is the cream in our Twinkie. He's baby of the bunch and we made him shave his head so that we could look younger. He's Ryan Waters

And here we have the sprinkly hundreds and thousands for the tug of our cape that make us want to come back for the second piece. From West Africa like me, a Ghanaian man, his name ... this is the only living Black man called Karl van den Bossche
And this is us

And thanks to you. You continue to amaze us after all these years and keep us right here where we belong. We continue to be your soldiers of love. Thank you so much

[Verse 1]
You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer
If you were mine
If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go to heaven

[Chorus]
I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
You're ruling the way that I move
You take my air

[Post-Chorus]
You show me how deep love can be

[Verse 2]
You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer

[Chorus]
I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
Won't run away

[Bridge]
You show me how deep love can be
You show me how deep love can be
This is my prayer

[Chorus]
Cherish the day
I won't go astray
Won't be afraid
Won't run away
Won't shy

I cherish the day
Won't go astray
I won't be afraid, no
As long as I'm with you

[Outro]
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
I cherish the day, oh yeah
I cherish the day, yeah
I cherish the day
Cherish the day, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I cherish the day

[Intro]
Got to find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart
Got to find out what I'm meant to do
You're the one who broke my heart

[Verse 1]
When I met you, boy
You were as sweet as cherry pie
That smile in your eye
You were as wild as Friday night

However hard you tried
Change would come and strangle it
It was bound to die

[Verse 2]
You gave me your soul
For at least a day
Listen, boy, there was a time
When I wanted you to stay
You knew the cost
It's you who's gonna pay
I'm stronger now, I loved you then
I ask you anyway

[Chorus]
You were sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night
Sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night

You were the only one, you were the only one
Oh boy, you broke my heart

Sweet as cherry pie
Sweet as cherry pie

I gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Gotta find out what I meant to you

So I ask you anyway

[Outro]
I gotta find out what I meant to you
Gonna find out, gonna find out what I'm meant to do
You tease me
You were the only one

[Intro]
Love is what the word was

[Verse 1]
I saw a picture
How could you be so careless
How could you have done that to us
And I write this letter
I send it all back to you
And every word you said

[Bridge]
In there every word, oh oh oh oh
How could you have done that to us

[Verse 2]
You treated me like a stranger
And all the time I was loving you
All your slick moves
They were once innocent moves
I wanted to look up to you
I really trusted you
And every word you said

[Bridge]
In there every word, oh oh oh oh
How could you have done that to us
(Love is what the word was)
I was loving you like a child, yeah
All the time you were smiling the same smile
I was loving you like a child
I really trusted you
Every word you said
Every word you said
(Love is what the word was)
Every word you said

[Verse 1]
Girl, you are rich even with nothing
And you know tenderness comes from pain
It's amazing how you love
And love is kind and love can give
And get no gain

[Chorus]
It's down a rugged road you've come
Though you had every reason
You didn't come undone
Somehow you made it to the other side
You didn't suffer in vain

[Verse 2]
You forgive those who have trespassed against you
And you know tenderness comes from pain
It's amazing how you love
And love is kind and love can give
And love needs no gain

[Chorus]
It's down a rugged road you've come
Though you had every reason
You didn't come undone
Somehow you made it to the other side
You didn't suffer in vain

[Outro]
You didn't suffer in vain
You know it's only love
That gets you through
It's only love, it's only love
It's only love that gets you through

[Verse 1]
I'm crying everyone’s tears
And there inside our private war
I died the night before
And all of these remnants of joy and disaster
What am I suppose to do

I want to cook you a soup that warms your soul
But nothing would change, nothing would change at all
It's just a day that brings it all about
It's just another day, and nothing’s any good

[Chorus]
The DJ's playing the same song
I have so much to do
I have to carry on
I wonder if this grief will ever let me go
I feel like I am the king of sorrow, yeah
King of sorrow

[Verse 2]
I suppose I could just walk away
Will I disappoint my future if I stay
It's just a day that brings it all about
It's just another day, and nothing's any good

[Chorus]
The DJ's playing the same song
I have so much to do
I have to carry on
I wonder will this grief ever be gone
Will it ever go
I'm the king of sorrow, yeah
King of sorrow

[Verse 3]
I'm crying everyone’s tears
I have already paid for all my future sins
There’s nothing anyone
Can say to take this away
It's just another day, and nothing’s any good

[Outro]
I'm the king of sorrow, yeah
King of sorrow
King of sorrow, oh
King of sorrow, yeah
I'm the king of sorrow
King of sorrow, yeah
King of sorrow, oh
King of sorrow, yeah

[Verse 1]
I am in the wilderness
You are in the music
In the man's car next to me
Somewhere in my sadness
I know I won't fall apart completely

When I need to be rescued
And I need a place to swim
I have a rock to cling to in the storm
When no one can hear me calling
I have you I can sing to

[Pre-Chorus]
And in all this
And in all my life

[Chorus]
You are the lovers rock
The rock that I cling to
You're the one
The one I swim to in a storm
Like a lovers rock

[Verse 2]
I am in the wilderness
You are in the music
In the man's car next to me
Somewhere in my sadness
I know I won't fall apart completely

[Pre-Chorus]
And in all this
And in all my life

[Chorus]
You are the lovers rock
The rock that I cling to
You're the one
The one I swim to in a storm
Like a lovers rock

[Bridge]
When I place to swim
You're my main shelter
And you'll always be there
You're the one, the one I swim to
I know you're always going to catch me
You'll always catch me when I fall, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
You are the lovers rock
The rock that I cling to
(The rock that cling to, yeah, yeah)
You're the one
The one I swim to in a storm
Like a lovers rock

You are the lovers rock
The rock that I cling to
You're the one
The one I swim to in a storm
Like a lovers rock

[Outro]
You'll always catch me when I fall

[Spoken Intro]
This next song is a sketch of a picture on my mind since I was a child
Tonight, I'd like to dedicate it to my mom, in memory of my father, Adebisi Adu
It’s about the struggle he and his peers had to bring us to where we are today

Coming from where he did
He was turned away from every door like Joseph
To even the toughest among us
That would be too much

He didn't know what it was to be Black
'Til they gave him his change
But didn’t want to touch his hand
To even the toughest among us
That would be too much

Isn't it just enough
How hard it is to live
How hard it is to live
Isn't it hard enough
Just to make it through a day
The secret of their fear and their suspicion
Standing there looking like an angel
In his brown shoes, his short suit
His white shirt and his cuffs a little frayed

Coming from where he did
He was such a dignified child
To even the toughest among us
That would be too much

Isn't it just enough
How hard it is to live
How hard it is to live
Isn't it hard enough
Just to make it through a day
Just to make it through a day

Coming from where he did
He was turned away from every door like Joseph
To even the toughest among us
That would be too much

He didn't know what it was to be Black
'Til they gave him his change
But didn't want to touch his hand
To even the toughest among us
That would be too much

[Intro]
I have never been more ready in my entire life to do this right now
Never
It's all been leading up to this moment
All right now, right here, know'm'sayin'
My whole life, right here

[Verse 1]
We got rhyme selections in a wide array
J'ai des bonbons pour vous manger
The party people scream, "Oui, oui, c'est vrai"
'Cause I got a remote for my bidet

Now A-D-R-O-C-K
I use the microphone like Picasso used clay
Down with Freckles from around the way
Peace to Bambaataa and Jazzy Jay

I rock on the mic from here to Bombay
I give it my best and say come what may
'Cause everybody's got their dues to pay
I'm looking sideways like my man Pele
Gettin' on like Ali bomaye
So fed up with racism today
Time to speak up and not turn away
Make the sun shine when it's cloudy and gray

[Chorus]
Dip dip dive, so socialize
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
If you learn to love, you're in for a surprise
It could be nice to be alive

("Bringin' back that old New York rap")

[Verse 2]
I'm taking doody rhymes to a brand new height
I shine on the mic like UltraBright
Created a monster with these rhymes I write
Goatee metal rap, please say goodnight

Now here's a little something that you might not like
My DJ's name is Mix Master Mike
It's a real pity that you people got to bite
But I could understand because he sounds so nice

Reading you the news 'cause I'm Country Mike
Use a microphone like Shazam uses tights
Try to keep clear of that hate and spite
So I keep my mind still like the still of night
Now, who in the world do you want to fight?
It's against the system, we should unite
Homophobics ain't alright
If you learn to love, then you might love life

[Chorus]
Dip dip dive so-socialize
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
If you learn to love, you're in for a surprise
It could be nice to be alive

[DJ Babu scratch]
("Bringin' back that old New York rap")

[Verse 3]
Now you can shuffle numbers but facts is facts
So many billionaires while so many lack
So before the poor decide to react
Well, come on party people and share up your stacks

Now I'm-a break it down to the brass tacks
Do the Biz Mark dance and the cabbage patch
You try to turn the key but then you broke the latch
Sneak into my files for some rhymes to snatch

I'd like to have a say on the income tax
Don't wanna help build bombs and that's the facts
No money for health care so what's the catch?
The man got you locked with no key to the latch
Mike and Adam have got my back
You bring the mic and we'll bring the raps
Turn on the PA and rock your shack
Don't smoke cheeba, can't stand crack

[Chorus]
Dip dip dive, so-socialize
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes
If you learn to love, you're in for a surprise
It could be nice to be alive

[DJ Babu scratch]
("Bringin' back that old New York rap")

[Verse]
Spent 500 on some Saint Laurent
Walk in the club, like I gotta get this money
Oh, I be just drippin' Balenciaga
It's a puddle, so much money like a puzzle
I remember I was looking like a slave
Working so hard, praying for the days
Police locked me up, you should of seen my face
Gave my lawyer 50k yesterday
I pray to God I beat the case
2019 Daytona, like a race
Niggas on Instagram, but don't say it to my face
I cannot wait, put his body in a lake
I found out all of these niggas was fake
I fucked his baby momma yesterday
His son asking me what's my favorite game
Ain't got time for the Fortnite, I'm running up some M&M's
Whippin' that dope, tryna bring back a 10
Who is Tyga? I ain't never heard of him
Hop in the kitchen, my wrist spin
Young Drako going 10 for 10
Went number one before, I'll do it again
Nominated for a Grammy, I did it
A thousand dollars for Louis Vuitton kicks
I count up the racks, this shit get to my head
Hop in that Lamb, that's an arm and a leg
Count up a check when I hop out the bed
Everyone saying your life's a mistake
I'ma go cop the Audemars Piguet
My diamonds, like Santa on sleigh
Fell in love with the bitch's head
Red on my bandanna, Judge Dredd
Tick-tick-boom, a grenade
They had me locked down in a cage
Had to make bail so they see my face
If I go to hell, shoot Devil in face
I'm sippin' lean, fell in love with the taste
Before I eat his plate, I say my Grace
I'll wipe your nose then tap my face
Kick in a door, with an AK

[Outro]
Dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping
I'm dripping, I'm dripping
Dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping
I'm dripping, I'm dripping
Dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping
I'm dripping, I'm dripping
Dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping
I'm dripping, I'm dripping
Dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping
I'm dripping, I'm dripping
Dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping
I'm dripping, I'm dripping
Dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping
I'm dripping, I'm dripping
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping
I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping
I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping
I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping
I'm dripping, I'm dripping, I'm dripping
You were from the North, I was from the South
We were from opposite places, different towns
But I knew it was good and you knew it was too
So we moved together like a ball and chain
Minds becoming two halves of the same
It was real, and the shadows grew

Cause you've got a secret don't ya babe?

I would've shouted loud and broken through
I would've given it all to belong to you
But there were different plans, different rules
You said "where I'm from there is a lock and key
If you'd be so kind as to follow me
I will show you the way to the rest of my sins"

Cause you've got a secret don't ya babe?
Yeah you, you got a secret don't ya babe?
And I should know
Yeah I should know
Yeah you, you've got a secret don't ya babe?
Yeah you, you got a secret don't ya babe?
And I should know
Yeah I should know
For I'm your secret aren't I babe?
Yeah I'm your secret aren't I babe?
Aren't I babe?

[Intro]
It's a lifestyle, you know
I'm young and I'm rich, I'm a fuckin nigga, ok haha

Ridin' 'round town tryna duck 12
I bought me a brick, then I got a scale
Don't count no money, I weigh it on scale
My boy Rarri put that blue in his hair
I'm ridin' 'round with that bale
Young Draco, nigga, you know I go in

Biggest comeback, 2018
All of my niggas pull up with the beam

Pull on your block and I spray up the scene
Pull up foreign halftime at the Clippers game, man, I want heat
Shout out to my block, Zone 1, Westside, Simpson Road street

[Verse 2: Hammon]
Shoot you out the gym like Stephen (Yes, sir)
Niggas say he havin', he flexin' (That's cap)
Just fucked on your bitch in the west end
Pressure by the bitch, lil' nigga, you stressin' (Hurt)
You famous but broke, where they do that? (Uh-uh)
Coupe real fast like who that?
Kush hit hard, copped a few packs (Uh)
Bitch booty jumpin' like two traps

[Verse 3: Rarri]
I got my diamonds on me, all of my neck is on freeze
You know that I got the key, that's why you rolled up on me (Rolled up on me)
Rollie wrist, I got it on me, in the Rarri when I blow G (Oh)

-Dancin' in circle-

It’s f* hot in Roblox
Look at that costume *points little monster* you are delicious darling
Thank you so much to my beautiful, loyal, amazing fans, you are so filled with talent and joy. I’m so glad all the time…
That’s a very little monster in there *points fan* Hello! I can see you ;)

You know, did anybody get to go to the artr*ve? That was a party
Oh you know, that was my last tour, the artr*ave
And, when I went on tour, I went to my home, which is the first first home I’ve ever had, huh

And I walked around and I said, what am I gonna do now, in this house? Am I gonna write more music?
And I’m gonna go on tour again, ‘cause that’s really what I want to do
And I thought what am I gonna write about? I want so badly to relate to people that haven’t related to me yet, not because I’m
You know, don’t love the fans I have but I think it’s important you know to grab somebody else’s f* hat and try to walk in their sh* for a little while
So I made sure this album, Joanne, that I didn’t just honor the more personal sentiments
I made sure also to honor the h** in my heart
The trap of my spirit
You know one day, I’m gonna have a kid in one arm and a glass of Pxnot Grigio in the other

And as long as I keep dancin’ in circles it’ll feel real good to be lonely. LET’S GO!

[Intro]
Tap down those boots while I. *spin around the circle*
Hands up, lets go ! *waves*
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown

[Verse 1]
I lay around, touch myself to pass the time. *tcuch myself*
I feel down, I wish you were mine
I close my eyes. *spin*
Take a breath and I picture us in a place
I can't recognize, cmon !

[Pre-Chorus]
In the fire I call your name out
*dances*
Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out

[Chorus]
I'm singin': Bcby don't cry, bcby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely
Bcby don't cry, bcby don't cry *remove the clip*
I'm singin': Dancin' in circles, feels good to be lone-ly. *spin*

[Post-Chorus]
*spin*
*dances*
Funk me downtown

[Verse 2]
I fool myself. Hands up !
Swirl around as if I'm someone else
Your hands are mine
I do a trick, pretend that I am you until it clicks
I come alive, come alive

[Pre-Chorus]
In the fire I call your name out
Up all night tryin' to rub the pain out

[Chorus]
I'm singin': Bcby don't cry, bcby don't cry
*point mic*
Bcby don't cry, bcby don't cry
I'm singin': Dancin' in circles, feels good to be, cmon! -ly. *spin around the circle*

[Post-Chorus]
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown!
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown!

[Bridge]
Hurts inside, but not this time. *poses*
All the things that are on my mind
Vanish as I tcuch myself. *waves*
Call out loud for you
Oh, can you hear me singin'?

[Chorus]
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
DANCIN' IN CIRCLES, FEELS GOOD TO BE LONELY !

[Post-Chorus]
*spin around the circle*
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Let's funk downtown!
Tap down those boots while I beat around
Funk me downtown..!

-Angel Down-

[Verse 1]
I confess I am lost
In the age of the social
On our knees, take a test
To be lovin' and grateful

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
But the people just stood around

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Verse 2]
Doesn't everyone belong
In the arms of the sacred?
Why do we pretend we're wrong?
Has our young courage faded?

[Pre-Chorus]
Shots were fired on the street
By the church where we used to meet
Angel down, angel down
Why do people just stand around?

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Bridge]
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

[Chorus]
I'm a believer, it's a trial
Foolish and weaker, oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down
I'm a believer, it's chaos
Where are our leaders? Oh, oh, oh
I'd rather save an angel down

[Outro]
Save that angel
Catch that angel
Save that angel
Catch that angel
Save that angel
Catch that angel
Save that angel
Catch that angel
Catch that angel

-Joanne-

*gets guitar*
*sits*

We’re very honored tonight that my latest album ‘Joanne’ is number 8 in United States. Thank you! :)

And I just want to take a, take a little poll here. Don’t worry about it, it’s not gonna offend me, I just wanna know, how many of you here tonight in the audience don’t know who Joanne is?
Oh. I think many people are a bit lost
But, if you do know who Joanne is, that’s amazing
And for those of you wondering tonight, you might be saying, who’s Joanne? *laughs*
And that person, Joanne, is two things. Number 1, my middle name is Joanne, given to me by my parents
But Joanne, was also the name of my father’s sister who I was named after. She died in 1974 of lupus
This loss of my family, it travelled decades and generations that I thought she would be like an angel, from the dinner table
I thought of her and my parents at night, and I study her, so that I might be able to understand my father
So when I asked of all of you tonight, it’s even the joyest moment that we get to spend all together, knowing I know
And many of you know that there are people all over the world they could never afford to go see a live show like this, you are all so very lucky
And as we got time to ask you, I would ask you to honor your own pain in this moment, and take yourself back to that place where you were blasted and your life was changed so much
So much that you don’t even remember who you were before

For me, that pain has only one name, and it’s Joanne

*whispers* one, two, three
*plays guitar*

Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven’s not ready for you…

Girl, where do you think you’re going, where do you think you’re going, going girl?
Girl, where do you think you’re going! Girl


We both know, things don’t work that way
I promised I, wouldn’t say goodbye, so I grin, and my voice gets thin

Girl, where do you think you’re going?

Honestly I know where you’re going

And I’ll still love you even if I can’t see you anymore. Can’t wait to see you soar

Joanne middle stop speech:
Hello gentlemen
I guess what I’m trying to say is I was trying to figure out myself a little better, and, instead of just staring at myself
I tried to figure out my dad, and my mom, and their pain. And it led me right back home

*sits*
*whispers* one, two, three

*plays guitar*

Girl, where do you think you’re going, where do you think you’re going, going girl!
Girl, where do you think you’re going, where do you think you’re going, going, gi-oh-rl!

Call me Joanne

Xo Joanne

XoXo all our pain, makes us this way, it made me who I am

Joanne

Pussy niggas say they want me, tell them to come get me
Don't count up money, I literally get it
I skrrt through the city, extended the Glizzy
That 30, that automatic, backwards semi
Ooh, Stacks on Deck, murder
This right here Red Rum, I called this shit murder
Who him cause I ain't never heard of him
Hop in a orange McLaren, watch You Drako skrrt

[?] and bullets, I'm feeling like Percy
Hop out the whip, I'm doing them dirty
Pull up and shoot, like Kyrie Iriving
I don't give a fuck about the cash
I see your bank account, and I laugh
Add it up, pussy nigga do the math
Hundred K for a show, God damn
I'm getting money for real
I was rich way before the deal
Pop a nigga like a pill
Young Drako, nigga I'm worth 30 mil
It's Zone 1 

[?], my nigga we having it
They tried to hit me with the RICO in traffic, and
Young Drako drip, I don't dress off a mannequin
Shoot with the Draco, it came from Afghanistan
Your bitch, she suck on my dick, she my biggest fan
I got fishes, see the pack in the mufuckin' minivan
Put that stick on your partner then we killin' him
Young Drako numb to this fuck shit, nigga I feelin' him
Young Drako gettin' cash, money, and dividends
Rich Gang, young nigga, I been the man
Pyrex pot whip my 360 like 

[?]

[?] in my mansion, need a helicopter man
Slide back on your block with that chopper
Yeah I'm sippin' on lean like I came from the doctor man
My chopper start singin' like it's in a Oprah man
My diamonds be wetter than mufuckin' Aquaman
Pull up on the block with a Draco, it choppin' him
Drako not a door, so nigga stop knockin' him
Reach for my chain then you know that I'm poppin' him
I jump in the McLaren, ain't a thing stoppin' him
Walk in that trap house, them bricks, I'm coppin' them
Come to the Soulja Mansion and go take a swim
I remember Dill Avenue, gettin' it in
Ran from police with Tonio, my best friend
Extended Glizzy, 30, and a FNN
Hit him with Draco, he won't see again
Jump in Bugatti, I'm gone in the wind
Cop me a Rollie and whip up my bitch a new Benz
She don't let me hit, then I'm fuckin' her friends
I'm pouring up juice and I'm pouring out Gin
Diss me in a song, but he won't do that again
Up on they block, 360, watch me spin

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1]
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

[Verse 2]
Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there

[Verse 3]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

[Bridge]
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me (Mmmm...)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, oh-oh-oh yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Oh, yeah)
It's like a dream to me

[Breakdown]
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah (Come on)
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah (Come on)
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah
Yeah, yeah, y-y-yeah

[Chorus]
Just like a prayer

Just like a prayer
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there, there, there
You know I'll take you...
You know I'll take you there, there, there
You, you, you
You know I'll take you there

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 2]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Verse 3]
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 4]
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees, so please

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself

[Outro]
Express himself hey hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself hey hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how

Express yourself

[Intro]
Cherish, cherish

[Verse 1]
So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny
I can't let go, baby, can't you see?
Cupid, please take your aim at me

[Chorus]
Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would
Cherish, cherish

[Verse 2]
I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need
For two hearts that bleed with burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

[Chorus]
Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would

[Bridge]
Who? You! Can't get away, I won't let you
Who? You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love
You're givin' it
You're givin' it to me boy
Keep giving me all-all-all your joy
Give me faith
I will always cherish you
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view
Who? You! Can't get away I won't let you
Who? You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus into Fade]
Cherish the thought (Give me faith, give me joy, my boy I will always cherish you)
Cherish the joy (Give me faith, give me joy, my boy I will always cherish you)
Cherish your strength (You're givin' it, you're givin' it to me boy, keep giving me all your joy)
Perish the thought (You're givin' it to me boy)
(Keep giving me all your joy)
Cherish the thought (Give me faith, give me joy, my boy I will always cherish you)
Cherish the joy (Give me faith, give me joy, my boy I will always cherish you)

[Verse 1]
It's funny that way
You can get used to the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

[Verse 2]
Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh father, I have sinned

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

[Bridge]
Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?
Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?

[Verse 3]
Maybe someday
When I look back, I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too

[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself

[Intro]
Keep, keep it together
Keep, keep it together

Keep, keep, keep, keep it together
Keep, keep it together
Keep, keep, keep, keep it together
Keep, keep it together
Keep, keep it together
Keep, keep it together
Keep, keep, keep, keep it together

[Verse 1]
I got brothers
I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Gonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of sharing all the hand-me-downs
To get attention, I must always be the clown
I wanna be different, I wanna be on my own
But Daddy said, 'Listen, you will always have a home"

[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

[Verse 2]
I hit the big time, but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger
City life can get to you
People can be so cold
Never want to turn your back
Just giving to get something, always wanting something back

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

[Chorus]
Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

[Bridge]
When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
Because blood is thicker than any other circumstance

[Pre-Chorus]
When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

[Bridge]
When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
Because blood is thicker than any other circumstance

[Breakdown]
Keep it together

One, two
One, two, three
Hit it

Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever

Keep people together forever and ever
Keep, keep it together
Keep people together forever and ever

[Verse 1]
Pay for your kiss, your kiss is useless
Nobody home, nobody home
Your eyes are open, I know you're fakin'
Where'd I go wrong? Where'd I go wrong?
You gave me hope, the sex was flawless
I know you know, I know you know
And just like that, you shut me out
What was that about?

[Pre-Chorus]
You gave me the runaround, run 'round, runaround baby
Took me in, then shut me out
Locked out (Locked out), oh why?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna break down the door
I don't wanna break down the door
You gave me the key to your heart
So why'd you have to change the locks?
I don't wanna break down the door
I don't wanna beg anymore
You gave me the key to your heart
So why'd you have to change the locks?
Change the locks
Change the locks

[Verse 2]
So tired of truth, was it ever true love?
I need to know, I need to know
Out in the cold, but you don't give two fucks
Girl, you don't

[Pre-Chorus]
You gave me the runaround, run 'round, runaround baby
Took me in, then shut me out
Locked out (Locked out), oh why?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna break down the door
I don't wanna break down the door
You gave me the key to your heart
So why'd you have to change the locks?
I don't wanna break down the door
I don't wanna beg anymore
You gave me the key to your heart
So why'd you have to change the locks?
Why you gotta do that to me?
Change the locks
Why you gotta do that to me?

[Bridge]
I wanna know; will you tell me somethin'?
I wanna know why you left me nothing
I'm at your door, you see me struggling
I tried every key, but none of them are working
I wanna know; will you tell me somethin'?
(Tell me somethin') I wanna know why you left me nothing
I'm at your door, you see me struggling
I tried every key, but none of them are working
(Working, none of them are working)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna break down the door
I don't wanna break down the door (Break down the door)
You gave me the key to your heart (You gave me)
So why'd you have to change the locks?
I don't wanna break down the door
I don't wanna beg anymore
You gave me the key to your heart
So why'd you have to change the locks?
(Why'd you have to change the locks?)
Why'd you have to change the locks?
Change the locks
Change the locks
Change the locks
Change the locks

[Outro]
Why you gotta do that to me?

[Verse 1]
You cannot touch me enough
You cannot kiss me enough
You cannot tease me, you cannot please me
You cannot leave me heartless
Talking is overrated
Especially when you get naked
I think I lucked up, you might get cuffed up
Your sex has been my favorite

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm blown away
By your...
And what that mouth do
Every single breath I take is for you
Damn, your body mental
So baby, let's get physical
Oh, let's get physical

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
Let's get physical
Oh
Get physical
Oh

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you gotta feel it out
To figure it out
Sometimes you gotta touch to know it's real
So baby
Baby, let's click up, click up
You might see your phone screen lit up, lit up
That's me on the hotline
Pick up, pick up, I'mma tell you to come over
'Cause...

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm blown away
By your...
And what that mouth do (

[?])
Every single breath I take (I take) is for you
Damn, your body mental
So baby, let's get physical
Oh, oh, oh, oh, let's get physical
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Sometimes you gotta feel it out
To figure it out
Sometimes you gotta touch to know it's real
(I wanna touch it so I know it's real)
And if you let your body parts do the talking
Ooh, that's wanna know how you really feel

[Chorus / Outro]
So baby, let's get physical
Oh, oh, oh, oh, let's get physical
Oh, oh, oh, oh, let's get physical
Let's get physical
Let's get physical
Get physical
Let's get physical
Let's get physical
I've been out of, touch
Baby, let me love in
'Cause I've been out of touch
Friction is my drug of choice, just can't get enough of

Touchin' your...
Got the alarm on a timer
Don't you dare keep me waiting (Waiting)
Uh, I'm getting lost in the 

[?]
Don't let me run out of patience (Patience)
When you doin' that, doin' that that
I lose patience
When you suck in that fat, swear that's all I need
You keep provin that, provin that fact that I need you back
Don't you know, don't you know?

I've been out of, touch
Baby, let me love in
'Cause I've been out of touch
Friction is my drug of choice, just can't get enough of
Touchin' your... touch
Got the alarm on a timer
Baby, let me love in
'Cause I've been out of touch
Friction is my drug of choice, just can't get enough of
Touchin' your...
No slippin' through my fingers when we touch
Touchin' your...
No slippin' through my fingers, turn up, Tina
Tina
Turn up, Tina

You were here just this morning
But i feels like forever (Ever)
Uh, yeah, since I had you performing
No one else could compare to (Compare to)

When you doin' that, doin' that that
I lose patience
When you suck in that fat, swear that's all I need
You keep provin' that, provin' that fact that I need you back
Don't you know, don't you know?

I've been out of, touch
Baby, let me love in
'Cause I've been out of touch
Friction is my drug of choice, just can't get enough of
Touchin' your... touch
Baby, let me love in
Cause I've been out of touch

Tina
Turn up, Tina

[Verse]
Has it really been that long?
Did I count the days wrong?
Did we just go 'round and 'round
All the way to step one?

[Pre-Chorus]
They would ask me all the time
Every time the show's up
"So what you doin' with your life?"
It ain't givin' up

[Chorus]
Just growin' up in stages
(Lay down, low down)
Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
And still, my days are shapeless

[Post-Chorus]
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone

[Bridge]
I'm just laying here
Waiting for a change to come
Take us to the place
Takin' us where we would have gone

[Pre-Chorus]
They would ask me all the time
Showin' up in ages
"So what you doin' with your life?"
Call it givin' up

[Chorus]
I'm just growin' up in stages
(Lay down, low down)
Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
And still, my ways are aimless, I know
We're growin' up in stages
And I'm runnin' out of patience
Growin' up

[Outro]
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone

[Chorus]
Baby, I'ma beat the sun home, beat the sun home
Beat the sun home, beat the sun home
Beat the sun home, beat the sun home
Wanna keep you waiting, baby, be patient

You a bad bitch,

[Verse 2]
Call me home late, but you cool with it
It’s a dinner date, but you're cool with it
When I get home, I act a fool in it, baby, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be comin', I’ll be comin', I'll be comin' onto you

[Chorus]
Baby, I'ma beat the sun home, beat the sun home

Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

[Verse 2]
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse 3]
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Bridge]
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Fuck all that, bitch
You can't have mine
(Verse 1)
We signed up for the long run
Love is a race and a marathon
If our hearts beat at the same pace
We'll be there till we're both gone
(Oh yeah)

(Chorus)
All I need is you
All you need is me
All we need is us
Right now, now, now
Even if the world was ending tomorrow, oh
All we need is us, right now, now, now

Forever's a long time
But you get every minute that I got (Oh)
No one deserves all of mine
We will be here till the clock stops

All you need is me
All we need is us
Right now, now, now

He cuts 'em off

[Chorus]
My boy

Don't love me like he promised

He just sounds like he's tryna be his father
My boy's an ugly crier
But he's such a pretty liar
And by that I mean he said he'd "change"

[Chorus]
My boy
My boy
My boy
Don't love me like he promised

I was ridin' in the Rove', the one with no lid, a half a mill' (Half a mill')
Designer her kicks, she wants to wear Prada (Designer)
She said she got white paint on her toes (Woo)
Peepin' they face, niggas been mad since before (Since before)
Yeah, in a Continental with your ho, nigga (In a Continental)
I just bought a rental, fuck the incidental
Put it in her liver, she just like my pickle
Knew since I was little not to talk to pillars (Skrr)
Made the news one week, it took off like a missile (Skrr skrr)
Quietly peel your top off, potatoes (Skrr skrr)
We got now, we got next, nigga (Skrr skrr)
Can I live in a skyscraper? (Skrr skrr)
I got mills and I'm not gon' cake her (Skrr skrr)
I got seals and I'm scared to break 'em

[Outro: Young Thug]
Most of these niggas they played out
Most of these bitches is played out
Peepin' they faces, they mad 'cause my cake up
Living in the Matrix
All of my rings, all of my shades, all my baguettes
Play for the cases, niggas really be on your head
The racks on your head, they might catch you caking
We traveling daily and I got hoes in every place
We serving out a basement, with camera surveillance
Pouring up Laker, and rocking the latest
Each time you break my heart
Each time you break my heart
I know how it feels to be the talk of the town
I'm not gonna let you go and run around
I need to know that you’ll be true to me
Cause that's the way it's got to be
Why can’t you give your promise to me
Is love so blind that you cannot see
I'm trying hard not to walk out the door
Know that I, oh, know that I can't take no more
Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you anyway
And if you're so sure that I'm not your kind
How come you can't just walk away
In the beginning we were nothing but glad
Those were the best days that we ever had
There’s no compassion, all your warmth is gone
Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on
Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
I see the look in your eyes
I know you’re hurting inside
Let me try
To make you love me again
I'll say that I knew you when
You were mine
You were mine
Each time, oh, yeah
In the beginning we were nothing but glad
Those were the best days that we ever had
There’s no compassion, all your warmth is gone
Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on
I see the look in your eyes
I know you're hurting inside
Let me try
To make you love me again
I'll say that I knew you when
You were mine
You were mine
Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
Each time you break my heart again
Well I can say I knew you when (each time)
You were mine
I try to put my pride aside
(Each time you break my heart)
Each time you break my heart
Each time you break my heart
I know how it feels to be the talk of the town
I'm not gonna let you go and run around
I need to know that you'll be true to me
Cause that's the way it's got to be
Why can't you give your promise to me
Is love so blind that you cannot see
I'm trying hard not to walk out the door
Know that I, oh, know that I can't take no more
Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you anyway
And if you're so sure that I'm not your kind
How come you can't just walk away
In the beginning we were nothing but glad
Those were the best days that we ever had
There's no compassion, all your warmth is gone
Tell me how, oh, how can I keep holding on
Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
I see the look in your eyes
I know you're hurting inside
Let me try
To make you love me again
I'll say that I knew you when
You were mine

Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
Each time you break my heart again
Well I can say I knew you when (each time)
You were mine
I try to put my pride aside
(Each time you break my heart)

[Intro]
Big eyes, better to see you wit
Better to eat you up
Better to ease your mind
Better not treat your own bad
Bet I unload my nine
Bet I unload my clip
Bet I unload the dime

[Verse 1]
Still feel it even if you don't say it
Kingpins wishing on the death of a player
I got real niggas over me, I swear (Big eyes)
You playing (Better to see you wit)
You tried it (Better to eat you up, better to feed your bullshit)
I show you how I move and get down (Better not see you, I-)
And you sure you had me figured out
But you had it wrong
You should’ve stuck to the script
And I'm tried of being sweet
I'm tired of being sweet

[Chorus]
So, baby, brace yourself
It could be worse
You could be dead right now
Instead of later
I know you hurting
Baby, brace yourself
It could be worse
You could be dead right now
Instead of later
It’s now or never
(Baby, ooh)
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh (Ooh), Ooh, Ooh
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh (Ooh), Ooh, Ooh
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh

[Verse 2]
Big eyes, they better to see you wit
Better to feel you wit
Better to know your vibe
Better unload your clip
Better not waste your time
Better not change your mind
Better control your drip
Niggas be stealing yo shine
Niggas be all on yo tip
Niggas be all on yo dime
I got bigger plans, on my old dude
Need a man? No, no
These bitches outta hand, no, no
Watch how I tumble and flipping it back
Watching yo nigga keep doubling back
I could make it look good, never looking back
Watch how I tumble and dip on yo ass

[Verse 3]
Green pass, get a pass first time
Never 'gain, get a new one first
Green Jeep to the mm, mmm
And I rode that till the sun came
Got Kauai on my mind
Can't go back till the summertime
Till I think about you, you
Fire back, fire back, fire back, get him
High right now and I still feel like I'm dying
Don't know what I'm to do about the way I feel
You got me tripping out the palm of your hand

[Chorus]
Brace yourself
It could be worse
You could be dead right now
Instead of later
I know you hurting
Baby, brace yourself
It could be worse
You could be dead right now
Instead of later
It's now or never
(Baby, ooh)
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh (Ooh), Ooh, Ooh
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh (Ooh), Ooh, Ooh
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh

[Verse 1]
I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There, all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved

[Chorus]
When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
Move me, baby
Nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
I know it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're S. Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequence
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

[Instrumental]

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
It's a motherfuckin’ vibe right here, boy
Dead for real
Mm, yup, yup
Ha-ha, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Ayy, ayy
Wow!

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Tell 'em we rich now
Tell him I might fuck his bitch now
Might cop a coupe with a shift now
Finally got money to order my food and pay tips now
Might as well fuck with the crips now
But I still fuck with the big B's
You can catch hot shells, like hot cakes all day like it’s Mikey D's
Use to ride 'round on them 22's, walkin' around in them 23's
Bro get that stack and I turn a 10 to a 20, I call that shit double G's
I done bought Gucci's last 5 seasons
I hit your bitch at the four seasons
Niggas find every reason as to why they not where they should be in life, dawg
I rock a wedding ring on my marriage finger, but I can’t have a wife, dawg
Still with a tribe on a quest, tryna get it, yeah, R.I.P. Phife Dawg
Still switching lanes with the gang, lights blinkin’
Doin' dash in the white frog

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Yeah, I done made millions on millions
Stack through the ceiling, ride dirty, Chamillion’
Can't go back broke, 'cause I wanna have children
Took the whole gang, put 'em in one pavilion
Back on my shit, so it’s fuck how you feelin'
Nigga don't fuck with me, like I'm a villain
But I ain't do no wrong, I just be chillin'

[Post-Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I think they mad cause this car drips ice down, damn, this just the rich life
I think they mad cause they wife might get sliced
If it's only a boring night
I'm a young nigga, worth a lot of money, walkin' with a pole, fuck a fist fight
I think I was born with a seventh sense, I think my newest bitch heaven sent

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Yeah, yeah, bitch I'm best friends with the mailman
Drop off a pack at my doorstep
Walk in your spot, get the floor swept
Shoutout them folks who had overslept, didn't fuck with me till they knew I could help
Now I'm walkin' 'round with them big knots
Big Bentley B's and them droptops
Big booty bitches in crop tops
Eatin' up dick 'till they teeth rot
Fuck clubbing, I'm at the main spot
Them niggas, they in the same spot
I had to clear up my mental, huh
Rolex time in the central, VVS in my dentals
Hella cars, it's essential, hey
I'm droppin' 30 like Devin Booker
Snatch up yo bitch because she's a looker
Bitch, I'm the wave like a bag of Ruffles
Not with the internet scuffle
My bitch say she want a bigger ass
I told her gon' head and pump it up
Now that's an everyday struggle, fuck
Yeaah, I'm getting tired of these frenemies
Cuttin' off all of the fake niggas
Lately, I ain't like your energy
I be better off by myself, oh well, yes

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Yeah, I done made millions on millions
Stack through the ceiling, ride dirty, Chamillion'
Can't go back broke, 'cause I wanna have children
Took the whole gang, put 'em in one pavilion
Back on my shit, so it's fuck how you feelin'
Nigga don't fuck with me, like I'm a villain
But I ain't do no wrong, I just be chillin'

[Post-Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I think they mad cause this car drips ice down, damn, this just the rich life
I think they mad cause they wife might get sliced
If it's only a boring night
I'm a young nigga, worth a lot of money, walkin' with a pole, fuck a fist fight
I think I was born with a seventh sense, I think my newest bitch heaven sent

Mr. Worldwide
Akon

[Chorus: Akon]
Don't let too many fall for you
Because you just may fall too
You will get stuck in the middle
So can’t have your cake and eat too
Can't have too many lovers
Can't have too many lovers
Can’t have too many lovers
Can't have too many lovers
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I got too too many to count
Too too little, too too late
Too too tried to change me, somebody save me (Amen)
Maybe I don't wanna be saved
Go to Atlantic if you wanna be brave
They ain't from Miami, they just wanna be, wanna be dating (305)
Dubai, New Deli, Punta, Calcutta, India, Akon, Pitbull love it
Mami got a badonkadonk in the trunk, but she come with luggage
Rubbish

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
A lot of women, I don't like it, I love it
If you don't like it, shove it (Haha)
A lot of women, I don't like it, I love it
If you don't like it, shove it (Dale)

Don’t let too many fall for you

[Drop]
Lyrics from snippet:

[Intro]
Songbook, baby

[Verse]
Somebody call the doctor, please
'Cause she got me on my knees (Yeah)
I fell right away, babe (Oh-oh-oh)
Man, I swear that thing so deep
I probably wouldn't stand a chance in your wave
Ayy, ayy (Oh-oh-oh)
'Cause you know I need that

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Just like bums, we used to stay in the slums of LA by the way
Gang-bangers killin' each other for rep, sellin' rock cocaine on my doorstep
Had a ball to bounce, bike to ride, but my mama never would let me play outside
But when I got enrolled in elementary school, started bangin' like a fuckin' fool
So cool, throwin' up gang signs to the gangster beat, shot an enemy from across the street
Mama came home, said she got a good job. Daddy did too. Now they don't squab
Financially, we improvin'. 2 months later, son, we movin'
No more duckin' from shotgun shells. Bought a two-story house in East Palmdale
(give it to me now.)

[Chorus]
Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(Check it out, check it out, check it out.)

[Verse 2]
No more rats and no more roaches, livin' next door to football coaches
Now I got a new place to sell me crack. Now I got little white kids to jack
I stopped wearin' blue, wasn't trippin' on red. Too busy squabbin' with the skinheads
Stupid questions, distract the class. Rubbin' little girls all on the ass
I didn't really care if I passed or failed, figured I was headed for the NFL
Until the playoff game, shoulder got hurt. I thought about my future, layin' in the dirt
I can't jump, I can't flinch. Superstar player, ridin' the bench
Graduate from school? Don't make me laugh. I got an F+ in basic math
(give it to me now.)

[Chorus]
Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(Check it out, check it out, check it out.)

[Verse 3]
I knew I couldn't make it in the corporate world, so I bought me some khakis and a Geri curl
I knew I couldn't make it to the NFL, went to East Palmdale and started slingin' yayo
For sure! I was makin' crazy dough. Should've dropped outta school a long time ago
Bought a cell phone, like a nut. Now I deliver like Pizza Hut
I drunk whisky and Bacardi. I sold weed to anybody
Me and my homies sold dubs and dimes, took turns bustin' rhymes just to pass the time
Police drove up to my spot. Asked, "Hey, homeboy, what you got?"
I put a fat rock inside his hand. About 25 sheriffs jumped out the van

[Chorus]
Palmdale, (Hell, yeah) come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
(check it out, check it out, check it out.)

[Verse 4]
Now I got a fucked up life. Five bad kids and a naggin' wife
Dead end job at the airport. Check too short to pay the house note
Turn on the TV, then I see different homeboys that went to school with me
Playin' in the NFL. We used to kick back in East Palmdale
Rodney Williams. Lorenz Tate. Zeno plays for Colorado State
I wish my homeboys much success, but at the same time, I still get depressed
Walkin' through the wind with a cup full of gin thinkin' 'bout things that could've, would've, should've been
I wipe my tears, sip my beers, wish good luck to my peers from

[Chorus]
Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began
Palmdale, come back to me
I need you and I love you, baby
Palmdale, come back to me
Cause that's where my heartache began, heartache began

[Interlude]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, all the Palmdale Falcons, past and present. All the little ones I don't even know, you know what I'm sayin'. Everybody, wherever you're at, aye, aye, aye, aye

[Refrain]
Yo, let me get a Palm (Palm!)
Yo, let me get a Dale (Dale!)
Yo, what do we sell? (YELL!)
Yo, where we fittin' to go? (We fittin' to go back to jail!)
Yo, let me get a Palm (Palm!)
Yo, let me get a Dale (Dale!)
Yo, what do we sell? (YELL!)
Yo, where we fittin' to go? (We fittin' to go back to jail!)

[Intro]
Hey sugar how you doing huh?
Your pretty face don't match that nasty attitude
What you mean where my girl?
Probably with your man
Can we fuck?

[Chorus]
She won't let me fuck (babyyyyy)
I really need to bust a nut (ohhhhhh)
She won't let me fuck (honeyyyy)
I really need to bust a nut (ohhhhhh)

[Verse 1]
It's so flustrating, yeah, being a man
All these sexy women don't understand
Things we need to do yeah
Every other day or two
Like take you home baby yeah
And make sweet love to you
But you you won't let me fuck

[Chorus]
She won't let me fuck (You say the mood ain't right uh)
I really need to bust a nut (I know that pussy's tight)
She won't let me fuck (oh give it to me baby)
I really need to bust a nut (ohhhhh)

[Verse 2]
Her heart is still broken, her emotions are sore
She's trying to recover from the man before
Her ex boyfriend, he probably can't see
That it was easy for him, but, uh, he made it hard for me
Cause she she won't let me fuck

[Chorus]
She won't let me fuck (oh give it to me baby)
I really need to bust a nut (you know just what I need yeah)
She won't let me fuck (girl you eating all my food
Girl drinking all my beer)
I really need to bust a nut (you're smoking all my weed yeah)

[Verse 3]
You rub your ass against me on the disco floor
I asked you for your number and you said hell no
You always hang around me, everyday
Different women wanna kick it, but you scare them away
Now I get up offended when you come around
Cause I'm tired of my organs, going up and down
That sucks, cause she won't let me fuck

[Chorus]
She won't let me fuck (oh give it to me baby)
I really need to bust a nut (don't play with my head again)
She won't let me fuck (let me hit it baby
Yeah let me hit it baby)
I really need to bust a nut (are you a lesbian?)

[Bridge]
Oh let me lick it baby
Yeah let me stick it honey
I'll give you my money
Girl you can have it all
Go ahead and have a ball
If you want you can take em both, baby

[Verse 4]
In the year 2000, I see thousand
Of pretty young women I found arousin
Grocery store shoppin, magazine browsin
Many different ways to keep their hair styles in
Full of boredom, I walk toward em
Get em close to me, cause I'm suppose to be
Male aggressor, female impresser
Say the right things possibly undress her
But that's the post game
This is still the pre game
Silly woman, she game
Baby what's your name?
Even though I'm a freak
I play it off like a college geek
Crack a smile and politely speak
With intellect to the women I select
Hoping that she don't detect
My egotistical chauvinistical lust
I thrust till I scream like Mystikal
YAAAAAAHHHH!
The wrong message I hope I'm not sendin
Laughin and pretendin my dick's not extendin
Can't be over zealous she might discover
She's walking away, BITCH!, blew my cover

[Chorus]
She won't let me fuck (you know I love it)
I really need to bust a nut (please don't change the subject)
She won't let me fuck (we could've fucked all night long)
I really need to bust a nut (but you telephone number is bone)
She won't let me fuck (girl you got a lot to give)
I really need to bust a nut (you dress so provocative yeah)
She won't let me fuck (I can see your lingerie from real far away)
I really need to bust a nut (bitch! you must think I'm gay)

[Outro]
Aw don't make me beg
Baby let me rub your leg
Don't make me cry
Look into my eyes
Girl you so damn pretty
Stop acting so sadiddy
Let me rub some oil on your ti hahaha
Yo I'm up outta here she don't want to fuck cuz
Smoke a blunt
I love to smoke a blunt man
Hey man you know, my white homies ask me
Do you like uh, bongs or blunts?
I tell ‘em blunts, cause i get pulled over all the time
I can’t be throwin’ bongs out the window, you know what i mean

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Then let it go

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Then let it go

I love smoking weed all by myself
Dont have to pass it to no one else
I hit my blunt
Anytime i want
Got so much weed i dont have to hunt
I dont get hyper
I dont get crunk
I do get high
I do get drunk

Once im high and im high no doubt
I grab my ashtray and put my cigar out
Once my high is gone with the wind
I grab my lighter then i flick then i again

Briefly take a chronic break
Weed headache
Big mistake
Im high so i put my blunt down
Turn up my music and dance all around

I can’t hear the door
I never leave home ‘less
Its time to school

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Now let it go
Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Now let it go

I remember when i started smokin weed
Pickin' out the stems and the seeds
I didn’t have enough to buy me a beer
My homeboy told me to hit this here(?)

I grabbed the blunt
I took a hit
I thought to myself
“i like this shit”
It’s better than beer
So annalyze this
I don’t have to go take a piss

I don’t know how to roll
But the people i roll with
Know how to roll blunts like a pole

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke

Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Now let it go

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hahahah
Hold a smoke, uh

Drivin' cross country though minnesota
State fuckin' trooper straight pulled me over
He said i was drivin' fast as hell
He took a deep breath and asked “what’s that smell?”
I knew i was busted, at this point
So i handed him a beautiful, perfectly rolled joint

He looked at it once
He looked at it twice
He told me, “you roll your joints real nice”

Afroman don’t give a fuck
Light that blunt and get stupid stuff
Smokin' to me is so much fun
People bitch cause i don’t get nothin' done

If you are a little kid
Please don’t do the things i did
Anti-drug message? let me see..
Don’t smoke weed
Give it to me!

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Now let it go

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Now let it go

Smoke a blunt
Nice and slow
Hold the smoke
Now let it go

[Intro:]
HEY NIGGA, HEY WASSUP MA NIGGA
HEY NIGGA, NIGGA, NIGGA, NIGGA, NIGGA, NIGGA
Hey man, dont call me that...
WELL, WHAT DO YA WANT ME TO CALL YOU??

[Chorus]
Call me something good, dont call me the n-word
Call me your brother, yeah
Call me something good, dont call me the n-word
Call me your brother, yeah

[Verse 1]
Afroman, North-ader
Today's topic is the n-word
The n-word is traced to the Latin word "niger" which now we know is Spanish word "negro"
The Southern, misspronociation occured
And that was the birth of the n-word
By the 1800s, it was firmly established, into a provacatory name
Humilation and shame, and it remains, a principle term
For racism lower than an earth worm
No matter who's using it, who's abusing it
If you knew the trick, you would be losin' it
The American, auto, police suss
Racial slurs for all ethnic groups
The n-word, hate and mistrust
Rape, humilation, total disgust

[Chorus]
Call me something good, dont call me the n-word
Call me your brother, yeah
Call me something good, dont call me the n-word
Call me your brother, yeah

[Verse 2]
The n-word, English facts
Sarcastic acts, ridiculing blacks
A term of exclusion, player-hater
A verbal reason for descrimination
Whether an adjective, verb or noun
It's meant to put black people down
Non black people, believed the heist
And it reinforces, stereotypes
Worthless, dirty, stupid, lazy
What's you called me? You crazy
A black man performed the first heart surgery
And the n-word is not the racial slur for me
The most extensive word, the most intensive word
The most expensive word, the most offensive word
The dark skin, of an African
Offended the eyeballs of the Englishman

[Chorus]
Call me something good, dont call me the n-word
Call me your brother, yeah
Call me something good, dont call me the n-word
Call me your brother, yeah

[Verse 3]
Plantation owners, used to eat food
Make black men fight, like a pitbull
Ya seen that movie "Django"?
That's how black men had to tangle
Black were taught, to hate each other
Instead of your master, kill your brothers
Sell mama, sell papa, sell the baby like a turd
The first thing the baby heard was the n-word
The slave owner, was the parency
And he taught self-hate apperantly
He taught black folks, how to hate black folks
To use the n-word in "yo mama" and black jokes
It's so absurd, some people prefer to be greeted by the n-word
I'm the black that dissagrees, don't say the n-word to me
Thank you

[Chorus]
Call me something good, dont call me the n-word
Call me your brother, yeah
Call me something good, dont call me the n-word
Call me your brother, yeah

[Intro: Afroman]

[Verse 8]
Well my name is Afroman and I'm from east Palmdale

So all of you skins (skins) please give me more head

[Verse 9]

[Intro]
Yeah, la-da-da-da-da-da, baby

[Chorus]
Said colt 45 and two zigzags baby that's all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale
Skatin' on Dayton rims
So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville
If my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet marijuana will

[Verse 1]
Well it was just sundown in small white town
They call it East Side Palmdale
When the Afroman walked through the white land
Houses went up for sale
Well I was standing on the corner sellin' rap cds
When I met a little girl named Jan
I let her ride in my Caddy
Because I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan
We fucked on the bed, fucked on the floor
Fucked so long I grew a fuckin' afro
Then I fucked to the left, fucked to the right
She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white
Thought to myself sheeba-sheeba
Got my ass lookin' like a zebra
I put on my clothes and I was on my way
Until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet
And so I ran I jumped out the back window
But her daddy he was waitin' with a two-by-four
Oh, he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right
The motherfucker whooped my ass all night
But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad
That's the best damn pussy I ever had
Got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine
I'm gonna fuck that bitch just one more time

[Chorus]
Said colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale
Skatin' on Dayton rims
So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville
If my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet marijuana will

[Verse 2]
I met this lady in Hollywood
She had green hair but damn she looked good
I took her to my house because she was fine
But she whooped out a dick that was bigger than mine
I met this lady from Japan
Never made love with an African
I fucked her once, I fucked her twice
I ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya (tell ya)
I met a woman in the heart of Australia
Had a big butt and big titties too
So I hopped in her ass like Kangaroo
See I met this woman from Hawaii
Stuck it in her ass and she said "AIEE"
Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch
Then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch
I met Colonel Sanders wife in the state of Kentucky
She said I'd fry some chicken if you'd just fuck me
I came in her mouth, it was a crisis
I gave her my secret blend of Herbs' n' Spices

[Chorus]
Said colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong

[Verse 3]
I met Dolly Parton in Tennessee
Her titties were filled with Hennessy
That country music drove me crazy
But I rode that ass and said, "Yes, Miss Daisy"
Met this lady in Oklahoma
Put that pussy in a coma
Met this lady in Michigan
I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again
Met a real black girl down in South Carolina
Fucked her until she turned into a white albino
Fucked this hooker in Iowa
I fucked her on credit, so I owe her
Fucked this girl down in Georgia
Came in her mouth, man I thought I told ya
Met this beautiful sexy ho
She just ran across the border of Mexico
Fine young thing said her name's Maria
I wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla
I wanna get married but I can't afford it
I know I'm'a cry when she get deported

[Chorus]
Said colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale
Skatin' on Dayton rims
So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville
If my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet marijuana will

[Bridge]
When I say "Afro", you say "Man"
Afro, Afro
When I say "Afro", you say "Man"
Afro, Afro
When I say "Smoke some", you say "Weed"
Smoke some, Smoke some
When I say "Smoke some", you say "Weed"
Smoke some, Smoke some

[Interlude]
Aye, y'all make some noise right about now
La-da-da-da-da-da
I wanna thank y'all for playin' this song over the years, you know what I'm sayin'?
Let me bust this last verse right quick, I'ma take y'all away, man, check me out, you don't stop

[Verse 4]
Have you ever went over a girl's house to fuck
But the pussy just ain't no good
I mean you gettin' upset because you can't get her wet
You in the wrong neighborhood
So you try to play it off and eat the pussy
But it take her so long to cum
Then a dude walk in, her big boyfriend
And he asks you where you from
So you wipe your mouth and you try to explain
You start talking real fast
But he already mad cause you fucking his woman
So he start beating on you ass, check
Now your clothes all muddy
Your nose all bloody
Your dick was hard but now it's soft
You thought you had a girl to rock your world
And you still gotta go jack off

[Chorus]
Said colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need
We can go to the park, after dark
Smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems
Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale
Skatin' on Dayton rims
So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville
If my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet marijuana will

[Outro]
Man, man
Man, man

[Verse]
'Twas the night before Christmas, nothin' but drama
I got in a fight with my baby mama
She yelled, "Fuck you," and she opened the door, threw something shiny and lathery out in the six feet snow
I got out my car and I started the sneeze, then I realized it was a Raider jacket with all three Super Bowls on the sleeves
I got so happy when I pulled that new jacket out the ditch, I ran back in the house and fucked the shit out of that bitch
Ahhhhhhhhhhh shit! shit! shit!
Now I'm walkin down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yellin at these hoochies and I'm lookin for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta doe, slap the hoe
Get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'
Afroman likes tall cans
Now I'm a afroholic, call me Afroman
Love to sag my khakis with a tall can
My homies pop the forty of some St. I's
Now that mother uh! staggerin from side to side
We the loudest homeboys in my neighborhood
We look real bad but we feel so good
My thirst is quenched but my cravin won't extinguish
I need some forty ounce mother uh! Old English
Put the top in my mouth put the bottom to the ceilin
Drink it down down until I get that crazy feelin
Now just walkin down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yellin at these hoochies and I'm lookin for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta doe, slap the hoe
Get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'
See these girls be actin all bad and rude
Always gotta bad attitude
See I just want to dance, why can't you get the picture
Act like a brother want to move in with cha
I gots no fame, I gots no wealth
So I whined up dancin by my God damn self
But I pay my money, just like you
And baby I'ma do what I came to do
You see I can't wait around till I get rich
Just to make yo gold diggin attitude switch
So I'm walkin down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yellin at these hoochies and I'm lookin for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta doe, slap the hoe
Get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'
I stepped into this party full of Mexicans
I didn't realize I was the only black man
One hand on my bottle, the other on my peter
I barked like a dog and started freakin senoritas
I think she was embarrassed with the eight ball in my cup
She kept on steppin back so I kept on steppin up
This vaco strolled up, put his gun to my head
I knew if I moved I was officially dead
That had to be his woman, I know it doggonit
That ain't the first time that I got confronted
{say something in Spanish} get the fuck outta here
I said I'm gone mother fucker, now gimme my beer
Cause I'm just walkin down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yellin at these hoochies and I'm lookin for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta doe, slap the hoe
Get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'
HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO

(Wait a minute, man. Hey, check this out, tell it
It was this blind man, right?
Man, check this out- it was this blind man, right?
He was feelin' his way down the street with this stick, right?
Hey, he walked past this fish market, you know what I’m sayin'?
He stopped, he took a deep breath, he said
Woo, good morning, ladies

You like that shit, man?
Hey, man, I got a gang of that shit, man
I tell you what- my man on the guitar, fool on the drums
Everybody just crowd around the mic

[Chorus]
I got Bentley in the driveway
On fire, like a fireplace
Get the fuck up out of my way
Get the fuck up out of my face
You ain't getting no cash, then we cannot talk today
I need this shit everyday, call the Plug up ándale (Aye, Aye)

[Verse 1]
If you getting no money then you better shut the fuck up
I pulled out a Draco, you know I bust
Then you get hit, out of luck
Nigga, in my gun what I trust
Nigga, you know that I'ma go up
If you tell me that this shit up
Pullin' on the block, then you know I bust
Who Rich Gang getting money like us?
I put 200 bricks in a truck
I took off and you know that it's up
If it's up, then you know it stuck
Big ass chopper that'll leave him broke
Big ass chopper that'll leave him poor
Put him on the block, I'll slit his throat
Two-three bullets, they on a boat
Young Drako I whip, you know
I be clean, I'm fresh like coke
I be clean and fresh like soap
I be clean and fresh like who?
I be clean and fresh like who?
All my diamonds they be new, all my hundreds they be blue
But I swear to God, wish they was red
I put money on your head
My Lamborghini, an arm and leg
Boy, you heard what the fuck I said
I'll shoot your ass until you dead
I'll shoot your ass until you dead

[Chorus]
I got Bentley in the driveway
On fire, like a fireplace
Get the fuck up out of my way
Get the fuck up out of my face
You ain't getting no cash, then we cannot talk today
I need this shit everyday, call the Plug up ándale (Aye, Aye)

[Verse 2]
You know what's up
Them bullets, they gon' bust
In my gun what I trust
And if he say it's up, then you knowing that it stuck there
I be everywhere, and he ain't never there
I be everywhere, my diamonds cold like February
Niggas up, they fake
These niggas play games like Solitaire
Got diamonds in some solitaires
Got baguettes and they in my ear
Got baguettes, big ol' Bs
Make the wrong move, I'll squeeze
Put him on the block with the heat
I'm hot, one million degrees
Bust down Rollie, my sleeve
These niggas be lame, and weird
And, I don't need to know
But I know, you try me, it's gon hit the store
Whippin' dope on a boat
Whippin' dope, clean like soap
Sell a link, fake read
Went off, hit a lick
I just came back from a trip, in the kitchen I water whip
Boy, you better not squeal, 

[?]

[Chorus]
I got Bentley in the driveway

Got bricks up in the driveway
On fire, like a fireplace
I had this shit my way, ain't enough cash
Fuck up out of my face, fuck up out of my way
No we can't talk today

[Verse]
Please get out the fucking way
My brother told me that he can't get it any other way
I'ma need a bunch of space
We crunchin' numbers for the day on gang shit
Under gray clouds every summer it ain't rainin'
We don't take crumbs from off the loaf
Hoe you gon' pay me what you owe me
Niggas lying under oath in their arraignment
Flea shit, niggas not flee, you got fleas
Bitch, you mangy, labeled
Motions only, we don't go the same speed
Shoot ya shot, it start to take a toll
That never grazed me, play your role
We got the juice and all the pulp
We scooped your main squeeze
Chubby and I'm dangly
Run me up the totems off his waist
The rattle snakes
You niggas shakin' in ya socks
Operation get atonement
It ain't safe to say you made it
We gon' make it like P and Jada, praises to The Lox
Nothing sacred but the codes
But we crack em like the locks
Give me flowers while I'm breathing
Then parade me when I'm pushin' daisies
Cookin baby, maybe I could try
Mood fluctuating like the changes in the tides
God unresponsive-

[Intro]
I feel it, it's coming

[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Verse 1]
When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it's real
Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
Till I feel your

[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Verse 2]
When you looked into my eyes
And you said goodbye could you see my tears
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
Till I feel your

[Chorus 1]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Bridge]
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say, never go away

[Spoken Interlude]

Waiting is the hardest thing	It's strange
I tell myself that if I believe in you	I feel like I've known you before
In the dream of you	And I want to understand you
With all my heart and all my soul	More and more and more
That by sheer force of will	When I'm with you
I will raise you from the ground	I feel like a magical child
And without a sound, you'll appear	Everything strange
And surrender to me, to love	Everything wild

[Bridge]
Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing

[Intro]
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Verse 1]
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there
And my mama made me learn this song
You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you
That's why

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
The deeper I go

[Verse 2]
All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there
And my mama made me learn this song
You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you
That's why

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Bridge]
Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there
And my mama made me learn this song
You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you
That's why

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Outro]
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
I can't help falling in love
And you know it
So I show it
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
I can't keep from falling in love with you

I don't wanna keep the bright flame
Of your ego going
So I'll just stop blowing in the wind
To love you is a sin
Adios

[Verse 1]
Sitting on a park bench
Thinking about a friend of mine
He was only twenty-three
Gone before he had his time
It came without a warning
Didn't want his friends to see him cry
He knew the day was dawning
And I didn't have a chance to say goodbye

[Chorus]
In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
Because now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?
What for?

[Verse 2]
Driving down the boulevard
Thinking about a man I knew
He was like a father to me
Nothing in the world that he wouldn't do
Taught me to respect myself
Said that we're all made of flesh and blood
Why should he be treated differently?
Shouldn't matter who you choose to love

[Chorus]
In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
Because now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

[Bridge]
People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn in this case
Ignorance is not bliss

[Chorus]
In this life I loved you most of all
What for?
Because now you're gone and I have to ask myself
What for?

[Bridge]
People pass by and I wonder who's next
Who determines, who knows best
Is there a lesson I'm supposed to learn in this case
Ignorance is not bliss

[Verse 3]
Have you ever watched your best friend die (What for)
Have you ever watched a grown man cry (What for)
Some say that life isn't fair (What for)
I say that people just don't care (What for)
They'd rather turn the other way (What for)
And wait for this thing to go away (What for)
Why do we have to pretend (What for)
Some day I pray it will end

[Outro]
I hope it's in this life
I hope it's in this life time

[Verse 1]
Something's missing and I don't know why
I always feel the need to hide my feelings from you
Is it me or you that I'm afraid of?
I tell myself I'll show you what I'm made of
Can't bring myself to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart, I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do
I don't wanna feel blue

[Chorus]
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way
Bad girl drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy
I'm not happy

[Verse 2]
Something's missing and I don't know why
I always feel the need to hide my feelings from you
Is it me or you that I'm afraid of?

Can't bring myself to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart I know we've come apart

[Intro]
Goodbye to innocence
Anonymity (sic)
Peace of mind
Goodbye to all of us
Hello mankind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Goodbye to innocence
Always and forever
Stop think about it (x2)

[Chorus]
You know you better stop
Stop and think about how you get your kicks
I know I didn't ask for it

You know you better stop, stop and think about me
Before you mess with someone else
Why don't u pay attention to yourself

[Verse 1]
There are some who believe that I owe them something
But theyâre wrong, I owe nothing to no one but myself

And there are some who say they created me
But only my parents will have that acclaim
I took it from there, I am to blame

Stop and think about how you get your kicks
I know I didn't ask for it

You know you better stop, stop and think about me
Before you mess with someone else
Why don't u pay attention to yourself

[Verse 2]
My life is not a game that I play to entertain you
And if you could do it better then you're welcome to my fame
I'm not gonna spend my time correcting myths and rumors
You believe what u wanna believe, and I'll pray to keep my sense of humor

[Chorus]
Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

[Verse 1]
You think you're so smart
You try to manipulate me
You try to humiliate with your words
You think you're so chic
You write me beautiful letters
You think you're so much better than me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

[Chorus]
Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

[Verse 2]
You think you're so shrewd
You try to bring me low
You try to gain control with your words

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

[Chorus]
Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

[Bridge]
Friends they tried to warn me about you
He has good manners, he's so romantic
But he'll only make you blue
How can I explain to them
How could they know
I'm in love with your words
Your words

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You think you're so sly
I caught you at your game
You will not bring me shame with your words

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But your actions speak louder than words
And they're only words, unless they're true
Your actions speak louder than promises
You're inclined to make and inclined to break

[Chorus]
Words, they cut like a knife
Cut into my life
I don't want to hear your words
They always attack
Please take them all back
If they're yours I don't want anymore

[Verse 3]
Too much blinding light
Your touch, I've grown tired of your words
Words, words
A linguistic form that can meaningfully be spoken in isolation
Conversation, expression, a promise, a sigh
In short, a lie
A message from heaven, a signal from hell
I give you my word I'll never tell
Language that is used in anger
Personal feelings signaling danger
A brief remark, an utterance, information
Don't mince words, don't be evasive
Speak your mind, be persuasive
A pledge, a commitment, communication, words

My name is Dita, I'll be your mistress tonight
I’d like to put you in a trance

[Verse 1]
If I take you from behind, push myself into your mind
When you least expect it, will you try and reject it?
If I'm in charge, and I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild, let my mouth go where it wants to?

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it up, do as I say, give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I’ll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to
I'd like to put you in a trance, all over

You are who you are
(And I) Wouldn't want to change a thing
(In spite of) All the pain that love can bring

You send me

Inside me you take me
You thrill me

Is this gonna go on forever and ever?
Somebody end this dance lesson
There were some cute ideas there

[Intro]
Breathe in, breathe out
I say a little prayer
How the gods above
Could be so unfair

[Verse 1]
I'm not so good when I'm alone
I don't like what I see
I never measure up
To what the world would like to think of me

[Chorus]
I know there's someone out there
Waiting for me
There just has to be, has to be

[Verse 2]
Go on, go on
Don't sit there like a fool
You've graduated from
A different kind of school

[Verse 3]
I should be glad that I'm alive
It could have been much worse
I might have never loved at all
And never known what I am worth

[Chorus]
I know there's someone out there
Waiting for me
There just has to be
There must be someone out there
Waiting for me
There just has to be
Has to be

[Verse 1]
I, I can't lie, I’m scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothin' at all, nothin’ at all?
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doin' nothin' at all, watchin' it fall?

[Pre-Chorus]
The flicker burning, you know the time is runnin', running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
’Cause staying silent’s the same as dyin'
I won’t stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
It's a new life

[Verse 2]
Real fantasy, wishin' it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doin’ nothin' at all, watchin' it fall?

[Pre-Chorus]
The flicker burning, you know the time is runnin', running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dyin'
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight

Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily around me

Yeah, it's a new life

[Verse 1]
This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

[Chorus]
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
At Skyfall

[Verse 2]
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

[Chorus]
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall

[Bridge]
Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

[Chorus]
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At Skyfall

[Verse 1]
I've ran away for miles
It's gettin' hard for me to breathe
'Cause the man that I've been runnin' from is inside of me
I tell him keep it quiet
So hardly does he speak
'Cause he wants to keep his distance
But it's hard for him to leave
He knows I hear him cryin'
Cryin' out for help
I don't know how to save him
I can't even save myself
There's many people dyin'
I've always been afraid
Not that I'm scared of livin'
I'm scared of feeling pain

[Chorus]
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections

[Verse 2]
I've been so used to winnin'
It was hard for me to lose
No, there's nothing wrong with me
There's just something wrong with you
So I've been making changes
Been workin' on my health
No more competition
Can't compete against myself, no, no, no
I'm not doin' this to be loved, no, no
I've been doin' this to be remembered
Let the people hear it if they want to
Help the one's around me get it on, too
If I die tomorrow and I'm gone
Let the blood run high
Let the carpets drown
I'll be forever now

[Chorus]
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
Look, bitch, please don't act like my friend, be my friend
My mama said, "Don't act like a man, be a man
Quit going overboard," I think it's finally sinkin' in
KeY Wane on the beat, you know that be my favorite BPM
Hol' up, fuck me over once, you never seein' me again
Fuck me over twice, then I'm the last thing you see
Never thought I'd be investin' in restaurants with Hov
And see my movie theater in downtown Detroit opening doors
Dawg, I see niggas get buried in suits that never wore suits
That shit can get deep as my Nigerian roots
And I need therapy too, someone that cares for me too
Someone who there for me to the point
When they not there, it still feel like they there for me too
My zone is not a comfort zone, you can't compare me to you
That's mastermind advice, livin' a life that's overpriced
Lookin' like I sold my soul, bought it back, then I sold it twice
No, it's just years in the makin'
Love makin' is the only thing happenin' overnight
Look, dawg, I been meditating on top of the mountain
So many lies spread about me, no point in respondin'
I realized that some stars live way above the comets
Million dollar deals on my iPhone, signature in the–

But y'all done made me have to get in my bag
Oh Lord (I'm single)
Ooooh (and I'm ready to mingle), yep
Yahh

[Verse 1: Usher]
There it is, there it go
Fall in love with these women I barely know
Ten stacks on the flo'
Time to re-up, tell 'em I need a hundred more
You at the bar, pouring it up
You try to wife it up, I already tore it up
Up in V-I see how I keep it B-I
Like a paper trail, shout out to my nigga T.I
Yahh, so wavvy
When I say (Usher baby), all the girls go crazy (so wavy)
Even your own lady
(Wait a minute)
That's your old lady
Y'all still pushing Benzes
Helicopter copper take me where my friends is
My taste is so expensive
When I'm up in Vegas I'm staying with Steven Wynn is
Now that's a table full of winners
Don't jock just knock before you enter
I hop my cars right, you see them fog lights
And ain't no fall guy, ball like a dog, right

[Chorus: Usher]
And it's simple elementary (yah)
Just say pimping when you mention me
She want it I got it
She got what I want
In Houston they boppers
Miami, they shones
I can give it to you simply (yah)
My pimping don't come with sympathy, hah
She want it I got it
I got what she want
Whatever you call it I'm taking it home

[Verse 2: Usher]
There he is, there he go
Globe trotter, Mr. Internationa-a-al
I'm the coolest, huh, the Fonz
Court side holl'ing out plays to LeBron
Ask Shaq what he need man
Made a call, now we got him up in Cleveland
Yeah, take a flight in the evening
Be back in the morning, it must be the G man
And they hate when I brag
But I'm so fly, got permanent jet lag
Yeah, if you want it just ask
Red card, this is not a bus pass
And I'm tearing up my mojo
Getting mail everyday no homo
I blind 'em, they can't see me
Doing numbers like AC/DC
Industry's in a recession
But I'm still spending from Confessions, yeah
Homie that's why I ain't stressing
These youngin's really need to learn a lesson
Can't doubt me (no), you won't out me (no)
Wouldn't even have a style without me (uh huh)
Yah, I can see behind the smiles
Wasn't rocking with me then don't be jocking me now

[Chorus: Usher]
And it's simple elementary (yah)
Just say pimping when you mention me
She want it I got it
She got what I want
In Houston they boppers
Miami, they shones
I can give it to you simply (yah)
My pimping don't come with sympathy, hah
She want it I got it
I got what she want
Whatever you call it I'm taking it home

[Break: Usher]
Oh Lord
Oooh, yep

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I'm a Bankhead gladiator with a side tighting
This ice in my chain'll make the whole room lighten
Breitling catch your chick's eye like lightening
Over half a million dollars in diamonds for your excitement
Every other day there's a T.I sighting
I pass by flying higher than gas prices
I'm the nicest, my life is like uncle Luke interlude
Group of broads nude in the room while I'm getting chewed
Picture three chicks bumping Lollipop Remix
Say they can't believe this
Solid like cement, she went down
And she came up, now I... then we change up
Didn't drop one drop got everything up
Like Clinton... to be become famous
We can become the best of friends, or remain strangers
Pay attention and I'll show you how to do your thing bruh, aye

[Chorus: Usher]
Oooh, and it's simple elementary (yah)
Just say pimping when you mention me
She want it I got it
She got what I want
In Houston they boppers
Miami, they shones
I can give it to you simply (yah)
My pimping don't come with sympathy, hah
She want it I got it
I got what she want
Whatever you call it I'm taking it home

[Outro: Usher]
Shout out to my my T.I...
Shout out to my my T.I...

[Verse 1]
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, I just got clean rap
I don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An' the pen is like a lighter
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me

[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[Verse 2]
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy

[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[Outro]
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down

[Intro: Nick Jonas]
I'm feeling so cool
From top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Well, dammit, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
I'm feelin' high like a late night summer of last year (Yeah)
Standin' there with the red dress on ya
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me or am I just havin' a good year?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]

Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool

Dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Must've done something right 'cause all these
Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees
And every time that song comes on it's about me
Oh, I feel like Post Malone when I get home
Sittin' there, winning like it's Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (Two)
'Cause dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
When I grow up, I wanna be just like me

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (Two)
'Cause dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Verse]
You niggas clowns like Ringham and Brothers

[Outro]
As a matter of fact, don’t even give them that man. Young Vibe, give them that other exclusive shit in, ha

[Spoken Interlude: Meek Mill, Young Vibe]
Yeah, y'all know who the fuck it is

It's our city nigga

[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
It's Meek motherfucking Milly, uh
BH, all my bitches (all my bitches)
You know I had to get one for the hoes (hoes)
Haha

[Chorus]
I said hoes, we never love them
We fuck them and then discuss them
And if you ain't fucking my man, you prolly fucking my cousin
There's nothing, how do we want it

[Verse]
Um, um amazing
Better yet a buffet
You can get all three
But I don't get her number, I tell her to call me
Phone rings she with her friends and they want to party
I tell her meet me, hotel room 13
I be there in a little
Man he little, I sizzle
Step up in the telly, hoes naked already
Looking all sexy, screaming daddy come get it
The dream gods tell me twice, I be right in it
Shorty wetter than a pool, I dive up in it like I'm swimming (splash)
Knocking bitches off, daddy this ain't nothing new
I'm Shaggy baby, would you let my dawgs Scooby Doo
She said that's crazy but I tell her this is what we do
Expect the unexpected, you seen the movie too
Rolling through the block (uh)
Benjis on rock (uh)
Bad bitch on my back, at the twelve o'clock
T-5 barking on them
PT5 tour ass on them
Cops come, double clutch, fist tell that corner on them
Ride hard, fly it off like a Maserati
Getting low when I'm rolling, she gon' ride, she my Bonnie
My mommy, little hottie
Vanilla Ice, check out her eyes and her body
My little right thing
Bitches be on my dick cuz they know I be on some shit
Like if you ain't fucking or sucking, don't even jump in the whip
She ride, tell her jump in (come on)
She ain't tell her to holler
Sliding in that Impala
Grinding, chopping on choppers
Still M.O.B., mommy's don't get a dollar
I'm trying to fuck you for free, if you tricking don't even bother
I'm a P.I.M.P., naked bitches in the 'scala
Put a blue and white Yankees shirt, striped polo with the collar (free)
But everybody know my name
Meek Milly, flow is flames
Plus I got that fire man, Puff just called me Lil Wayne
And I got a little game
Hoes feeling a nigga's swag
Tryna fuck and suck me just to get their niggas mad
See this, I just sit and laugh
You don't want to wife that
You eating her and treating her, see I'm the one who piped that
Soon as I'm finished with her, you can have her right back
If I get a piece of pie, my man gonna slice that
Breakdown, take down, shorty keep your mouth shut
This is what we do, 102, we ain't about that
I don't give a fuck, I leave you stuck like a mousetrap
Middle of the city, tell your rubber to get with me, nigga
Bitch

[Intro]
Hey, the funkmaster flex is coming
I told myself I'd say that
Hey, hey look

[Verse 1: Ice Cream beat]
Wake up, cuz gotta get your cake up
Its falling from trees like leaves
I'm bout to rake up
Man if you ain't hungry than thats just
More bread for me to bake up
Man if you ain't hungry man I'm trynna
Get my cake up
Look at the time, how could you think
Your shit is sicker than mine
Ask your homie as your girl ask your
Nigga then rhyme
This is andre mixed with Kanye mixed with Jigga then Nas
Couldn't name a bug with a buzz bigger than mine
Man I'm damn new homeless how Im picking up dimes
But nevermind that, look how I'm bringing these clever lines back
Nigga you whack, shoulda fired whoever signed that
Cole introduced you to death, you kept in contact
Jealous niggas, how many chances y'all blew?
How many times you been new?
All them advances y'all blew
Now you see me on the rise and throw a tantrum or two
Like "Dog i'm iller than him." Nigga im cancer than you
You barely catching the flu, now who is you?
Dead summer, you bout to tell a couple niggas lose your number
Cause Cole world coming, later for them bench warmers
Bitch I get covers you don't even get covered
No more stunting like kenevil though, I ain't evil even though
The flow is hella hot my pot is steaming for a reason hoe
Hiroshima flow, napalm, used to pray to god that funk flex
Would drop A-Bomb, man
Now he dropping like eight bombs
Anything possible, skinny jeans not a go
Raps go so deep they begin to seem nautical
Grade A, straight A, nigga go check the honor roll
Boy, hey lemme still get
Can I still get it flex?
Hey (On you) Hey (On you on you)
Hey (HOT 97)

[Verse 2]
I got a
Chip on my shoulder the size of a golden nugget
The industry overlooked me for that I'll be holding grudges
Wouldn't take a chance on me suddenly its oh you love it
Lets get a Cole feature, thats gon put you over budget now
Picture being broke without no pot to piss in and
Suddenly your idols is your competition
Used to be like god to me, slowly losing my religion as
These notes from my composition turn to compositions then
Put it out and let the world sing
(Yo hol' up hol' up hol' up)
We had dreams just to make it up the flagpole
Just to find out that your heroes was some assholes, Y'all don't feel me
Man look, hey y'all don't feel me (Lets get another one flex)
Hey y'all don't feel me
(I told you he was gonna do something else, lets get to something else, lets get to something else?)
Yes sir, whatchu got?
Hey, hey, hey, uh, uh (Chuckles)

[Verse 3: Blow tha Whistle beat]
Yeah, hey, New York (Oh my goodness, arrgh! arrgh!)
Hey, man, feast your eyes on a real nigga
Could never say it too much, im a ville nigga, (NICE)
Permission slips, if you wish I could field trip ya
Oh yeah you ill, while I heal, would you gill quicker
Told my brother when I get a little bigger Imma whoop your ass (Ha Ha!)
School of hard knocks, only outings with the class
So just in case a nigga trynna pull a fast one
When it come to these hoes, Im trynna pull a fast one
So when it come to questions she don't even ask none
I don't even remember the name of the last one
Wasn't this easy when a nigga didn't have nothing
Could't catch a break, now a nigga need a
Full body cast, throwing rappers into a body-bag
I do it just for kicks like I'm in karate class
Nigga mind on money stress, like he took pilates class
Cole finna blow with his old snotty, ass (Blow the whistle?)
Blow the whistle! (You know what is is, hot 97 Funk Flex J Cole)
Man blow the whistle (You want another one?)
Man whatever you got man, dog i'm ready for whatever (Let's go let's go let's go)

[Verse 4]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, yeah, man, look ok
Now that I'm blowing up, they money is slowing up
Them older hoes I used to know say "Oh you blowin up?
I remember when you was that tall" Ok now girl I'm this tall
And I'm ballin, I'm Chris Paul, they can't guard, and my whip dog
Look y'all, to my old hoes I miss y'all, how could I ever diss y'all
Hold but never kid yall, uh, I need someone who's gone be my baby
Not someone saying "What have you done for me lately?"
I took you out, I dug you out but oh that ain't enough?
You want my mind, you want my time but that ain't whats up
Time is money I can't afford that now, but girl you got the best range
And a smart ass mouth, So come here (BLOW THA WHISTLE!)
I really mean this, something like a genius
Ass so good, would have thought you made the deans list
Man we got it Flex, thats all they get boy (Ah, just, just curse who cares!)
Ha hah ha ha ha (Just curse who cares!)
Ahhhhhhhh
(Wait a minute, wait a minute)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

[Refrain]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

[Refrain]
Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Post-Chorus]
Figure out where we're goin'

[Interlude]
Can we just talk?
Before we get lost

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Post-Chorus]
Figure out where we're goin'

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

[Outro]
Figure out where we're goin'
Figure out where we're goin'
Talk

[Chorus]
Oh, the world's situation
Should be rated X, rated X
Said, the world's situation
Should be rated X, yeah, rated X
Listen, people

[Verse 1]
Not only in the movie shows
Take a look outside, it's where the truth is really told
It's life in living color
Fighting, killing and dope dealing, it's everywhere

[Chorus]
What about the crime? Rated X
What about the killing, fighting, stealing everywhere?
They let the children see life destroyed
But they won't let them see the making
Oh, what happened to God's creation?

[Verse 2]
The one thing that really bothers me the most
Is how we calmly take the lives of other folk
The world today is in a grave situation
Dirty water we can't drink, dirty air, it's so unfair
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Baby, something is missing all over the world
It's alright, it's okay
You and me, baby, can withstand
All the sin and corruption this land
We got love, we got peace
If we could hold it, spread it all over world

[Chorus]
Oh, then the world's situation
Won't be rated X, rated X
Do you hear me?
When I preach all that I've learned
We'll have happiness and love, it'll be oh, so sweet
And then we jive in the master plan
We can walk together, side by side, hand in hand
Oh, love is still rated X
We all know is hate is all the way rated X

[Bridge]
Where's the love? Where's the peace?
Where's the joy? Where's the hope for us all?
God is watching, He knows where you're at
Yes, he's watching the situation, that's a fact

[Outro]
Oh, the world's situation
Should be rated X, woo
Situation

[Intro]
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me

[Verse]
It's been too much, I've been on the side and I'm waiting
Got a little time, maybe all night, if I'm patient
What's on your mind? I can never read you (I can't)
No, I always leave you crying when we fight, but I don't mean to, yeah
No, no, love don't come easy
Especially when you're loving me, yeah
It's never enough for the both of us, so sorry
Couldn’t have known it would ever be this hard
Ooh, we had it all, but we lost and that's our fault
I should be here waiting for you to answer my calls, no
But I'm never giving up on word, I've been
I've been focusing on putting me first
Still could never see you with somebody else
I can't even live with being by myself
That's the part of me that really needs your help
Lately, I haven't been doing very well
That's the difference between heaven and hell
I feel heaven when you're here with me
I feel hell every time you leave
But I need to get you off of my back
I gotta get you off of my back
We said we would never take it this far
Here we are, going back and forth
I hoped we would never make it this far
But now, I gotta find my worth

[Outro]
Say you don't love me no more, just say you don't want me
(Say you don't want me, yeah)
We don't gotta be no more if you really don't want to
(We don't gotta be no more)
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
(Just say you don't want me, yeah)
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me
We don't gotta be, we don't gotta be, yeah, no more
We don't gotta be no more, no more, no more, no more, no

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
Don’t save me, I'm in no need of saving (Oh yeah)
And if you stay with me, I know you need patience (Yeah, yeah)
Blood and cologne on the fragrance (Mmm, yeah, yeah)
'Cause if ya deal with me, I know you know what pain is (Oh no)

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
And I don't even like to think about it
On my own, but still so crowded
Walls come down and the guards come up
But there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded
Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?
I've been burning rubber on the Michelin
Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck

[Outro]
Yeah (I'm in love with bad luck)
Bad, bad luck

[Verse 1]
Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, I’ve been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place (Mmm, nah)
It’s crowded
In LA, but I’ll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say you’re down, I could show you around
If you’re really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?
What do you say?

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Verse 2]
Saved
Got the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded
But if that's not the vibe, yeah, it’s cool
We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, we’ve been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love
If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Bridge]
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it (So bring it back)
So bring it, so bring it back (So bring it, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it (Yeah)
So bring it, so bring it (Nah)
So bring it, so bring it (Bring it, bring it)
So bring it, so bring it back
So bring it, so bring it (Yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (No no, no, oh yeah)

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right

[Verse 1: Khalid]
I feel like I'm losing you whenever I'm offline
Though I never had you, I used to pretend that you're mine
I feel like there's nothing for me here, but still, I try
I feel like there's nothing for me here, but still, I try
Bruising my finger hitting your line
If I'm holding back, I might just lose my mind (So alone)

[Chorus: Khalid & SAFE]
Keeping my phone alive (Alive)
Hoping that you call this time (Oh, I)
Thought I heard your ringing (You)
You know I hear things sometimes
Call my line, call my line
Come alive, come alive
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Keepin' you on my radar
Lately, you're so damn cold
You used to hold me down
You're far, so it's been a while
I still remember your voice
How you talk so soft in the morning
You're the only one I'm wanting
Love stays still and I'm frozen
But I'm opening thoughts that I keep within
I guess I gotta be a man
I tried as hard as I can

[Chorus: Khalid & SAFE]
Keeping my phone alive (You)
Hoping that you call this time
Thought I heard you ringin'
You know I hear things sometimes
Call my line, call my line
Come alive, come alive
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend (Come alive, oh yeah)
Show me, don't pretend (Yeah, yeah)
Show me, don't pretend

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
You go searching for paradise
You sit back and close your eyes
We're burning, yet so alive
And now you've got your hands up
Hoping you catch the high
Feels like the summer time
Chasing the northern lights, oh
Don't like watching your momma cry
You say you'd rather die
She says you're wasting your life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, life don’t stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin’ himalayan haze
Won’t wash all your sins away

[Chorus]
Hate don’t give
Love don’t rewind all the good times
All the dollars you’ll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Don’t give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends

[Verse 2]
Do you hear me through your speakers
So much distance, space between us
Say you're dreaming and I’ve been, too
And no-one knows what you’ve been through
And I've been thinking a little deeper
Contemplation, getting cleaner
See no leaders, need more teachers
I'm in shambles, I don't sleep much

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, life don’t stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin’ himalayan haze
Won’t wash all your sins away

[Chorus]
Hate don’t give
Love don’t rewind all the good times
All the dollars you’ll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Don’t give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends (Overthink)

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Life is never easy when you need it to be
Try to knock me down, but I get back on my feet
Everybody's angry and they're coming for me (Coming for me)
But I can't give them energy that I won't receive (I won't receive)
So I brush 'em off, I got a lot on my sleeve
Like I'm moving backwards, but it's all on repeat
This place is getting crowded, I got no room to breathe
I hope the only thing I'm losing isn't my memory

[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today

[Verse 2]
Now it's real, take your time, you're almost there
Wherever we’re going, gotta be prepared
We’ll be fine, are you scared? Are you scared?
People keep on talking 'bout what they wanna be
Walking down the line, but they don’t live what they preach (Live what they preach)
Sharing attributes with all our own enemies
You gotta pay to live and even dying ain't free

[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give up)
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
(Yeah, and I won't be waiting on you)
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give up, no no)
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today, yeah

[Bridge]
You gotta take it slow (Alright)
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control (Yeah, mmm)
Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control)
You gotta take it slow (Oh)
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control)
Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control)

[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face

[Outro]
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Its been a hundred, mmm
Hundred, hundred days and I'm still alive
Had a hundred friends, but I cut em off, I don’t need em
Not like any of them gave a fuck if I was breathing
Summer's over so they switching around like the seasons
Gotta keep my guard up, now I'm playing defense
Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me
But I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons
I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons
Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Its been a hundred, mmm
Hundred, hundred days and I'm still alive

[Verse 1]
You just turned 21, so lately, you've been drinking
Wasted on alcohol you chase to fight the feeling
Thinking 'bout letting go, would that be easy for you then? Yeah
So lay with me, lay with me, we're underneath the bleachers
Stay or leave, stay or leave, I hope you're never leaving
All of these memories crawling underneath your skin, skin (Oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're in pain, but who's to blame?
All our lives, it never ends

[Chorus]
Yeah, alright
You gotta hold on tight
Yeah, alright, alright

[Verse 2]
Don't believe everything
The shit you like gives you anxiety, but finally
I see you smiling when you say you need privacy
You're only hiding from yourself, mmm, oh
I say I'm fine, coming home
I see the sun come up and shut the blinds
Episodes, I know I never take my own advice when I'm wrong
But I can't do it by myself, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're in pain, but who's to blame?
All our lives, it never ends

[Chorus]
Yeah, alright (Alright)
You gotta hold on tight
Yeah, alright
You gotta hold on tight

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm in pain, but I'm to blame
To end this fight, I have to change

[Chorus]
Yeah, alright
Hold on tight
Yeah, alright
Hold on tight

[Verse 1]
My ride or die
Let’s burn out tonight
Even if we don’t survive
We were right by being wrong
Don’t look back to the wreck
Stay with me, turn your head
This is it, all that's left
Just some times that we had, oh

[Chorus]
Heaven, make me an offer
Lord, there’s nothing for me left out here
Heaven, if you come over
Oh, I know how to make us disappear

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
And now the way you say
My name sounds like a song
That you've been singing all along
Don’t forget it once I'm gone

[Chorus]
Oh, Heaven (Heaven), make me an offer
Lord, there’s nothing for me left out here (Oh)
Heaven, if you come over
Oh, I know how to make us disappear

[Chorus]
Heaven (Hey), make me an offer (Oh)
Lord, there’s nothing for me left out here (Yeah)
Heaven, if you come over (Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah)
Oh, I know how to make us disappear

[Outro]
Heaven, make me an offer
Lord, there’s nothing for me left out here

[Verse 1]
Taking off, turn off the lights
We're so in denial of breaking up, we make it up
Every time I look in your eyes, I’m back in love

[Pre-Chorus]
I've waited all my life, for someone like you
But I'm losing sight of your point of view

[Chorus]
Are we broken? Lost in emotion
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
Is this the last fight? Lay here one last night
I know we’re both tired, that's our excuse
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?

[Verse 2]
It's no one's fault, that's what they say
You want it your way, you know it all
We said its no one's fault, losing our minds
Lie after lie, fake love

[Pre-Chorus]
We had a hell of a ride
Issues aside, both of us

[Chorus]
Are we broken? Lost in emotion (Lost in the moment)
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
Is this the last fight? Lay here one last night
I know we're both tired, that's our excuse
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?

[Outro]
Are you, mmm, ooh
Are you, oh

[Verse 1]
Unread texts and missed calls
Told everyone I turned my phone off
Didn't ask for help and now I’m lost
Life comes in phases (Phases)
Consequences and mistakes
I'm sorry that it's taken me so long

[Pre-Chorus]
Mister, mister, please let off your power
Give me half an hour, or better yet, a full
Only sweet until it all goes sour
But life is what you make it, and then there’s more to lose

[Chorus]
Gatekeeper, can you show me more to life?
Lately, I've been living out of spite
Grim Reaper, just give me one more night
I need another chance to say goodbye
I shouldn't have to die to feel alive

[Verse 2]
Here's the thing with disappearing
You can yell and no one hears you
Times like this, I need an ear
When I finally have so much to say
Wish I could see your face, oh
And do what I have to stop the tears

[Pre-Chorus]
Sister, sister, please know that I'm sorry
I wish you could've stopped me from falling off the hill
Only sweet until it all goes sour
But life is what you make it until it gets too real

[Chorus]
Gatekeeper, can you show me more to life?
Lately, I've been living out of spite
Grim reaper, just give me one more night
I need another chance to say goodbye
I shouldn't have to die to feel alive

[Verse 1]
We were running onto something
And we didn't say "forever," but it's all we wanted
You were so in love with simple things
And now we're searching for the fire dripped in kerosene
I've been loving more, living less
Off of highs and lows, so obsessed
Couldn't get nothin
But we're never running out

[Chorus]
We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing
When you're free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear it calling?
'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don't let me go

[Verse 2]
Is this Heaven or Armageddon?
I'll be gettin' high with you to watch the endin'
We were drownin' down our memories
A cemetery full of bottles, man, that liquor bleed
When you're loving more, caring less
It's the highs and lows with no regrets, oh
And we wanted it all then
But we're never running out

[Chorus]
We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing
When you're free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear it calling?
'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don't let me go

[Bridge]
So tell me when you're falling
No, I can never doubt your love
Can you hear me calling?
Is it everything you're dreaming of?
Leave it all on the night
As long as you're not leaving me behind
On your heart, your heart, ah

[Outro]
Free spirits, free spirit
Free spirits, free spirit

[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
I'd give anything to see
A little Christmas tree
And to hear, hear the laughter
Of children playing in the snow, ooh-ooh
To kiss my baby under the mistletoe

[Verse 2]
But I can't promise my eyes this sight
Unless they stop the fight
'Cause I'm a prisoner of war
Lying here in my cell
Hoping my family is well
Wish they wouldn't worry so much about me
Just try to get us home
In time for the Christmas tree

[Verse 3]
Listen, oh yeah, ohh, ohh
'Cause I want to see snowflakes fall
I want to see Santa Claus
Oh, I want to hear jingle bells
Want to hear jingle bells ringing
But I can't promise my eyes this sight
Unless they stop the fight

[Verse 4]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
If I can't make it home in time
I know you'll be keeping my spirit bright
By wearing my name and trying to stop this fight
Ah, but I'd give anything to see you, the family
And that little Christmas tree

[Verse 5]
Ooh, I want to see snowflakes fall (See snowflakes fall)
I want to see Santa Claus (Santa Claus)
Oh, I want to hear (Hear) jingle bells ring
Yes, I want to hear jingle bells ringing
Oh, oh, oh, I want to see snowflakes fall
I want to see Santa Claus (Oh)
I want to hear jingle bells ring
I want to hear jingle bells ringing, ringing, oh
I want to see snowflakes fall
I (I, I) want to see Santa Claus (Santa Claus)
Darlin', I wanna hear jingle bells ring
I miss you, babe
I want to hear jingle bells
I miss you darlin', I miss the kids
Oh, I want to see snowflakes fall (Snowflakes fall)
I want to see Santa Claus
I want to hear jingle bells (Oh, I do)
I want to hear jingle bells

[Intro: Tyson Ritter & Timbaland]
'Scuse me. Do you mind if I sit down?
Is it okay if I sit down here?
No? Are you alone?

Git it, git it, git it, girl!
Hey!
(Come on, now!)

[Bridge: Tyson Ritter]
When I look in your face
It's when I lose control
What I see in your eyes
Is what is burning my soul
And I know that it's true
'Cause when you're saying my name
And no, I won't forget you girl
Because I'm saying it again

[Chorus: Tyson Ritter]
I'm in love I'm in love with you
I'm in love I'm in love with you
(Give it all you have) Yeah
I'm in love I'm in love with you
You drive me crazy
I'm in love I'm in love with you
Because I'm in love I'm in love with you
I can't take it
I'm in love I'm in love with you
You know, yeah
I'm in love I'm in love with you
You drive me crazy
I'm in love I'm in love with you
I'm in love
Git it, git it, git it, girl!

[Outro: Tyson Ritter & Timbaland]
Ah, hey!
Git it, git it, git it, girl! Hey!
Come on now!

[Intro]
Look at those beautiful eyes
She reminds me so much of me
Starting out in a brand new world
Who she gonna be?
Will she follow everything that's been said?
Maybe listen to her heart instead
Maybe she needs to be free
She got that from me

[Verse 1]
What you get is what you see
It's a fantasy life, but it's real to me
And I'll do what I want when I want to do it

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't want to live in a box or mansion fault with doors and locks so I never let anyone put me through it

[Chorus]
Need that freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it
Give it up to you
Need that freedom, skin it
Freedom, bop it
Freedom, sell it
Do it all for you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I know pain is as natural as the rain
I just thought it didn't rain in California
Baby, I know love isn't what I thought it was
'Cause I've never known a love like this before ya
Baby, I know dreams tend to crumble at extremes
I just thought our dream would last a little bit longer
There's a time when every man draws a line down in the sand
We're surviving, we're still living, are we stronger?

[Chorus]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life
And all its suffering
Oh Christ
Am I good for nothing?

[Verse 2]
Baby, I know hate is always waiting at the gate
I just thought we locked the gate when we left in the morning
And I was told that war is how we landed on these shores
I just thought the drums of war beat louder warnings

[Chorus]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
And all its suffering (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
Oh Christ (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
Am I good for nothing? (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)

[Verse 3]
Baby, I know death probably hasn't happened yet
'Cause I don't remember living life before this
And darling, our disease is the same one as the trees
Unaware that they've been living in a forest

[Chorus]
You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
And all its suffering (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
Oh Christ (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
Am I good for nothing? (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
This life (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
And all its suffering (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
Oh Christ (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
Am I good for nothing?

[Verse 1]
Baby, I love you, but that's not enough
And pulling away has been unbearably buff
I ran up the mountain, out of your sight
The snow on the peak was just unbearably white

[Verse 2]
The city was freezing, an elegant floe
The wind at the doorway was unbearably cold
You walked to the bedroom and sat down to write
The page in your notebook was unbearably white

[Chorus]
There's an avalanche coming
Don't cover your eyes
It's what you thought that you wanted
It's still a surprise
It's hard on the body
It's hard on the mind
To learn what kept us together, darling
Is what kept us alive

[Verse 3]
Sooner or later, the story gets told
To tell it myself would be unbearably bold
Presented with darkness, we turn to the light
Could've been smart, we're just unbearably bright

[Chorus]
There's an avalanche coming
Don't cover your eyes
It's what you thought that you wanted
It's still a surprise
It's hard on the body
It's hard on the mind
To learn what kept us together, darling
Is what kept us alive

[Bridge]
Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white
Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white
Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white

[Verse 4]
Baby, I love you, but that's not enough
And pulling away has been unbearably buff
I ran up the mountain, out of your sight
The snow on the peak was just unbearably white

[Outro]
Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white
Call it a day, call it a night

[Verse 1]
Tell me what your heart wanna say when you love when you're over me
I just wanna take in your love then you say you're over me
Know I wanna make new love then you say you want all of me
Listen to me
You should love me

[Chorus]
You wanna stay on top, girl
You wanna stay on top
The top spot was you, girl
I know you wanna talk
You don't wanna be over me
You wanna be all over me
I claimed you so openly
I claimed you so openly, yeah

[Verse 2]
And the scars don't hurt no more, mm
You wonder if I'm ready for another
When I say you can't 

[?] more fun, yeah

[Chorus]
You wanna stay on top, girl

I claimed you so openly

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Ah

[Verse 1]
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for something
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?

[Chorus]
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

[Verse 2]
There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.​
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away

[Chorus]
We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday (If you and I get comfortable)
We're on the borderline (On the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time (Then I saw the time)
Watched it speedin' by like a train, like a train

[Refrain]
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
If there's room, room for doubt
As within, as without ya
Will I be so in love?
Any closer? Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun
Here comes the sun

[Verse 3]
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How could I have known?
How was I to know this high came rushing?
I said, "Come with me outside"
I need to clear my mind, this weight is crushing
Do you see the light, oh
Coming from their eyes? Oh no
And I couldn't get away

[Chorus]
We're on the borderline (Ooh)
Gets me every time, these close encounters
Just to know I can (Just to know I can)
Once again, I am alone

[Refrain]
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation, well, I tried (I was fine without ya)
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer? Bad idea
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?

[Verse 1: Ezra Koenig]
I know the reason why you think you gotta leave
Promises of future glory don't make a case for me
I did my best and all the rest is hidden by the clouds
I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now

[Verse 2: Ezra Koenig]
Leaving on your wedding day, all calm and dressed in white
All I'll keep's the memory of one last crooked night
The pews are getting filled up, the organ's playing loud
I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now
Alright

[Chorus: Choir of All Saints]
God, yu tekem laef blong mi
Mi mi givim nao long yu
Mbae mi givim evride
Blong leftemap nem blong yu

[Verse 3: Danielle Haim]
I know the reason why you think I oughta stay
Funny how you're telling me on my wedding day
Crying in those rumpled sheets like someone's 'bout to die
You just watch your mouth when talking 'bout the father of the bride

[Verse 4: Danielle Haim]
Why's your heart grown heavy, boy, when things were feeling light?
Turning this June morning into some dark judgment night
This ain't the end of nothing much, it's just another round
I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now

[Chorus: Choir of All Saints]
God, yu tekem laef blong mi
Mi mi givim nao long yu
Mbae mi givim evride
Blong leftemap nem blong yu

[Outro: Ezra Koenig]
Alright

[Verse 1: Ezra Koenig]
I know I loved you then
I think I love you still
But this prophecy of ours
Has come back dressed to kill
Three stones on a mountain
Three small holes in a field
You've given me the big dream
But you can't make it real

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
O, wicked world
Just think what could have been
Jerusalem, New York, Berlin
All I do is lose, but baby
All I want's to win
Jerusalem, New York, Berlin

[Verse 2: Ezra Koenig]
A hundred years or more
It feels like such a dream
An endless conversation
Since 1917
Now the battery is too hot
It's burning up in its tray
Young marriages are melting
And dying where they lay

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
O, wicked world
Just think what could have been
Jerusalem, New York, Berlin
All I do is lose but baby
All I want's to win
Jerusalem, New York, Berlin

[Verse 3: Ezra Koenig]
Our tongues will fall so still
Our teeth will all decay
A minute feels much longer
With nothing left to say
So let them win the battle
But don't let them restart
That genocidal feeling
That beats in every heart

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
O, wicked world
Just think what could have been
Jerusalem, New York, Berlin
All I do is lose but baby
All I want's to win
Jerusalem, New York, Berlin

[Verse 1: Ezra Koenig]
Something's happening in the country
And the government’s to blame
We got married in a gold rush
And the rush has never felt the same

[Verse 2: Danielle Haim]
Shared a moment in a café
Shared a kiss in pouring rain
We got married in a gold rush
And the sight of gold will always bring me pain

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
I don't wanna hear the rumors, please don't say it loud
I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud
Boy, who’s your baby?
Girl, if you don't know by now
There's two seats on the midnight train
The gold won't weigh us down

[Verse 3: Ezra Koenig, Danielle Haim & Both]
Hanging gardens turned to desert
All that loving turned to hate
We got married in a gold rush
And those wedding bells were ringing out our fate

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig, Danielle Haim & Both]
I don't wanna hear the rumours, please don't say it loud
I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud
Boy, who's your baby?
Girl, if you don't know by now
There’s two seats on the midnight train
The gold won’t weigh us down

[Verse 4: Ezra Koenig, Danielle Haim & Both]
The rush is on to somewhere else, we're running out of time
Everything was ours, now it’s just an empty mine
Animals don't understand the words on the danger sign
For them, it's just some shade from the morning shine
I thought you might learn the language
I thought you might learn to sing
We were born before the gold rush
So why can't I remember anything?
I want to put things back together
I wanna give, don’t wanna take
Time to disavow the gold rush
And the bitterness that's flourished in its wake

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig, Danielle Haim & Both]
I don't wanna hear the rumours, please don't say it loud
Please don't say it loud
I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud
Boy, who's your baby?
Girl, if you don't know by now
There's two seats on the midnight train
The gold won't weigh us down
I don't wanna hear the rumours, please don't say it loud
Please don't say it loud
I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud
Boy, who's your baby?
Girl, if you don't know by now
There's two seats on the midnight train
The gold won't weigh us down

[Verse 1: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
We go together like sound and sight
Black and white, day and night
We go together like left and right
Oh, we go together
We go together like give and take
Pains and aches, real and fakeWe go together, don't be opaque
It's clear we go together

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
We belong together (Can you say what you mean?)
We belong together (Can you mean what you say?)
Baby, there's no use in being clever (Can you mean what you say?)
Baby, it don't mean we'll stay together

[Verse 2: Ezra Koenig, Danielle Haim & Both]
We go together like pots and pans
Surf and sand, bottles and cans
We go together like lions and lambs
Oh, we go together
We go together like Keats and Yeats
Bowls and plates, days and dates
We stay united like these old states
It's how we go together

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig, Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
We belong together
We belong together
Baby, there's no use in being clever
Baby, it don't mean we'll stay together

[Outro: Ezra Koenig]
Hallelujah, you're still mine
All I did was waste your time
If there's not some grand design
How'd this pair of stars align?

[Intro]
That's my man (Man)
Flood my wrist with all type of bands (Bands)
I've been blossomin', all type of strands (Cash)
Can you get your neck and wrist on flood? Yes I can (Blat, blat, ah)

And she just been shoppin' and shit
Damn, I can't do nothin' with Jeezy
And I plan on dyin' like this
I had to Balmain my tweezers
Now they just notice I'm lit
.357 for my mama 'nem
I was one of the ones with Obama 'dem
I play it safe with my commas now
Y'all niggas worse than your mamas now
Ain't had to go to the pulpit
I got to sit with the government
I got a team up at Popeye's
Even at the airport, we mob ties

[Verse 1]
The Cartier frames are flooded
I look at the Bentley Mulsanne with my mama
Lil' shawty, lil' shawty, she bustin'
Lil' shawty gon' fuck her a rich nigga, pants off
Where is the chicken? Go right back to Popeye's, gotta give it to Pedro
Light-skinned bitch with a dark side
But I'll never go fuck up with bae, though

[Refrain]
Turn it up, burn it up (Woo), burn it up, burn it up (Woo)
Burn it up, burn it up (Woo), burn it up, burn it up (Woo)
Burn it up, burn it up (Woo), burn it up, burn it up (Woo)

[Verse 2]
It's way too late, just do it for the sake
It's way too late, still try goin' on that date (Ayy, ayy)
I took the pink one night, now I got the blue diamond in my face (Ba-bing)
I done gave her the keys to the house
Might as well gon' give her the code to the safe
Can't replace him 'cause that's my man (My, my man)
Shit, a hunnid thou', all hunnids in my hand (It's in my hand, yeah, yeah)
Half a million to the chain gang, yeah the can (To the can, shit)
'Nother half a million spread it on my hands (Half a mil', yeah)
Yeah, that's great, but can you catch my slang? (Woo)
All I ever do is buy, I bought her beans
Fast cars get me through the traffic, Sandy Springs
Paul Walker, this year Porsche, got turbo and the wings (2019)
Aw baby, tell me what you wanted, what you seen when you was out (Finesse)
Tell me what you're trippin', what you're trippin' about (Yeah)
You got karats on your toes and your link and your spout (I got karats)
Rose gold mixed with white and you rock cinnamon now (Rose)
I done made you take the diamonds off from Tiffany now (Take them off)
I done told you watch this planet, ain't no sympathy now (No sympathy)
Gucci your neck, fuck boys, they been talkin' 'bout
Spend a Gafford on your ring, now I'm ready to bow now
Baby, let's go, woah, woah, woah

Light it up, light it up, light it up, light it up
(How did all these people get in my room?)

Come fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly away
If you can use some exotic booze there's a bar in far Bombay
Come on fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly away

Come fly with me, we'll float down to Peru
In llama-land there's a one man band and he'll toot his flute for you
Come on fly with me, we'll float down in the blue

Once I get you up there where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry eyed
Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so near
You might hear all the angels cheer because we're together

Weather-wise it's such a lovely day
Just say those words, we'll beat those birds down to Acapulco Bay
It is perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come on fly with me, we'll fly, we'll, we'll fly...

Once I get you up there where the air is so rarefied
We're gonna glide absolutely petrified
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so awfully near
You might even hear a gang of angels cheer just because we're together
Weather-wise it's such a groovy day
You just say that word and I'll beat your bird down to Acapulco Bay
It is perfect for a flying honeymoon they do say
Come on fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly...
Pack up - let's fly away

And don't tell yo papa!
How glad the many millions
Of Annabelle's and Lillian's would be to capture me
But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell
I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never, never know
It's not that I'm attractive
But oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view...

I've got a crush on you, Sweetie Pie
All the day and night time here me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo - could you care?
For a lovely cottage...
(You wanna meet Monday, we pick out the furniture?)
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby on you
Could you coo - (There you go again!) Could you care? (Now wait a minute!)
For a lovely cottage... (Laughs) that we could share
(Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight)
The world will pardon my mush
But I have got a crush, my baby, on you
Oh yeah
I've got you under my skin
I have got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you’re really a part of me
I've got you under my skin

I have tried so not to give in
And I said to myself this affair it never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well
That I've got you under my skin

I’d sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice, comes in the night
It repeats - repeats in my ear
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win
Use your mentality - wake up to reality
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

(Run for cover - run and hide!)
I would sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice, comes in the night
It repeats, how it yells in my ear
Don't you know, you fool, there ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality - wake up-step up to reality
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Because I've got you under my skin
Yeah, you grab me under my skin
The shadow of your smile when you are gone
Will color all my dreams and light the dawn

Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star, it was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips and so so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams

Dreams broken in two
Can be made like new
On the street of dreams

Gold, silver and gold
All you can hold's up there on a moonbeam
For there ain't nobody poor, long as love is sure
On the street of dreams

All the gold, silver and gold
All you can hold's up there on a moonbeam
For nobody's poor, long as love is sure
On the street of dreams

[Verse]
Since you left me, if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute, she’s just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one

[Pre-Chorus]
So take a good look at my face, ooooh
You'll see my smile, yeah
Look a little bit closer and it’s easy, oh
The tracks of my tears

[Chorus]
My smile is my make up I wear since my break up with you
Baby take a good look at my, ooooh
You'll see my smile looks out of, yeah
Just a look closer and it's easy, ooh
The tracks of my tears (baby, baby, baby, baby)
So take a good look at, ooooh
Yeah, you'll see my smile, oooh
Look a little bit closer
I need you, need you

[Instrumenal]
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
It's quarter to three
There's no one in the place 'cept you and me
Set em' up, Joe
I got a little story I think you should know
We're drinkin' my friend
To the end
Of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And another one for the road

I know the routine
Put another quarter
In the machine
I feel kinda bad
Can''t you make the music
Easy and sad

I could tell you a lot
But it's not in a gentleman's code
Just make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
You'd never know it
But buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things I'd like to say
And if I'm gloomy
Please listen to me
Till' it's talked away

Well, thats how it goes
And Joe I know you're gettin'
Anxious to close
Anyway, thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind
My bending your ear
But this torch that I've found
It's gotta be drowned
Or it's gonna explode
Make it one for my baby
And another for the road

The long, it's damn long...
It's so long...
Now, this man here is gonna take me by the hand and he gonna lead me down the right path to righteousness and all that other mother jazz - in the right tempo!

Fly me to the moon
Let me swing among those stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you....Jump! Rock!

Why don't you fill my heart with song
Let me swing forever more
Because you are all I long for
All I worship and I adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I -I love...
YOU!
You make me feel so young
You make me feel like spring has sprung
Every time I see you grin
Such a happy individual
The moment that you speak
I wanna run and play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I, we're just like a couple of tots
Runnin' around the meadow
Pickin' up all those forget me nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung and a wonderful fling to be flung
And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
Because you make me feel so young

You make me young
You make me think that spring has sprung
Every time I see you grin
I'm such a cuckoo individual
The moment that you speak
I like to run and play hide-and-seek
I'd like to go and bounce the moon
Just like a big balloon, because
You and I, we are just like a couple a tots
Who are runnin' around the meadow
Snatchin' up all those forget me nots

You make me young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Lots of bells to be rung, and a wonderful fling to be flung
And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
Because you, you make me feel so
Man, I just feel so
You make me feel so young
So young
One day you turn around and it's summer
Next day you turn around and it's fall
And all the springs and winters of a lifetime
Whatever happened to them all?

As a man who has always had the wand'ring ways
I keep looking back through yesterdays
Till a long forgotten love appears
And I find that I'm sighing softly as I near
September, the warm September of my years

As I man who has never paused at wishing wells
Now I'm watching children's carousels
And their laughter's music to my ears
And I find that I'm smiling gently as I near
September, the warm September of my years
The golden warm September of my years
I'm gettin' married in the morning
Ding-dong the bells are gonna chime
We'll have a whopper, pull out the stopper
Get me to the church on time

I've got to get there in the morning
Spruced up and lookin' in my prime
Girls come and kiss me, say that you'll miss me
Get me to the church on time

If I am dancing, roll up the floor
If I am whistling, out the door

I'm gettin' married in the morning
Ding-ding-dong they're gonna chime
Don't lose your compass, kick up a rumpus
Get me to the church, get me to the church
For Pete's sake, get me to the church on time

If I am dancing, roll up the floor
If I am whistling, right out the door
I'm gettin' married in the morning
Ding-dong they're gonna chime
Girls come and kiss me, say that you'll miss me
Get me to the church, get me to the church
For Pete's sake, get me to the church on time
Ding-dong
Ding-dong
Ding-dong
When I was seventeen, it was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen

When I was twenty-one, it was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stairs
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one

When I was thirty-five, it was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We’d ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five
But now the days are short, I'm in the autumn of my years
And I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
It poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year
Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Be happy, my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
So the ways be the rule
Give your heart and your love to whom ever you love
Don't you be a fool

Darlin', why stop to cling to some fading thing
That used to be
If you can't forget
Don't you worry 'bout me

Baby, why should you cling to some fading thing
That used to be
If you can't forget
Don't you worry 'bout me
When you're awake the things you think
Come from the dream you dream
Thought has wings, and lots of things
Are seldom what they seem

Sometimes you think you've lived before
All that you live today
Things you do come back to you
As though they knew the way

Oh the tricks your mind can play

It seems we stood and talked like this, before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you are wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when
Hey, drink up all you people
And order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The drink and the laughs on me

Try to think that love's not around
Still it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gaining any ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes, that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up all of you people
Order anything you see
And have fun you happy people
The drink and the laughs on me

Pardon me but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now the number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
Excuse me while I disappear
Now this could only happen to a guy like me
And only happen in a town like this
And so I say to each of you most gratefully
As I throw each one of you a kiss, this is...

My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of people, too
People who smile at you
And each time I roam, Chicago is
It's calling me home, Chicago is
It makes grin like a clown
It's my, my kind of town

This is my kind of town
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of razzmatazz
And it has all that jazz
And each time I leave, Chicago is
It's grabbin' my sleeve, Chicago is
The Wrigley Building, Chicago is
The Jumpin' Pump Room, Chicago is
One town that won't let you down
It's my kind of town
Chicago, Chicago, Chicago
My kind of town Chicago
The Wrigley Building, Chicago is
The Chicago Cubbies Chicago is
One town that won't let you down
It's my kind of town!

[Verse]
I know I dream about her all day  I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say "I love you"  But I ain't into makin' love songs Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life I introduced her to this hippy life We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night  them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system  make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love  it takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood  Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

[Bridge 1]
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

[Bridge 2]
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?

[Bridge 3]
For all them hoes that was frontin' on niggas back in the days, man (This for my broke jiggy niggas right now, you know)
You know what I'm saying?
Excuse me, fuck out my face
They say wealth is in the mind, not the pocket
I learned that from a very wise man
(Gotta pocket full of stones like Pimp say)

[Verse 2]
Okay excuse me, Mr. Bill Collector, I got problems
My check arrive mañana, I'ma pay my debt, I promise
I spent 20 thousand dollars with my partners in Bahamas
Another 20 thousand dollars on Rick Owens out in Barneys
I said excuse me, why the fuck you lookin'? What's your problem?
I swear we gon' have drama if you touch my tailored garments
All you see is niggas here, so that means it's triggers there
What you mean? We got weed, and codeine and bricks for sale
I bet a lot of niggas plottin' so you know I got that heater, bruh
Drive my side of Harlem, catch me ridin' with my nina, bruh
She got an apple bottom that remind you of Bonita, bruh
Oh you mean like Q-Tip? Now that girl my new bitch
Excuse me, no, I believe the proper term's excuse you
I could switch up on you niggas and start shittin' if I choose to
That's when the new you becomin' different since they knew you
I guess the new me is just gon' take some gettin' used to

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Duh, duh-duh
Dreamin' of sharin' love
Duh, duh-duh
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all

[Outro]
I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD

[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, look
My granny 88, she had my uncle and then
A miscarriage back-to-back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed rode for nine months, but gave birth in the end
Pops turned 60, he proud what we done
In one generation, he came from Africa young
He said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love kinda of like Hussle and Boog
Mani turned ten, Kross turned two
Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view
We the ones that made millions off the curb, fool
In this rap shit ten, never made nerd moves

[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
(Hussle, Khaled)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)

They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher (Woah, woah)
(Nip, talk to 'em)

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle & John Legend]
Emptied out the clip, it was broad day
Fuck niggas always gotta learn the hard way
We gon' tape it off if we ball play
Put a half a moon crescent on your bald fade
Police hit the lights, that's a car chase
Lookin' back at my life make my heart race
Dance with the devil and test our faith
I was thinkin' chess moves but it was God's grace
Crooked ass whoever 'til we all straight
With no shame, I peeped game and it's all fake
South Central state of mind, high crime rate (Yeah)
Homicide, hate, gang banging'll get you all day (Yeah, yeah)
And look at my fate

[Chorus: John Legend & Nipsey Hussle]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
(Told Khaled bounce the four 'til the bar break)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

[Outro: John Legend]
Higher
Oh, Lord

[Intro]
Check, one, two, mmm
Yes Lord

[Verse]
Goddamnit, I did damage on my last shit
Pop champ with some of the greatest in the gambit
Pop tags off of debit, in sweatpants and
My bucket cap got me looking like Jam Master Jay
Big bands, I was throwing up that magic
But how I went from getting dances to giving counseling
Bitch told me I'm pretty as Zoolander
Play the drums better than that Nick Cannon flick
And I say
There has never been another in hip-hop ’til I came
That can spit and play the drum kit
At the same, entertain
If there was let me know
Bitch, I'll wait
Is that your chick? Is she a thot? Is that your man? Is he a cop?
What's your plan when that capping for the ’gram get you knocked?
I could never wish prison, even on my biggest op
I just hope you niggas saving, a good lawyer costs a lot
I was just sixteen in a F-150
Juice off a new state prop in the rock
Look it up, look
Where was you the day that Snoop Dogg beat the murder case
Hallelujah baby
I'm saying any given moment we could lose it, baby
I'm just living like the days before the crucifixion
And to be honest, after watching R Kelly shit
I'm tryna teach my nieces to be celibate and really patient
And uh, that's enough, bro
Ion want blow
I ain't feeling y'all niggas I'm uncomfortable
What’s killing my nigga
That’s 

[?]
Ion wanna pull up on no more funerals
'Cause I’m miserable and ain't it some shit
When your pockets dumb rich, but it's still a slum village
And you look around and everything's changing
Well, at least I’m with the niggas that I came with
And they wonder why I speak this way
And they love me 'cause I got the best teeth in the game
And I'm hungry since the day I first leaked in the egg
Screaming 'skeet, skeet', I could've been a stain on my mommas jeans
I ain't a gang member, but I know Game, nigga
My uncle always told me, "Punch 'em in the face quick
And don't say shit, 'cause that's for lame niggas
But don't forget, you invented your own lane, nigga"
I remember nights getting pulled over pigs
Bright lights beaming off a hatchback
See I got expired tags, license don't exist
Tryna keep it cool
It's the second day of June, and it's hot enough to fry a catfish
Living off 

[?]
With the roaches and the lower income, bread mouldy in the fridge

[?] said he's bout to have a baby
And two months later I say the same shit
Lord knows I love her
But he also knows I wasn't really ready but who ever really is?
Smartest thing I ever did
Take you to the 

[?], fill out all them documents
If it wasn't for my sons
I'd prolly be on a long OxyContin binge
But then again
My dreams been realized, the wings was double fried
My green was stuck between the peas and kettle fries
I gave up the beef then I gave up the pork then I
Garnered a co-sign from one of the goats
Come on in, you letting out all the cold air, bro
Where you been? I know you ain't forget about ya folk
Late again, I may not come when you want
But I'm always up on time, so roll up and smoke la la
Weed too potent, shit, I had to call momma
Tell her how much I love her, cooking them home products
When the bills would pile up, cereal with the water
If Lord couldn't help us we had Hamburger Helper
When you want it done right you gotta get it for yourself, huh?

[Verse 1]
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I’m not alone?
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I'm not alone? No

[Verse 2]
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I’m coming home?

If I see a man waving, does this mean that I'm not alone? No

[Verse 1]
Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old?
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold?
You can untrain yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
'Til next year?

[Pre-Chorus]
God, I can’t do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I’m not alone

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I’m coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I’m not alone?

If I see a man waving, does this mean that I’m not alone? No

[Chorus]
I've been dealing with these pressures
Weighing on my mind
Left my vision impaired, I can't see

[What's left behind]?
It feels just like a phosphor
The art is locked in my mind
Need to get it out now so I can breathe
And stop wasting time

[Spoken Word]
The most common phosphenes are pressure phosphenes, caused by rubbing or applying pressure on or near the closed eyes. They appear spontaneously only when visual stimuli are lacking and especially when the viewer is subjected to prolonged visual deprivation

[Chorus]
I've been dealing with these pressures
Weighing on my mind
Left my vision impaired, I can't see

[What's left behind]?
It feels just like a phosphor
The art is locked in my mind
Need to get it out now so I can breathe
And stop wasting time
On, weighing on
Feels just like a phosphor
Weighing on, weighing on me
The art is locked in my mind
On, weighing on
Feels just like a phosphor
Weighing on, weighing on me
The art is locked in my mind

[Spoken Word]
These subjective images resulting from the self-illumination, as it were, of the visual sense are called phosphenes. Because phosphenes originate within the eye and the brain, they are a perceptual phenomenon common to all mankind

[Intro: Big Sean]
We got a ten, forty-seven on East 9th Streetet
Oh, it's just
Woah, woah, woah
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Please don't tell my nigga Mike, you know he gon' judge me
Please don't tell my mom, if she find out she won't love me
Last time we did it, we woke up together huggin'
Only question on my mind right now is, "Do you trust me?"
I don't like popping, but I like popping with you though
I don't like to drink, but I like leaning with you though
Sometimes, wonder if your love's the only thing that kill me
Everytime I'm with you, it just feel like I'm the real me (Real, real, real)
That's a damn line like where the ocean and the sky meet (Yeah)
Somewhere in between yeah, baby, that's where you and I meet
Just know I'm a call away (Brr) and I'll be with you night and day

[Chorus: Coldplay, Big Sean]
Let me take you for a joyride, a joyride
Let me take you for a joyride, it's alright
Baby, you can be the highlight of this life (Woah)
Let me take you for a joyride, say, "Oh my God" (Woah)
To make you say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Make you say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Then we going up and down, up and down, up and down, yeah
Going up and down, up and down, up and down, yeah

I need your company, don't make me be alone (Alone)
Tripping off the last joyride you took me on (Oh yeah)
I pull up skrt-skrt, to the front, get ready 'cause I'm coming (Swerve)
Only question on my mind right now is "Do you love me?" (Do you)
I don't like the ZZZs but I'll bar with you though
I don't like the hills, but I'll ride through them with you though
Mood swings, you're going from "I love you" to "I hate you"
Off the show means meditation, get closer to nature
I'm here every time, like when the stars and the sky meet (Damn)
Somewhere in between, yeah, baby, that's where you and I meet
Just know I'm a call away and I'll be with you night and day
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Coldplay, Big Sean]
Let me take you for a joyride, a joyride
Let me take you for a joyride, it's alright (Woah, woah)
Baby, you can be the highlight of this life
Let me take you for a joyride, say, "Oh my God" (Damn, damn)
To make you say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Make you say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Then we going up and down, up and down, up and down, yeah
Going up and down, up and down, up and down, yeah

[Refrain: Big Sean]
Yeah, yeah
Chill out, vibe out, light one, smoke one, ride out (Ride)
Hair down, stretch out, lay out in my hideout (Hide)
We deserve to give each other feelings (Feel)
Skrt with me and we go missing

[Chorus: Coldplay]
Let me take you for a joyride, a joyride
Let me take you for a joyride, it's alright
Baby, you can be the highlight of this life
Let me take you for a joyride, see all my guys (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Big Sean]

Damn, up and down
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
A heart on a run keeps a hand on a gun
Can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

[Chorus]
So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

[Verse 2]
I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on High
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing, “I thought it'd be me
Who helped him get home”
But home was a dream, one that I'd never seen
'Til you came along

[Chorus]
So, girl, hang your dress out to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on its Stones like a piece of driftwood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

[Outro]
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Then I need that Raf, then I need Balmain
My partner got his pockets broken, when he sell cocaine
Man, I need a chain, Supreme and the Palace
Just a young nigga that will shoot your favorite stylist
(Imitates gun noises)
Hey, these girls out here drooling
You boys out here look foolish
Like what the fuck y'all doing?
I don't need no valence (No)
Yeah, I know it's childish (Yeah)
I'm just a young nigga that will shoot your favorite stylist
Cat burglar on the cat walk
Pretty, even when my mask on
Fucked up stylist in a black arms
Shoot your stylists in his backbone
In the street, full of backstabbers
Fashion niggas be swag jackers
Y'alls dressing like backpackers
Ask them why they wear their hat backwards
Bad rappers, dress as backwards
Ask them all who made rap classic
Ask them all who made black classic
They all credit, like back taxes
Half black bitch, mad black whip
Who, who, who, yeah bad fashion
Zoom, zoom, zoom, fast asshole
All booty, just backstabbers

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky, Wale]
Shoot your favorite stylist, I'm a fashion killa (Huh)
Shoot your favorite stylist, I'm a fashion killa
Fuck your favorite model, I'm a fashion killa
Wear your favorite fabrics, I'm not an average nigga (Boss)
Shoot your favorite stylist, I'm a fashion killa

Niggas look so childish, when I'm on the liquor
(I modified this shit forever)
Shoot your favorite stylist, I'm a fashion killa
(Don't ever forget it)
Fuck your favorite model, I'm not your average nigga
(Um, might bring Mike James in here, no)

[Refrain: Wale]

Distressed tees, jeans for the low
My shit is OG, your shit is really old
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, god damn

Dressed up, must have left your wardrobe in your house

When love comes calling
Don't look back
When love comes calling
Don't look away
When love comes calling
Don't look back
When love comes calling
Don't look away

[Verse 1]
It’s been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I’m back in town
This time I’m not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I’m not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus]
He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"

[Chorus]
(Something), something about this place
(Something), something about New York Nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool American guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

[Chorus]
America, America, I love you!
You and I

[Post-Chorus]
You, you, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I, I
You and I
You, you, you and I
America, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I

[Bridge]
We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy, and America, and Jesus Christ
(Happy Thanksgiving)

[Chorus]
(Something), something about the chase
Six whole years
So put your drinks up, put your drinks up
For America, America, I love you

[Post-Chorus]
You, you and I
Oh yeah, well, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Nate Dogg]

[Verse 1: Dre Dre]

Bad bitch scooped her up same ol' same
Fuckin in the drivers seat while I'm switching lanes
Gettin brains Long Beach, Compton thang

Draws down nuts platinum, let em' hang

And while she bounced out wit me before you came

Simple and plain cuz we's be off the chain
Nigga Nate Dogg, pimp game, please explain

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Give me a bomb instrumentals
Straight from Gangbang central
Keep that bomb weed coming
Wheres my bomb
One thing I know, know that these rats want cheese
We set a trap and caught her on her knees
I heard him coming and I dropped my keys
I hit the window, yep, khakis still creased
Don't like to drink big
Smoke cos I got big trees
Girls pause when they see me
Blue '64 on these

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Who am I
Mr. D-O-G, he's fine
I don't fuck with 8's just 9's and dimes
Holla at me dog, I'm tryna find some time
And if I do, we'll sit back and recline
Untill then, you can put your mind on mine
And we can have a good time
I put my dick on your spine
Hit you from behind, make your sun shine
I won't tell, oh bitch quit lying
Matter o' fac' ho, get off my line
Cos right about now, I need my peace of mind
Sippin' Hennesy with a twist of lime
Smoking on a dime, beach, snortin' a line
Calvin, not Calvin Klein
Original, so genuine
My office hours are from, 10 to 5
God Bless you and good night is how I end my rhyme
But meanwhile
(Fades)

[Intro: 50 Cent:]
Sh-sh-sh-shady
Aftermath, haha
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, haha

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore
Do you want more (more)
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore
Do you want more (more)
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore
Do you want more (more)

[Eminem]
Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise

[Brigde: Eminem]
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time
When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

[Dr. Dre]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches

[Eminem]
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the f*ck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this mutherf*cker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

[Bridge: Eminem]
First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

[Bridge: Linkin Park]
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Linkin Park & Jay-Z]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore, do you want more (more...)

[50 Cent]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

[Eminem]
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

[Dr. Dre]
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

[Eminem]
So never say never cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

[Chorus: Dr. Dre]
I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it
Let it ride, tonight's the night, yeah
I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it
Let it ride, tonight’s the night, yeah

[Verse 1: LL Cool J and Dr. Dre]
Uh, you know you a freak
Before the album went platinum, ya hardly speak
And now you're skin grinnin, gassed off the chrome rims and
Twenty room mansion, I rest my Timb's in (Yeah, Yeah)
Uhh, I feel it how ya shake it
Rings in ya belly, I can’t take it (Nah)
Toss up your Moët, money make it
Last week frontin, tonight butt naked (Butt naked)
I got the flavour, make em Zoom-a-zoom (Uh, Uh)
The LL Cool J(Yeah), give me room
Looked up in my eyes as I lowered the boom
Twenty thousand freaks packed up in one room, uhh

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom
(Mmmm, whatchu wanna do) Uhh, whatchu wanna do?
All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom
(Mmmm, whatchu wanna do) Uhh, whatchu wanna do?

[Verse 2: Dre and LL Cool J]
Once again it's on, can't be home
The crime got me in the zone; homies blowin up the celly
Phone
The world knew I had to come once mo'
And just to let y'all know, I do my thing and still blow
Nuff to burn ten mill' cells, confirmed
The most anticipated since Tyson's return
So come on everybody let's all get down
Cause what we have, is a brand new sound

[Pre-Hook: LL Cool J]
All the mommies in the house gettin live tonight
They wanna (Zoom Zoom Zoom, Zoom Zoom-Zoom)
And all my dogs feel the vibe tonight
They wanna (Zoom Zoom Zoom, Zoom Zoom-Zoom)
Say what?

[Varied Hook: Dre and *LL Cool J*]
All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom
(Mmmm, whatchu wanna do) Uhh, whatchu wanna do?
All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom
Dre, whatchu wanna do?
Mr. Smith, it’s on you, uh

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
In other words, it’s gon' be like that
You young boys is blind, I’m seein them cats
Evolutionary (what?) Revolutionary and legendary
I got a climax waiting for each and every cherry
I'm like a narcotic, niggas is microscopic
Dr. Dre and Cool J, is the topic
Forever, my lyrics is rough and energetic
Them cats is blazin? I don't get it, they cosmetic
If shorty wanna step up? I'll twist his neck up
You can’t get no money battling me; that's like ripping your
Check up
What partna? Take ten paces and turn around
That quick, yo' whole ghost town is burnin' down (Woof!)
What I spit, manipulates whole clicks
Make 'em conversate on how real niggas ride my dick
It's like a serum, I just can't hear 'em
All them new niggas poppin' new shit, I never fear 'em
As we proceed
To give you what you need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Break it down!
(Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Dre]
I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it
Let it ride, tonight's the night, yeah
I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it
Let it ride, tonight's the night, yeah
I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it
Let it ride, tonight's the night, yeah

[Verse 1]
Less and less sense it makes for me to live over in here
When it comes over me, that smile you see will slowly dissapear

[Chorus]
This city is dense and it makes me tense
And it makes me tense, and it makes me tense
And it never ends, and it never ends

[Verse 2]
We've been here too long and don't know where's the last place I've been
Remember when we were young and didn't do anything?

[Chorus]
The city is dense and it makes me tense
And it makes me tense, and it makes me tense
And it makes me tense, and it never ends
And it never ends, and it never ends
And it never ends, and it never ends
And it never ends, and it never ends

[Verse 1]
Words aren't easy, they'll come and they'll go
Feelings alive, but they'll never show
All of my heroes are people I know
Never see faces that look like my own

[Verse 2]
I wanna take it easy, retreat in my soul
I wanna feel your body when my hands are cold
Got me addicted to something you have
Let it grow inside me, it makes me so mad

[Chorus]
It makes me so mad
It makes me so mad
It makes me so mad
It makes me so mad

[Verse 1]
I met a dark spirit, I know
She found me drifting at the show
The ring she hands me has a glow
She comes so close

[Chorus]
And says we all get lost, but we all come back
We all get lost, but we all come back
We all get lost, but we all come back
We all get lost, but we all come back

[Verse 2]
I see the hazy scene unfold
Through my lenses, they're cracked and old
We're all okay, that's what I'm told
But it's taken hold

[Outro]
Don't take me with you
Don't take me with you
Don't take me with you
Don't take me with you
Don't take me with you
Don't take me with you

Oh, never wanted it to roll away the stone
There's no road I've ever known
Never, never, never know
Today I'm feeling strong, baby
Today I did it all alone

So, baby, baby, baby, come on

Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead

Vore the night
And maybe you'll get away tonight
And maybe then the night's alright
And maybe you'll want something of mine
And we'll get on and get by
And maybe we'll learn to belong too
And maybe we'll learn to will mine
'Cause I can't depend on the now new
And these niggas don't come tonight
Roll your guns up, roll your guns up
They got guns so you're gonna come
Roll up your guns up, and nothin' left to do, but

[Chorus: Kanye West, Santigold, and both]
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV sta-tion
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead

Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead

Alright, sometimes the day's too long
Where would you go?
Somebody known too long
Ooh, and now you know
So I can't keep 'em tonight, you want to?
A'ight, oh, oh, oh
And make another song 'til drift off, 'til I, 'til I, I
Shoot up the station, TV station
Who knew there was nothing to do and everything to lose
And there's not nothing left to do, but

[Chorus: Kanye West, Santigold, and both]
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
I'm going to, and if you're with me
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
If you're tired of all the lies, if you're tired of all the cries
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead
Now if your signs aren't all that nice n' if you find someone for life
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, TV's dead

And if you're tired of all the lies n' then you're tired of all the cries
It won't consign until all we die
And when you drab I'm still alive, still alive
Shoot up, shoot up, shoot up the station, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I know sometimes you wanna go and give up
Girl, why you wanna argue when I'm fucked up?
Is it cause the sex is better when we make up?
Girl, you wanna beat it up before you fall asleep?
Making words I hate 

[?] until you love me
And you'll be feeling better in the morning

[Chorus]
They say change takes time
But baby, we can fix it overnight
If you let me try
Then baby, we can fix it overnight, overnight
Oh, overnight

[Verse 2]
The tide is coming faster, we should slow down
Your tongue is tied, I don't know what to say now
Until we have the time to work it all out, no, no, no
Girl, when we crash and burn, we burn this all down
You know it's getting late, we might as well now
I'll make it better by the time the sun's out, oh, oh

You know you got me, I know I got to

Crossbows and arrows, the smoke in the shadows
You'll lose your mind standing on the battle line
Starting to choke on your heart in your throat and
It feels just like you can't remember how to fight

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll crack before we shatter
We can't fall apart (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
We don't get to die young
Trouble keeping our head sometimes
We just have to push on
We don't get to give up this life
All the breath in your lungs
Is stronger than the tears in your eyes
It's do or die, but we're alive
And while we're here, we'll hold the line

[Post-Chorus]
We'll hold the line

[Verse 2]
Don't hold your hands up, it's your final stand
Put your white flag down, oh don't you surrender now
No hero's story, there's no blaze of glory
But dawn only comes at the end of the night

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll crack before we shatter
We can't fall apart (Oh, oh, oh)

We don't get to die young
Trouble keeping our head sometimes

And while we're here, we'll hold the line

I don't know your name but excuse me miss

Woah, woah

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
I saved the last dance for you
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, tell me fellas have you seen her? (Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick that a youngin' never seen before
I say, "Yo, tell the girls I wanna meet her" (Meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her
Oh, should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time, she's out the door
I gotta go for mine, I think I'll say

[Chorus]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Verse 2]
Now shawty, grab hold of my hand
And let's pretend the floor is ours
You say you don't really dance
Don't worry 'bout it, we just one-two step, one-two step
Now if the music is moving too fast (Too fast)
Grab my hand a little tighter (Tighter)
Don't be afraid to move a little closer
Girl, there's something about you that makes me wanna say (Aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Chorus]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Ooh)
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss (Ooh)

I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
I think I'll say yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss

[Bridge]
I wanna be where you are
Ain't nothing wrong with dancing
Baby, it's so romantic
Baby, I can be in your heart
So many things I wanna tell you
I think that I should start by saying

[Chorus]
Yo, woah
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room

Now everybody just clap your hands like this (Like this)
Just clap your hands like this (Woah, like this, huh)
And if your shorty's in the house tonight
Just grab her by the hand, homie, make her understand
Y'all was made to dance like this (Like this)
Y'all was made to bounce like this (Woah, like this)
Just let her know she was made for you and
You want to do everything she want to, man

[Verse 1]
Yo, tell me fellas have you seen her? (Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick that a youngin' never seen before
I say, "Yo, tell the girls I wanna meet her" (Meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her
Oh, should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time, she's out the door
I gotta go for mine, I think I'll say

[Chorus]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Verse 2]
Now shawty, grab hold of my hand
And let's pretend the floor is ours
You say you don't really dance
Don't worry 'bout it, we just one-two step, one-two step
Now if the music is moving too fast (Too fast)
Grab my hand a little tighter (Tighter)
Don't be afraid to move a little closer
Girl, there's something about you that makes me wanna say (Aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Chorus]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Ooh)
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss (Ooh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
I think I'll say yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Bridge]
I wanna be where you are
Ain't nothing wrong with dancing
Baby, it's so romantic
Baby, I can be in your heart
So many things I wanna tell you (Oh woah)
I think that I should start by saying

[Chorus]
Yo, woah
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her (Oh yeah)
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss (Oh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Outro]
Now everybody just clap your hands like this (Like this)

Y'all was made to bounce like this (Woah, like this)
Just let her know she was made for you and
You want to do everything she want to, man
Ha, woo!

[Verse 1]
When you're out with your friends
Do you ever think of me?
When I'm not by your side
Do you ever think of me?

[Chorus]
Oh, it's confusing to see
People don't care about me
People don't care about me

[Verse 2]
I am out with my friends
Life is great without you now
'Cause you are not by my side
Why can't I be happy now?

[Chorus]
Oh, it's confusing to see
People don't care about me
People don't care about me
People don't care about me

[Bridge]
Don't come back here crying
It's your fault you're failing (People don't care about me)
Sorrow's here to punch you where it hurts the most
Hell, people don't care about me

[Outro]
People don't care about me
People don't care about... me

[Intro]

Chris Brown is in the building

[Verse 1]
The young boy just turned 16 and I got (Uh)
Six four's and hot bikes that I rock (Uh)
Keep three or four sweeties on my clock (Uh)
But all that swinging in that bikini just make 'em vicious
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop (Uh)
'Cause you speak in that slang that I talk (Uh)
That sassy tempo with that walk (Uh)
May be the reason that all these teenies may never see me

[Chorus]
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"

[Verse 2]
Ma, take a break, let me explain to you (Woo)
What your body got a young boy ready to do (Woo)
If you take a chance to let me put them thangs on you
I could show you why I make them straight A's at school
I'm a hustler, trust my frame and age
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page
I can picture us switching lanes
In the coupe, with you on the phone screaming my name (Chris!)

[Chorus]
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Gimme that, hot)
You be talking like you like what I got (Yeah, gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme" (Oh)
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Hot, gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Hey, gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac (Ooh)
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme" (Ooh, oh)

This what your body's saying, oh!

[Chorus]
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Three years older, gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Oh, gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme" (You could be in the back, yeah)
Momma you may be three years older but you hot (Ooh, gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (Yeah, gimme that)

You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"

[Outro]
V.A.! Yeah ha
Yeah, ma, don't be fronting like you don't know what's going on
Aight, yeah
Don’t
The city speaks on its name
You’ve lost your own little way
I think the reason why you-hate-me
Is that your loving it !

I want go back to that wonderful place
The one with roses and the moon shows it’s face
And all the angels banish your own disgrace
You're only jealous now that you’ve been replaced

Don’t
Don’t call her leave her alone
Don’t try to pick up the phone
And if he gives you his ice cold glance
Just fucking stare at him
Just fucking stare at him
Just fucking stare at him
Just fucking stare him

I want to go back to that wonderful place
The one with roses and the moon shows it’s face
And all the angels banish your own disgrace
You're only jealous now that you’ve been replaced
I really fucking hate you you make me wanna die
I really fucking hate you you make me wanna die
I really fucking hate you you make me wanna die
I really fucking hate you you make me wanna die

I want go back to that wonderful place
The one with roses and the moon shows it’s face
And all the angels banish your own disgrace
You're only jealous now that you’ve been replaced

Setting me free
Setting me free
Setting me free
Setting me free

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
I-I-I, things have never been stranger
I-I-I, things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Darling

[Verse 1: Ezra Koenig]
Another night indoors, another sign of life-ife
Wobbling up through the floor
You and Kidada
Ooh, I might get low, low, low
But now I'm too high to know
The sound of you and your sister
I couldn't face these days alone
You got the right light, candles burning
We don't need the moon anymore
I used to look for an answer
I used to knock on every door
But you got the wave on, music playing
Don't need to look anymore

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
I-I-I, things have never been stranger
I-I-I, things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change

[Verse 2: Ezra Koenig]
You and Kidada
Ooh, the lights get low, low, low
And I got nowhere to go
I used to freeze on the dance floor
I watched the icebergs from the shore
But you got the heat on, kettle screaming
Don't need to freeze anymore
Ooh-ooh, darling
I might get

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
I-I-I, things have never been stranger
I-I-I, things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change

[Bridge: Ezra Koenig]
Who knows the reason that kindness lost its hold?
Those better angels confined to minor roles
I left the wilding, wilding, wilding days of old
Your house is warmer the wilderness is cold

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
Things have never been stranger
Things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
Ooh
Things have never been stranger
Things are gonna stay strange
Oh, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change

[Outro: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
Ooh
Things have never been stranger (Ooh)
Things are gonna stay strange (Ooh)
I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I

For a better place (Baby, it's okay)
I fear that it's something (Hear that it's something)
Something you say (Oh, woah)

[Verse 1]
Meet me outside of my palace
Don't need no approval, girl, you valid
Let's make out right by my violets
Don't watch me do it, close your eyelids

[Chorus]
Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?
Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?

Uh, hey baby
Um, I know I keep asking this
Um, but I guess I just really wanna know at this point
You know, we've been intimate for a while
Been crushing on each other for years
But I guess I'd just really like to know if
You feel the same way about me as I feel about you
You know all your feelings for me inside of your heart
Let me know, bye

[Chorus]
Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?

[Verse 1]
Open your eyes and light the fluid
Get into it, petrol siphon
Low on meals, browning fields
Bury children

[Chorus 1]
Urbanization
Scarification
Population exodus
There is no Planet B
Open your eyes and see

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Open your eyes and shoot the dingo
While this shit goes out the window
Multi-factions
Rusting tractors
Dying hero

[Chorus 2]
Only way through is colonization
Acclimatization
Population exodus
Monetization
Civilization
The operation has begun
There is no Planet B

[Bridge]
Patient seasons
Blacked out for ages
Dreaming of cake
Snowflakes blanket
Old deserts
Outskirts disperse
Earth is a blank verse
Last hearse
Dry nurse
(Oh!)

[Refrain]
Open your eyes and see
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
Open your eyes and see

I'ma let my bitch eat pasta (eat that, hoe)
Told y'all niggas ain't stopping
Black card in my wallet, I'ma feed my partner
I was at one of my shows feeling like Cam'ron with the pink Margielas
We was tryna beat a murder capital, riding around the town with the pink Beretta
When I got in touch with the money, me and shawty fucked around and filled my schedule
Momma just sent me a picture got Indian in my family through my God damn nana
Young nigga fucked 'round, dropped out school, learned it all through the ID channel
Young nigga fucked around and ran out of bullets in the .40, got to get a banana
These young niggas go brazy, done got that money, they still might pop
So many blue faces on me right now, young nigga still gamble

Boomerang your bitch sweet, she coming back

[Verse 1]
Somethings up with Lee
She's lying through her teeth
She hides it underneath
Buying things that she don't need

[Verse 2]
She can play the game
Always speaks to us the same
But there's an itch under her chin
Give it up, don't let it in

[Interlude]
Let it in

[Verse 3]
She looks all around
And no secret to be found
Calm her nerves and fill her glass
Helps forget the things that pass

[Verse 4]
Fits inside her room
Luna got her a new broom
Sweep away some bits of skin
Let another day begin

[Outro]
Nothing makes much sense you’ll see
Ripe fruit lands close to the tree
All this time won't set you free
Take away the water
All that's left is honey

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Daydreaming, I stay in the backseat
The slow beat rocks me back to sleep, keeps me on automatic
Pressed my face up close against the glass I see the people
When they pass they move so automatic
You wake up when I go down
The radio reminds me I'm alive
We've been hearing it all night

[Chorus]
Come on now, don't let this go
Don't let my love fade away
People come and people go, but I

[Verse 2]
Lazy day, I'm so hungry
You melt me like a candle and a flame
But something is pulling you away
We've been stuck out here so long
My phone rings and reminds me I'm alive
And I'm feeling kinda high

[Chorus]
Come on now, don't let this go
Don't let my love fade away
People come and people go, but I
Stay

[Verse 1]
Running low on time
Let me loose, have a cry
Let me breathe, oh my, lalala lalala
Soaking up the sweat
'Til I'm putting you to bed
And you're sleeping like you're dead, lalala lalala

[Chorus]
Walk along the stair
Fall down, say a prayer
Fall down, say a prayer
Fall down, say your prayer

[Verse 2]
I can't take the heat when it's busy on the street
When I need it like a fix
Send me in, I'll be quick
Look me in my eye, feel the temperature arise
Like a needle, on a spine
This is it, you are mine

[Chorus]
Someone cry somewhere
Fall down, say a prayer
Fall down, say your prayer
Fall down, say your prayer

[Outro]
You make it easy to feel no pain
When you are above me
Bathe in the rain
Bathe in the rain
Bathe in the rain
Bathe in the rain
Bathe in the rain

[Verse 1]
Please take my hand
I'm a lonely, lonely, lonely man
I'll have this dance
If you give me at least a chance
If you give me at least a chance

[Verse 2]
Follow you home
In the night I like to go and roam
Grab you too close
Let me be the one you need the most
Come on, take me, take me, to the throne

[Chorus]
Deep in the night
I awake to a sound
Is it mice on the floor
Or the pipes in the ground?

[Verse 3]
I'll lock the door
With no light I can't see anymore
Palms facing forward
But my head is swaying back and forth
All that I want is to feel something nice
This can be easy or this can be right

[Chorus]
Deep in the night
I awake to a sound
Is it mice on the floor
Or the pipes in the ground?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
How you keep yourself from cracking
It's not easy, need to practice
Night time, day, don't let it
Get the best of you, girl

[Verse 2]
I can remember that time that
You slipped down, you cut your
Face right on the pavement
And I'm still up here waiting for you
Sister, why don't you
Walk on the wild side today?
I can wait for you
If you don't have the words to say

Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm

Last night, I laid my head down
And felt all the demons again
Please don't speak to me
If you don't have the words to say

After all this time you still let the light in
Time will speed up and then you fall behind them

[Intro]
Mwah, yeah
Man, I got some John pants with belt loops in 'em

Shawty s'posed to been helpin' me, instead she left me (okay)
Rather not dwell on that, I buy ice like I'm Michael Phelps
When I turned 14, my daddy strapped me and said, "watch yo self"
And I did just that

[Chorus]
I was whippin' around in a Rover (Skrt, skrt)
My mink too heavy for my shoulders (Way too heavy)

Take a breath, take it deep
"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

[Verse 2]
Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes"
Sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
So just pull the trigger

[Bridge]
As my life flashes before my eyes
I’m wondering, will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won’t get the chance to say goodbye
But it’s too late to think of the value of my life

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no
Know that I must pass this test
You can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no, no
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
No use, your lips keep moving
But I got a couple of screws loose
Them other boys talkin' about me
They say I'm bad news
And probably best for you to keep this short
It's my time to interrupt
Gonna take a lot to start me up
I don't think you wanna deal right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)
I got a, got a, got a gun on me
I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feelin' watered down
You're gonna drown

[Pre-Chorus 1: Rihanna]
All over your radio, see me in the stadium
I'll spin your body
Imma run to let these ladies know
Watch your tone around me
Don't push my buttons
You don't really wanna see me get wild
G-G-get wild

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Buckle up, I ride this like a fast car
Suck it up, don't even try to act hard
And you can try to run but you won't get very far
And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you
You got a hole in your head too
And I knew it the very moment I met you
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Gonna take a lot to work me up
I don't think you wanna do it right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)
I got a, got a, got a attitude on me
And I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feelin' watered down
Baby might drown

[Pre-Chorus 2: Rihanna]
Catch me on your mind baby
Don't waste my time baby
Now watch me wine
You can take that as a sign baby
So left and right with me
Now push my buttons
You see me go wild
Go, go wild

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
(Oh, oh)
Sometimes I go crazy

Watch me, watch me

A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)

[Intro: Steve Lacy]
I think I take myself too serious
It's not that serious

[Verse 1]
Alone in someone's bedroom, she firmly took my hand
The isolation ended, I began to understand
In the ping-pong match of constant desire
I was never gonna get ahead
'Cause I was looking in the mirror

[Chorus]
Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

[Verse 2]

Enemies for centuries, until there was a third

Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

[Verse 3]

Lonely in the ocean, but in every other way

In the warmest fellow-feeling

[Chorus]

What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

[Verse 4]
I didn't have your sympathy, but I knew where to start
Explaining to you patiently that the one who broke my heart
Would have broken yours
And thrown the pieces in the river

[Chorus]
Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

Use the pain of someone else and triumph for their will
And spill the blood

Let's go

Please don’t look at me that way
Your eyes are so heavy and I’m not that interesting
If I had it my way I would be a ghost
And abandon the white sheet
God, it’s so hard to be seen

Think I’d like to be invisible
Become one with the living room wallpaper at your party
Wouldn’t mind disappearing
But you always say you would miss me
Who am I kidding?
Even if I meant it
I’d probably still visit
I know how you hate to be lonely
I could float around and rearrange objects
To a conversation piece

Come back as anyone else, a better version of myself
A costumed monstrosity
And it already feels when you hold me
That your hands could pass right through my body
So do you think when I die I’d get a second try?
To do everything right I couldn’t the first time?
L.A. without the words or the bullshit
Yeah, Lower Alcatraz

I get stoned
I can't go home
I'm calling long distance on a public saxophone
My head is achin'
Lord my mind is breakin'
Feel I got run over by Captain Coconut and his dog named Rover
Gotta keep on movin'
Gotta keep on movin'
To understand both sides of the sky
You gotta keep on groovin' yeah
Good groovin'
'Cause you got your God and so do I
We gotta keep on lovin'
Good, good, good, lovin'
Make love on my dyin' bed
We gotta stop smokin', stop, stop
I mean cigarette smokin'
Or else I cough myself to death
And to make love to you baby
I wouldn't even have the breath
We gotta keep movin'
Keep on groovin'
Understand both sides of the sky
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
You got your God and so do I
I've been loving you, a little too long now
And I can’t stop now
Yeah, oh
You were tired, and you want to be free (Yeah)
My love's growing stronger, as you become a habit, habit to me
Oh, I've been loving you, a little too long now
Oh, and it won’t stop now
Oh, oh

I won't stop loving you, no
I won't stop loving you, no, no

I won't stop loving you
I won't stop loving you
I won't stop loving you
I won't stop
I won't stop loving you
I won’t stop loving you

[Chorus]
If I could say something
To capture your essence
It would be bucolic beauty
That surrounds us

[Refrain]
You're so special
You’re so easy

[Verse 1]
We should get all sweaty
And jump into the ocean
It would be intoxicating
Like the sunset

[Refrain]
You're so special
You're so easy

[Verse 2]
For years and years
You’ve been on my mind
You lips were contoured, tasting was so strong
Your essence captures the things that are never loved
This all contributes to things, they climb freely

[Chorus]
If I could say something
To capture your essence
It would be bucolic beauty
That surrounds us

[Refrain]
You're so special
You're so easy
You're so special
You're so easy

[Chorus]
If I say no
Would you be blue?
Let's take a walk into the dark
And find a light

[Refrain]
You said that nothing escapes you
I don't feel like we're on the same wavelength
I couldn't tell you now for certain
Your energy just seems so impersonal

[Chorus]
If I say no
Would you be blue?
Let's take a walk into the dark
And find a light

[Refrain]
You said that nothing escapes you
I don't feel like we're on the same wavelength
I couldn't tell you now for certain
Your energy just seems so impersonal

[Outro]
If I say no
Would you be blue?

[Verse 1]
Less, less I know
But then there's something else
So I thought
Hair, pretty face
Cannot see the pain inside
'Cause your smile

[Refrain]
Anyone could've known that you left
In the dark, in the dark

[Verse 2]
If I had been
On the sad side of you
I would be
With, with you now

[Refrain]
Anyone could've known that you left
In the dark, in the dark

[Verse 3]
But at least I wish I could
See you and say goodbye
But I can't

[Verse]
How many colors do you see?
When you close your eyes
And how many times must we speak?
Before you realize
That you're not free
May my eyes always stay level to the horizon
may they never gaze as high as heaven, to ask why
May I never go where angels fear to tread
so as to have to ask for answers in the sky
The whys in this lifetime i've found are inconsequential
compared to the magic of the nowness - the solution to most
questions
there are no reasons

And if there are - i'm wrong
but at least i won't have spent my life waiting
looking for God in the clouds of the dawn

I'll be up early to rise though of course -
but only to make you a pot of coffee

That's what i was thinking this morning Joe
that it's times like this as the marine layer lifts
off the sea from the view of our favorite restaurant
that i pray that i may
always keep my eyes level to your eyeline
never downcast at the table cloth
You see, Joe
it's times like this that the marine layer lifts
off the sea on the dock with out candle lit
that i think to myself
there are things you still don't know about me
like sometimes i'm afraid my sadness is too big
and that one day you might have to help me handle it

But until then
may my eyes always stay level to the skyline
assessing Long Beach's glittering new development
never higher than the tallest building
never to heaven or revenant
'Cause i have faith in man as strange as that seems
in times like these
and it's not just because of the warmth i've found in your
brown eyes
It's because i believe in the goodness in me
that it's firm enough to plant a flag in
or a
rosebud
or to build a new life.

Don't turn your back on me (No, no)
We'll find our balance (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Nice to have someone to care for you (Ooh)
Be there for you
Someone that'd take a dare for you (Ooh)
Yeah, and in the morning when you wake up

Like you're the only thing there for her
And the memories die
And I'm glad you were there for it
Yeah, I'm glad you were there (For it)
(For it, for it, for it) And the memories die
And I'm glad you were there for it (For it, for it, for it)

[Verse 2]
Give me just a second, in the city gettin' faded
I'm a star, don't you forget it, gettin' rich, I'm still a menace
Foot on the gas, goin' fast on the track, keep rollin'
I'ma make it last like the laughs keep goin'
I'm hungry for the morning, no taste
And I'm on the run now and we ain't get to touch base
I sent you texts to let you know that I was home safe
But that wasn't the point, babe, you just wanna talk later

[Bridge]
'Cause at nights, you can't sleep
Spendin' the day thinkin' who you gon' be (Ahh)
Lookin' at the models all up on the screen
Thinkin', "That should be me up on the TV"
(We're comin' home tonight, big hurry)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
In every sea there’s a mouth of a river
Where waterfall riches flow down
Why do they cry?
No one knows why
In every mouth there’s a word of forgiveness
That melts all the ice to the ground
Why do you sigh?
I don’t know why

[Chorus]
Why does the sky fall down
Like pouring rain?
To let it flow again
Gonna make you feel alright
Take your dreams, keep them out of sight
Wanna make you come alive
Close your eyes, keep you warm at night
So come a little closer to me
So many things I want you to see
My darling

[Verse 3]
In every laugh is the sorrow
Of all of the tears that you’ve held for so long
Would you make me cry?
Oh, let me run dry
In every tear are the eyes of a father
And mother that brought you to see
Sing lullaby
As you say goodnight, night, night (goodnight)

[Chorus]
Why do the stars look down (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10)
And feel no shame (Counting up the droplets of the tears falling from the sky)
When they are all the same?
Gonna set your mind alight
Keep you close to me and hold you tight
Wanna keep you burning bright
Take your words, shine them like a light
So come a little closer to me (Come a little closer)
So many things I want you to see (Many things I want you to see)
My darling

[Outro]
In every soul is the need to grow older
To speed up the passing of time
I don’t know why
But it makes me cry

Lyrics from Guava Island:

Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems
Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow
But one thing's for certain, baby
We're running out of time

[Verse 1]
Stayin' north of Sunset, lookin' for a place to live
Have another drink to cloud my mind and my judgment
I don't wanna go out unless I found a pick-me-up
I was playing this bar a couple times a month

[Pre-Chorus]
Now these bands just keep gettin' younger
Like I was before time slipped through my fingers

[Chorus]
Now I'm wasted, wastin' all of my breath
Wasted again

[Verse 2]
Standin' in a parking lot in the glow of a Rite-Aid sign
Everyone I know is staying in tonight
I've been here before, just screamin' at a cell phone
Seems like a couple of months went by, but it's years ago

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to be reckless, throw it all on black
Hoping I'd find better days, but now I'm back
With none of that

[Chorus]
Now I'm wasted, wastin' all of my breath
Wasted again

[Bridge]
Can't you feel it though, caught there in the undertow?
It's raw, cuts right to the bone
Can't you feel it now, up there when you're high as hell
It's soft, soothes you from the storm

[Verse 3]
My friends are turning 30
Playing down at the Silver Lake Lounge
I made that joke 10 years ago, now it's goin' down

Goin' down, yeah it's goin' down
Goin' down, yeah it's goin' down
Goin' down, yeah it's goin' down, goin' down

[Chorus]
I'm wasted, wastin' all of my breath
Wasted
Wasted, wastin' all I had left
Wasted, oh no
Again

[Verse 1]
Take my money, take my soul
Edward's house and rock 'n roll
Walkin' home was easier with you, ooh
Let me speak, I'm losin' steam
Listen to the second gleam
Smoke a little, tease me like you do, ooh

[Chorus]
And you're more than I can take
Can't you see I'm fallin' through?
The way your muscles move, drivin' in your car
You're a flashin' light on my radar

[Verse 2]
Jump the garden wall tonight, run until you're outta sight
Lead me, chasin' hopeless through the dark, whoa
Each morning I get dressed for you
Heart-sick feeling right on cue
You've got me like a walk in the park, whoa

[Chorus]
Take my hands as they shake
Why can't you hear me callin' you?
The way your veins pop out, playin' your guitar
You're a flashin' light on my radar

And the mornin' tastes so fake
But what else can I do?
The way it's all a part of who you are
You're a flashin' light on my radar

[Outro]
You're a flashin' light on my radar

[Verse 1]
I've got a surgeon's precision and a drunk man's hand
They say I've stopped growin', so I do what I can
Nothin' ever changes but the cigarette brand
But don't panic, this is just routine
Don't panic, this is just routine

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got roses on the brain, and I'm all wilt
You've got snowflakes in your veins, and I'm all melt
You don't got blame on your breath
God bless, but all I taste is guilt
Ooh

[Chorus]
Misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you?

[Verse 2]
I've got a surgeon's hand and a drunk man's passion
Totally limbless and I'm ready for action
Nothin' ever changes but the taste of tobacco
But don't panic, it's just routine
Don't panic, this is just routine

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got roses on the brain, and I'm all wilt
You've got snowflakes in your veins, and I'm all melt
You don't got blame on your breath
God bless, but all I taste is guilt
Ooh

[Chorus]
Misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you?

You've got roses the brain, and I'm all wilt

[Chorus]
But misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you?

[Verse 1]
Hon, please forgive me if I ever did you wrong
I'll be your candle; burn me upside down
From now on, I won't sleep on my arms
Numb, is how I feel deep inside my soul
Need to feel that I am on the line
I'm sorry that I dragged you down my way

[Verse 2]
Hon, I never meant to cheat you out of time
In cold mornings when our sheets are warm
I see a flower with no needles on (So far)
Stung, and there's a bee that gave it all away
Pretty eyes now filled with pain
A young confusion, what a shame
I'll never smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again
What good would it do?

For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is through

I'll never love again
I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again
To somebody new

Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you

Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper, but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 2]
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been working later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been smoking deeper, but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Bridge]
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane
(Thank you so much)

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

[Refrain]
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em, ey
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, nowhere to turn)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

[Refrain]
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, (What do I say?)
I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em, hey
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Bridge]
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new rules, I count 'em)

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em (I love you guys)
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

[Outro]
Alright, we're gonna need to sing this toegther
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Why? You're gettin' over him
That's right!

[Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why, hey

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why, hey

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Please, boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Bridge]
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

[Breakdown]
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why, sing

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(One more time)

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Please, boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Intro]
Ahh, ahh

[Verse 1]
Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you

Go slow, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us

[Verse]
Woke up this mornin' from a nightmare
Four in the mornin' with a fear in my eyes
Looked to my left and you were right there
I started cryin' 'cause it made me realize
No one is here, we are alone, babe
We are alone with our love
No one's out there, we are alone, babe
We are alone with our love

[Chorus]
When the world ends
I think I wanna die with you, no, no-no-no (Baby)
When the world ends
I think I wanna die with you, no, no-no-no (Baby)

Woke up this mornin' from a nightmare
Four in the mornin’ with a fear in my eyes
Looked to my left and you were right there
I started cryin' 'cause it made me realize
No one is here, we are alone, babe
We are alone with our love
No one’s out there, we are alone, babe
We are alone with our love

[Chorus]
If the world ends
I think I wanna die with you, no, no-no-no
If the world ends
I think I wanna die with you, no, no-no-no (Oh, no)
If the world should end
I think I wanna die with you, no, no-no-no
When the world ends
I think I wanna die with you, no, no (Oh, no)
We were so close, there was no room
We bled inside each others wounds
We all caught the same disease
We all sang the songs of peace

Some came to sing, some came to pray
Some came to keep the night away

So lay your candles high
So we will not stand black against the night

Lay Down
Lay Down

[Verse 1]
Isn't it funny how sometimes the best things in life are unexpected?
I’ve been trying hard to figure a formula for happiness and right now it involves a lot less of you
I wouldn't take it personally though I just have a hard time caring for myself when I'm not alone but then again if I don’t

[Chorus]
I've been missing you
I've been missing you
I swear

I've been missing you
I've been missing you
I swear

I've been missing you
I've been missing you
I swear

I've been missing you
I’ve been missing you
I swear
I'm in beast mode, beast mode, beast mode
My brothers call, they got pesos, pesos
I drop the top, turn it up, now I put on the rocks

[?], my shots causing guap
I spend them racks, I spend them racks for on of my boys
Now we the ones makin' noise, 

[?]

I'm in the streets (I swear to God)
I told my boys let's have a party (Let's do it)
They just know that, because we made it out the streets

[Part 1]

[Verse 1: Ben Robertson]
Dancing all alone, I am in my room
Spinning and twirling, twirling and wishing
That I was with you, mumbling in franglais
I don’t know what to say so I’ll leave it up to you
Turn the volume up! That's my favourite song
It always picks me up, long after you’re gone
Seems like yesterday you were a passing face looking the other way..

[Bridge: Ben Robertson]
Dancing all alone (dancing all alone)
Dancing all alone (dancing all alone)

[Verse 2: Ben Robertson]
Dancing all alone, sunny afternoon
I’m turning off the news, my brain is out of tune
Scooch a foot or two, that’s my favourite couch
(It) supports me at my worst, gives high fives when I wake up
Turn the volume up! I’ve heard this song too much..
But I can’t seem to stop, it sounds better in the dark
Gazing once again, out of my window
The blue jay in the yard hasn’t a care in the world

[Part 2]

[Verse 3: Ben Robertson]
Gazing at you, it’s not star-gazing but it’ll do..
Lying watching cartoons, but we got older and they did too
Please don’t give me your blues
Today I’m happy with my red & yellow hues
Gazing at me, but I don’t get what it is you see

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

I'm the only one of me

[Verse 2: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie, Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me

You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Both]
Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up, one, two, three
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Both, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)

Caterpillar mansion, cosmic star, elegantly dancing, who you are
Is who you ought to be

Caterpillar mansion, smiling moon
Gone all the time, yes, all too soon
Before the clouds move

Caterpillar mansion, cosmic star, elegantly dancing, who you are
Is who you ought to be
Sweet Loretta is gone to a place much better
Right out in space where they can't even write you a letter
Oh, my darling, I don't mean to sound so alarming
Just say to your face that I find your grace disarming

Place on the island through the star despite of the weather
Place on the island through the sun surrounded by whatever

Sweet Loretta, I suppose it's better
That you're out in space free from my love forever
Flying saucer, you came to the earth for the slaughter
Why did you bother to bring such a beautiful daughter

Place on the island through the star despite of the weather
Place on the island through the sun surrounded by whatever

Sweet Loretta is gone to a place much better
Right out in space where they can't even write you a letter
Oh, my darling, I don't mean to sound so alarming
Just say to your face that I find your grace disarming
Place on the island through the star despite of the weather
Place on the island through the sun surrounded by whatever
There's a mist in my brainforest
And it will clear with the day, I'll go away

There are hearts on the floor
It started when the walking man played just the other day

There's a mist in my brainforest
It started when, I don't care, clear as hell

There are hearts on the floor
It started when the walking man played just the other day

There's a mist in my brainforest
But it will clear with the day, I'll go away

[Verse 1]

Some people live for the fortune

Physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
That life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all

With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby

Some just want everything
Everything means nothing

A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Verse 1]
Skin under sun
Summer breeze, summer break
Oh, I was young then
Hadn't made my mistake
Unaware of the fall
Unaware of my fate
There was peace in the valley
'Til I made my mistake

[Chorus]
Quick in the night
As the storm took its shape
Caught at the border
As I made my escape
It was cold, it was dark
You were cruel, you were fake
Hoping for kindness
Was my greatest mistake

[Verse 2]
I was young then
Hadn't made my mistake
There was choice to get out
Or remain in this state
There was springtime and future
'Til I made my mistake

[Chorus]
Quick in the night
As the storm took its shape
Caught at the border
As I made my escape
It was cold, it was dark
I was foolish and lame
Hoping for kindness
Was my greatest mistake

Sometimes shit gets scary
When you don't lock the door
I like thinking about you
Gonna think about you more

They find you, find you
They find you, find you

Gimme a hug, gimme a hug, gimme a hug, c'mon gimme a hug
Gimme a hug, gimme a hug, c'mon gimme a hug, gimme a hug
Gimme a hug

[Verse 1]
I know you stole my panties 'cause I have the matching bra
My girlfriend said she saw you out with my favorite red dress on
She said you were dancing in my black snakeskin flats
Acting like a stripper and you didn't even match

[Chorus]
You want a five-finger discount, but nothing in life is free
How 'bout you work hard for what you want instead of lifting it from me
If it helps just a little, I'll give you the middle
It'll help you cut the cost
Can't give you a five-finger discount, but here's twenty percent off

[Verse 2]
I can't believe what you've done to me
After letting you in my house
Who knew you were casing the joint while sleeping on my couch
I'm sure you'll find forgiveness, yeah I'm willing to bet
'Cause that's my grandma's Jesus necklace
Hanging 'round your neck!

[Chorus]
You want a five-finger discount, but nothing in life is free
How 'bout you work hard for what you want instead of jacking it from me
If it helps just a little, I'll give you the middle
It'll help you cut the cost
Can't give you a five-finger discount, but here's twenty percent off

[Bridge]
The cops ain't gonna help me
But this town is pretty small
I'm gonna find out when I find you
That pretty girls can brawl

[Chorus]
'Cause you want a five-finger discount, but nothing in life is free
Well, you better hope that karma ain't a bigger bitch than me
If it helps just a little, I'll give you the middle
It'll help you cut the cost
Can't give you a five-finger discount, but here's twenty percent off

[Outro]
Five finger discount, but here's twenty percent off
Screw you!

[Intro]
D.A. got that dope!

Ayy, nigga, them ain't diamonds, that's foil
Big platinum plaques but they ain't for you (Nah)
I’m a California nigga in a yellow Lamborghini (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
When I take off the top, take off your bikini (Ayy)

[Verse 1: Ezra Koenig]
No time to discuss it
Can't speak when the waves reach our house upon the dunes
Time cannot be trusted
When the police come, they always come too soon
Life felt like heaven today
Like a foreign car though we are American-made
I thought I'd probably stay
But before I know, I know

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
My Christian heart cannot withstand
The thundering arena
I'll see you when the violence ends
For now, ciao ciao, Bambina

[Verse 2: Ezra Koenig]
No signs of injustice
No signs, but the flames that are filling up the room
Fire cannot be trusted
When the engines come, they always come too soon

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
My Christian heart cannot withstand
The thundering arena
I'll see you when the violence ends
For now, ciao ciao, Bambina
My Christian heart cannot withstand
The thundering arena
I'll see you when the violence ends
For now, ciao ciao, Bambina

[Intro: India, Jeremih, & DJ Khaled]
Sabes bien que fue un engaño
Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado
Así mismo me engañaste
Y lloras hoy porque fallaste
Cómo tratas de buscarme
Después que tú me traicionaste
Ahora tengo que alejarme
Busqué la forma de olvidarte
(Ayy, come here, man, haha)
Ooh
(Señorita, she is beautiful, no?)
We The Best Music (Oh-nah-nah)
Sabes bien que fue un engaño (Oh-nah-nah)
Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado (Another one)
Así mismo me engañaste (DJ Khaled)

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Why, oh, why? You stay, you stay
And cry every night, you stay, you stay
I don't know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal, you stay, you stay

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, I don’t know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level’s no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain’t even bedtime
And don’t you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy
I wonder

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh, why? (Oh, why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don’t know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
You stay, tell me why you

[Verse 2: Jeremih & DJ Khaled]
I think you're too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl
And that's real
That ain’t the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that
Baby, you can't take that
Hit the gym and get your shape back, oh
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga (Work)
With your mind and your heart and your soul (Let's go)
For your goals, in control, you let it go (Work)
I just want to see you happy
I just want to see you laughing
I just want to see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who really about you
Who gon' see about you
'Cause it's been a while, so baby

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh, why? (Oh, why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal

[Verse 3: Lil Baby & J Balvin]
You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day, he'll grow up and be a man
And lately, you been pouring out your heart on the 'Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see, I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by the ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision, I'm with it, no asking why
I catch you slippin' at all, you gon' be mine (J Balvin, men; ¡wuh!)

[Outro: J Balvin, Jeremih, & DJ Khaled]
Ma', la verdad es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado
Cuando tus ojos brillan en la luz son los que me fascinan
No hay quién te gane
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay, oh, you stay
Tell me why you (Another one)
Ma', la verdad es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado
Cuando tus ojos brillian me dan luz solo que me fascinan
No hay quién te gane
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay, oh
Think you're too loyal

Everytime you push me to the edge (Edge)

[Bridge]
Emotional, woah, woah, woah, woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
I'm on a Mission Impossible
I turned my fantasy optical
Pot to piss in to a pot of gold
I got the lava flow
Vision bigger than Galapagos
Middle fingers to your honor though (Look)
You got an attitude problem, I got a lattitude problem
I'm up out the bullshit
You gon' make me get the mask
And the Batman like we in Gotham
Know that's an option
I'm a little off the Henessey
Just so you know the authenticity
Why you gotta be the centerpiece?
And kill off all the energy
Why can't we just live in synergy? (Huh? Huh?)

[Chorus]
Why are you so emotional? Woah, woah, woah, woah
Emotional, woah, woah, woah, woah (I just gotta ask, like)
Why are you so emotional? Woah, woah, woah, woah
Emotional, woah, woah, woah, woah (Uh-huh)
Why are you so emotional? Woah, woah, woah, woah
(Why? You need to keep that bullshit to yourself, man)
Emotional, woah, woah, woah, woah (I gotta ask, like)
(You come around fuckin' the vibe up, we ain't got no time for that)
Why are you so emotional? Woah, woah, woah, woah
(It's only time to boss up, straight up)

[Outro]
Emotional, woah, woah, woah, woah
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Uh-huh)
Emotional, woah, woah, woah, woah (Why you bein' so)
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Round and round and round she goes, she be goin' close
We have our strength (we have)
Small bosses still in progress (we have)
As we say in BO$$ our great-great-grandchildren are already millionaires
Future numbers one on the Forbes list (one, one)
We're going to darken this list (we're going) I do not know what they will be when formed
Just follow Bonnie and Clyde
Dad and Mom are respected
Be like B and Jay Make it rain in the summer
Stop the world and steal it for you
You can small heirs (can)
With love B

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Everybody knows the damn truth
Our nation lied, we lost respect
When we wake up, what can we do?
Get the kids ready, take them to school
Everybody knows they don’t have a chance
To get a decent job, to have a normal life
When they talk reforms, it makes me laugh
They pretend to help, it makes me laugh
I think I understand why peopl﻿e get a gun
I think I understand why we all give up
Every day they have a kind of victory
Blood of innocence, spread everywhe﻿re
They say that we need love
But we need more than this

[Refrain: Tiffin Children's Choir]
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control

[Verse 2: Madonna]
This is your wake-up call
I'm like your nightmare
I'm here to start your day
This is your wake-up call
We don’t have to fall
A new democracy
God and pornography
A new democracy

[Chorus: Madonna]
People think that I’m insane
The only gun is in my brain
Each new birth, it gives me hope
That’s why I don’t smoke that dope
Insane people think I am
Brain inside my only friend
Hope it gives me birth each new
That dope I don’t smoke, it’s true

[Bridge: Madonna]
Everybody knows the damn truth
Everybody knows the damn truth (Wake u﻿p)
We need to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
We need to make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up
It’s a hustle, yeah
It’s a hustle
It’s a con
It’s a hustle
It’s a weird kind of energy, a bizarre thing that happens to be
An abnormal fraternity, and I feel more than sympathy
We got to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
We need to make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up

[Chorus: Madonna]
People think that I’m insane
The only gun is in my brain
Each new birth, it gives me hope
That’s why I don’t smoke that dope
Insane people think I am
Brain inside my only friend
Hope it gives me birth each new
That dope I don’t smoke, it’s true

[Chorus 2: Madonna]
Everybody knows the damn truth
Everybody knows the damn truth
We got to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
(Wake up)
Ah (Ah), Ah (Ah)

[Interlude]
A new democracy!

[Verse 3: Madonna]
Everybody knows the damn truth
Our nation lied, we’ve lost respect
When we wake up, what can we do
Get the kids ready, take them to school
Everybody knows they don’t have a chance
Get a decent job, have a normal life
When they talk reforms﻿, it makes me laugh
They pretend to help, it makes me laugh

[Verse 1]
I will be gay, if the gay are burned
I'll be Africa, if Africa is shut down
I will be poor, if the poor are humiliated
And I'll be a child, if the children are exploited

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what I am
And I know what I'm not

[Chorus]
O mundo é selvagem
O caminho é solitário (É, é, é)
O mundo é selvagem
O caminho é solitário (É, é, é)
(É, é, é, é)
(É, é, é, é)

[Verse 2]
I'll be Islam, if Islam is hated
I'll be Israel, if they're incarcerated
I'll be Native Indian, if the Indian has been taken
And I'll be a woman, if she's raped and her heart is breaking

[Pre-Chorus]
I know what I am (God knows what I am)
And I know what I'm not (And He knows what I'm not)
Do you know who you are?

[Outro]
Wild is the world
And lonely is the path
To come to you

[Verse 1]
I spent all night waitin' up
It's gon' be the last night I wait up for you
Spent a long time wakin' up
Used to think that I was not enough for you
Now I see that I'm just way too much
You got your hands full, I misunderstood
Now I see that I'm who I can trust
And you got a lot of wrong you're tryna make good

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

[Chorus]
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me pôr tão louca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca

[Verse 2]
I bent my knees for you like a prayer
My God, look at me now
Peel off my weakness, layer after layer
Nothing left for me to keep 'round
I'm a force and I won't tame, babe
Can't go through this and stay the same, babe
I've seen a lot of stranger things, babe
And I'll never look at you the same

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

[Chorus]
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me pôr tão louca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca

[Bridge]
Eu te amo
Mas não deixo você me destruir
I put you on a pedestal, but statues, they can fall
Felt so safe, I let you drive me straight into the war
Paid the hell you dealt me, thought you felt me
Was never good at games, now I'll just forget your name
(Forget your name) Mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

[Chorus]
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy (Crazy)
Você não vai me pôr tão louca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca (Louca)
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me pôr tão louca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca

[Verse 1]
I'm in the sky where I oughta be at, I've been watching you

Mouth closed, I don't want your opinion, who you talkin' to?
Stand out, no, I don't wanna blend in, why you want me to?

[Pre-Chorus]
They say be all I can be

[Verse 1]
I went to the far right
Then I went to the far left
I tried to recover my center of gravity

[Chorus]
I guess I'm lost
I had to pay the cost
The thing that hurt me most
Was that I wasn't lost

[Verse 2]
I came from the Midwest
Then I went to the Far East
I tried to discover my own identity

[Chorus]
I guess I’m lost
I paid a handsome cost
The thing that hurt the most
Was that I wasn't lost
I wasn't lost

[Bridge]
No, I wasn't lost
It was a different feeling
A mix of lucidity and craziness
But I wasn't lost, you believe me
I was right, and I've got the right
To choose my own life like a full circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle
Aquilo que mais magoa
É que eu não estava perdida
Aquilo que mais magoa
É que eu não estava perdida

[Chorus]
I guess I'm lost
I had to pay the cost
The thing that hurt me most
Was that I wasn't lost
I wasn't lost

Every night, before I close my eyes
I say a little prayer that you'll have mercy on me
Please, dear God, to live inside the divine
Not like I want to die
Teach me to forgive myself, outlive this hell

[Verse 1]
Is it really love if it hurts?
Is it really pain if it’s inside?
On the outside, I'm strong
Hold my hand, please sympathize
Hard enough tryna forgive

Please, dear God, to live inside the divine
Not like I want to die
Teach me to forgive myself, outlive this hell

[Verse 2]
Is it really faith if I'm weak?
Can you tell the truth when you live lies?
I'm just looking for the signs
Hold my hand, please sympathize
Hard enough tryna forgive
Hard enough tryna live
Flawed, flawed by design, yeah
Please, please sympathize

[Pre-Chorus]

Us kids don't know what we're talking about
That we're too young to understand how the government works
We call B.S.

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm goin' through it, yeah
I know you see the tragic in it
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it

[Verse 1]
She was darkened but light-headed, a daydream
Earning from her eyes down to her knees

[Pre-Chorus]
With some kind of love
Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate
How smooth they are and quick to interchange
Some kind of love

[Chorus]
I'll be the devil in your eye if it's what you need to hear
I'll be the devil in your eye if it'll change the way you feel

[Verse 2]
Hold my breath, I know it's me you're gonna blame
Blame my mother, blame my mood, it's all the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Some kind of love
Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate
How smooth they are and quick to interchange
Just some kind of love

[Chorus]
I'll be the devil in your eye if it's what you need to hear
I'll be the devil in your eye if it'll change the way you feel

[Outro]
That's some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
Some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
Some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
(Some kind of love)
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose

[Verse 1]
Another afternoon
In the boulevard, in the movie
Leave it up to you
You're a natural Houdini
Baby you're my one and only love
In the magazine, in the bedtime
You're the girl I'm always thinking of
In the videos, through the sunlight

[Chorus]
Give me a sign
Tell me you're mine, together, forever
Call the hotline
Listen for my connection
Your heart affection, I'm breathless

[Verse 2]
Now that I galore
And you’ll picture us on a Friday
We're grown-up like a billboard (take it up to light on the highway!)
Take it up to light on the highway
Baby you're my television dream
She's a flower-girl in the sunshine
Little memories playing on her screen
In the videos through the sunlight

[Chorus]
Give me a sign
Tell me you're mine, together, forever
Call the hotline
Listen for my connection
Your heart affection

[Interlude]
I mean, it was ok, it was alright, it was good, I mean I'm not saying it was bad, but it's just, y'know…

[Outro]
Love won’t last forever, out here in the sun
You know that I'm in heaven, baby you're the only one
Love won’t last forever, out here in the sun
And you know that I'm in heaven, baby no one else is fun

[Intro: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Coachella, you ready?
Let's go get 'em
Yes! So crazy right now!
Most incredibly, it's your girl, yes, B
History in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Yeah, I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so, looking so, looking so

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Drop it
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
(B)
When I talk to my friends so quietly
("Who he think he is?")
Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
You ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
The beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now (Yeah)
Got me looking so crazy right now (So, crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
So crazy right now, so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now (Hey)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Hey)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Coachella)
So crazy right now, so crazy right now (Y'all dance with me, come on)

Rolling high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that's what good
Kiss my mama, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your crew was talking lip
Guess what I did? Smack that trick
Smack that trick
Guess what I did? (Smack that trick)
Gold everything, gold ass fangs
Gold ass chains, gold ass things
You can see me stunt when you turn on the screen
You can-you can see me stunt when you turn on the screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights
I'm the capital B, I don't need no hype
The capital B mean I'm 'bout that life
The capital B mean I'm 'bout that life, bitch

[Non-Lyrical Vocal Outro]

[Verse: Beyoncé]
Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'ma walk, I'ma march on the regular
Painting white flags blue
Lord forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Ooh, I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away", oh
May the last one burn into flames

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose, yeah
Freedom, freedom, where are you?
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'ma keep on running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves, oh

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want from me?

What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?

Ring with the harmonies of liberty
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the list'ning skies
Let us march on 'til victory is won

[Intro: Messy Mya]
Baby, I'm back by popular demand
Bitch, I'm back by popular demand
I did not come to play with you hoes
I came to slay, bitch

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess
Paparazzi, catch my fly and my cocky fresh
I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress (Stylin')
I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces (Woo)
My daddy Alabama, mama Louisiana
You mix that negro with that Creole, make a Texas bama
I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros
I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils
Earned all this money, but they never take the country out me
I got hot sauce in my bag, swag

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow bone it
Dream it, I work hard, I grind 'til I own it
I twirl on my haters, albino alligators
El Camino with the seat low, sippin' Cuervo with no chaser
Sometimes I go off (I go off), I go hard (I go hard)
Take what's mine (Take what's mine), I'm a star (I'm a star)
'Cause I slay (Slay), I slay (Hey), I slay (Okay), I slay (Okay)
All day (Okay), I slay (Okay), I slay (Okay), I slay (Okay)
We gon' slay (Slay), gon' slay (Okay), we slay (Okay), I slay (Okay)

Okay, okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, 'cause I slay
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, 'cause I slay
Come on, prove to me you got some coordination, 'cause I slay
Slay trick, or you get eliminated

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
When he fuck me good, I take his ass to Red Lobster ('Cause I slay)
('Cause I slay)
If he hit it right, I might take him on a flight on my chopper (I slay)
Drop him off at the mall, let him buy some J's, let him shop up (I slay)
I might get your song played on the radio station ('Cause I slay)
I might get your song played on the radio station ('Cause I slay)
You just might be a black Bill Gates in the making ('Cause I slay)
I just might be a black Bill Gates in the making

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow bone it
I dream it, I work hard, I grind 'til I own it
I twirl on my haters, albino alligators
El Camino with the seat low, sippin' Cuervo with no chaser
Sometimes I go off (I go off), I go hard (I go hard)
Take what's mine (Take what's mine), I'm a star (I'm a star)
'Cause I slay (Slay), I slay (Hey), I slay (Okay), I slay (Okay)

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation (I slay)
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation
You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation
Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper

[Intro]

[Chorus]
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry

[Verse 1]
He trying to roll me up (I ain't sorry)
I ain't picking up (I ain't sorry)
I'm headed to the club (I ain't sorry)
I ain't thinking 'bout you (I ain't sorry)
Me and my ladies sip my D'USSÉ cup  (I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry)
I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause...

[Interlude]
Bug a boos, I need a good laugh
You, make me laugh

Did that make us laugh?

[Bridge]
Middle fingers up (Middle fingers up)
Put them hands high (Put them hands high)
Wave it in his face (Wave it, wave it in his face)
Tell him, "Boy, bye" (Tell him, tell him, "Boy, bye")
Let's go
Tell him, "Boy, bye", tell him, tell him, "Boy, bye"
Tell him, "Boy, bye", tell him, tell him, "Boy, bye"
Tell him, "Boy, bye", tell him, tell him, "Boy, bye"
I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, "Boy, bye"
Tell him, "Boy, bye, boy, bye"
Middle fingers up, I ain't thinkin' 'bout you

[Chorus]
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry

No, no, hell nah

[Verse 2]
Now you wanna say you're sorry
Now you wanna call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding

[Verse 3]
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Foolish of me to dream while you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got...

[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
(I see you, how did you do that so fast? She has on my outfit, y'all)
Sing it
(Me, myself, and I) Sing it
(That's all I got in the end)
(That's what I found out) Found out
(And it ain't no need to cry) Sing it ladies
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend

Right, ladies? Yes

[Verse 4]
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my woadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair

[Verse]
I rock diamonds on my neck
Got diamonds on my records
Since 15, comin' down, reppin' Texas
How you gon' neglect this? You was just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone, you ain't gots to lie, Craig
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Acting like I'm nobody
You gon' make me call somebody

[Outro]
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
I think it's time to go
(Let's go, little kitty cat)
He don't want no mo'
(Let's go little kitty cat)
He better call Becky with the good hair

[Intro: Beyoncé]
(Call Becky with the good hair)
Coachella, thank y'all so much for having us once again
I'm so honored to be on this stage tonight
And this next song is for all of my queens
Do we have any beautiful queens in the house tonight?
I want y'all to sing along if you know the lyrics
It's called "Bow Down"

[Verse: Beyoncé]
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of bein' in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down bitches

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Bow down bitches, bow-bow down bitches (Hey)

[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]

(Comin' up)
H, H-town-town, I'm comin' down
(Comin' down)
Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
Get filthy when that liquor get into me

Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
(Coachella, I wanna hear y'all sing)
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, now-now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you
Drunk in love
(How y'all doin' over here?)
I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby (I can see you all the way, all the way back there)
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love
(Sing it, y'all)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night (Sing, come on, sing)
We be all night (Sing, hey)

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints 'cause my body so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-Eleven
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin', if you scared, call that reverend
(Boy, I'm drinkin') Get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic 'til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard (Surfboard)
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood (Wood)
I'm swervin' on his, swerve-swervin' on his big body Benz
Surfin' all on his (Surfs up)

Hey

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Since 15 in my stilettos, been struttin' in this game
"What's yo age?" was the question they ask when I hit the stage
I'm a diva, best believe her, you see how she gettin' paid?
She ain't callin' him to greet her, don't need him, her bed's made
This is a stick-up, stick-up (I need them bags of that money)
We're gonna stick-up, stick-up (You see the mask, where that money?)
All my ladies get it done, I see you, I do the same
Take it to another level, no passengers on my plane

[Bride]
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

I'm a, I'm a a diva, I'm a, I'm a a diva (You see the mask, where that money?)
(I need them bags of that money)

[Outro: O.T. Genasis]
I be gettin' to the money, everybody mad
I think I'm gettin' too much money, everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot
The same old nigga from the trap
Everybody hated on him, then he bounced right back
I be gettin' to the money, everybody mad
I think I'm gettin' too much money, everybody mad
The same old nigga from the block
The same old nigga with the pot
The same old nigga from the trap
Everybody hated on him, then he bounced right back
Gettin' to the money

You a bad girl, and your friend's bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu (Ooh)
You a bad girl and your friends bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu (Ooh)

[Interlude: Beyoncé]
As a Black woman, I used to feel like the world wanted me to stay in my little box. And Black women often feel underestimated. And I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but the process. Be proud of the struggle. Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history and rejoice in the pain. Rejoice in the imperfections and the wrongs that are so damn right. And I wanted everyone to be grateful for their curves, their sass, their honesty. Thankful for their freedom

[Verse 1]
Who the fuck do you think I is?
You ain't married to no average bitch, boy
You can watch this fat ass twist, boy
As I bounce to the next dick, boy
And keep your money, I got my own
Keep a bigger smile on my face being alone
Bad motherfucker, God complex
I’ll motivate your ass, call me Malcolm X
Your operator, innovator
Fuck you, hater, you can't recreate her, no, haha
You'll never recreate her, no, hell no, uh

[Refrain]
You just gotta let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, baby, oh
You just gotta let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, baby

[Chorus]
You hurt yourself
Don’t hurt yourself
When you play me, you play yourself
Don't play yourself
When you lie to me, you lie to yourself
You're only lying to yourself
When you hurt me, you hurt yourself
Don't hurt yourself

[Refrain]
You just gotta let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, baby
Hey baby

[Verse 2]
Who the fuck do you think I is?
I smell that fragrance on your Louis knit, boy
Just give this fat ass a big kiss, boy
Tonight, I'm fucking up all your shit, boy

[Bridge]
(The most disrespected person in America is the black woman)
I am the dragon breathing fire
(The most unprotected person in America is the black woman)
Beautiful mane, I'm the lion
(The most neglected person in America is the black woman)
Beautiful man, I know you're lying

[Outro]
This is your final warning (Don't hurt yourself)
You know I give you life (Don’t hurt yourself)
If you try this shit again (Don’t hurt yourself)
You gon' lose your wife

[Non-Lyrical Vocal Outro]

[Verse 1]
I told you how you hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby
But you don't care
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
When you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care? Well, that's okay

[Chorus]
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry
And now every time our love goes sour, you can't sympathize, baby
You see these tears falling down to my ear
I swear, you like when I'm in pain, yeah
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care? Well, that's okay
Listen, hey

[Chorus]
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

[Bridge]
Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust?
Now you're just givin' up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more

[Interlude]
Ooh, ooh, do-do-do do do-do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, ooh, hey

[Chorus]
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

[Outro]
I still care, baby
I still care, yeah
I still care
La-la-la, la-la-la

Right here with me, right here with me
Hello

[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every girl in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here gotta look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how it's looking, babe

[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "Speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
So why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue?
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor

Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change

Me and my boo in my boo's coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the flyest
Grind up on it, girl, girl, girl (Show him how you ride it)
Me and my boo in the coupe lip locking
All up in the back 'cause the chicks keep flocking
All that gossip in 10 years, stop it
London, speed it up, Houston, rock it

Come on

Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag Bey, boy, you hurtin’ that
Brooklyn Baby where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and Bey, she about to sting, stand back

[Verse 2: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Baby (Yeah), seem like everywhere I go, I see you (Yeah)
From your eyes your smile, it's like I breathe you (That's right)
Helplessly, I reminisce, don’t want to (Uh huh)
Compare nobody to you (Take 'em uptown)

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control (Take 'em uptown)

Know that I can't get over you (Hey, uh)
'Cause everything I see is you (Oh whoa, that’s right)
And I don’t want no substitute (That's right)

Know that I can't get over you (Uh huh)
'Cause everything I see is you (Uh huh)
And I don't want no substitute (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, I swear it’s déjà vu

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yeah, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl, you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gonna need the help tryna study my bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
It's a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true (Yeah)
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having déjà vu?

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute (Here we go)
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Outro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
But for the attention of men
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes

[Intro: Beyoncé]

Take all these crazy ideas and actually make it into somethin' that
Heals people and that may spark vision in people
That shows them to dream big
And shows them that they are limitless
It's possible
If my country ass can do it, they can do it

Everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear

Before I let, before I let, b-b-before I let go
(Oh, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, oh)
Before I let, before I let, b-b-before I let go

[Verse 1]
Nothing lasts forever, and I told you
Everything you need to know that's not true
Lyin' to myself because it hurts you (Hurts you)
Waitin' for the simple taste to come through (Come through)
I've been known to hide within my own walls (Own walls)
Jewelry in my eyes so that I don't fall (Don't fall)
Onto higher prices, and escape with (Escape with)
All my ice intact, but who am I to kid?
Pound of flesh, and yeah, I'm still kickin'
Solipsism to spare my own stupid
Fears because the past and future scare me
Ridin' out to Venice with a nosebleed
I stood before the waves and prayed to be clean (Be clean)
But dirty in my mind, my gold turned green
But this is everything you ever wanted (Wanted)
Cryin' for the ones I lost in '18 ('18)
IG3, to 014, unhappy
Nothing ever makes you get past it
33 and still can't stop thinking (Thinking)
Fallibilism I keep on spendin' (Spendin')
To shower my beliefs with ice melting

[Chorus]
Losin' touch of everything I know
Prayin' for my heart to turn to stone
Bandana tied around my broken skull
Ice around my wrist, my touch is cold
Losin' touch of everything I know
Prayin' for my heart to turn to stone
Bandana tied around my broken skull
Ice around my wrist, my touch is cold

[Verse 2: Toro y Moi]
Don't be actin' dumb, cookie's gonna crumble
Wipin' up the crumbs, I do this shit casual
Happens all the time, plus I'm dark and handsome
Shit's broken by design, it's a tantrum

[Chorus]
Losin' touch of everything I know
Prayin' for my heart to turn to stone
Bandana tied around my broken skull
Ice around my wrist, my touch is cold

[Outro: Toro y Moi]
Don't be actin' dumb, cookie's gonna crumble
Wipin' up the crumbs, I do this shit casual
Happens all the time, plus I'm dark and handsome

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Automatic, make cash, get wasted
Automatic, make cash, get wasted
Make mama panic, boys talk to me colored
I'm a kid, damn it, I'm not a-
I grew up in Houston, Texas visiting Prairie View. We rehearsed at TSU for many years in Third Ward. And I always dreamed of going to an HBCU. My college was Destiny's Child. My college was traveling around the world and life was my teacher. I wanted a Black orchestra. I wanted the steppers. I needed the vocalists. 'Cause I wanted different characters—I didn't want us all doing the same thing. And the amount of swag is just limitless, like...  the things that these young people can do with their bodies and the music they can play and the drumrolls and the haircuts and the bodies and the... it's just not right. It's just so much damn swag

Wasting all my time wondering if you really loved me
I was wasting all my time thinking 'bout the way you treat me
Wasting all my time on someone who didn't know me
I was wasting all my time on someone who couldn't love me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew when I met you
I'm not the one you wanna be with
And I can't see you blossom in the future that I'm dreamin'

[Verse 2]
I'll be spending all my time
With someone who really wants me
I'll be spending all my time
On someone who really knows me
'Cause I found someone who has time
To show me he really loves me
So it's not wasting any time
Even though he's still far from me

I don't mind when you leave
But I can't find peace when I sleep
Drop me off, I'll be alright
The weather is warm tonight

My mind is never clear
Flies are entering through my ears
Drop me off, I'll be alright
The weather is warm tonight

I don't think you understand
You say you're uncomfortable, you make me mad
Don't you wonder what it'd be like
To be with me tonight?

I don't mind when you leave
But I can't find peace when I sleep
Drop me off, I'll be alright
The weather is warm tonight

My mind is never clear
Flies are entering through my ears
Drop me home, I'll be alright
The weather is warm tonight
I don't think you understand
You say you're uncomfortable, you make me mad
Drop me off, I'll be alright
I'll be alright
When I was young, I was told I'd find
One rich man in ten has a satisfied mind
And I’m the one

A hundred to one says I wouldn't react
But I'm the one in a hundred who would swing right back
Yes, I’m the one

Thousands of steps and staircases to climb
Thousands of men you'd most likely decline
And yet I'm the one

Ten thousand to one, could I possibly bet?
I'm compelled by your love and I haven't lost yet
Clearly, you're the one

One in a million don't mean what it meant
And these millions of gold coins don't gleam when they’re spent
You’re left with none

Ten million dollars could win the whole lot
But if ten million dollars is all that you got
You won't be the one
Hundreds of millions of papers to sign
Hundreds of millions of souls left behind
And yet, we’re the ones

A billion to one, don't the odds make you sick?
To be one in a billion's a terrible trick
You're the wretched one

When I was young, I was told I’d find
One rich man in ten has a satisfied mind
And I'm the one

[Verse 1]
The snow fell last night
Your flight couldn't leave
Come back to the bed
Let's take this reprieve
It felt like the end
The end's been delayed
You're here in my arms
So what should I say?

[Verse 2]
The words of a song
The prayers that we pray
The lock on the door
Won't keep them away
The snow slows them down
If just for a day
But here comes the sun
Those toxic old rays

[Bridge]
Trains start to move
Bells start to ring
The seasons we had
Don't mean anything

[Outro]
Trains start moving
Bells start to ring
The seasons we had
Don't mean anything

[Intro]
Yeah, nigga
Aye, Aye
I've been on the, I've been on the-

[Verse 1]
I've been on the run, that's why I go harder than you go
Plus I call 'em like I see 'em, maybe that's why I'm all alone
Product of the cold, but let me back up
The bitch back arched like a bow, yes sir
Leave her eyes, and in between them thighs, wetter
I told you that I'm in it for the long stretcher
I thought I told you that I'm in it for the long stretch
Drunk off of liquor from the long neck bottle
Mama told me that her soul been hollow for the longest
I told her like I know those problems
But you gotta know that wallowing is chosen
I scraped my face on the bottom one time
Now mama son shine
Like the mother fucking blinds when they open
Ashes to Ashes, pray death kiss my opponent
Had scars on my fist when I rose it
Armed with intent to provoke and a motive
Not be nutrition for vultures
Armor too thick for the poking
Think 'fore you 'proach me, bitch

[Verse 2]
It's 6 in the morning
You live 'round the corner
It's hard in the city, I'm falling, I'm sickened
The piggy's approaching, clicking the cuffs on the poultry
Chickens get split and get sold
Live or you don’t
Do what you do for your family but most, handle yourself
Know your daddy got goals
Be a man and just focus
Get you a plan and you get your shit split like divorce
Only throw hands when you stuck in a jam
And they force it, we can't afford no more losses
When your mind run cut the faucet, cuz
6 in the morning
The piggy approaching
Your window half open
He reach in and choke you
The world keep on spinning
We fish in the toilet
It get difficult not to get hopeless
It get difficult, it get difficult

[Verse 1]
I was alone at dawn she woke me
She was asleep and tired
She came inside and whispered to me
The girl is what I had inside

[Chorus]
But she's a P.Y.T., a pretty young thing
The girl's a P.Y.T., she's a pretty young thing

[Verse 2]
I was upstairs she came and woke me
I was asleep and tired
She came inside my prima donna
The girl is my heavenly prize

[Chorus]
The girl's a P.Y.T., my pretty young thing (to me)
P.Y.T., a pretty young thing

[Bridge]
She is always there
Whenever I need her
Telling me the words thats right
Telling me things
I do about her
She is just the one, right!

[Chorus]
The girl's a P.Y.T., a pretty young thing
The girl's a P.Y.T., a pretty young thing
P.Y.T., a pretty young thing
The girl's a P.Y.T., a pretty young thing
Oooooh

The girl's a P.Y.T., she's my pretty young thing
The girl's a P.Y.T., a pretty young thing
(I love her so I'll never let her go)
(I'm loving you today)
(I'm loving you tomorrow)
(My girl, my girl, my girl)
(I know I love her so)
(To me yeah)
(And it's fine babe)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Fresh off the plane
Pittsburgh pimpin' blew up and now he got his own strain
Diamond everything
We tired of paying for it so we put it in our name
To the top, but where we came from is way different
Been a boss and gon' remain
Know the cost, I can't complain
I'm back and rolling joints bigger than ever
The more time I take, the better I get
The more chains I cop, the wetter she get
All bullshit aside but never forget
Heard boss shit before but never like this
Blowing O's in my whip
Writing flows, bringing pounds where we ain't supposed to
But they don't even trip
Name on the list, we don't wait 'til it come out
Might buy every one so they don't exist
Rollie on the wrist
Competition try and miss
Diamonds on my fist
Gotta rock the coldest 'fits
Glad you noticed, never seen nothing like this so they focus
Mixing my new shit with my old shit
White diamonds on gold
We fell in love with how the money fold
Hundred millions I done sold, changed souls with the stories I told
Take it as a compliment when them younger niggas tell me that I'm getting old
That mean my money mature
Villas on shores, having conversations with billionaires
Skip the awards, we already there
Just keep the chronic smoke in the air
Model chick with long hair wearing weave cause it's easier to maintain
My niggas come from hunger pains
Now we all rocking two or three chains, Versace everything
Spilling our drinks, pulling out minks
Live a life that's as real as you think

[Chorus: Problem & Wiz Khalifa]
It take a lot to keep a crew alive
Really socialize
Beef shit, we don't vocalize
Keep it in overdrive
Come through and catch a vibe
Bitches is over fine
G's up, stay cheesed up, smoke it then re-up
It takes a lot to keep a crew alive
From counting twenties and fives
To private jets when we flying
They can't believe us
It take a lot to keep a crew alive
So we keep the bottles on ice
Staying down, still cursin' to Jesus (What?)

[Interlude: Wiz Khalifa & Curren$y]
So if I tell you something, I meant it, man
I'm not just doing this shit for my motherfucking health
I ain't got time to waste
You know that old ass saying, "Time is money?"
Well I got a whole lot of money
And I don't got a whole lot of time
So don't mind me if I change that up
Let me sit

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Paper been sitting up, just collecting dust
Though my Bentley clean as fuck, super sharp
Your bitch got cut, you mad but
You need to analyze the game that you laid
Had hella cracks in the frame, foundation was weak
She peeped early you was a lame
And proceeded to deplete your change
Smoking weed with my gang
Track suit tailored to feature my watch and bracelet
My reputation speak for me, I don't really say shit
Killer whales tip the scale, major sales
They praying that we fail though the real prevail
The illest niggas
Them haters really just wishing they could kick it with us
I swear that's why they so mad
Chevrolets candy painted, laid on the Ave
Hitting switches, drag the ass, sparking like a lighter
Million dollar rap writer, full time low-rider
A New Orleans East Sider
All my weed designer, all my hoes'll open fire

[Outro: Curren$y]
Yeah

[Intro]
Okay
You know what I'm sayin'?
(Cardo got wings)
I ain't gon' keep playin' with y'all
Not like I was before though, haha
Uh

[Verse 1]
Backseat how I like to ride
Two freaks tryna fit inside
Just left the club, now she wanna slide
Nigga keep callin' so she tryna hide
Big chain, got her eyes wide
Big dope, nigga, no lie
Presidential, monumental
She only fuck with you when the rent due
I'm tryna bag one when I spin through
On the grind, gettin' money's not a issue
You know it's the bomb just by the scent
Nigga sayin' he a pimp, but he doin' shit that tricks do
Lot of bullshit I been through
It made me a boss and my whole team official
We just stickin' to the script
Niggas sayin' they get down but I promise they don't do it like this

[Chorus]
'Bout to take another trip
Tell my bitch roll another zip
And my gang don't slip
Smoke trees, count a mil' before I dip
So much that the bank can't fit
She chose up, you can't blame her
We in the room high as a skyscraper
We came this far, ain't never gon' change up
Homie, that's Taylor

[Verse 2]
Straight game what I give her
Big crib but I made it out of Pittsburgh
No time for the fuck shit
We pull up, cleanest niggas at the function
All white Benz lookin' for some skins
Make sure I got room for you plus your friends
Straight card, no cash
Heard them niggas be simpin' so them niggas ain't lastin'
Get a joint and put gas in
Them niggas ain't even in my way, I move past 'em
Everything I make classic
And niggas be hatin', but to me that ain't natural
And it's pay me, fuck you
Smell two K's when I come through
I just roll another zip
Niggas sayin' they get down but I promise they don't do it like this

[Chorus]
'Bout to take another trip
Tell my bitch roll another zip
And my gang don't slip
Smoke trees, count a mil' before I dip
So much that the bank can't fit
She chose up, you can't blame her
We in the room high as a skyscraper
We came this far, ain't never gon' change up
Homie, that's Taylor

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Detain the  boss, maybe it's ’cause these 'fits I been gettin' off
Cardo got wings
Okay
You niggas still lost
Uh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Tryna detain the boss
Maybe it’s 'cause these 'fits that I'm getting off
Outfits, murder one, I ain't killin' 'em soft
Big crib, that's a mansion and not a loft
I ain’t never falling off, won’t take part in that
Some niggas get money, don't know how to react
Ain’t a million dollars, my name ain't on the contract
She ain't a boss, you can have her back
I'm where her loft at
Smoking out, playing my favorite songs
Let her hit the weed and she sing along
Pink diamonds, Rolexes telling the time
And if I wanna make a movie, she gon’ tag along
I ain't one for boasting and bragging
I'm the type to put it in my raps, you find out that most of it happened
You smell the smoke, you know it's the captain
Bring in the bottles, I roll 'em and pass 'em

[Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT]
When I wake up in the morning
I'm rollin' up the weed and I'm thinking 'bout you
And what we gon' do, yeah
I might take you back to my home
Smoke all them joints and I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And what we gon' do

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I got it legalized
And now it's me and my homies when I need to fly
My money a bigger size
And if she ain't coming home tomorrow, I'm the reason why
For my team, down to ride, you see it in my eyes
Thirteenss on the side, my trees crystalize
'Bout the life to live, I ain't missing mine
Leave it all for my kid
I can hear 'em hatin' from the distance
The world's filled with all kinds of paper, I'm tryna get it
Treat her so good that she think of me when I'm finished
Going so hard they just wait for the intermission
But I ain't never letting up
Never rushing my moves
I just wait for them to slack off, giving me the perfect opportunity
Then I set 'em up
Chain cold as the weather in December
This that G.O.A.T. flow, I know you remember

[Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT]
When I wake up in the morning
I'm rollin' up the weed and I'm thinking 'bout you
And what we gon' do, yeah
I might take you back to my home
Smoke all them joints and I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And what we gon' do

[Outro: THEMXXNLIGHT]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I tell her what I  do
Yeah
I tell her what I do, do
Yeah, yeah, I tell her what I do
Yeah, yeah, no, no, I tell her what I do

[Intro]
Cardo got wings

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Bong rips before Benihanas
You need to come with me and unwind
Be there in a nick of time
We pull up and skip the line
You could order what you want, girl, it's just fine
I ain't gotta say it twice
You the type to play your cards right
Leave your homegirls and stay out all night
Get excited when you find out the price
Love me like your first piece of ice
Or your favorite pair of Nikes
Either scenario, I'm what you wearing
Style no comparing
Ain't care so it's nothing for you to share them
I'll hit you when my plane landing
Pay you a visit when I can
And when I see you don't be acting different
Through with them losers, now you back to winning

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
No, you don't need no man
Girl, you get it on your own
And we don't need no drugs
We already in our zone
Oh, you got it right back
Right back, right back
Right back, right back
Oh, you're back to winning
Oh, back to winning
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
We built this so I'ma stand on it
Ain't right 'less me and my man own it
Know the bottom because we came from it
And they surprised 'cause we planned on it
Confrontation, never ran from it
Million dollar conversations, product placement
Trying to keep up but they out of date
Out of breath, out of line, all the way out of shape
Now they hate
If I roll it up it gotta be great
Bank account look like what the lottery say
Any time of day
Put a couple low-riders in your face
Wan' go, but she probably stay
Running game how it ought to be played
Ten years, ain't nobody take a shot at me
If it ain't cruise life, don't try to ride with me
One in the back, one on the side of me
In and out like a robbery
And the eyes never lied to me

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
No, you don't need no man
Girl, you get it on your own
And we don't need no drugs
We already in our zone
Oh, you got it right back
Right back, right back
Right back, right back
Oh, you're back to winning
Oh, back to winning
Yeah, yeah

[Intro: Chevy Woods]
Uh, yeah

[Verse: Chevy Woods]
She always in the latest
It gotta be something about her, I can't do no basic
Need us annihilate then, that's just to keep it player
Been getting money, don't be stupid, can't do me no favors
I got this project chick always play Lil Wayne
I think she tryna drive me crazy, told her stay in her lane
They always told me it was fire when it came to that 'caine
Yeah I was serving hard in like James and kept a rocket
Way too G'd up, feet up, light the weed up
I took his honey from him, she told me you wan' be us
He had a buzz, that was a light year
With 20-20, you pussy, we see it quite clear
I hit your BM in her DM then had her with me by PM
Stevie Wonder, I get money off keys and never see 'em, uh
Ain't saying shit, boy, you all talk
And ain't no prices ever dropping over here, this ain't Walmart

[Chorus: Young Deji & Wiz Khalifa]
And you know we ain't dry on the side
We just keep gettin’ profit, don't watch my pockets
Don't be mad, put your pride to the side
Real niggas don’t gossip, lil' nigga, stop it
And you know we ain't dry on the side
We just keep gettin' profit, don't watch my pockets
Don't be mad, put your pride to the side
Real niggas don't gossip (Okay), lil' nigga, stop it (Uh)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Big bag, I’m a big bag talker
Diamonds in my chain, look just the Wheel of Fortune
Different colors, they both sisters but got different mothers
Park my whips together, pull up, make ’em kiss each other
New flavors, I got lots of new flavors
Hella lit with all these bottles at my fuckin' table
We know that it’s night time, it look like the day, though
Why'd I worry 'bout being signed when I own the label?
Why'd I worry ’bout one horse when I own a stable?
I remember one room with the basic cable
I remember niggas talked, they don't want the fade though
I remember you's a trick so the pussy paid for, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Young Deji]
And you know we ain't dry on the side
We just keep gettin' profit, don't watch my pockets
Don't be mad, put your pride to the side
Real niggas don't gossip, lil' nigga, stop it
And you know we ain't dry on the side
We just keep gettin' profit, don't watch my pockets
Don't be mad, put your pride to the side
Real niggas don't gossip, lil' nigga, stop it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm a big risk taker
Hundred on the neck, cop some ice for the wrist later (Wrist later)
Saw it, that's the deal breaker
Out in LA ballin', got me feelin' like a real Laker (Real Laker)
Shorty get a hand
All that postin' on the 'Gram ain't for free, that's her bread-maker (Bread-maker)
And I hardly go to bed
I could hardly see the day that my squad ain't gettin' fed (Gettin' fed)
Got a problem, nigga, say it
And that money so long, we don't count it, we just weigh it (We just weigh it)
Your respect, you better pay it
Or some niggas you don't know pullin' up to where you stay at

[Chorus: Young Deji]
And you know we ain't dry on the side
We just keep gettin' profit, don't watch my pockets
Don't be mad, put your pride to the side
Real niggas don't gossip, lil' nigga, stop it
And you know we ain't dry on the side
We just keep gettin' profit, don't watch my pockets
Don't be mad, put your pride to the side
Real niggas don't gossip, lil' nigga, stop it

[Intro]
Yo, yo, what up? What up?
It's your boy Nick Budsworth
Right here with your 4/20 check-in
I know you riding high out there
So make sure you buckle your seatbelts
We got a lot of traffic so you might wanna have one rolled
Drink lots of water 'cause it's hot out
And if you're gonna be out all night, don't watch for the police
'Cause they don't give a fuck if you're smoking these days
It's legal, bitch

[Chorus: Young Deji & Wiz Khalifa]
You know I got what you need, baby
Know what you deserve
You know I got what you need, baby
I'm what you deserve (Okay)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
If my gang's in it, then you know it's legit
Buy the diamond rings, frozen fist
Legendary status, close to it
Pounds, growin' it, then we smokin' it
I ain't through with the game 'til I recoup everything that I'm supposed to get
Couple doors, open them
So niggas after me can get rich before they close again
If we ain't close, then we closin' in
Hittin' that chronic and holdin' it in
How many days he gon' roll again?
Made a mil' gettin' stoned with his friends
Makin' sure we look good for them pictures that we posin' in
Champagne bottles cold in the fridge
I'm goin' in and goin' again
Niggas sick, they got no defense
Can't block shit
Gettin' dollars make a lot of sense
Boy, your pockets full of lint
Pull 'em inside out before you sit

[Chorus: Young Deji & Wiz Khalifa]
You know I got what you need, baby (Yeah, yup)
Know what you deserve
You know I got what you need, baby
I'm what you deserve

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Keep the drinks cold
Seen shit get worse so we don't care when they reach
Before the paper meet the ink, think
Got our own weed, got our own everything
Trips every week, 20k for a seat
Tried to stay low-key but paparazzi won't let me
Old Chevies, new Mercedes, a few ladies
A couple niggas who wanted millions since we was babies
I get the room, it's so comfortable, say she gotta stay (Gotta stay)
Money, I made a lot today (A lot today)
Pulling out them private tables
Thirty a hand if you wanna play
Risk it all before I play it safe
If you broke, I'ma stay away
It goes down if I okay it
Four cars where I stay at
Racin' boats, catchin' all the wave action
Jetlife, Taylor Gang captain
The ones you named your plane after

[Chorus: Young Deji]
You know I got what you need, baby
Know what you deserve
You know I got what you need, baby
I'm what you deserve

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, yup
La música de Harry Fraud
Let me just run through it in my head
Uh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Get up off your ass
This cash ain't gon’ get itself, the race ain't gon' win itself
Focus on your business and your health
Put them notches on your belt
Treat them haters like they not here
Only smoke it if it’s top tier
Never puttin' your trust in a girl, that's bein' smart, it's not fear
All that I'm sayin', they motive's not clear
Lookin’ for a come-up, you won’t get a shot here
And still them bottles gon' pop, ’nother 30K, you gotta go shop
Even though it pains 'em, I guarantee it ain't never gon' stop
I’m with a few G's, you ready or not?
We levelin' up, conversations 'bout television and such
Make a toast to the better us
We never die, never givin' up
Never let sucker sheep get ahead of us
Blow rapper weed on the regular
You just rappers with weed, et cetera

[Chorus: Young Deji]
It's our time
I don't wanna hear you cry
Stop complaining, it's our time
I don't wanna hear you cry
Stop complaining, complaining, yeah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Whatever you like, I got it on ice
Trips to paradise, never seen you wear it twice
We don't care the price, diamonds in our wrist-wear
We celebrate 365 days out of the year
It took a lot to get here, some losses
Now we pour out our own liquor and race Porsches
Several options
Stay real and still made a fortune
Doesn't happen often
Pull up, don't let the valet park it
Mama get in, don't make it awkward
This some G shit you wanna take part in
And if it ain't, well then I'll gladly beg your pardon
Rollin' KK, got it straight from out the garden
Bank the largest
Thank the Lord when we make deposits
Lot of hate but we shake it off us
We invest if it's makin' dollars
This for legacy, it ain't for follows

[Chorus: Young Deji]
It's our time
I don't wanna hear you cry
Stop complaining, it's our time
I don't wanna hear you cry
Stop complaining, complaining, yeah

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, yeah
We still in the mix (Statik Selektah)
We got that Wiz Khalifa
We got that McQueen
We got that Taylor Gang
It’s all coming up next
Yeah, yup
Stay lit

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Get out the gold bottles, cars, got old models
Girls, keep 'em in bunches, learn to roll with the punches
Buy anything that I want, would rather save up
Paper phasers is what they labeled us
Twelve whips plus, but this one is my favorite
Cooled up, playing my latest shit
Your girl tired of curated playlists
Nothing else to say, but let's get paid
We ain't promised tomorrow, so we live today
Different stroke, same weed, rolled in a J
Another tour planned, slave to make a million dollars on a stage
Stick to the script, we on the same page
And if I ain't do it yet, then you can bet
More diamond chains, Porsches, and Corvettes
Pullin' up to the set, get nothing but respect
Niggas fuck with the gang and love the Jets
Been around the world for the checks
This ain't checkers, it's chess
You better make your best move next

[Chorus: Young Deji & Wiz Khalifa]
Every day, every day
Every day is a better day
And it's all love, it's all love (Okay)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
FaceTimes from the homie
Saying I'm doing a great job
When you thoroughbred, it ain't hard
Do more than just play the cards
My son future what I'm saving for
Me falling off, shit that's what they banking on
That ain't really rapper weed, you just think it's strong
She ain't really in your corner, you just think she yours
Several floors, you can smell the kush through the door
Raise generations, we don't need awards
Ain't doing red carpets no more
Just send my shit straight to the crib if I win
Lately, I been going in, customizing rims
Hittin' up models that's slim
Who ride and say they wan' come get high again
Sliding in a Benz
A hundred million dollars, I been trying since a kid
There ain't no KK on it, I ain't flying in it then
Gotta represent, new residents
Never hesitant, dead presidents

[Chorus: Young Deji]
Every day, every day
Every day is a better day
And it's all love, it's all love
Every day, every day
Every day is a better day
And it's all love, it's all love

[Outro: WEED Radio & Sebastian Thomaz]
Like I said y'all, it's going down, W-E-E-D
Shout out to Wiz Khalifa, man
He's in town tonight and he's got a special guest with him
He's bringing the Khalifa Kush with him as well
And um, speaking of Khalifa Kush
I heard Wiz has an Oreo commerical
Featuring his own son Sebastian
And we actually got Sebastian on the line right now
That's right, Wiz Khalifa's six year old son Sebastian is on the line right now
Sebastian, what do you wanna hear?
Some player shit

[Intro]
Statik Selektah

[Chorus: Sosamann]
What I'm smokin' got me feelin'
Like we ain't ever comin' down tonight
And I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'
The Taylor way is how I live my life
What I'm smokin' got me feelin'
Like we ain't ever comin' down tonight
And I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'
The Taylor way is how I live my life

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Throwin' tips to the distributors
Only focus is our kids and the culture we contribute to
Pull up book, invite the prime minister
Hundred black cars in a line, bulletproof, never dyin'
Gold pieces with diamonds to tell our time
All our women fine, team solid, never drop dimes
Came up out the sky with a Louis bag and a pound
Some pairs of Air Force Ones
I'll make a million dollars 'fore I'm done
Focused on funds, cars with engines in the trunk
We leavin' the venue drunk
They pointin', sayin' we livin' it up
Get as much as you give? Well, shit
I'm tryna give it all so I can get it back
Now Taylor Gang that

[Chorus: Sosamann]
What I'm smokin' got me feelin'
Like we ain't ever comin' down tonight
And I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'
The Taylor way is how I live my life
What I'm smokin' got me feelin'
Like we ain't ever comin' down tonight
And I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'
The Taylor way is how I live my life

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Since the first turkey bag, we ain't never look back
My nigga said he'd get the hotel
I said "Nah, I'll sleep on the couch," and that was that
We here right on time, hater, relax
Raw papers by the pack
Wakin' up neighbors
Was on the road for a couple months so I stacked
Taylor Gang, Jet Life, fill the walls up with plaques
Leadin' by action, rollin' weed up in a classic
Relaxin', leave the show with too much cash to spend
Get back to the pad
Remember days when niggas was doin' bad
Now our girls look like they doin' ads
Wasn't into sports or too into class
But all my chains look like your phone flashin'
New estate, the gate automatic

[Chorus: Sosamann]
What I'm smokin' got me feelin'
Like we ain't ever comin' down tonight
And I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'
The Taylor way is how I live my life

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
You already know, man
Uh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I got a deuce, I got an ace
I got a car for every bump on your dirty face
If you ain't gang then you in the way
No we ain't the same, diamonds spellin' out my name
Shorty want the pleasure but it come with pain
Hard to tame and blessed with a lot of game
Keep the kush under a flame
The grind was a slow process but well worth it
Now they nervous, shit get way deep under the surface
I traveled all around the Earth and never missed a day of work
You fallin' off, I'm keepin' it more player
Smoke one flavor
Parkin' my low riders, pissin' my neighbors off
Been in the game way too long and ain't take a loss
How you showin' up to work late and think you a boss?
My plane takin' off, more money in the bank
Less time spent on waitin' on someone else

[Chorus: Young Deji]
You don't have to hide no more, yeah, ayy
You don't have to hide no more, yeah
You don't have to hide no more, yeah, ayy
You don't have to hide no more (No)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Always have and always will be
The sickest, my nigga, ain't no remedy
Stay on the grind, ain't no plan B
You hustle hard, you understand me?
Roll up the plants
Stuffin' them hundred dollar bills in my pants
She ran out of luck, last chance
Ahead of my time, way too advanced
Wondering what my new shit gonna sound like
Rolling kush by the pound
Ain't tough 'less your niggas is around
Still underground
With thirty mil' a year, how that sound?
My son straight so I ain't gotta worry 'bout much
You out of touch
Money straight, pile it up
I can buy what I want
I ain't takin' her out on a date, no way
Sunshades, brighter days
Rollin' kush up, buyin' them J's
My flow is more exciting
You niggas more into biting
Less talking, more writing

[Chorus: Young Deji]
You don't have to hide no more, yeah, ayy
You don't have to hide no more, yeah
You don't have to hide no more, yeah, ayy
You don't have to hide no more (No, girl)

[Chorus: Young Deji & Wiz Khalifa]
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby (Okay)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
When you got visions of being the man
Sometimes other people won't understand
Gotta go hard for yours, maintain the upper hand
Rollin’ up grams with this chick who's super thick but she from Japan
Soaking up some vibes, workin' on my tan
Another show, another two hundred grand stuffed in the safe
There ain’t no comparison to my watch and the one you wearin'
Weed so loud, you hear it
Pull up and we the ones they wanna stare at
Fuck an appearance
You hear us talk it then we really live it
Houses with tanks, fifty thousand dollar fish up in 'em
My team was built to win
Hit your broad with that venom
Pro clubs and Levi denims
You can tell by our women
And all these legendary bars I'm pennin'
Come to my mansion if you wanna kick it
Flooded with digits, boss up, it's your decision
You lookin' fucked, we stuck to the business
Yeah yup

[Chorus: Young Deji]
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Ten steps ahead of these niggas
Wanna last in this game, then you better be
Rollin' so much weed, look like the ’70s
Newer chain, copped a better piece
The crib mine, nigga, fuck a lease
She off the leash, bank account in Greece
Gettin’ mine to say the least
Put it down, she tell me I'm a beast
Soon as 2009 get released
We got more heat for the streets
Fuckin’ up her sheets, 100K a week
Rich but I stay discreet
You know how them major players be
Tell her she can stay or leave
Can't believe, but we really achieved it
Bars are seamless
Money large, wrist anemic
I ain't there unless my team is in it
Ain't nothing new, we been here a minute
Trips to Spain and Venice just to handle our business
Don’t leave a thing unfinished
Champagne with our dinners
Going strong every inning
Some shit you might wanna witness
Yeah yup

[Chorus: Young Deji]
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby

[Outro: Young Deji]
How it feel, how it feel
To have a...
Real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner?
They can never clone it, baby
They can never clone it, baby

[Intro]
It's business, man
Wake up to the business
You handle yours, I'll handle mine
At the end of the day, what's done is done
Uh

[Verse 1]
Gotta be real, gotta be stackin' dollar bills
Gotta look out for my team in the field
Gotta stay fresh like my ideas
Gotta keep old cars switching gears
Gotta spit fire for my engineer
Listen here, the flow sharp like kitchenware
Different tier, we do our job then we disappear
Vision clear, money got us on a mission
They hooked, we supply the addiction
Only multiply and addition, no division
Drive the coldest edition, exotic bud twistin', got it out the mud
Models hoppin' out our showers and tubs
Dealers be givin' us ounces just because, showin' us love
50K just to show up in club
Versace frames, Gucci on the rug
I own the strain, you just know the plug
We don't do this for the fame, we doin' it 'cause we really kings
Well-oiled machines, keep all of 'em clean

[Chorus]
Ball 'til you fall
Don't let 'em monitor your millions, get 'em all
Gotta stay hands on, heavily involved
Try to handle your business and stay up out of ours
Then your problem's solved
Ball 'til you fall
Don't let 'em monitor your millions, get 'em all
Gotta stay hands on, heavily involved
Try to handle your business and stay up out of ours
Then your problem's solved

[Verse 2]
Lifted my low-rider up like Doughboy
When he caught sight of them niggas fuckin' with his lil' bruh
What we in it for? Make 'em remember us
Ten years plus, 10K's a new pair of rims for us
Come and kick it with some niggas who don't empty guts
They broke so they envy us
Laughin' to the bank while these suckers so serious
You ain't a boss, let me talk to your superior
Leather interior, bet I don't marry her
New year, gearin' up for success in different areas
Niggas was lost, switched the criteria
Hard not to stare at us
Think she home, but she here with us
Gettin' that kush smoke in her hair and stuff
Thirty thousand feet in the air
Always been and will be prepared for any affair
No diamonds in my teeth but that's all I wear
Solitaires by the pair, been ballin' my whole career

[Chorus]
Ball 'til you fall
Don't let 'em monitor your millions, get 'em all
Gotta stay hands on, heavily involved
Try to handle your business and stay up out of ours
Then your problem's solved
Ball 'til you fall
Don't let 'em monitor your millions, get 'em all
Gotta stay hands on, heavily involved
Try to handle your business and stay up out of ours
Then your problem's solved

[Intro: THEMXXNLIGHT]
Yeah
You need someone to love you, shawty
Love you, shawty
Need someone
You need someone to, ayy
You need someone to love you, oh

[Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT & Wiz Khalifa]
You need someone to love you, shawty

I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you
I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you
I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you
I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you (Okay)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Make your decision, usually I use my intuition
Rolling that weed, I'm on a mission
My eyes low, still paying attention
Ball hard, illest in my division
Better than all the competition
Set shot, puttin' my wrist in
Don't ball hard, learn how to dish it
Good from up close or distance
Make a million dollars in an instant
You get it all if you stay persistent
Now foreign countries, we be paying visits
Speaking of paying, lately, I've been playing with digits
So much coming from these words, it's making 'em nervous
Ain't a thing by chance, everything you see on purpose
Stayed down, became a boss, stayed real and observant
We always sticking to the code and my team is determined
We always keeping something rolled, hit the weed, don't get nervous
I'm thinking it's perfect, I'm constantly working
I think I deserve it, so I think I'ma purchase

[Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT & Wiz Khalifa]
You need someone to love you, shawty (Yeah yup)
You need someone to treat you right

I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you
I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you
I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you (Yeah yup)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Roll 'em as tight as I can
Who would've thought I'd grow to be the man?
Stick to the code, everything go as planned
Need in advance, straight biz
Won't give you a chance to hit us with that song and dance
Fifteen hundred dollars on some pants
I get the same chicks with some cut-off shorts and a pair of Vans
Pull up, ask her what she got planned
We pull off as fast as we can
Car so fast, hope you see it again
I usually be with fam, usually be stacking them grands
Built it all with my hands, run it back and replay it
Went from students in the game
Now me and my brother run the faculty, wrap around balcony
Painting in the living room look like a masterpiece
Rollin' up them joints, that's a thou' a piece
Me without trees is like a convict without the streets
Got a crib without the lease, I get a plate, my niggas feast

[Chorus: THEMXXNLIGHT & Wiz Khalifa]
You need someone to love you, shawty (Yeah yup)
You need someone to treat you right
If you need someone to talk to, call me
I'll do anything you like
I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you
I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you
I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you
I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you

[Outro: THEMXXNLIGHT]
You need someone to love you, shawty
You need someone to treat you right
If you need someone to talk to, call me
I'll do anything you like
I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you
I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you
I wanna do it all for, all for, all for you
You can have a life beyond your wildest dreams
all you have to do is change everything...
all you have to do is change everything
All you have to do is change everything
all you have to do is change everything

[Verse 1]
Early one morning the sun was shining
And he was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said that their lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like mama's home-made dress
Papa's bank book wasn't big enough
He was standing at the side of the road
Rain falling on his shoes
Heading out for the old East Coast
Radio blasting the news
Straight on through
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 2]
She was married when they first met
To a man four times her age
He left her penniless in a state of regret
It was time to bust out of the cage
And they drove that car as far as they could
Abandoned it out west
Splitting up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at him
As he was walking away
Saying "I wish I could tell you all the things
That I never learned to say"
He said "That's all right, baby, I love you too
But we were tangled up in blue"

[Verse 3]
He had a steady job and a pretty face
And everything seemed to fit
One day he could just feel the waste
He put it all down and split
And he drifted down to New Orleans
Where they treated him like a boy
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge
He nearly drowned in Delacroix
But all the while he was alone
The past was close behind
He had one too many lovers and
None of them were too refined
All except for you
But you were tangled up in blue

[Verse 4]
She was working in the blinding light
And I stopped in for a drink
I just kept looking at her face so white
I didn't know what to think
Later on when the crowd thinned out
I was getting ready to leave
She was standing there right beside my chair
Saying "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
I said "Nothing baby, and that's for sure"
She leaned down into my face
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her
As she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 5]
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was snow all winter and no heat
Revolution was in the air
And one day all of his slaves ran free
Something inside of him died
The only thing I could do was be me
And get on that train and ride
And when it all came crashing down
I was already south
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round
I had the worst taste in my mouth
That I ever knew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 6]
So now I'm going on back again
Maybe tomorrow or maybe next year
I gotta find someone among the women and men
Whose destiny is unclear
Some are masters of illusion
Some are ministers of the trade
All of the strong delusion
All of their beds are unmade
Me I'm still heading towards the sun
Trying to stay out of the joint
We always did love the very same one
We just saw her from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue
i measure time by the days i've spent away from you
that thought occurred to me
as i watched the sky go dark from blue

[Verse]
My arms were around her, my eyes were aglow
But the moment was tender, the music was low
While we were dancing, I think you should know
I was telling her about you, mmm-hmm

[Bridge]
She kept coming closer, the magic was there
She wore an expression that made people stare
It looked so romantic, darling, I swear
I was telling her about you, mmm-hmm
When you passed by and caught my eye
You didn't say a word
You turned to bow and walked right out
And the silence was the loudest that I've ever heard, mmm-hmm
Come back to me, darling, I must make you see
That things aren't always what they seem to be
The girl in my arms, she meant nothing to me
I was telling her, ooh, I was telling her
I was telling her about you, mmm-hmm

[Outro]
Mmm-hmm, when you passed by and caught my eye
Baby, you didn't say a word
You turned to bow and walked right out
And the silence was the loudest that I've ever heard
Come back to me, darling, I must make you see
That things aren't always what they seem to be
Ooh, the girl in my arms, she meant nothing to me
I was telling her about you
Only telling her about you

Gaze in your eyes, got me saying, "What a beautiful lady"
No ifs, ands or maybes
I'm releasing my heart and it's feeling amazing
There's no one else that matters, you love me

'Cause your perfume's smelling sweeter
Since when I saw you down on the floor, guitar, yeah

[Verse 2]
You won't need too much persuading
I don't mean to sound degrading
But with a face like that
You got nothing to laugh about, no, no
Red lips, hair and fingernails
I hear you're a mean old Jezebel
Let's go upstairs and read my tarot cards, c'mon

[Chorus]
You better stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight, you better stay with me (Stay with me), oh yeah
Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me (Stay with me)

[Verse 2]
So in the morning
Please don't say you love me
'Cause I'll only kick you out the door, yeah
Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home
You can even use my best cologne
Just don't be here in the morning when I wake up, oh

[Chorus]
Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight, you better stay with me (Stay with me), yeah
You better stay with me
Oh, stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me (Stay with me)

Tonight you better
Better, better, better, better, c'mon
Ooh, ooh

Yeah, alright
Mm, mm, mm
Oh, well
Ooh
C'mon, you better stay with me
You better stay

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Bridge]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This sh- is vital, I know you had to
This sh- is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Bridge]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!

[Outro]
Trick, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that -sy on a pedestal
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherf-in' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!

[Outro]
Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car!
Come on, we finna roll out!
I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo' freestyles ready!

[Spoken Word: Announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please give a warm welcome to Fleetwood Mac!

[Verse 1]
Monday morning, you sure look fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me, then you say it's wrong
I can't go on believing for long
But you know it's true (yes)
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me, then you get on down the line
But I don't mind, no
I don't mind, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

[Verse 2]
Monday morning, you sure look so fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me, then you fade away
Ya' know I can't go on believing this way
I've got nothing but love for you
Won't you tell me what you really wanna do
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I don't mind, no
I don't mind, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

[Guitar Solo]

First you love me, then you get on down the line
But I don't mind, no
I don't mind, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby don't treat me so bad
I’m the best boy that you ever had
You wanna leave now and find a new start
Please you're mean now please stop
It's gonna kill me if you break my heart

[Chorus]
Don’t you let me down again
You're just bound to see the end
You're just bound to see the end

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby don't treat me so bad
I'm the best boy that you ever had
You wanna leave now and find a new start
Please you're mean now please stop
It's gonna kill me if you break my heart

[Chorus]
Oh, don't you let me down again
Oh, you’re just bound to see the end

[Verse 1]
Have mercy, baby, on a poor girl like me
You know I'm falling, falling, falling at your feet
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go

[Chorus]
'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

[Verse 2]
Have pity baby just when I thought it was over
Now you got me running, running, running for cover
I'm begging you for a little sympathy
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

[Chorus]
'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Baby, baby, hope you're going to stay away
'Cause I'm getting weaker, weaker everyday
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me

[Chorus]
'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down
And there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

[Refrain]
Say that you love me
Say that you love me

[Outro]
Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling

[Spoken Word: Christine McVie]
Thank you! Have a very good evening everybody

[Verse 1]
Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had
And what you lost

[Chorus]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

[Verse 2]
Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had
Ooh, and what you lost

[Chorus]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Well women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know
You will know, you'll know

[Verse 1]
I can't help about the shape I'm in
Can't sing, I ain't pretty and my legs are thin
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to

[Verse 2]
Now, when I talked to God, I knew he'd understand
He said, "Stick by my side and I'll be your guiding hand
Don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to"

[Spoken Word: Christine McVie]
Well we haven't played anything from Tusk yet so we're gonna try some out tonight for you. And uh- the first one of which is actually the first track on side one, and it's called "Over & Over."

[Verse 1]
Could you ever need me
And would you know how, yeah
Don't waste our time
Tell me now
All you have to do
Is speak out my name, yeah
And I would come running
Anyway

[Chorus]
And I said
Could it be me?
Could it really, really be?
Over and over
Could it really, really be?
Over and over

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
And I said
Could it be me?
Could it really, really be?
Over and over
Could it really, really be?

[Verse 2]
Don't turn me away
No, don't let me down (Let me down again)
What can I do
To keep you around

[Outro]
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over

[Chorus]
One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
She doesn't like sleeping alone

[Verse 1]
You may come home one morning
And find she's not sleeping alone
Oh, then baby you'll see
Oh yes, you should have stayed at home
Because

[Chorus]
One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
She doesn't like sleeping alone
Just one more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
Oh, wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight

[Verse 2]
If you want her, better get her now
Or she'll be running away somehow
Oh, it's not for me to say
If she'll be happy some other way
Because

[Chorus]
One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
She doesn't like sleeping alone
Oh, One more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
Oh, wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight
Don't be a fool

Just one more lonely night
Oh, One lonely night
Wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight
Don't be a fool

[Outro]
Just one more lonely night
Just one more lonely night
Oh, wouldn't you like to be the one
Holding her tight

[Spoken Word: Lindsey Buckingham]
This is another song off of our album Tusk, and this is a song by Stevie Nicks called "Sara."

[Verse 1]
Wait a minute baby
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me ’bout the fire

[Chorus 1]
Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me home

[Verse 2]
And he was just like a great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match
He was singing
And undoing, and undoing
Ooh the laces
Undoing the laces

[Chorus 2]
Said Sara, you’re the poet in my heart
Never change, never stop
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
But when you build your house
Oh then call me home

[Verse 3]
Hold on
The night is coming and the starling flew for days
I'd stay home at night all the time
I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Ask me and I'm there, yeah
Ask me and I'm there 'cause I care

[Chorus 1]
In the sea of love
Where every woman would love to drown
But now it’s gone
They say it doesn’t matter anymore
If you build your house
Then please, call me home

[Chorus 2]
Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, and don’t you ever stop
And now it's gone
No, it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house
I'll come by

[Outro]
Sara
All I ever wanted, was to know that you were dreaming, Sara
There’s a heartbeat that never really died
Oh, won't you swallow your pride?

[Intro]
No, don't make me wait

[Verse 1]
It's not that funny is it?
When you don't know what it is
But you can't get enough of it
If's not that funny is it?

[Chorus]
So don't blame me
Please, please, please
I didn't want to bleed so
I didn't want to be this late
So don't make me wait

[Verse 2]
It's not that funny is it?
No one to turn you on
All your hope is gone
It's not that funny is it?

[Chorus]
Don't blame me
Please, please, please
You're here cause I say so
Didn't want to be this late
So don't make me
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Spoken Word: Lindsey Buckingham]
Thank you very much. Thanks a lot, really

[Verse 1]
She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I’d been

[Chorus]
Been down one time
Been down two times
I’m never going back again

[Verse 2]
You don’t know what it means to win
Come round and see me again

[Chorus]
Been down one time
Been down two times
I’m never going back again

[Spoken Word: Stevie Nicks]
I'd like to take a moment to dedicate this very old song to you, London, because you’re very special to us. It's called "Landslide."

[Verse 1]
I took my love and I took it down
Ooh, I climbed a mountain, and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
'Til the landslide brought me down

[Verse 2]
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within this heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
I don’t know
Hmm, I don't know

[Chorus]
I've been afraid of changing
Because I, I built my life around you (Oh but you know that)
Time makes you bolder, children get older
And I'm getting older too
I'm still afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you (Oh but you know that)
Time makes you bolder, children get older
I'm getting older too
Yes, I’m getting older too, so

[Verse 1]
Take this love, take it down
Oh, you can climb a mountain and you can turn around
But If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down

[Outro]
And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well maybe the landslide will bring you down
Hopefully, the landslide will bring you down

[Verse 1]
To be the last to leave the last to be gone
Stolen from the ones who held onto it
To be the last in line oh the ones that live on
Silhouette of a dream treasured by the ones
Who hung on to it
Almost a breakdown of our love affair
The stiletto cuts quick like a whip through the air
Long distance winners will we survive the flight
Not one of us runs from the fire light

[Chorus]
I would love to believe, I believe what you say
In the drama of the moment
Oh no there is no easy way, no one ever leaves
Everyone stays close until the fire fades

I would love to believe, I believe what you say
In the drama of the moment
Oh no there is no easy way, no one ever leaves
Everyone stays close until the fire fades

[Verse 2]
To be the last to leave what caused the fearsome
Divorce in the night there was no competition
Well to survive do it right and you believe in the five
To survive the distance everyone fights
Everyone fights and the fire flies
What happened to my feelings
When heartbreak comes in the night
Some call it my nightmare my five fireflies
Well like a sailing ship on one of love's rocks, no one

[Outro]
Of our love affair like a whip through the air
I would love to believe, I believe what you say
Fireflies

[Spoken Word: Christine McVie]
This is the first season we ever had from The White Album

[Verse 1]
You can take me to the paradise
And then again you can be cold as ice
I'm over my head (Over my head)
Oh, but it sure feels nice

[Verse 2]
You can take me anytime you like
I'll be around if you think you might
Love me, baby (Over my head)
And hold me tight

[Bridge]
Your mood is like a circus wheel
You're changing all the time
Sometimes I can't help but feel
That I'm wasting all of my time

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
Your mood is like a circus wheel
You're changing all the time
Sometimes I can't help but feel
That I'm wasting all of my time

[Verse 3]
I think, I'm looking on the dark side
But everyday you hurt my pride
I'm over my head (Over my head)
Oh, but it sure feels nice

I'm over my head (Over my head)
But it sure feels nice
I'm over my head (Over my head)
But it sure feels nice

[Spoken Word: Announcer]
Thank you

[Spoken Word: Stevie Nicks]
This is a story about a Welsh witch

[Verse 1]
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

[Verse 2]
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer
Your life knows no answer

[Refrain]
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

[Verse 3]
She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the sky
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you even try?
Would you even try?

[Refrain]
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

[Outro]
Taken by, taken by the sky
Taken by, taken by the sky
Taken by, taken by the sky
No

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Taken by, taken by the sky
Taken by, taken by the sky
Taken by, taken by the sky
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Oh, taken to the sky

[Spoken Word: Lindsey Buckingham]
We love you! C'mon! C'mon now! Ah, c'mon! C'mon!

[Verse 1]
Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could maybe I'd give you my world
How can I when you won't take it from me?

[Chorus]
You can go your own way (Go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (Go your own way)

[Verse 2]
Tell me why everything turned around
Packing up shacking up's all you wanna do
If I could baby I'd give you my world
Open up everything's waiting for you

[Chorus]
You can go your own way (Go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (Go your own way)

[Chorus]
You can go your own way (Go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (Go your own way)
You can go your own way (Go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (Go your own way)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
You can go your own way (Go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (Go your own way)

[Spoken Word: Lindsey Buckingham]
Yes! Cleveland, thank you all! We love you all!

[Verse 1: Lindsey Buckingham]
If you wake up and don't want to smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You’ll see things in a different way

[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it’ll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Why not think about times to come?
And not about the things that you've done?
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It’ll be better than before
Yesterday’s gone, yesterday's gone

[Verse 3: Buckingham and C. McVie]
All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don’t believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you

[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it’ll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Outro: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Ooh don't you look back
Ooh don't you look back
Ooh don't you look back
Ooh don't you look back

[Verse 1]
I've been alone
All the years
So many ways to count the tears

[Pre-Chorus]
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel

[Chorus]
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die

[Verse 2]
I been alone
Always down
No one cared to stay around

[Pre-Chorus]
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel

[Chorus]
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die

How I feel
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die

[Verse 1]
I do come from miles away
Haven't got no place to stay
Glad to help you plow your fields

[Chorus]
Farmer's daughter

[Verse 2]
Might be just a couple of days
Clean up rest and on my way
Thank you and I'm must obliged

[Chorus]
Farmer's daughter
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
So long better leave your land
Many thanks it was mighty grand
I do hope to see you again

[Chorus]
Ooh, farmer's daughter
Ooh, farmer's daughter
Ooh, farmer's daughter

They tellin' me be humble, but they know I'm cocky
Let me feel myself, yeah nigga, know I'm cocky

Big phantom grille, cook the streets like hibachi

She on the way to my suite, I'm 'bout to catch a body

She make me fight for the pussy, she Ronda Rousey
Playing hard to get, ring around the Rosie
If I whip it out, you gotta blow me
Shit, I'm going live
The block is hot, bitch go inside
Barry Sanders tryna juke the truth, we know you lyin'
She poppin' pussy, pussy swollen, pop a motrin
Now, I can take my jewelry off, still be the golden child

She on the way to my suite, I'm 'bout to catch a body

[Verse 2: Tyga]

You mean to act like I don't know, when I know I'm hot
Ass shot, when my shit blew, woah
She wanna rock to my tempo
I'm in the endzone when he in the friendzone
If you really on, where your niggas at? Put them on
Man in the mirror, only man out the pen dome, woah
I'm going live, sit down and watch me
See my bitch tan, we just came from somewhere tropic
'Bout to catch a flight, just to go shopping
This V5, whatchu know about it
My money count as my only accountant
I can only account for me and my niggas
Who you hold it down with?

[Pre-Chorus: Tyga]
They told me to be humble, so I started humming
Mmm mmm, fuck you hoes I came from nothing

[Verse 3: AE]
Yeah, you're testing my patience
Yeah, you're testing my faith, yeah
They know my strength, no

So I waited and waited
Uh, still nobody came, yeah
See, it's nobody's blame, no
I want the world to know
I picked up myself
See, now it's a stick, I'll put up your hand
Now they can't put out my fire
See the boy made himself to a man

By the time you read it, I'll be far away (Far away)

Swear you're giving me your heart, but I don't care (Don't care)
Better call Becky with the good hair (The good hair)
You only want me when I'm not there
Boy, you better get in line

[Bridge]
Sometimes I regret the day I put this ring on (Get in line)
Looking at my watch he should've been home (Get in line)
He always got them motherfucking excuses (Get in line)
I pray to God you reveal to me what his truth is (Get in line)

[Chorus]
Hey, big homie better grow up (Get in line)

Beating down your back door (Get in line)

You've been running game on the wrong one (Get in line)
I'm runnin' so fast for the long run
Runnin' out the back door (Get in line)

We truly could have been
Living young, wild and free (Get in line)
We truly could have been
Living young, wild and free

[Verse]
I believe in something special
I believe in trust
I believe in us
I believe in my tradition

Stay away from the emotion and madness
Stay away from the streets
For me, for me
Hide away from the moment that make us
Hide away from the streets
For me, for me

[Chorus]
It's a mad world, hey
It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad world, hey
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here? Yeah
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here? Yeah

Stray away from deceit
For me, for me

[Intro]
Say something, say something
Say something, say something

[Verse 1]
Say something to me, say It like you mean it
Out there thinking you deserve this
All over nothing, pain is the meaning
Out there somewhere in the distance

[Pre-Chorus]
Way too cold outside, feels like I've been running wild
All out here for living, so we keep on biding time

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Say something
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Say something

[Verse 2]
Say something to me
Speak up if you wanna fight it
Don't think you can't describe it (Yeah)
All of your energy
Leave us with the old reminder
Of what you always seem to care for

[Pre-Chorus]
Way too cold outside, feels like I've been running wild
All out here for living, so we keep on biding time

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Say something
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Say something

[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I was sick and tired of how they use our minds
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I press rewind, I never press record
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I was making sure that everything's alright
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
It's on the line, our future's heading for
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Relapse and all that, there's no way to fall back
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
It's too far gone, it's too far gone
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Now they take our memories, it's up to us to say
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
It's not too far gone, it's not too hard to
Say something

[Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh) Say something
(Ooh-ooh) Say something
(Ooh-ooh) Say something (Oh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh) Say something
(Ooh-ooh) Say something (Oh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh) Say something
(Ooh-ooh) Say something (Oh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh) Say something
(Ooh-ooh) Say something

[Verse 1]
In the wake of the madness
I held it until it came right, yeah
I'm looking on the bright side
While they wreaking the havoc
There's no random access here
Erase what they call memory
I'll make sure they remember me
Until they disappear

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm asking permission for where I stand, stand
I don't know where to hide when said and done
Takes more than you'll ever understand
It's rolling into one

[Verse 2]
I wish I'd never seen the danger that life posed to me
Circling all around me
I hope for memories that never fade like her and he
Worshiping onto the ground, we
Fake it 'til we make it
They'll be dreaming about nothing but us
Take it 'til they break us
They'll be screaming loud, misplacing our trust

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm asking permission for where I stand, stand
I don't know where to hide when said and done
Takes more than you'll ever understand
It's rolling into one

[Bridge]
If I had answers no one listens
I won't get down with that system
We won't run away, life long prison
Life's too short to leave it to them
Theory tells me, if we wait here
My own story serves the waitress
Full as a plate gets, empty questions
Something I can't stomach
Dress me down like naked clones that
Share their souls for cheap romantics
Less the antics, we're human here, intelligence
So as you know it's all or nothing
Show some grace or mind my loving
Souls keep swimming against the current
Show me what love is
Show me what love is
Show me what love is

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm asking permission for where I stand, stand
I don't know where to hide when said and done
Takes more than you'll ever understand
It's rolling into one
Ooh, I'm asking permission for where I stand, stand
I don't know where to hide when said and done
Takes more than you'll ever understand
It's rolling into one

[Chorus]
Tell me, can you hear? Messages are turned up loud
Struggling to move through the open crowd
Finding an oasis, reasons you had stayed about
Thinking it was time for some answers now

[Verse 1]
Woke up on the wrong side
Feel victim of a slow night
Try to breathe
But the pain in my chest won't go by
Stand up, I'll be alright
Just fishing for an alibi
Try to leave, but the voice in my head won't stay quiet
Downstairs to a dark room
Feel the light of the full moon
In a place where I'm finding an angel in you
I'm scared, I'm finding it's lonely
I'm finding it's always on me

[Chorus]
Tell me, can you hear? Messages are turned up loud
Struggling to move through the open crowd
Finding an oasis, reasons you had stayed about
Thinking it was time for some answers now

[Verse 2]
I'm up and away
Feel victim of a long stay
Try to speak
But the sound of my voice ain't fail safe
I'm scared, I'm finding it's lonely
I'm finding it's always on me

[Chorus]
Tell me, can you hear? Messages are turned up loud
Struggling to move through the open crowd
Finding an oasis, reasons you would stay inbound
Thinking it was time for some answers now

[Bridge]
What's the reason that I can't leave?
This ain't treason you ask of me
What's the reason that I can't leave?
This ain't treason
What's the reason that I can't leave?
This ain't treason you ask of me
What's the reason that I can't leave?
This ain't treason

[Interlude]
Tell me, can you hear? Messages are turned up loud
Finding an oasis, reasons you had stayed about
Tell me, can you hear? Messages are turned up loud

[Outro]
What's the reason that I can't leave?
This ain't treason you ask of me
What's the reason that I can't leave?
This ain't treason
What's the reason that I can't leave?
This ain't treason you ask of me
What's the reason that I can't leave?
This ain't treason

[Verse 1]
The grass is always greener when the fields all mine
And I'll lose my hero’s journey as the years gone by
And the stories still unwritten, there's no sense of time
Oh my, oh my

[Chorus: Jordan Rakei, Frida Touray & Both]
I live out alone, no room for yourself
I'm trying to focus, It’s my story to tell
I'm human as well
(As well), well
(As well), well
(As well)
I'm human as well
(As well), well
(As well), well
(As well)

[Post-Chorus: Jordan Rakei, Frida Touray & Both]
And I'm running 'round in circles
Flying high above the ground
And I'm searching out the echoes
And the signs of who we are, who we are

[Verse 2]
I've seen a lot of danger coming 'round my way
Finding love in every moment, hope it’s not too late
And the story’s now unfolding once upon a time
Oh my, oh my

[Chorus: Jordan Rakei, Frida Touray & Both]
I live out alone, no room for yourself
I'm trying to focus, It’s my story to tell
I'm human as well
(As well), well
(As well), well
(As well)
I'm human as well
(As well), well
(As well), well
(As well)

[Post-Chorus: Jordan Rakei, Frida Touray & Both]
And I'm running ’round in circles
Flying high above the ground
And I'm searching out the echoes
And the signs of who we are, who we are

[Outro: Jordan Rakei, Frida Touray & Both]
Who we are
Would you kindly tell me
Who we are
Trying to find the reasons for
Who we are
Someday we'll know it all

[Verse 1]
I'm hoping for a good look
I'm hoping there's some real change coming
We're praying for a lost cause
When we are told we are not all welcome
You asked me for the real thing
I'm short on telling everyone nothing
My memories will only fade

[Pre-Chorus]
When we lose our control
It seems that this is a fantasy
Or a projection of anticipated memory
It's all in my hands to find a way
To lead me out of this place
For one last final time

[Chorus]
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me

[Verse 2]
We talked about it years ago
We sat upon a hill of frustration
It's never been like this before
Now it all seems we are not all welcome
I tell myself another lie
That it would all seem to get better
But now it's just an eye for an eye

[Pre-Chorus]
When we lose our control
It seems that this is a fantasy
Or a projection of anticipated memory
It's all in my hands to find a way
To lead me out of this place
For one last final time

[Chorus]
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me

[Verse 1]
So come and sit with me
How does this taste?
Not like you had hoped
Now that you taste the leaves
There's history in bitterness, you know
Sit down and look around
The bamboo at our feet from years ago
Tied down beneath the sea
The package drifts away
For all we know, yeah, know, yeah

[Chorus]
Warmth inside an ancient frame
Tell me, does it feel the same?
Ooh, the belly of the storm became
Enriched but it served you more

[Verse 2]
Lie here to taste the morning flowers in this place
Tell me, how do you feel? Yeah, feel, yeah
Your breath escapes the cup but scales down to the lake
Now we’re falling asleep, yeah, asleep, yeah

[Chorus]
Warmth inside an ancient frame
Tell me, does it feel the same?
Ooh, the belly of the storm became
Enriched but it served you more

[Outro]
Am I fit for consumption?
Have we forfeit the need of pleasure?
It surrounds me by the edges
You understand, yeah
Am I fit for consumption?
Have we forfeit the need of pleasure?
It surrounds me by the edges

[Verse 1]
I've been looking for a reason
I've been holding on for more
I want something to believe in
'Cause I've lived like this too long

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the light shine down on me
Down on me
Oh, to speak
Salvation cries aloud for me
She waits to see it closely
And down by the river
Mmh, all for that place we've all been fighting on
Await the tales of encore
And soulful resolution

[Chorus]
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way

[Verse 2]
I've been waiting years to hold you
But we keep on passing by
I walk the streets in silence
In silence, searching through the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the light shine down on me
Down on me
Oh, to speak
Salvation cries aloud for me
She waits to see it closely
And down by the river
Mmh, all for that place we've all been fighting on
Await the tales of encore
And soulful resolution

[Chorus]
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way
Forcing my way

[Bridge]
I'm tryna find the words to say
To send me on my way to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, to speak
Salvation cries aloud for me
She waits to see it closely
And down by the river
Mmh, all for that place we've all been fighting on
Await the tales of encore
And soulful resolution

[Chorus]
Oh, but we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way
Oh, we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way

[Verse 1]
Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy

[Chorus]
But don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this

[Chorus]
But don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

[Bridge]
So I'll walk out of here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say we're still friends
(But I don't wanna pretend)
So if I see you again

[Chorus]
Don't you (Don't you), don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you (Don't you) say you've
Missed me if you don't want me again
You don't (You don't) know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

[Outro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Don't you (Ah, ah, ah)

[Verse 1]
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you
Your face jumped right in my way
As things lately do
Oh baby can't you see
The thought of you makes a mess of me
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you

[Chorus]
And Now I
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'Bout you
Oh, ah

[Verse 2]
I get lost when I drive around town
Thinkin' 'bout your smile
Always ending' up
Your side of town
And I don't know why
Must be somethin' under this hood
Nobody's strong like you
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you

[Chorus]
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'Bout you

[Verse 3]
Your eyes are the color of
The great big sea
The one I go swimmin' in
Every time you look at me

[Chorus]
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'Bout you

[Outro]
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you

[Verse 1]
She's real pretty if you’re into that brunette
Looks good without any makeup on
Green eyes kind of thing
Uh huh
She's spontaneous, she ain't afraid of anything
She’s not the jealous type
She's the type you give a diamond ring

[Pre-Chorus]
And I came along, just after she walked out
Picking up the pieces 'til I've figured out

[Chorus]
There's a girl that you want
She's everything that I am not
And you can't stop thinking about her
There's a thin little line
And it’s like you cross it every time
When you can’t stop thinking about her

[Verse 2]
She came from a really small town
She liked to watch football with you
Well, I'd learn football too, if you wanted me to
Uh huh
She’s really good with babies, she'd be a great mother
She said I should really meet her sometime
Uh huh

[Pre-Chorus]
It's getting old, I wonder if you've seen
The favorite conversation’s killing me

[Chorus]
There's a girl that you want
She's everything that I am not
And you can't stop thinking about her
There's a thin little line
And it's like you cross it every time
When you can't stop thinking about her

[Bridge]
Don't you know I was a 4.0 in school?

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

[Verse 4: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin'
"Why did you let her go?"
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?

[Verse 5: Taylor Swift]
Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And, yeah, I bet you think about me

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

[Outro: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me"
I bet you think about me
(Verse 1)
There you are
Standin' there like you don’t know what to say
And I move like this
Here I am, racing myself, I wanna know what's coming now, what a waste

(Pre-Chorus)
Well all of that time, I thought you were mine
Was I just kidding myself?
For letting it go, and loving you so, don't you dare tell me not to look at you like that

(Chorus)
Gonna look at you like that, I’m gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it's the last thing that I do, I'm gonna make this hard on you while I, look at you like that

(Verse 2)
Won't you say, that we can still be friends
It doesn't work that way
And don't you dare think, that a pack of all my tears can take that
Crying out when I'm alone

(Pre-Chorus)
Doing right here, I'm crying right now, you can watch me crumble down, that’s for breaking my heart, so baby don’t stop, thinking you could ask me not to look at you like, that
(Chorus)
Gonna look at you like that, I'm gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it’s the last thing that I do, I'm gonna make this hard on you while I, look at you like that

(Bridge)
Don't you tell me to be strong, and make it harder than it has to be, after you don't call, and remember what you’ve done to me

(Chorus)
'Cause I'm gonna look at you like that, gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it's the last thing that I do, after what you put me through, I'm gonna have to let you know,

[???]

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah
Gonna look at you like that
Look at you, Look at you, Look at you, like that
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah..

[Verse 1]
Mr. "Perfect face"
Mr. "Here to stay"
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
Everything was right
Mr. "I've been waitin' for you all my life"
Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"

[Pre-Chorus]
But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"
Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay

[Chorus]
Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"

[Verse 2]
Mr. "Never told me why"
Mr. "Never had to see me cry"
Mr. "Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy"
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you

[Chorus]
Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"

[Verse 3]
So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay your way to your seat
It's the best seat, in the best room
Oh, he's so smug, Mr. "Always wins"
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

[Bridge]
And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss "Here to stay"
Now I'm Miss "Gonna be alright someday"
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be Mr. "Too late"

[Chorus]
Goodbye, Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Goodbye, Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss Misery for the last time
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"

[Outro]
You're perfectly fine
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
You said you'd never go away

[Verse 1]
Love one another as how you love your mother
And everything to man will be in a good hand
(Destiny)
Mama-ma lose it don't you call me
(Destiny)

[Verse 2]
Forgive and forget and you'll never regret
The good things you will live right after you
(Destiny)
Mama-ma lose it don't you call me
(Destiny)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Do unto others, as they may do to you
The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too
(Destiny)
Mama-ma lose it, don't you call me
(Destiny)

[Verse 4]
Love one another as how you love your mother
And everything to man will be in a good hand
(Destiny)
Mama ma lose it don't you call me
(Destiny)

[Outro]
Every man for your own penalty
(Destiny)
Mama, mama, mama, mama, lose it
(Destiny)
Mama, mama, lose it, don't you call me
(Destiny)
Oh, I know you call me
(Destiny)

[Loop]
So you don't know where you're going

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you

[Chorus]
You can take a picture of something you see
Or swim a river out to the sea
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And they're talking it to me
And they're talking it to me
And they're talking it to me
And they're talking it to me

[Chorus]
You can take a picture of something you see
Or swim a river out to the sea
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done

[Bridge]
So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk?
You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored?
When you worry about the future and the 3rd world war
When you worry about the future and the 3rd world war

[Verse 1]
I'm up in the part of the throne
I'm trying to sing a song
In a language I don't speak
I try but I can't get through
I'm trying to get to you
But you're difficult to reach

[Chorus]
You can take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung

[Verse 2]
Under the great North star
Try to work out where you are
In the silence of the sea
I don't know where I'll be
In the future, in the past
Going nowhere much too fast
When I go there, go with me
Ah, got to find your missing piece

[Bridge]
When I go there
When I go there
When I go there

[Outro]
So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk?
And you feel like you're going where you've been before?
You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored?
Nothing's really making any sense at all, let's talk
Let's talk

[Verse 1]
Oh, brother I can't, I can't get through
I’ve been trying hard to reach you 'cause I don’t know what to do
Oh, brother, I can't believe it's true
I’m so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you

[Chorus]
You can take a picture of something you see
Or swim a river out to the sea
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done

[Verse 2]
Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how do you feel
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

[Chorus]
So you take a picture of something you see
Or swim a river out to the sea
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done
Or do something that's never been done

[Outro]
So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk?
You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored?
When you worry about the future and the third world war
Nothing's really making any sense at all, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk

[Verse 1]
Last night, she tested my endurance (Damn)

My money turn her on, it make her horny (Horny)
Bumblebee-butt, my type a hornet (Muah)
By business is boomin', I'm on a journey (Rackies)

Money pourin', call Riri because it's pourin' (Ri')
Four different Rolls Royce umbrellas, man, I'm a tourist (Ooh)
I'm so saditty and pretty, could be a flourist
Have you looked at me recently? I look gorgeous (Muah)
With my pretty, saditty bitch, but really, she innocent (Huh?)
But she the drug dealer-bitch, get the pain and the benefits
In the backseat, gettin' intimate, new Bentley, I tinted it
Jerk on that dick like a pogostick, then eat nut like it Benedict

[Chorus]
I was dead-broke, now I got that bread now (Wop, damn)
I'm so impatient, I can't wait to bring that bread out (Woo)

Damn-near woke up all the children (Shh)

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Every night, every day, how about every lifetime?
Yeah, I know what they say, and that's fine
'Cause I'm here to stay through the good and the bad times
Baby, save me a space in your mind, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Well, call me crazy
And people saying that we move too fast
But I've been waiting, and for a reason

Nothing matters any longer, now I got you here with me
I think about you every time I, every time I lose myself again
I lose myself again

[Verse 1]
I've been wondering what to wear
I love our noon rendezvous
I know you tell me you missed me
And I want to make love to you

[Chorus]
Your words they intoxicate me
I shiver each time that you speak
How much more can I endure, my love?
The sound of your voice makes me weak

[Verse 2]
If my body functions operate
This way when you just call my name
I'd hate to see when we are finally
Playing that nasty love game

[Chorus]
Your words they intoxicate me
I shiver each time that you speak
How much more can I endure, my love?
The sound of your voice makes me weak

[Verse 3]
The words are all over your face, my love
What shall you or shall I do?
You could show me some new tricks, my love
I'd love to be taught by you

[Outro]
I've been wondering what to wear
I love our noon rendezvous

[Verse 1]
Blush, eyeliner
Hush, see what you made me do?
Base, mascara
Erase, I wanna look good for you
Comb, hair
Don't care, I hate to comb my hair
Make-up

Pink, blue
Purple, I wanna make it good for you

[Verse 1]
There’s a fairy tale that says
Once upon a time
Funky music belonged to people who
Drank cheap wine

[Chorus]
That’s why I gotta get on my own way
That’s the new golden rule
Enjoy the closest human
I’m much too hot to be cool
100 miles an hour, baby
That’s what it’s all about
I need a lover that can slow me down
Somebody that’ll make me shout

[Verse 2]
There’s a misconception that says
Everything on the one (Everything on the one)
Then my first reaction is just try to
Have a little fun

[Chorus]
That’s why I gotta get on my own way
That’s the new golden rule
Enjoy the closest human
I’m much too hot to be cool
100 miles an hour, baby
That’s what it’s all about
I need a lover that can slow me down
Somebody that’ll make me shout
Uh, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha, oh

[Verse 3]
There’s a fairy tale that says
Twice in the Land of Oz (Twice in the Land of Oz)
Dorothy make love to the Lion because
Because, because

That’s the new golden rule
Enjoy the closest human
I’m much too hot to be cool
100 miles an hour, baby

I need a lover that can slow me down
Somebody that’ll make me shout (Make me shout)

Gonna make me shout

[Verse 1]
You want to know if I care for you
You ought to know by now
How can you stand there just pretending
When you know how I feel?

[Chorus]
Oh baby, you're my love
And I love everything you do to me, yeah
You're my love
And I love when you're around
You're my love
And I'll never let you down

[Verse 2]
You want to know what I see in you, oh
I can't really say for sure
All I know is that I need you, oh
More than I've ever needed anyone else before

[Chorus]
Oh baby, you're my love
And I love everything you do to me
You're my love
And I love when you're around, yeah
You're my love, I love when you're around

[Bridge]
Seasons changing faster than they did when we were young
It's funny but we didn't seem to care
The only thing we cared about was keeping our love strong
And as long as you're there, I'll always care

[Chorus]
You're my love
I love what you do to me
You're my love
I love when you're around, oh baby

[Outro]
Honey, my love, yeah, yeah, yeah
Stop your pretending, you know how I feel
I love you babe, love you babe, love you babe
Love you, love you, love you, yeah, yeah
Love you, I love you

I, I, I love you
You're my love, you're my love, yeah, oh yeah

[Intro]
Don't you get me

[Verse 1]
She wears a long fur coat of mink
Even in the summer time
Everybody knows from the coy little wink
The girl's got a lot on her mind
She's got
Big thoughts
Big dreams
And a big brown Mercedes sedan
What I think this girl
She really wants is to be in love with a man

[Chorus]
She wants to lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love it ain't much

[Verse 2]
She saw him standing in the section marked
"If you have to ask, you can't afford it" lingerie (Lingerie)
She threw him bread and said "Make me scream"
In the dark, what could he say? (What could he say?)
Boys with small talk and small minds
Really don't impress me in bed
She said "I need a man's man baby"
Diamonds and furs
Love would only conquer my head

[Chorus]
She wants to lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love it ain't much

[Verse 3]
They made haste in the brown sedan
They drove to 55 Secret Street
They made love and by the seventh wave
She knew she had a problem
She thought real love is real scary
Money only pays the rent
Love is forever, that's all your life
Love is heaven sent
It's glamorous

[Chorus]
Lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love it ain't much, it ain't much
She wants to lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love it ain't much, it ain't much
Lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love it ain't much, it ain't, ain't, ain't much

[Verse 1]
I guess you've heard of my reputation
I've had my share of foolin' around
But everybody needs stimulation
And mine just happens to be all over town
It's an easy money occupation
A first-class psychiatry
But just once, I'd like to make love without taking off my clothes
Just once, I wanna make love with somebody who really and truly knows

[Chorus]
Contrary to rumor, gigolos get lonely too
All my lovers need stimulation
But honey, babe, I think that I need you

[Verse 2]
Maybe you're the kind of person
That could turn my world around
Won't you gimme a little inspiration?
Maybe that's what I need to make me settle down
It's an easy money occupation
But honey, one thing, understand
I've got more money than you could imagine in your wildest dreams
But honey, money don't make no happy man 'cause

[Chorus]
Contrary to rumor, gigolos get lonely too (Yes they do)
All my lovers need stimulation
But honey, babe, I think that I need you

[Bridge]
Just once, I wanna love without takin' off my clothes
Just once, I wanna love with somebody who knows
That I got more money than you could ever see
But honey, money won't make me get me up off my knees

[Chorus]
Gigolos get lonely too, yeah
All my lovers need stimulation
But honey, babe, I think that I need you
Contrary to rumor (Yeah), gigolos get lonely too
All my women need stimulation, yeah
Honey, babe (Honey, babe)
You babe

[Verse 1]
Every summer in the gardens of Florence
A peasant of female persuasion
Used to cry for Michaelangelo
To save her from death's invitation
Some say this woman was crazy
Others say this woman was possessed
Just one look at her face
And it's evident to her he was the best (Oh)

[Chorus]
Dear Michaelangelo
Color the dreams in my head
I look at your paintings
And I'm with you in your bed
Dear Michaelangelo
Save me from death's invitation
I'll make love to no one unless he's of your persuasion

[Verse 2]
By summer's end came many offers
All of which the peasant refused
She wanted Michaelangelo
And no other, no other man would do
No one could speak of passion and touch her
Touch her the way he does
No one except Michaelangelo
It was him or a life without love

[Chorus]
Dear Michaelangelo
Color the dreams in my head
I look at your paintings
And I'm with you in your bed
Dear Michaelangelo
Save me from death's invitation
I'll make love to no one unless he's of your persuasion

[Bridge]
A life without love
A life without love
Don't die
Don't die without love
Dear Michaelangelo
Dear Michaelangelo

[Chorus]
Dear Michaelangelo
Color the dreams in my head
I look at your paintings
And I'm with you in your bed
Dear Michaelangelo
Save me from death's invitation
I'll make love to no one unless he's of your persuasion

[Post-Chorus]
Dear, dear
Dear Michaelangelo
Angel

[Outro]
Dear Michaelangelo
Color the dreams in my head
I look at your paintings
And I'm with you in your bed
Dear Michaelangelo
Save me from death's invitation
I'll make love to no one unless he's of your persuasion
Dear Michaelangelo
Color the dreams in my head
I look at your paintings
And I'm with you in your bed
Dear Michaelangelo
Save me from death's invitation
I'll make love to no one unless he's of your

[Verse 1]
Look into my big brown eyes
Tell me what's on your mind
Do you really love me?
Or do you just wanna make some time?
See, I don't really care
I just want a little company
I can tell by the look in your eyes
That you really, really want me

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you love to love me?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to love me, baby?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to be with me alone?
Wouldn't you love to have me for your very own?

[Verse 2]
I'm really not that hard to get
I only wanna make you see
That baby, I'm not ready yet
To give you every part of me
I don't want to tease you
I only wanna turn you on
I know I can please you, baby
'Til your rocks are gone
'Til all is gone

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you love to love me?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to love me?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to be with me alone?
Wouldn't you love to have me for your very own?

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody singin'
Don't you wanna be with me alone?

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you love to love me?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to love me, baby?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to love me?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to love me, baby?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you love to be with me alone?
Wouldn't you love to have me for your very own?

[Bridge]
Tell me what's on your mind
Don't you want to be with me alone?
Don't you want to have me for your very own?
Wanna love me
I want you tonight 'til my blood sings

[Outro]
Wouldn't you love to be with me alone?
Wouldn't you love to have me for your very own?
I love you, you love me
My baby, don't you wanna love me?

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Kiss the tears right off your face
Won't get scared, that's the old, old, old me
I'll be there time and place
Lay it on me, all you're hold, hold, holding

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Time, time only heals if we work through it now
And I promise we'll figure this out

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
I will take your pain

Just tell me where to start
I thank the oceans for giving me you
You saved me once and now I'll save you too
I won't hesitate for you

Don't you ever say goodbye
Cross my heart, and you can keep, keep, keep mine
If I could only read your mind
Then I could map out all the ways to make it right

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Time, time only heals if we work through it now
I, I promise we'll figure this out

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]

You saved me once and now I'll save you too

Pull me close and I'll hold you tight
Don't be scared 'cause I'm on your side

Pull me close and I'll hold you tight
Don't be scared 'cause I'm on your side
Know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you

[Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I will take your pain
And put it on my heart
I won't hesitate

I thank the oceans for giving me you
You saved me once and I'll save you too
I won't hesitate for you

Could you, could you come on?
Could you come on together

Gonna crawl my way and I climb home because

Pullout mash forward
Smelling like a a gas leak
Pullout the black bomber
Engine in the back seat Haulin
Why I feel like Tony Starks
We used to use the iron with the starch
My own lady is so spoiled
My old Chevy got new chrome on it
Pullout mash forward
I bet they never catch me
Feels like Tony Starks
Ouuu the irony
Cool out in that corner
I don't want to network
Pocket full of business cards
I think I'm too nice, i'm too charming
She told her me life was straight forward
She wanted a ticket but can't pay for it
We falling in love, we falling in love
Best teef in the game is all that she wants

[Intro]
Oh My God Ronny!!

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
We are all they talk about
We are all they talk about
Young and do what I want
That need a chain that's what they hate about

Young and do what I want
That needed fame that's what they hate about

[Post-Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
They talk about me
They talk about you but not like dat

[Intro: Eminem]
(Remix!)
A crafty little bastard that I am, sly
Would've put the slick sick son of a bitch
Silly little rabbit, don't you know Trix are for kids?
This is what the moral of the story is
(Cheah!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black white or albino, yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See, if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keep makin' them tired old threats
A little bit like The Boy Who Cried Wolf, yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
'Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts, right out the sky, go bad
From out of nowhere, you might just find your career
Come to it, (Eek!) and I'm just like (Oh, yeah!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You jealous little fucks beg for my attention, but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit (Yeah)
Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squash it
'Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let 'em, inside's like "Go get 'em"
And I'm just like "Why you're tryin' to fight momentum?"
We just keep winnin', by landslides, oh, and um
Shady Limited's, in any size yo' denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say "Our clothing line's on Fiyaa''
Meanwhile, your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I'll just keep fucking you like I fucked her
Right in the ass with K-Y, yes, sir!
So full of joy, boy, am I absurd?
Even Chingy would tell you: "Yeah, boy, don't curr"

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!) (Ca$his!)

[Verse 3: Ca$his]
Watch Jimmy get cracked to the floor with the rounds
Spun around and hit the ground, you the new James Brown
The king of Motown saw out for a while
You not a genius, you a joke, and they all know now
I don't brag about the way that I lived in the past
I'd spray, I'd get away up with whoopin' your ass
From now on, don't speak up, name me your raps
Before I hop out your bushes, dressed in all black
I thought I told you, Ca$his can suck you clean
Squeeze life out the beat, all you hear is me (Mwah!)
I'm a BBG, plus a BGD
Bring it on anytime you wanna come see me
Stay alive little guy, you don't want it with me
And man, 50 put that money on me
King Mathers made me to blow up
Re-Up 'bout to crush, now you know Ca$his!
Shady!

[Chorus: Eminem]
See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh, yeah!)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh, yeah!)
So Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh, yeah!)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em!)
And where is D12 at, they're like (We over here!)
And where the fuck we goin', we're like (Nowhere!)

My daddy Alabama, mama Louisiana (Ooh yeah)
You mix that negro with that Creole, make a Texas bama

Earned all this money, but they never take the country out me (Yeah)

Sometimes I go off (I go off), I go hard (I go hard)

Thugger
*sips*
Man, nowadays, like...

(Wheezy Beats)
I don't even wanna see the victory, na'm sayin'?
I don't even wanna see the... the records I broke, na'm sayin'?
Nevermind that, you na'm sayin'?
'Cause when you see it, you na'm sayin'?
The moment you see it...
You start taking heat for it...
And you slow your roll, you na'm sayin'?
I don't ever wanna slow my roll, I wanna always feel like I didn't break the records, you na'm sayin'?
So I can keep breaking records...
Dig that

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Ashin' blunts inside my Grammys (Uh)
Porsche Calado nigga, whip it panoramic
Clothes neat, shoes tied, like I'm 'bout to run it
Concierge tryna get me sent up off the planet
Trick or Treat like a lil' old boy

[?] (What you say?)
Chop off the top and I leave it down
You riding with me, truth or dare?
Pull off in a foreign coupe-coupe-coupe
Cash on delivery, whoop-whoop-whoop
You told me that you living, but me too
Cash talk always, runnin' through the hallways
Chasin' money always, answer, never call back
All my niggas racked up, all my bitches bad, yeah
If he play, then mask up, gon' shoot 'em up-up, hey
My momma a black panther just like Cam Newton
I pray to the Lord, then I start shootin'
I get thrax for my soul, but they gotta prove it
Eeny-meeny-miny-moe, nigga, let's do it
Gon' and get it off your chest
Get some more clips and get a vest
Get around your bitch and give her less
Shoot 'em in his flesh and watch him rest
Catch your bitch and make the bitch flush
Catch your bitch and watch his bitch lush
Drain the babies, baby, better not flush
Icy, who want it with us?
Three hundred twelve thousand for a Bentley truck
Another fifty just to pipe the system up
A hundred eighty thousand for the Patek
Everybody whippin', Super Mario
Everybody livin', ain't no 

[?]
Everybody really gettin' they own dough
Everybody whippin' up they own coke
Everybody subscribing they own folks
Everybody know, you say you don't know
Everybody bitches getting lipo
Everybody livin' to the fullest
All these hoes are stallions like they broncos

[Bridge: Young Thug & Gunna]
Bronco (Bronco)

[Verse 2: Gunna]
My momma a black panther just like Thugga momma too
I know you wanna fuck me baby, gon' and tell the truth
They thought it was a game 'til I started bustin' out the roof

[?] when I ride through
I done been through so much, I been lied to
I wouldn't tell you go do something I wouldn't do
System so fucked up, I can't go by the rules
They just made a law I couldn't abide to
I wouldn't go out sad even if I tried to
Lately I been eatin' steak and not no fast food
You been sellin' music off of iTunes
Fuck who askin' 

[?] everything new
Said we goin' up and bro, it's times two
I just tell security "Let them dimes through"
You know we fuck these bitches all around the city
We fuck 'em by the two, we ménagin' it
Put her on a jet, I let her fly with me
Told them bitches "Come on, spend some time with me"
Private Leers takin' off, the lean spillin'
Man, I need to wake up, think I'm still dreamin'
They callin' for these pints, these niggas still fiendin'
Hope the Lord protect me from the real demons
Had a party, was so crazy, cleaners still cleanin'
Smashin' in them Beamers, nigga, wheely beamin'
I just made some friends that like to eat the semen
Told my niggas that I'm done, ain't fuckin' with the pieces
Hit a nigga block and leave 'em rest in pieces
I tried to tell 'em listen, nigga, we them teachers

[Outro: Gunna]
We the teachers

[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

[Chorus]
Share my world
Don't you leave
Promise I'll be here
Whenever you need me near
Share my world
Don't you leave
Promise I'll be here
So baby don't you have no fear

Share my world
Don't you leave
Promise I'll be here
Whenever you need me near
Share my world
Don't you leave
Promise I'll be here
So baby don't you have no fear

[Outro]
Ooh, la la la

You're so nice, but tonight we're gonna be more than just friends

[Pre-Chorus]
I recall the days and ways of love we made

It would all decease

And you'll be at peace with yourself
You won't really need no one else
(Except who? Except who, baby?)
Except for the man up above
(And why is that? And why is that?)
Because He'll give you love
Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh

I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)

[Verse 1]
Sitting here
Wondering why you don't love me
The way that I love you
And baby, have no fear
'Cause I would never ever hurt you
And you know my love is real
Boy, I can
(Come on, L.A., let me hear y'all)

I know some times
Can get rough but we'll make it
We'll make it through the storm
And I know I will try
To make sure that you can trust me
And you know the reason why that I say

[Bridge]
(I can love you) I can love you
A little better than she can, oh
(I know that you) I know that you
Wish that you could be my man
'Cause I can love you better than she can

[Chorus]
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)

You take me away from the pain

Y'all hear it every day, it's called Seven Days
And that shit happen all the time

(Tell them your story)

[Verse 1]
I've been searching for someone
But never looked before my eyes
There you were to my surprise
It was so obvious looking into your face
After playing a game of truth or dare
I wanted to stay at your place
I never thought that I
Would fall in love with you
But since the day we kissed
I knew it had to be you
I never thought we would be together
I can't believe I just made love to you
After all the things that we've been through
Now what are we gonna do?
Oh

[Chorus]
Monday, a friend of mine
Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away
Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back
I wanted to kiss you
On Saturday
On Sunday we made love
Now what are we gonna do?

[Interlude]
Now ladies, after lettin' this nigga get y'all all strung out
And he wanna start actin' stupid

Don't claim your ass is ready (Remix) when you're not (Remix)
'Cause if you play me out, I'll blow up your spot
And I don't care where you are (Say what?) or what you say (Uh-huh)
Or what you do (Uh)
And I don't care who you wit'
It could be your bitch or even your crew, oh oh, yeah yeah yeah
I never thought that I would have to step to you
About the way you move, but this conversation is due
Now let me know if we're together, I refuse to be your fool
Trust me, the last thing you wanna do is make me lose my cool
Oh

[Chorus]
Monday, a friend of mine

[Intro]
Oh, baby baby baby baby, oh, oh
Help me out in here, y'all, tonight
Come on

[Verse 1]
While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself (Say what?)
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids I have nothing to show
Wasted my years, a fool of a wife
I shoulda left your ass long time ago

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears, no no
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well, I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears, no no
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

[Verse 2]
I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I shoulda left your ass a thousand times

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
(See, I can do much better, yeah)
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
(Never gonna shed a tear over you, oh no)
Well, I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
(See, I'm not gonna cry no more)
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

[Bridge]
I know there are no guarantees
See, in love you take your chances
But somehow it seems fucked up to me
Just look at the circumstances
Through sickness and health (Say what?), 'til death do us part
Those were the words that we said from our hearts
So now when you say that you're leaving me
I don't get that part, hell no no no

[Verse 3]
I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping him get on his feet
Eleven years of sacrifice
And he can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I shoulda left your ass a thousand times

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears, oh no no
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well, I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
(I'm not gonna cry)
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
(And you're wrong)
Well, I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
(I'm not gonna shed a tear)
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well, I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my, oh no
I said he was never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever worth any of these tears
He wasn't worth it?
Was he worth it, ladies? Hell no
But you know what? We ain't gon' miss him, fuck it
But guess what?

[Spoken Intro]
For those of you tonight that might be missing somebody
Loved one, I don't know

And if you know this, just help me sing it, the whole place, whoever don't want to
But please, the ones that do, help me out

[Verse 1]
I'm not in love

It's just some kind of thing I'm goin' through (What?)
Goin' through (What?), goin' through (Uh), yeah
And it's not infatuation, oh no no no
Ain't nothin' goin' on between me and you (Who?)
Me and you (Who?), me and you, yeah

But I dream about it every night, baby, yeah
Wanting you here with me

Over and over and over and over and over again, yeah
And I'm not the least bit amused by it, baby
But still I don't wanna be with nobody else
No no no

[Pre-Chorus]
But I dream about it all the time, oh
Touchin' and kissin' me
And making love to me
And oh

[Chorus]
I'm missing you like crazy
(Oh, I'm missing you like crazy)
Body and soul is achin'
I'm out of control
(Out of control, out of control, I missed you)
Missing you so
(Oh, I am missing you so)

[Bridge]
Lord knows I'm tryin' to keep him out of my head
I ain't tryin' to love no one, no no
I ain't tryin' to get hurt again
You understand what I'm sayin'?
But there's something that just gets in my skin
And all I know is I can't let go
And that's the way it is

[Chorus]
I'm missing you like crazy
(Oh, I'm missing you like crazy)
Body and soul is achin'
I'm out of control
Missing you so
(Oh, I, I, I, I)

[Bridge]
Missing you
Trying to go somewhere, y'all
Missing you
Oh, but I'm gonna be missing

Oh, I just got a few questions, y'all, tonight

Stick with me, please don't go away
But I know that when I'm gone
When I'm gone I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you, Los Angeles
I'm missing you

[Intro]
Ooh ooh
If my mother was out there, I'd dedicate this to her tonight
Ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
Oh, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I'd get you off of my mind
But I can't
Just the thought of you (Just the thought of you)
My love and my whole world misty blue (Misty blue)

[Verse 2]
Oh honey, just the mention of your name (Just your name)
Turns the flicker to a flame
Listen to me good, baby
I think of the things that we used to do
And my whole world turns misty blue (Misty blue)

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby, baby
When I say that I'm glad we're through
Deep in my heart I know I lied
(You know I tried)
I lied
Baby, baby, when I say that I'm glad we're through
Oh, deep in my heart I know I lied, I know I lied
Oh oh, yeah yeah, baby, baby baby baby baby
Baby, I can't forget you
Heaven knows I tried, heaven knows I tried
And oh, oh oh, yeah, oh
No I can't, no I can't, oh I can't, I can't forget you
And my whole world turns misty blue (Misty blue)
Hey hey yeah

Oh, baby baby, baby baby baby, baby I can't
Said I can't forget you
If you know the song, sing along
Ooh, 'cause my whole world turns misty blue (Misty blue)

[Outro]
And I wanna say, before I go right now tonight, y'all
Because I don't have anything else unless you wanna hear it
I wanna say from the bottom of my heart
Now I really know what love is, from a distance
And it's real love, and I wanna thank each and every one of you
For supporting me, 'cause I could not have done it without you
And I'll be misty blue if I didn't have your love
And if it was you, I'd be out there screaming and cheering for you
Yeah, yeah, baby, baby, I should forget you

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I asked for a sign from my sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me, but when
You think you're in love, you only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you, and you for me

[Rap: Greg Nice]
Hey, yo, Mary, can we flip it once more?
I think it's 'bout time that we make an encore
Greg N-I-C-E straight bustin' through the door
Uplift the soul and much, much more
If you're feelin' down, baby doll, I'll make you happy
Not your brother, your mother, sister, need for your pappy
If you need me, you know where to find me
Real love, be happy, you remind me

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

[Verse]
Thank you love
You made me happy in so many ways
Through all my sweet and tender yesterdays
You were the sunshine I needed love
Mmm, you were there
You warmed my heart when troubled skies would come
You were my one and only faithful one
I wanna really really thank you love
Oh, thank you love
With all my heart and soul I thank you love
Each day that comes and goes I thank you love
I thank you 'cause you gave me true love
Oh, I was lost
Somewhere along life's road I was lost
And on that lonesome road our bridges crossed
You showed me the way to tender love
Oh, it's a miracle
Just like the sunshine makes the flower grow
That's just the way you change my whole life show
Through the sunshine of your tender love
Whoa, oh, thank you love
With every breath I take I thank you love
With every new daybreak I thank you love
I thank you 'cause you gave me true love
Oh, my darling, when I'm down
You'll gently squeeze these hands of mine
And I feel just like a child at Christmas time
'Cause I could feel the nearness of your love
Oh, my darling, I've been blessed
A precious thing is this that I possess
Could fill this heart of mine with happiness
I wanna really really thank you love
Oh, my baby, thank you love
With all my heart and soul I thank you love
Each day that comes and goes I thank you love
I thank you 'cause you gave me true true love
Thank you, thank you, thank you

[Verse]
If I ruled the world
Every day would be the first day of Spring
And every heart would have a new song to sing
And you know we'd sing of the joy every morning would bring
If I ruled the world
Every man would be as free as a bird
Every voice would be a voice to be heard
Why don't you take my word
We would treasure every day that occurred

[Bridge]
My world would be a beautiful place
Where we would weave such wonderful dreams
And my world would wear a smile on its face
Like the man in the moon has when the moon beams

[Outro]
If I ruled the world
Every man would say the world was his friend
There'd be so much happiness that no one could end
No, my friend
Not if I ruled the world
And every man would hold his head up high
There'd be sunshine in everybody's sky
Ooh, if a day ever dawned that I...
If I had anything to do with it I think it should be
If I ruled the world

[Chorus]

You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving

If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving (But I'm not leaving)

He says, "Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps"

That he’s here, means he’s never lost

Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving (But I'm not leaving)

Take these sunken eyes and learn to see

You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Yo, what's up?
Yo man, if that Rodney King shit would’ve jumped off with me man, that shit would've been a total different episode

[Skit: Sample]
Well, I might not be able to let you off so easy there Jimbo. See, you were doing 65 in a 35, and you ran a red light. That's reckless driving as far as I’m concerned! Who else you got in there with you Jimbo, huh? What the hell is going on in here? Alright, everybody out of the vehicle right now!

(Don't do it! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! God, don't shoot! Please don't shoot!)

You're a cop. I know you man. I know what you're thinking. You’re thinking, "We got us another crazy nigga here with a gun," well let me tell you something: Human life means very little to me at this point in time. You see, I thrive on misery. In the jungle, misery’s all you got, but, things are different back here in the world, or so they seem. Nobody wants to talk about pain and suffering. Everybody wants everything to be nice and civil. Well, okay then. Let's be nice. Let’s be civil. And let's drop those guns before I pull this trigger and change the way you feel about me!

[Interlude: Reporter]
"Yes, we have—there have been riots, ah, uh, rioting. Well, I don't wanna say rioting, but there’s been looting downtown. But right now, Bree, what I want to show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street."

[Refrain: RBX + Sample]
How many niggas like police?

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Sitting in my living room, calm and collected
Feeling that gotta-kill-a-cop perspective
'Cause what I just heard broke me in half
So fuck Daryl Gates and the whole police staff
Laugh now, but cry much later
You see when niggas get together
They get mad 'cause they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They found that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the Ese's helpin', nigga, it's time to rob and mob
(And break the white man off something lovely
I don't love dem so dem can't love me)
Yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on
It's jumping off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or somethin'
Got a VCR in the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And the police better not try to stop me
'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
'Cause I gives a fuck about a motherfucking cop

[Interlude: Reporter + Reporter 2]
"Yes, on the videotape we seem to have the, ah, people in the crowd throwing things at the officers."
"And swinging at them as well, as a result a young woman there, you see took a swing at at an officer with some object in her hand."

[Refrain: RBX + Sample]
How many niggas like police?
We don't love 'em!
We don't like 'em!
I said how many niggas like police?
We don't love 'em!
We don't like 'em!

[Hook: RBX (x2)]
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I wanna see you laying in a coffin sir

[Verse 3: RBX]
One-time trigger happy, no nigga love
One-eighty-seven time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints on a nine I throw away
Or get prints on my Uzi when it spray
Pop, pop, pop, another cop just dropped
And I get relief like, plop, plop, fizz
Smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't Nintendo, I'm high off the indo
Creepin', with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on a donut
And crack-up, so now he call for back up
I guess I gots to pack up, filling the clip up
I zip uptown but motherfuckin' cops are all around
Helicopters flyin', these motherfuckers tryin'
To catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no, the poor blacks refuse to go

[Interlude: Reporter]
"This is now covering a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these fires have been, uh, ignited. I mean, from here to the, uh, to the south end of South Central is a long way."

[Hook: RBX (x4)]
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
I wanna see you laying in a coffin sir

[Outro: Prince Ital Joe]
Gunshot, Dem ah go bust
Dem ah go bust, bust, bust
Jamaican posse, yuh gon bust gunshot
Death Row posse, yuh gon bust gunshot

Jamaican posse, wi nuh like police, and
Death Row posse, they nuh like police, come follow mi
Nuh like police
Wi nuh like police
Don't like police, and police don't like mi

[Chorus 1]
We had the greatest time
At Frank Sinatra's party
We drank expensive wine
Then watched the night roll by

[Chorus 2]
I saw a showgirl dance
With Sammy Davis Jr
They had a brief romance
Under the desert sky

[Chorus 3]
Fee, fi, fo, fum
I’m not the only Englishman
I'm under cover, but plenty of others
Are already flying high

[Chorus 4]
See Angie Dickinson
Bump into Peter Lawford
She's out to have some fun
He doesn’t seem to mind

[Chorus 5]
You don't have to doubt yourself
No, not on a night like this

[Chorus 6]
Jump in the swimming pool
Say hi to Dino Martin
He's hot to play it cool
Watching the girls go by

[Chorus 3]
Fee, fi, fo, fum
I'm not the only Englishman
I'm under cover, but some of my brothers
Are already flying high

[Chorus 7]
Come and enjoy yourself
At Frank Sinatra's party
We had the greatest time
Watching the night go by

And no bad vibe is gon' spoil mine
No such thing as the right time or wrong time
We don't do small time, we do royal time
I pictured myself here as a small guy
Switched up gears from Nasty Nas and Nasir like
Cassius Clay to Ali, the greatest of all time
Financial page, my name in New York Times
Incredible milestones forever
It's set-in-stone, MJB the letters
Everybody that try to violate, we beat 'em for God's sake
Never mind that I'm reachin' my prime the second time, that's great
In record time, stop the hate
And love your life, fix your crown up straight
I dodged bullets and jail time and kept drivin'
Stood tall through it all, keep thrivin'

[Verse 1]
What cruel world is this? Nectar of the Gods
Heroin gold in my veins and you in my thoughts
I'm on the freeway racing at a million and I just can’t stop
I call you up twice, hang up the phone, call again, I wanna talk

[Chorus]

Once I found my way, but now I am lost

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
With you
With you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Ugh, this is kinda how my heart sounds
Every beat like a image in the background
I'm sittin' here, thinkin' "where is you now?"
I wanna tell you but there's too many people round
You know I love you, I care but it's unfair
I ain't perfect but I'm tryna be the best I can
If it's real than it's gon' come back again
So I'm letting go, I hope you understand
All your friends say, he don't love you
And the grown ups say it's puppy
Love ain't lust, it's more unlucky
Until you meet a diamond girl, now it's sunny
Loving you, it was us against the world
You my favorite girl, for you, I would go to war
I take this all in just to show you
Or maybe I'm just stuck in the moment

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Now Romeo & Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're trippin' in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher
I don't care
I got you, baby
See, we both fightin' every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
See, like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray
Reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go
So we'll never know

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
Yeah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place (Oh no no)
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (And space)
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Sitting here, all alone watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days when we threw them snow balls
I can't believe I'm putting the tree up by myself
I need you and nobody else

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
'Cause I need you here and I want for you to know

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

[Verse 2]
And I never wanna do this alone
Baby I just need you to be here, here through the holidays, yeah
I just wanna know if you feel same way
Because I'm lonely baby, want you to hold me baby

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
I just want you to know I miss you and I want you to stay

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
Al I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

[Bridge]
Wrapping gifts without you babe's like mid-December
And there's no cold, I can't do this on my own
I've changed my ways
Keep running back and forth again, I'm here to stay, yeah

[Chorus]
And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

[Outro]
All I want is you this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas

Screaming in the field
As I was born
Worm
Will you return me
To the robin's beak?
I'll be a bird

[Chorus]
Terminal
We both know
Let the rest of me go
See my death become a trail
And the trail leads to a flower
I will blossom in your sail
Every dream and waking hour

Woman

Hold me in your heat
'Til I remember

[Chorus]
Terminal
We both know
Let me rest, let me go
See my death become a trail
And the trail leads to a flower
I will blossom in your sail
Every dream and waking hour

[Chorus: Still Woozy]
Love me like I'm six feet underneath the ground (oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's so cold and nice, there's nobody around (oh-oh, oh-oh)
In the afternoon, tryna find the time (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Yeah there's no way that I won't
They can't hold me in the ground

[Verse 1: Omar Apollo]
No me haces caso en la via de mi amor
Amo tu perfume porque tú le das color
A ser a mí me parece a mí
Mima entiende y ya cae besándote la boca
Besándote la boca y ya

[Chorus: Still Woozy]
Love me like I'm six feet underneath the ground (oh-oh, oh-oh)

No, they can hold me in the ground

Roses grow in the darkness

The lights don't cut when you're outside
You need me
There's a bar outside if you need me, yeah
Less is more in a free world

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Verse 2: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Verse 1]
The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends
He said, I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now

[Chorus]
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied

[Verse 2]
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

[Chorus]
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied
Don't know why I feel
So skinned alive

[Verse 3]
My thoughts are misguided and a little naïve
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smartass, but we all like stars
Wait, that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up, strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis

[Chorus]
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied

[Verse 1]
I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rapping on my windowsill

[Verse 2]
Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain there
Any fool can easy pick a hole, I only wish I could fall in
A moving target in a firing range

[Bridge]
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Lightning fuse, powercut
Scatterbrain

[Verse 1]
I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best with the covers up
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out
You know we're friends 'til we die

[Chorus]
And either way you turn
Open up your skull
Climbing up the walls
And either way you turn
Open up your skull
Climbing up the walls

[Verse 2]
I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection

[Chorus]
Climbing up the walls

[Verse 1]
You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home
Saying

[Chorus]
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken

[Verse 2]
You can force it but it will stay stung
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules
All of the rules
But still

[Chorus]
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is, everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken

[Outro]
Why can't you forget?
Why can't we forget?
Why can't you forget?

[Bridge]
There's something about you, baby
The way you look me in my eyes
It would kill me to watch you walk away, so
Stay by my side (Ah)
(Don't go away, don't go away, don't go away, stay)

[Chorus]
Don't go away, don't go away
I need you babe (Stay)
Don't go away, I love the taste, so stay the same, uh

Oh you

[Chorus]
Maybe she was all my life
Facing away all night
Oh you
Have got me so confused
(You got me feeling)
Yes, well I fucked up now

Oh you
Have got me so confused
(You got me feeling)

[Verse]
I'm burning out too much
You be looking, oh, like lunch
Would you ever stay up with me?
Baby, make love to me, sometime?
(Don't wanna go slow)
Well you're the heavyweight champ
And I'm lying with me
It was only your waist, you and I
Oh please just tell me what you know, what you know, what you know

[Bridge]
Oh you
Have got me feeling so confused
You got me feeling
Oh it's true
Oh you

[Chorus]
Maybe she was all my life
Facing away all night
Oh you

You
Have got me so con—
Have got me so confused

[Outro]
(Yeah)
You got me so good, oh why?
(Oh you)
All this time, I now see where you lie
I could wait forever, you know that
Whenever you can, let me know where you're at

[Verse 1]
Beast I've been looking real faced on my side
Still don’t know how to be all in the mind
All in the mind
It's what she would want (What she would want, want)

[Pre-Chorus]
Laid eyes so she wanna be a place imma die
Laid eyes so when wanna know if I'm alright
No, no, we

[Chorus]
I feel numb
Baby don’t lie to me
I think you know
Baby, don't lie
I'm looking at the way back
I know that you would like that
I feel numb
Baby, don't lie with this
Because I tell you what I need
I need you all the way back (Way back)
I know that you would like that (Like that), no, we

[Verse 2]
I've been looking real spaced in my eyes
I don't know how to be here all the time (I can be here all)
(Here all the time)
You know that I was
I was ready to be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But then she laid eyes so she wanna be a place I'mma die
Laid eyes so she wanna know if I'm alright
Gotta be the softest thing I could feel

[Bridge]
I fuck it up when you come back

Don’t know if I heard it right

Baby, don't lie with this
Because I tell you what I need

When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?

[Verse 1]
You’re so indecisive of what I’m saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
You wanna argue all day, makin' love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between

Tryna compromise but I can’t win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

You wanna argue all day, makin' love all night

[Verse 1]
Turn my lights on
How the fuck you quiet with the mic on?
I don't get anxiety, you Sam Bowie-ass niggas
I just get my Mike on
Y'all said I wouldn't go nowhere, I took the detour
When you see the someone in the crack right by the seashore?
When you see them brand new le Fleurs on the floor?
If the cops ask my name, bitch, I'm Igor

[Chorus]
Yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?

[Bridge]
Uh-huh, ayo
Uh-huh
Yeah, yo
Bitch

[Verse 2]
Running 'til the rims fall
Had them niggas and the cops looking jigsaw
I done fucked around and turned into the big dog
Better get God, get caught? Bitch, I think not
Yeah, new suit, new boots, same nigga, like what?
Lukewarm-ass niggas always wanna talk
I'm hot, I'm heat to the core like Earth
Don't touch, don't go, niggas might get buck

[Chorus]
Yo, yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?

[Interlude]
Whoop, uh huh
Yeah, bitch
Yeah

[Part II]

[Intro: slowthai]
I see the light
Now didn't I tell you motherfuckers
Um, I see the light
To pay attention and to keep your motherfucking eyes glued to the man that's in front of you?
I see the light
That's what the fuck I expect all y'all motherfuckers to do
I see the light

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & slowthai]
Dracula, Dracula, Dracula
Suck me first, I might get back at ya (I see the light)
Is that shit clear? Check the aperture
Hahahahaha, I can't laugh at ya (I see the light)
This the shit that make you nervous
'Bout to go buck wild, nigga, Steve Irwin (I see the light)
Sick of that 'Claren talk, I'm on my third one
Niggas talkin' reckless, I never heard 'em (I see the light)

[Chorus: slowthai]
I see the light
I see the light
I see the light
(Buck, don't touch, though, my niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)
I see the light
(Buck, don't touch, though, my niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)
I see the light

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator & slowthai]
That car crash couldn't take me (Woo, ha)
Green haired angels all around me (Uh)
No answer why, no tears to cry, bitch, I'm alive (I see the)
That wasn't my endpoint like v-neck
I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I cheat death
New album, no repeat, I reset
Everything I deliver special like G. Dep
Two of 'em, I total, Kima, Pam
Me and death, the universe played middle man
Quick nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut
Loud sound, no scratch
Motherfuckers really thought I died
Hoping they could take a spot
Nigga not knowing that I'm one of one
And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas
And I got my eyes open now I see the...

[Outro: slowthai & Jerrod Carmichael]
Light
I see the light
You never wanna meet a motherfucker like me
I see the light (I said)
I see the light
I see the light
I don't know what's harder, letting go or just being okay with it

[Chorus 1]
Somebody told me to walk away
When love got hard and I had to pay
But you know it’s such a shame
Nobody knows how to play this loving game

[Chorus 2]
Sometimes we all seem to act like fools
But do we care if we break the rules?
But I suppose it’s all the same
We never learn how to play this loving game

[Bridge]
Do I love you half as much
As I did before?
Darling, I could hardly love you more

[Chorus 3]
I tried to look for some good advice
'Cause we all have to pay the price
But 'til now, it never came
I’ll never know how to play this loving game

[Bridge]
Do I love you half as much
As I used to do?
No one knows me half as well as you
Yeah, you know you do, you know you

[Chorus 1]
Somebody told me to walk away
When love got hard and I had to pay
But you know that it’s still a shame
Nobody knows how to play this loving game

[Outro]
Nobody knows how to play this loving game
Nobody knows how to play this loving game
In the summer of '59, dandelions shine up through the pavement
Pedal pushers in the bushes
Waspy binges, sixteen inches round her waist
And it’s all in the name of good taste

In the summer of '59, dandelions shine up through the pavement
Fluorescent socks and fishnet stockings
Dirty combs from ideal homes, and girls are chaste
And it's all in the name of good taste

Good taste, nobody knew what we knew then
Good taste, look at the boys turn into men
Good taste, nobody knew what we knew then

Look at the girls turn into women
Uh, ooh, uh, ooh, uh
Look at the girls turn into women
Uh, ooh, uh, ooh, uh
Some of the girls turned into women
Ooh
In the summer of ’59, dandelions shine up through the pavement
Council houses, drainpipe trousers
Ciggy packs and long black jackets, ties are laced
And it's all in the name of good taste

Good taste, nobody knew what we knew then
Good taste, look at the boys turn into men
Good taste, nobody knew what we knew then

Look at the girls turn into women
Uh, ooh, uh, ooh, uh
Look at the girls turn into women
Uh, ooh, uh, ooh, uh
Some of the girls turned into women
Ooh

In the summer of '59

[Verse 1]
If I have a son, I will name him king
Teach him how to fight, teach him how to sing
And that a good woman will show you who you are
Not with her words, but with her heart

[Chorus]
And underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you

[Verse 2]
If I have a daughter, I will name her queen
Teach her how to fight, teach her how to dream
And too much satisfaction can be like hell
If you want to start a revolution, start with yourself

[Chorus]
And underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you

[Verse 3]
It's okay to smile, it's okay to cry
Know your daddy's songs, they will never die
And don't you feel guilty for what you've won
There is good and evil in each and everyone

[Chorus]
And underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you
Lyrics from Snippet

I wanna be myself
Tryna be my best
How do you
Learn to love yourself?
I think I need more love

[Verse 1: Vargas & Agnes]
Weight is on me, weight is on you
We scream and we fight like there's nothing to lose
End of the day, come and take my all
There’s no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Weight is on you, weight is on me
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be
God knows I try, we stumble and we fall
There’s no place I'd rather be than in your arms

[Chorus: Vargas & Agnes]
Give me tough love and a lesson to learn
Your tough love is what I discern
Sweet tough love, you're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: Vargas & Agnes]
Weight is on you, weight is on me
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be
God knows I try, we stumble and we fall
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

[Chorus: Vargas & Agnes]
Give me tough love and a lesson to learn
Your tough love is what I discern
Sweet tough love, you’re my pretty good luck charm
There’s no place I'd rather be than in your arms
Give me tough love and a lesson to learn
Your tough love is what I discern
Sweet tough love, you’re my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

[Verse 1]

Dressed like an Indian prince baby
You lookin fine and so mighty
Hot cold can I take a bit baby
Be your first fruit burst lady

[Pre-Chorus]

So take it slow
Move my boat
Shake it more
I can take it all

[Chorus]

Masam Gunah ah ah
Take it to the next level
If you want another medal
Gunah ah ah
Masam Gunah ah ah
It's unsung
You're gonna have to be on your own
For a little while
It's playing dumb
You check into the wrong room
It's not your style

You can't afford it
You know you're worth it
You can't afford it
You know you're worth it

You'd like to meet me in the lobby
Even though you know it's no place to be
Would you like the mint on your pillow?
I can take it off your hands 'cause I gotta go

I want you to see what I see
Take it to the second degree
I am despicable to be
And so applicable indeed
Pick up the phone
Delivery or room service
Because you're worth it
You go roam
Because you have a few more dollars
In your pocket

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & Chris Brown]

Crawl

[Verse 1]
Everybody sees this you
I'm the one that lost the view
Everybody says we're through
I hope you haven't said it too

[Pre-Chorus]
So where do we go from here
With all this fear in our eyes?
And where can love take us now?
We've been so far down

[Chorus]
We can still touch the sky if we crawl
'Til we can walk again
Then we'll run until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, yeah
Back to love, yeah
Back to love (Oh), yeah

Why did I change the pace?
Hearts were never meant to race
Always felt the need for space
And now I can't reach your face (Your face)

[Pre-Chorus]
So where are you standing now?
Are you in the crowd of my faults? (My faults, oh)
Love, can't you see my hand?
I need one more chance

[Chorus]
We can still have it all so we'll crawl (If we crawl)
'Til we can walk again
Then we'll run (Then we'll run) until we're strong enough to jump

So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, yeah

Gotta have faith when you're on the ropes
Someday that dream is gonna come true
And when it does, I'll say to you

Hello Broadway, how do you do?
I've waited a lifetime to say "hi" to you
Hello Broadway, here comes me
Oh, hello Broadway, look at my grin
I'm glad you decided to let me come in
Hello Broadway, here comes me, ha

[Bridge]
And those who fought me will say they taught me
Everything I know
They used to boo me, now they say they knew me
Hello Broadway's opening nights
Thank you for my name in lights

[Verse 2]
Hello Broadway, I like your style
Now that I'm here, I'll stay for a while

[Verse 1: Jake]
And I could not tell by the power of
The prophet spit fire all through your blood
If Jesus had brothers like I do here
Then walking on water is a blissful fear

[Verse 2: Jake]
The demons and lions bow their heads in shame
The devil appeared in the Bible camp
You baptized my grief with a kiss of grace
Then cut off my ears and I feel no pain

[Verse 3: Jake, All]
The pictures are plagued with amazing grace
And Mary held liquor, so passionate
I kill a man, with fists, so he knew me well

[Chorus: Jake with Nathan]

[Verse 1: All]
And I could not tell by the power of
The prophets spit fire all through your blood
If Jesus had brothers like I do here
Then walking on water is a blissful fear

[Spoken Outro: Jake]
Thank you very much

[Spoken Intro: Jake]
Alright, this next song is called "South"

[Verse 1: Jake]
Three leagues down the soft side of where you left my
Gold rose crown, you broke down and left me with a
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars

[Verse 2: Jake]
Three weeks down, I drowned myself in whiskey
Came back round, and drowned out, and left me with a
Chest hum, a black gun

[Chorus: Jake, with Nathan]
Streetlights talk the same way my mother told me
I walk the same way my father told me
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
Wise men talk the same way my mother told me
I walk the same way my father told me
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
Back straight and chest out

[Bridge: Nathan, with Whistler]
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south

[Chorus: Jake, Nathan, with Whistler & (Whistler)]
Streetlights talk the same way my mother told me
(You go down south, south)
I walk the same way my father told me
(You go down south, south)
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
(You go down south, south)
Back straight, chest out
Streetlights talk the same way my mother told me
(You go down south, south)
I walk the same way my father told me
(You go down south, south)
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
(You go down south, south)
Back straight and chest out

[Spoken Intro: Jack]
Alright, here we go again, this one's called "Suicide Saturday"

[Verse 1: Jake &  All]
I heard it told by her mother old
She could try, she could try it
With the power of tin and a bottle of gin
She was wise, she was wise to it
Cocked her father's gun, like the oldest son
She could try, she could try it
Blessed by the bed where she laid her head and calmed to a dull roar

[Chorus: Jake &  All]
Oh-oh, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
It was  suicide Saturday
Oh-oh, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
In a summertime kind of way
Oh-oh, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
It was  suicide Saturday
Oh-oh, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
In a summertime kind of way

[Verse 2: Jake &  All]
She felled the streets till she heard the screams
She could drive, she could drive it
That was where she'd buy her time
Her friends were crazed in the solemn rains
She could try, she could try it
I met her once, she was tight, she was tight
She was tight, she was tight, she was tight as hell

[Chorus: Jake &  All]
Oh-oh, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
It was suicide Saturday
Oh-oh, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
In a summertime kind of way
Oh-oh, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
It was suicide Saturday
Oh-oh, oh-oh woah, oh-oh woah
In a summertime kind of way

[Bridge: Jake, with Nathan & All]
Oh don't you wait now

[Outro: Jake & Audience Member]
Suicide Saturday
Suicide Saturday
Thank you!
(You're welcome!)
They say ev'rything can be replaced
Yet ev'ry distance is not near
So I remember ev'ry face
Of ev'ry man who put me here

I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say ev'ry man needs protection
They say ev'ry man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall

I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
You and I, we might be strangers
However close we get sometimes
It's like we never met

But you and I, I think we can take it
All the good with the bad
Make something that no one else has but

You and I, you and I

Me and you, what can we do
When the words we use sometimes
Are misconstrued

Well, I won't guess what's coming next
I can't ever tell you
The deepest well I've ever fallen into

Oh, I don't wanna know
Oh, I don't wanna know
Oh, I don't need to know
Everything about you
Oh, I don't wanna know
And you don't need to know
That much about me

You and I, we might be strangers
However close we get sometimes
It's like we never met

But you and I, I think we can take it
All the good with the bad
Make something that no one else has but

You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
Jesus, don't cry
You can rely on me, honey
You can combine anything you want
I'll be around
You were right about the stars
Each one is a setting sun

Tall buildings shake
Voices escape singing sad sad songs
Tuned to chords
Strung down your cheeks
Bitter melodies turning your orbit around

Don't cry
You can rely on me honey
You can come by any time you want
I'll be around
You were right about the stars
Each one is a setting sun

Tall buildings shake
Voices escape singing sad sad songs
Tuned to chords
Strung down your cheeks
Bitter melodies turning your orbit around
Voices whine
Skyscrapers are scraping together
Your voice is smoking
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around

Our love
Our love
Our love is all we have

Our love
Our love is all of God's money
Everyone is a burning sun

Tall buildings shake
Voices escape singing sad sad songs
Tuned to chords
Strung down your cheeks
Bitter melodies turning your orbit around

Voices whine
Skyscrapers are scraping together
Your voice is smoking
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around

Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around

[Intro: Eminem]
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
(Okay, let's go!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Ca$his]
It's Mister Shady
Call for Ca$his

[Verse 2: Ca$his]
Six-four hoppers up at least four blocks
I crank my watch like I don't see no cops
Riding on a 

[?] six cars and 

[?]
No rims stop and stand up in the drop

[?]
I be chilling with the bitches, 

[?]

[?]
On my L.A. pad rooftop, ha, ha

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Bobby Creekwater]
Yeah, so...

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
I'm at this party and notice that I didn't even get carted
Plenty lines, having fun, they see me and act retarded
I'm thinking to myself, "I'm a brand new artist"
I just started, tell me why I hit the ground and they parted
Feeling good
True stepping
I'm no number type, but gave me wood

[?]

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

White lies, lining up on their own
You said you would stand on my side
Regret, it’s too late to deny

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
All the back and forth and yes and no
All the right and wrong and high and low
And you set me up to let me down
But it all comes back around

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
What are you worth now?
What are you waiting for?
When every battlefield you run from generates a war?
What are you chasing?
What do you think you deserve?
Cause you will never have a thing
Unless you've got your word
What are you worth?

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Last straw as the sky turns to red
Free fall, while I fight to forget

What are you waiting for?
When every battlefield you run from generates a war?
What are you chasing?

What are you worth?
What are you worth?

What are you worth?
What are you worth?
What are you worth?
What are you worth?

Good to have me on your side, I ain't sayin' that you need me (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

[Verse 1]
Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home, there's none left for me

[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree

Oh, take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will, some day, rise
So, what am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said, I'm gonna play with myself
Show them how we come off the shelf

[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
(Harder, yeah, harder, yeah)

[Bridge]
Evil, we've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
The tension, it's getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater
(Summertime)
(Ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree

Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

See the girl dance

[Intro: Maisie Williams]
There will be no humans elsewhere
Only here, only on this small planet
We are rare as well as endangered species
Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious
If a human disagrees with you, let him live
In a hundred billion galaxies, you won't find another

[Verse 1]
My mind is filled with galaxies
It's all I see
It's all I see
Way up in the highest trees
I feel the breeze
I feel the breeze

[Chorus]
Take me on your boat one day
We'll fade away, we'll slip away
We'll go away, we'll be away
We'll stay away

[Post Chorus]
We'll go down the longest stream
Reflected in a sunbeam

[Chorus]
Just a speck of dust in the Milky Way
We'll fade away, we'll slip away
We'll go away, we'll be away
We'll stay away

[Post-Chorus]
We'll go down the longest stream
Reflected in a sunbeam

[Bridge]
I'm not going
I'm not going
I'm not going
I'm not going
I'm not going, going, gone

[Chorus]
Just a speck of dust in the Milky Way
We'll fade away, we'll slip away
We'll go away, we'll be away
We'll stay away

[Outro]
But we are alive today
We'll be ok
We'll be ok

[Chorus]
Houston, Dubai

But the land is deep

As this old world keeps turning
Me through my fever dream
Houston just did ninety-nine
Dubai's one-eighteen

[Chorus]
Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep
Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
I just want to wake up
Where I went to sleep

I got a wife back home, you know
She always thinks I cheat
I think about those Denton days
When life was light and sweet

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Every time I think I'm done
The plane keeps flying back
And every race beneath the sun
Just takes another lap

[Chorus]
Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep
Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
I just want to wake up
Where I went to sleep

[Verse 4]
I know the price, I know the map
But don't know what it's worth
So let the thieves and killers
Take my treasure on the Earth

[Outro]
Houston, goodbye
Goodbye to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep
Houston, goodbye
Goodbye to Houston
Now I'm gonna wake up
Where I went to sleep

I'ma toast me a nigga like Strudels
I'ma keep a red flag cause I'm boolin' (Brrat)
I know some roller spaces, I could dually
Yeah, yeah I'm screamin' oh my God like Cooly
When I snort it, I feel like I was aborted
If I ever adore you, babe, you better drive what's foreign (What's foreign)
I've been gettin' money before the music, fuck Pandora (Fuck 'em, fuck 'em)
I just do this shit when I get bored

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep goin' (Yeah)
You can lose your life but it's gon' keep goin'
Why not risk life when it's gon' keep goin'? (Yeah)
When you die somebody else was born
But at least we got to say we—

[Chorus: Young Thug]
We ran up them digits we ran up the money  (Woah, woah)

Turn into a bond and that bond will never
Be broken and the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first then the line
Will never be crossed established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what
We reach so remember me when I'm gone

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride

And I want a 20 on my chain, it dangles
Bands on me, I just might fuck your bitch like Bang Bros
So much jewelry on my neck, my fuckin' bank froze
And I wanna fuck it while I'm watchin' bank roll
Cut the roof off, you can't breathe when I smash it
Diamonds on funk and I bleed when I'm ashin'
Cut the roof off, you can't breathe when I smash it
Diamonds on funk and I bleed when I'm ashin'
Ride on my wrist, I got your ride on my wrist
Rollie on them bands when I ride on my wrist
Five on the fist, cop five on the fist
Then I want a forty, got five on my wrist
And I know you're no snake, been fuckin' on my bae
I'm fuckin' up a check and I wonder why
Been down on-on the tracks and I'm flippin' on a bitch
I'm fuckin' up a check and I wonder why
And I musta be a bun digger chanter
And I musta cutta fund that I shot up
And I go, and I go, and I said I go
Hannibal, diamonds up, ain't no matter, though
Racks in the bank, it's up, I'm on the payroll
I'm the one, I choose to paper chase, baby
Racks in the bank, it's up, I'm on the payroll
I'm the one, I choose the paper

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Ohh, don't act like you care about me
Ohh, don't act like you care about me (Care about me)

[Verse 1]
What happened to the kids?
A bunch of fucked up shit that happened where we lived (Uh)
Niggas braggin' and pro backing it at the crib, yeah
I was throwin' blows, toe taggin' it at the crib, yeah
Fightin' niggas older than me
My older brother said he won't defend me
I'm like, "Fuck it, nigga, don't defend me"
I know the Lord sent me
I sense Jehovah in me every time my soul is empty
I know the devil on my shoulder heavy
But the Lord'll always have some soldiers ready
I've exposed how deadly this war can get already
Mind, body, flesh, and my flesh
I know the heavens and the hells
Is both fightin' for my soul when I rest
I got these tightened up holes in my chest
They feel cold in my vest
And still, I pray my son'll grow in my steps
So he can get that same feelin' at night
And know his life got a purpose
And he ain't gotta pop a pill in his life
Ain't gotta hit them corners, chillin' wit' them killers at night
Like I did, and make mistakes that I did, tryna provide for my kid
I can't let him just rumble through all of the fumble that I did
'Cause I slid, so many times on all of these niggas I just can't (Uh)
Let his life fall into shambles, know this, life is all a gamble
But we bettin' from this angle, nigga
I'm tryna teach my brothers 'bout the dangers, nigga
Cold world, I'm tryna make some fuckin' changes, nigga
Give us somethin' that's gon' change us, nigga
Positive conversations when niggas angry, nigga
Instead of throwin' us in cages, nigga
Section 8, they got us livin' by these wages, nigga
Stop treatin' us like we dangerous, nigga
And maybe we'll stop bein' so dangerous, nigga
A lot of niggas out here stainin' niggas
If he your color, he your brother, you can't hate this nigga

[Verse 2]
Self-hatred what they taught us (Uh)
And look at all the shit it brought us
Mothers, daughters, sons, and sisters all in coffins
And what we got to show? Somebody that's recordin', nigga
Mental illness at an all-time high
We so caught up in the 'Gram, tryna be all-time fly
So much, you can't even show up in the same clothes
Somebody always lurkin', they clockin' your same pose
Callin' all women hoes, you know how the sayin' goes
Everywhere I go, I see the same hoes
But that's the same shit I'm sayin' don't save souls
Am I a hypocrite for sayin' them same roles?
I'm tryna change life, change mines, and change yours
But bitch, I'm only human, I fall in the same toes sometimes
You're as tall
You're as tall
You're as tall as the trees
When your head hits the sky, please don't ever forget me
You must leave
You must leave
You must leave
When you're alone in the ocean, please don't ever forget me
Blleeee (Blleeee)
Every cloud is another, is another god

My days been shining too bright
Keep me on the edge of my seat babe
Tucked away forever dim light

[Chorus 1]
Seems too real
Wanna keep it chill
Hold me near

[Verse 2]
That sucks it's a little too close now
Only you can get me to cry

Don't wanna hear about your other guy
All alone in the dark like a mushroom
That's the way I'm gonna get by
Spare me the awkward little details
Oh no there's trouble in sight

Something to fill
It's about to spill
What to do? (it's clear

So, get on out in that square
He's a winner, he's a whiz, a wonder
Adjust your veil and prepare
He's about to pull my heart asunder
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali, oops
And I absolutely love the way he dresses

Make way for Prince Ali!

[Verse 1: Big Tigger]
Rap City, The Basement
Big Tigger, off the top, freestyle, no replacement
With my man Ludacris, and I-20
Coming on down every week and scooping honeys
You know how it go but please abstain from testing us
The album called The Golden Grain
DTP, watch the kids flow, step out the way
And let my man Ludacris come through with the flow

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I see some fools ain’t smart ‘cause they going against me
I been rapping since Tyson punched Soda Popinski
On a whole ‘nother level, I pass the elite
You can ask Red and Meth, I’ll rip a Casio beat
Ribbit! Chicks dig it, long as my clique spit it
My Cadillac truck gets lower than six midgets
It’s wood, kid-id, cars for six digits
I’ll rip ya eye out and play FOOS-ball with it
Girls see me, they holler and holler hard
So much money, I’m ‘bout to buy College Park
My records just play, I don’t need payola
Long as my eyes stay redder than crayon Crayolas
And drill the player-hater, you hardly stacking
When you see me, don’t say nothing like Charlie Chapman
Ludacris, mmm! “Velvet Jones”
AKA “Slap a TRICK With a Cellular Phone”
I’m carrying chrome, bullets headed straight to your dome
I dig my cradle from my grave, bury my bones
It’s scary alone, scarier than hesitant people
Gotta smoke a lot of good, ‘cause my residence evil
My weapons are lethal, lethal like Murtaugh/Riggs
After I blast you, I’ma hurt y’all kids
When they see me in the street, parents blast and boo me
TVs in my ‘Lac are showing nasty movies
And all I gotta do is make a Hillandale call
I’m big, you smaller than Avondale Mall

[Break: Ludacris]
What! What! What!
I-20, what’s up? What’s up? What’s up?

[Verse 3: I-20]
Yeah, after ground, I hit you, put you under the street
The only peace that I know is hidden under my seat
Disturbing tha Peace, we selling out, you still on the shelf
2-0, I’m Pee Wee Herman, man, I’m feeling myself
You feeling my wealth? Check it, dog, here comes the cream
So many throwbacks, you’d swear I got a time machine
Know what I mean? Jump in the big-body Benz and
Car been stopped with the rims still spinning
It’s Information Infamous, I keep an infrared
Ducking D.A., neglecting off to never mess with Feds
I’m all about the bread, chrome to ya head, I bust it down
People call my style “monogamy,” ‘cause I don’t mess around
Yeah!

[Outro: Big Tigger & Ludacris]
I-Dub!
Tryna replace me in the worst way
Shoutout to JT, it’s his damn birthday
What! Golden Grain, baby!

[Intro: Will Smith & DJ Khaled]
Yeah

You know it's Will Smith and DJ Khaled (Whoo)
Unh, too late, y'all done wound me up (Turn it up!)
Too late, y'all done wound me up (Turn it up!)
Boutta show you what I'm workin' with (Show me what you workin' with!)

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
It's the Ali Baba
It's the big papa
It's the blue, handsome, Jasmine like a flower
It's the grant your wishes that don't even cost a dollar (Hah)
You gotten on the carpet when you ridin' what I holler like, ayy
Tell me where you wanna go
Hold up, don't tell me, I already know
Watch out, it's the Genie with the attitude (Watch out!)
Three wishes, what I need to make true?

[Chorus: Will Smith & DJ Khaled]
Mister (Mister!), Mister (Mister!)
Tell me whatever you need (Whatcha need?)
Anything rearrange, even climate can change
You ain't ever had a friend like me (Never!)
Just a lamp and a rub away from whatever you want
Habibi, lemme show you the dream (Habibi!)
Just whisper if you don't wanna shout out what you need
But I promise you ain't never had a friend like me

[Verse 2: Will Smith & DJ Khaled]
Tell the angels and gods, pass the baklava
Make 'em travel from close or make 'em travel from far
Well, this is your chance, man, wish from the soul
When I'm out of the lamp, man, I'm out of control (Hey!)
I got gold on my shoes, temple of jewels
A room for wise men and plenty for fools
I don't want you to lose, tryna help you dude
You ain't ever had a friend like me (Never!)

[Bridge: Will Smith & DJ Khaled]
Go big time! (Big time!)
Wish big time! (Big time!)
Go big time! (Big time!)
Go big time! (Big time!)
Wish big time! (Big time!)
Go big time! (Big time!)
Lemme see ya flex on 'em (Flex on 'em)
Shine on 'em (Shine on 'em)
Style on 'em (Style on 'em)
Slide on 'em (Slide on 'em)
Too fly, too fly on her
Just glide on her
Cool as a fan

[Verse 3: Will Smith]
I'm the coolest, bluest one of 'em all
You can wish to be rich, you can wish to be tall
You can wish away the haters, you just gimme a call
You can wish for what you want 'cause I'm granting 'em all

[Chorus: Will Smith & DJ Khaled]
Mister (Mister!), Mister (Mister!)
Tell me whatever you need (Whatcha need?)
Anything rearrange, even climate can change
You ain't ever had a friend like me (Never!)
Just a lamp and a rub away from whatever you want
Habibi, lemme show you the dream (Habibi!)
Just whisper if you don't wanna shout out what you need
But I promise you ain't never had a friend like me

[Outro: Will Smith & DJ Khaled]
Please don't get me started
Fly like magic carpet
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend (Never!)
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend (Never!)
You ain't never (Never!)
Had a (Had a)
Friend (Friend)
Like (Like)

(Never, ever, ever, never, ever, ever; Never!)
(Never, ever, ever, never, ever, ever; Never!)
You ain't never had a friend like me! (Never!)

[Verse 1]
Can you see my emotion
Sinking away in slow motion?
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea
Can you see my emotion
Say, can you see my devotion?
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea

[Chorus]
I hear what you're saying, I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying for a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me, I know
I got a bad reputation

[Verse 2]
I know that you've been talking
You never see me sleepwalking
Drifting out into nothing
Rolling away in my dreams
Can you feel that I'm falling?
Laying awake till the morning
Every word that I'm calling
Just getting lost out at sea

[Chorus]
I hear what you're saying, I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying for a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me, I know
I got a bad reputation
I got a bad reputation

[Bridge]
So, you got me figured out
Know what I'm all about
I'm all about dollars and green
Don't care about nothing but me
You got me figured out
You know what I'm all about
Don't care about nothing but me, yeah

[Chorus]
I hear what you're saying, I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying for a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me, I know
I got a bad reputation
I got a bad reputation

[Verse 1]
I swear I'm losing patience
For all of these fucking situations
And I swear I never say shit
But this time I'm gonna say it

[Pre-Chorus]
When the record's on the final song
And the parties will be long, long gone
All the pretenders and the hangers on
Can go find themselves another one

[Chorus]
But it ain't a thing, yeah
But it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, it ain't a thing, baby

[Verse 2]
I swear I'm losing patience (For all of these, for all of these)
All of these fucking altercations
Yeah, and I swear I never say shit (Said, never said shit, did I?)
But this time I really mean it

[Pre-Chorus]
When the record's on the final song
And the parties will be long, long gone
All the pretenders and the hangers on
Can go find themselves another one

[Chorus]
But it ain't a thing, yeah
But it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby

[Post-Chorus]
It ain't a thing, baby

But it ain't a thing, ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby

[Verse]
Dear society
You are moving way too fast
Way too fast for me
I'm just tryin' to catch my breath

[Pre-Chorus]
Can I get a little peace of mind?
And a little bit of silence to unwind?

[Chorus]
Relief, do you need a relief?
Do you need a relief? Do you need a release?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be–
Can I get a little peace of mind?

[Verse]
Dear society

Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be–
Can I get a little peace of mind?

Dear society

[Outro]
Can I get a little peace of mind?

[Verse 1]
I don't want to be seen in this shape I'm in
I don't want you to see how depressed I've been, yeah
You were never the high one, never wanted to die young
I don't want you to see all the scars within

[Chorus]
So, tell me why (Oh why, oh why)
Why am I such a freak?
You're out of your mind (Oh my, oh my)
Who the fuck are you to judge me?
And I told you I'd be different
And I told you I was wild
You're stuck in denial
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak

[Verse 2]
I keep thinking about what we could have been
If we hadn't been caught in what should have been, yeah
Oh, we used to be dancing, never cared about nothing
I don't know when we got all these scars within

[Chorus]
So, tell me why (Oh why, oh why)
Why am I such a freak?
You're out of your mind (Oh my, oh my), no
Who the fuck are you to judge me?
And I told you I'd be different
And I told you I was wild
You're stuck in denial
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak

[Post-Chorus]
Hmm, yeah
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
You're stuck in denial
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
Oh why, oh why
Hmm
Oh my, oh my
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
Oh why, oh why
Oh my, oh my
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak

[Verse 1]
Checking, checking, microphone checking
I'll tell you what you need to know
Holla, holla, gotta make a dollar
Time to put on a show
Many, many, one too many
People try to fill my shoes
But see ya, see ya, see ya 'round later
I'm about to make a move

[Chorus]
I'm a roller coaster beyond belief
I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now
I'm a riot walking down the street
I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm a villain, villain 'bout to make a million
One too many records sold (That's why I'm)
Chillin' while I keep on building
See you fuckers down the road (Ah)
Better, better, feeling much better
Tonight, I'll do it all again (Cop that)
Ticking, ticking, time keeps ticking
I'm rolling up till the end
Bring it back now

[Chorus]
I'm a roller coaster beyond belief
I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now
I'm a riot walking down the street
I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now (Yeah)

[Bridge]
Excuse me, Mr. Sir
I don't understand a word
Your inquiries are none of my concern
Excuse me, Mr. Sir
I don't understand your world
With all due respect, I best be on my way

[Outro]
I'm what you need, what you really, really
I'm what, I'm what you need, what you really, really
I'm what, I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now
I'm what you need, what you really, really
I'm what, I'm what you need, what you really, really
I'm what, I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now

[Verse 1]
I'm always left out, stranded on the fence
You came along, no ego, no pretense
In the trance, we danced and prayed for no tomorrow
We were brash and we were bold, but we were right

[Chorus]
She knows how I'm feeling
She banishes all my demons
So easy, like breathing
She bandages all my bleeding
She knows how I love her
We take it down undercover
She gets me, she sees me
I hope that she'll never leave me

[Post-Chorus]
I hope that she'll never leave me

[Verse 2]
I'm always left out, chasing innocence
You came along, you showed me what it meant
In the daze, we raced, yeah, dreaming of tomorrow
We were brash and we were bold, but we were right

[Pre-Chorus]
And I reckon we can take our time (I reckon we can take our time)
And I reckon we can go a while (I reckon we can go a while)
And I'll be there at the borderline (I'll be there at the borderline)
'Cause I owe you all the best of me

[Chorus]
She knows how, I'm feeling
She banishes all my demons
So easy, like breathing
She bandages all my bleeding
She knows how I love her
We take it down undercover
She gets me, she sees me
I hope that she'll never leave me

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh, ooh-ooh)
I hope that she'll never leave me (Oh-oh, ooh-ooh)
I hope that she'll never leave me
(Never leave me, never leave me, never leave me)
(Never leave me, never leave me, never leave me)

[Chorus]
She knows how I'm feeling
She banishes all my demons
So easy, like breathing
She bandages all my bleeding
She knows how I love her
We take it down undercover
She gets me, she sees me
I hope that she'll never leave me

[Verse 1]
All of the troubled times that we have overcome
All of the trials to find somewhere that we belong
All I know is that, with you, I'm holding on
'Cause all of the days out, all of the days out on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you love it? How it all just fades away
When your clothes don't feel the songs of yesterday
And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it? How it all, it all just fades away

[Chorus]
It all just fades away

[Verse 2]
All of the tracks we traced, we raced to reach the sun
All of the lights to find a place where we belong
All I know is that, with you, I'm moving on
'Cause all of the days out, all of the days out on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it? How it all, it all just fades away

[Chorus]
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
It all just fades away

[Outro]
And I can't go back and I can't go back
Don't you love it? How it all, it all just fades away

[Verse 1]
I don't believe in fate
No psychic vision
But when things fall into place - superposition
In any universe you are my dark star

[Chorus]
I want you to want me
Why don't we rely on chemistry
Why don't we collide the spaces that divide us
I want you to want me

[Verse 2]
Superstition aims with imprecision
But when things can't be explained - superposition
In any universe you are my dark star

[Chorus]
I want you to want me
Why don't we rely on chemistry
Why don't we collide the spaces that divide us
I want you to want me
I want you to want me

[Bridge]
No matter what we do
I'll be there with you!

[Chorus]
I want you to want me
Why don't we rely on chemistry
Why don't we collide the spaces that divide us
I want you to want me

[Intro: Jerrod Carmichael]
Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Nigga)
New magic (Woo), new magic, new magic wand

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'
This 60-40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold & Jessy Wilson]
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold & Jessy Wilson]
I wanna be found, passenger in your car (Don't leave)
You wanna be mean, mixed signals, don't park (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)
We can finally be together

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned
New magic wand

[Intro]
Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time to make you love me
Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
To make you love me

[Verse 1]
Secrets
Oh, you spin my head around (Oh, you spin my head around)
I been lookin' for it (For it, for it)
I been runnin' out of spells
To make you love me
Secrets
Keep it up
To make you love me (Ah)
Wade in your water (Wade in your water)
Your waves wash over me
I drift to the deep end
Don't save, don't save, don't save
It's a low tide (I'll be fine)
I found peace in drownin'

[Chorus]
Runnin' out of time, runnin out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time to make you love me

[Bridge]
Livin' in pretend
Keep it a buck fifty, fuck
Are you livin' in pretend?

[Verse 2]
So
Take your mask off
I need her out the picture (Wade in your water)
Take your mask off (Yeah)
Stop lyin' for these niggas
Stop lyin' to yourself
I know the real you
Don't save, don't save, don't save
Halloween ain't for a minute, lose the costume
You need to chill, okay
Been runnin' from the targets and 'em back in the day
And now they working their all, another track out the DAW
Actin' a fool, actin' a ball, we packin' the park, yeah
But I'm still runnin'
Out of time

[Outro]
Of time, of time
Runnin' outta
Of time
Still runnin' outta
Of time
Still runnin' outta time
Time
Yeah

[Part I: GONE, GONE]

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
(Two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You keep me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone, gone, gone)
Going away, and now I'm scarred for life

[Interlude: CeeLo Green]
My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
(My love is gone)
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
(My love is gone)
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)

[Outro: Jerrod Carmichael]
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul

[Part II: THANK YOU]

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
(Got my eye)
I said go, go

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Again, again
Again, again
(Got my eye)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo
I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk
I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I start my vehicle
Drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
God, that's all I want, other than air
Oxygen and financial freedom, yeah
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want from me
I can't maneuver without you next to me
It's so complex to me

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
What do you need?
Do you need bread? Do you need this?
Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list, see, I am Santa
Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic
I do not have self-control
I am startin' to wonder
Is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Kanye West]
I'm your puppet, you control me
I'm your puppet, I don't know me
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?)
You control me
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm lonely
'Cause I'm your puppet
(Puppet, oh)
You control me (Control me)
I'm your puppet (Puppet)
I don't know
I'm your puppet (Did I wait too long?)
You control me (Puppet)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You lost, son, and you've been tryna find your way to me
Ayy, to me, he's on somethin' that I hate to see
A to Z, nah son, I'm gonna take a breathe
Run a 'thon, I just stop and I'ma take the breathe
...on a...
...on a...
First, light the weed
First...
First... (Got me by a string)
First... (Got me by a string)
First... (Got me by a string)
(Oh, Lord)

[Outro: Kanye West, Tyler, The Creator & Jerrod Carmichael]
(La, la, la, la)
(La, la, la)
Breathe on a song
(La, la, la)
Breathe on a song
(La, la, la, la, la, la)
Breathe on a song
(Cut me loose)
(La, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
(Cut me loose, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But at some point, you come to your senses

[Chorus]
I don't think much about her no more
Seldom if ever does she cross my mind
Yesterday's gone, Lord, it's better forgotten
Like the poison red berries to die on the vine
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
This mornin' at dawn, Lord, I pulled into town
Had some coffee and talked with some old friends of mine
Laughing at the good times they remembered
And then I remembered a time

[Verse 2]
Lord, I can see the bright lights back in Dallas
As yesterday moves like a dream through my mind
I didn't suppose that I'd ever forget her
And you know it took such a long time

[Chorus]
But I don't think much about her no more
Seldom if ever does she cross my mind
Yesterday's gone and it's better forgotten
It's like a poison red berry that clings to the mind

[Verse 1]
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

[Chorus]
So call out my name (Call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—

[Verse 2]
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

[Pre-Chorus]
You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

[Chorus]
So call out my name (Call out my name, baby)
So call out my name when I kiss you so gently (Ohh)
I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name (Say call out my name, baby)
Girl, call out my name and I'll be on my way
Girl, I'll be on my—

[Outro]
On my way, all the way
On my way, all the way, ooh
On my way, on my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, on my way
(On my)

[Spoken Word: Jude Law]
A chieftain to the Highlands bound
Cries, "Boatman, do not tarry
And I'll give thee a silver pound
To row us o’er the ferry"

"Now who be ye would cross Lochgyle
This dark and stormy water?"
"O, I'm the chief of Ulva's isle
And this, Lord Ullin’s daughter."

And fast before her father's men
Three days we've fled together
For should he find us in the glen
My blood would stain the heather

His horsemen, hard behind us ride
Should they our steps discover
Then who will cheer my bonny bride
When they have slain her lover?
Out spoke the hardy Highland wight
"I'll go, my chief, I'm ready"
It is not for your silver bright
But for your winsome lady

"And by my word, the bonny bird
In danger shall not tarry
So though the waves are raging white
I'll row you o'er the ferry"

By this the storm grew loud apace
The water-wraith was shrieking
And in the scowl of heaven, each face
Grew dark as they were speaking

But still, as wild blew the wind
And as the night grew drearer
Adown the glen rode armed men
Their trampling sounded nearer

"O haste thee, haste!" the lady cries
"Though tempests round us gather
I'll meet the raging of the skies
And not an angry father"

The boat has left a stormy land
A stormy sea before her
When, oh! Too strong for human hand
The tempest gathered o’er her
And still they rowed amidst the roar
Of waters fast prevailing
Lord Ullin reached that fatal shore
His wrath was changed to wailing

For sore dismayed, through storm and shade
His child, he did discover
One lovely hand she stretched for aid
And one was round her lover

"Come back! Come back!" he cried in grief
"Across this stormy water
And I’ll forgive your Highland chief
My daughter! Oh, my daughter!"

'Twas vain, the loud waves lash’d the shore
Return or aid preventing
The waters wild went o'er his child
And he was left lamenting
Well, you said you loved me
But you know it was a lie
You said you loved me
But you know it was a lie
And that's the reason, but it's not the only reason
I wanna cry, cry, cry

You said you would find me
But you know you never came, yeah
You told me you would find me, pretty baby
But you know you never came, yeah
Well, the other night, you talked in your sleep, baby
You called out another man's name, yeah

You said you loved me
Oh, but you know it was a lie
You said you loved me
Whoa, but you know it was a lie
Ooh, that's the reason, but it's not the only reason
I wanna cry, cry, cry

[Spoken: Nicki Minaj]
The disgusting pig this person is
Calling a dead child a monkey, but telling people somebody talked about your child that never talked about your motherfucking child
So you can get some fucking sympathy points?

They can't feed they fuckin’ family
Because you mad at what another man stickin' his dick inside of
You mad... you mad at a woman for what a man is doin'
And that’s a problem with so many black women and women, period
Oh, 'cause she's not black, she refers to you black women...
Oh we got the receipts for that too...
FYI, she refers to black women as monkeys and roaches
ROACHES!
These are the women going hard... for her... the roaches... when the lights come out...

[Laughing in background]

They stay scrambling, the roaches, chile! We roaches!
Black women is roaches now!
We roaches, be clear!
Now, I'ma say... no!
So there are two beautiful women right now...
Who... who... have been accused of...
Whoever they slept with, and you know, whatev...
And so they were, you know, allegedly attacked
And are cut up everywhere...
But oh, not by women, men!
You sent a man to beat on women!
Lemme tell you... I'ma say it again...
What's sad is that a lot of times a man can hurt a woman so badly
That she no longer even knows who she's angry at
And what happens is... first of all let's get on 1-800 number for Postpartum Depression
Because, let me tell you something, that’s nothing to joke about
You just had the biggest blessing of your life with a child
And in two week you have attacked three women?
One at Fashion Week, and left looking the way you left looking so that people could point their fingers at our culture and at our community and laugh at us some more?

[Laughing and talking in the background]

Lemme tell you something, a woman cannot give your man pussy
If he doesn’t stick his dick in there
Who are you angry at, sweetheart?
And you wanna let your publicist write something about stopping bags?!
Do you know what the fuck it is to sit in your fucking room for hours and days at the time writing raps?!
You came into my fucking culture!
I've never had to fuck a DJ to play my songs!
This is not funny and this is not about attacking
This is about getting this woman some fucking help!
This woman is at the best stage of her career and she’s out here throwing bottles and throwing shoes?!
Who the fuck is gonna get her a fucking intervention?!
Get the fuck outta here with this bullshit!
You niggas don't care until somebody is fucking dead!
You niggas want somebody to fucking die until y'all stop!
Until you stop this bullshit, laughing at this shit, this shit ain't fuckin’ funny!
You put your hands on certain people, you gon' die!
Period!
I'm not the bitches in the strip club
And I'm not a bitch on a reality show
My money is very fucking long, too

[Verse 1]
Standing on the waters casting your bread
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Freedom just around the corner for you
But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 2]
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 3]
You’re a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care? Ain’t nobody there would want to marry your sister
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 4]
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 5]
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame
Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 6]
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery grey
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman
Jesse was late again, but I don't mind I’ll wait for him
Jesse gets mean sometimes
But I don't mind, he's got a lot on his mind
And dammit Jesse. It’s true. I do love you
And dammit Jesse. It's true. I do trust you

Jesse's a mess again
So I lie awake with him
And he's holding on to something I can't see
But it's alright, I'm safe with him

And dammit Jesse. It's true
I do, love you
And dammit Jesse. It’s true, I do trust you

And he could be bad, and turn his back;
He could break all his promises. But when I see Jesse I smile
When I see Jesse I smile
He could be bad, and turn his back;
He could break all his promises. But when I see Jesse I smile
When I see Jesse I smile

[Verse 1]
Back in the days when I held you
Oh, I really held you
I pulled you and compelled you
And maybe I was spellbound too
Back in the days if I hurt you
Oh, I really hurt you
Could barely look you in the eyes then
Maybe I'm a con man, a con man

[Verse 2]
You don't need a rabbit's foot or good luck charm
What the hell, wish you well
Couldn't do you no harm and I do you no harm
I hope he's bright and big and strong
With all the things, all the things that you want
Good luck

[Intro]
If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

[Bridge]
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

[Outro]
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (So)
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh
Down the mountainside
To the coastline
Past the angry tide
The mighty diesel whines

And the tunnel comes
And the tunnel goes
Round another bend
The giant drivers roll

I rode the Highball
I fired the Daylight
When I turned sixty-five
I couldn't see right

It was Mr. Jones
We've got to let you go
It's company policy
You've got a pension though

Roll on, Southern Pacific
On your silver rails
On your silver rails
Roll on, Southern Pacific
On your silver rails
Through the moonlight
I put in my time
I put in my time
Now I'm left to roll
Down the long decline

I ain't no brake man
Ain't no conductor
But I would be though
If I was younger

Roll on, Southern Pacific
On your silver rails
On your silver rails
Roll on, Southern Pacific
Roll on, on your silver rails

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Keep your eyes all on this fatty
If you like what you see take your hands and grab it
Hurry, hurry
Hurry, hurry
Late night get like all this real magic
Ride it automatic till the sun come up, ooh
Early, early
Early, early

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Ant Clemons]
Bad Trinidadian, need to let daddy in
If I need to spend some cash, fuck it, then, I'm zaddy, then
She in love with a man she can’t be with
But she know that pussy gon' leave him seasick (Mhm)
Every time she round, she get treat like the sidekick
Until that side chick went and got some side dick
Sun-kissed princess, gold toe ring
Smacker lip gloss, backside swole thing
When we first met, she couldn't take the whole thing
Nextel, brr-brr, that's my old ring
Polo Kanye, black-cladded fam
Kept a signed autograph in your binder notepad
We was freshmen, you was out to test men
You was up at Spelman, I might have fucked your best friend, haha

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Keep your eyes all on this fatty
If you like what you see take your hands and grab it
Hurry, hurry
Hurry, hurry
Late night get like all this real magic
Ride it automatic till the sun come up, ooh
Early, early
Early, early

[Verse 2: Ant Clemons]
I don’t know no patience, ain't got no more time to waste
Serious need that one or two or three more times after foreplay
Rocket-rocket-rocket-rocket ship blast like it's Jimmy Neutron
Told him fuck me good with them Jimmy Choo's on
I can't wait till you're all on me, yeah (yer-yer-yer-yerhhh)
You know I love it, love it, love it, love it (love it, love it)

[Chorus: Ant Clemons]
Keep your eyes all on this fatty
If you like what you see take your hands and grab it
Hurry, hurry
Hurry, hurry
Late night get like all this real magic
Ride it automatic till the sun come up, ooh
Early, early
Early, early
Keep your eyes all on this fatty
If you like what you see take your hands and grab it
Hurry, hurry
Hurry, hurry
Late night get like all this real magic
Ride it automatic till the sun come up, ooh
Early, early
Early, early

[Outro: Kanye West]
No fade outs
You can't help nobody, until you help yourself
You can't help nobody, until you help yourself
Nobody's going to help you better than somebody else

You know a man needs a woman right by his side
A man needs a woman right by his side
She keeps him warm at night, he keeps her satisfied

Soul of a woman, soul of a man
A perfect combination ever since the world began
Soul of a woman
Soul of a woman, soul of a man

You can't help nobody, until you help yourself
You can't help nobody, until you help yourself
Nobody's going to help you better than somebody else

You know a man needs a woman right by his side
A man needs a woman right by his side
She keeps him warm at night, he keeps her satisfied
Soul of a woman, soul of a man
A perfect combination ever since the world began
Soul of a woman
Soul of a woman, soul of a man
When I was a younger man
Got lucky with a rock 'n' roll band
Struck gold in Hollywood
All that time I knew I would

Get back to the country
Back where it all began
Get back to the
