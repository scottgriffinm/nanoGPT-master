l the electricity? Did you guys seen New York go dark? Did you guys see World Trade Center go down? Did you guys see all jobs stop for six months? So no one can tell me what God can’t do and what God will do. 

[crosstalk 00:42:28]

Kanye West: (42:27)
One second, one moment. He was waiting. We got five minutes. 

[crosstalk 00:42:40] wait a second. You need to hear this. 

[crosstalk 00:42:54] this woman was sent by God and is so brave to be able to tell you her story. The fact that she was willing to stand up in front of all of you guys and tell you she had an abortion, to make the point of how important it was for her to have the option as a woman because she did not have the resources in order to have a baby as she felt. This woman is so brave. Georgia, can we make a hand for Georgia right now?

Kanye West: (43:19)
We got, we’re going to have to, you’re very 

[crosstalk 00:43:20]. Come up here, you’re third. 

[crosstalk 00:43:20] I’ve got five minutes. I apologize, guys, but we have all the time in the world. We have all the questions. 

[crosstalk 00:43:20] Wait a second. I must 

[crosstalk 00:43:20] that I did smoke a little bit last night. 

[crosstalk 00:43:20] Every women or man who are charged with marijuana will be free. 

[crosstalk 00:44:26] Light up right now. 

[crosstalk 00:44:40] Wait a second. We have five more minutes. You’ve been waiting on this stage for about 17 minutes. What’s your name, sir? Gary, you’re waiting. Gary, Indiana, we about to bring that 

[crosstalk 00:44:55] Michael Jackson’s home. Oh, I’m sorry. 

[crosstalk 00:45:00]

Audience: (43:19)
I love Michael!

Kanye West: (43:19)
Oh, do we still love Michael?

Audience: (45:11)
Yeah! 

[crosstalk 00:45:11]

Kanye West: (45:11)
Do y’all love Cosby? Y’all love Bill Cosby?

Audience: (45:17)
Yeah! 

[crosstalk 00:45:17]

Kanye West: (45:17)
Be quiet. He’s talking about opioids.

Gary: (45:17)
I want to talk about opioids and 

[inaudible 00:45:39].

Audience: (45:17)
Speak up!

Gary: (45:17)
It’s like the treatment. We’re addicted to the treatment.

Kanye West: (45:55)
And by the way, we’re getting addicted to the treatment of the endorphins. Hey, how many times y’all looked up what y’all likes are when you post something? That’s a form of treatment. Y’all getting treated. In Chicago, we call that “getting treated”. When y’all get to comment number eight, who is that person? You don’t even know who that person is.

Audience: (46:13)
Nobody!

Kanye West: (46:14)
That’s the person that’s influencing you, because when you hear bad things about yourself, about a photo, it make you want to up the photo. You want to Photoshop it. You want to 

[crosstalk 00:46:14]

Gary: (46:14)
I’m saying we’re addicted to the treatment. They’re trying to 

[crosstalk 00:46:14].

Kanye West: (46:14)
What I said, this is the solution to make it more, to have 

[crosstalk 00:46:40] more money. Big pharms. We just need to make big pharms. There’s a solution for big pharm. There’s a solution with that. I tell you this, I’m not going up against big pharm; I would die. They would kill me. But I tell you this, sitting next to them, I would make them more money. I would make them more prosperous, but we got to do it in a way where we balance holistic and modernity. 

[crosstalk 00:47:00] Okay, Aisha’s comment is on gun violence in the United States. I live on a 4,000 ranch and I can shoot AR15s all day, day, day, night without going to jail and it feels weird because I grew up in Chicago.

Kanye West: (48:00)
Because I grew up in Chicago where if you use one of the guns, that was strategically placed in your community for you to get locked, you will end up going to jail. I was talking to a fellow billionaire, and he talked about…no I don’t want to use his name. Hey bro, I told you I ain’t finna use his name. You told me to use his name. You think I work for you?

Kanye West: (48:07)
No that’s what I’m talking about. I told…don’t step up but what’s your name? Tell the people what your name is. 

[inaudible 00:48:07].

Kanye West: (48:07)
Hey, guess what? Jesus saved the name. I’ll tell you what.

Kanye West: (48:07)
Real talk. Real talk. Young violence. I tell all my friends I know a place where you can shoot guns for free. Shooting guns are fun. 

[inaudible 00:49:18].People are getting guns at age six. If you guys put down all your weapons, what happens if other countries and all media and all China…I actually couldn’t say. When other countries come in and you have no weapons, what do you think is going to happen? We are slaves. These random women know how to fire a firearm. They are trained to do this. Guns don’t kill people. People kill people.

Kanye West: (49:50)
When I talked to the billionaire…it was another white man I got to be specific. When we moved to the inner cities it was because of the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution is over with now. It’s time to move again. If you have agriculture as your business, you get taxes breaks. Tesla, the original Tesla said that earth is a giant generator. God has given us freedom. You can feed your family and survive off of earth, wind, fire and 

[inaudible 00:50:54] through proper engineering. But the education and the schools and these textbooks that have been given to you, have you ever got a textbook that said “Okay you can buy a hundred acres for a hundred thousand dollars in middle America and you can farm and feed your family?” Has there ever been a class on that? But guess what? There’s a reason…would you agree that there’s a reason why there’s never been a class on that?

Kanye West: (51:14)
Because ever time I talk, you’re directly behind me saying something. What I’m saying is, what I ask for specifically is that when you talk, you talk all the way through. When Kerry talks, he talks all the way through. What I’ve told you, the whole time I’m talking to a hundred people, two hundred…it started with a hundred people it’s down to 

[inaudible 00:52:24] people. And every time that you make a comment 

[inaudible 00:52:32].

Kanye West: (52:53)
And you are adding to the attention of them not understanding 

[inaudible 00:52:53]. That’s what I’m asking you. His name is Shiloh, you want to speak up? Are you done with COVID, okay?

Shiloh: (53:36)
I have two questions. Two quick questions. First question, I want you to elaborate on the 

[inaudible 00:53:36] free of slaves and how 

[inaudible 00:53:39]. Second question, you believe so strongly in the bible, how do you think about 

[inaudible 00:53:45].

Kanye West: (54:36)
I will start the meeting once everyone is completely quiet. Two questions. You got two questions bro, put your hands down. Put your hands down. I’m going to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 10 minutes ago. These are good questions. Put your hands down. Put your hands down. I hear you questions. I heard you sir. You don’t think I know how to listen? 

[inaudible 00:55:17]. No they know everyone’s irrelevant around me. I heard you the first time. No, no. She got some problems. I heard you the first time. No you don’t gap me. On God.

Kanye West: (59:38)
I appreciate that. I got two major, awesome, incredible…you… disrespecting 

[inaudible 00:56:05].

Kanye West: (59:38)
You know what…you know what’s so funny? 

[inaudible 00:56:33]. We always so concerned about how skinny we are. That’s how I got plastic surgery. We always concerned about how good we speak English when it’s not our original language. We always concerned about how good we look and not embarrassing each other in front of an all white country that we work for. And don’t own anything in it. You stay looking bad…I believe we’re all beautiful. It’s not about how we look. It’s about our hearts. It’s about what’s in our souls.

Kanye West: (59:38)
Now, pause for a minute. If I was Trump I would have called you sister soldiers or something. But that’s not my vibe. Pause for a minute. You are the planned person that was sitting here like at TMZ to f*** my rally up. Be quiet.

Kanye West: (59:38)
I’m trying to answer a question and you are doing what the guy did to me at TMZ. You want to be that same person? And your face is covered so we don’t even know who you are.

Kanye West: (59:38)
400 years is related to the bible. 

[inaudible 00:58:19] African American slavery. Slaves to Hebrews and the Egyptians. But we use that term loosely. Like we say “Jesus” anytime we want. But we got educated, we’re going to have to understand that we need to educate ourselves about what that means.

Kanye West: (59:38)
You probably with the press out there. You probably one of them. Hey, somebody go grab him, and take him out.

Kanye West: (59:39)
Give me a second to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 20 minutes ago. Now the thing is, I am not going to pacify you with things that I do not believe in. But I will not put laws on things that you do believe in, but you don’t have no other opportunity to do anything else. I am not that kind of Christian. Jesus loved everyone. Jesus loved gay people. Jesus loved everyone. There’s a lot of Christians that feel like oh Jesus is against gay people. How could Jesus be 

[inaudible 00:59:58] black church. That’s some true sh**.

Kanye West: (01:00:19)
Everybody’s family…everybody has everybody. Everybody’s got some holier than thou worth. 

[inaudible 01:00:19]. Everybody got that one uncle that go to the money, the viral. Everybody got the one uncle that was touching the kids. Everybody got the one uncle…everybody. Everybody’s family…we all are imperfect human beings 

[inaudible 01:00:36]. Jesus loves everyone. He does not discriminate against anyone. Now the Harriet Tubman thing is, I’m sick of this black iconography being used by white organization for us to look up to and say “This is us.” I do not…I own 100% of the Yeezy trademark, but up until now Adidas was getting 85%. And now after this, they either out of business with me or they going to get 10%. I decided not to not make it 15. I decided to make it 10.

Kanye West: (01:01:12)
That was extremely good. That was extremely bad. I’m going to win in 2020. Out.

[Intro harmonizing]

[Verse 1]
I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul now
(Who is it?)
I can't take this stuff no more

[Verse 2]
I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside the dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do!

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away
(Who is it?)
Is it a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

[Bridge]
Hee hee, hee hee

It is a friend of mine?

And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee hee)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee hee)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night

'Cause I'm lying to myself

Did she find in someone else?
And it doesn't seem to matter
(Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right
(Da da da da)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
(Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure

Keep on with the force, don't stop (Keep on, baby)
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop

Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad

Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera
Every guy wished they could
Now it's back to reality for Miss Hollywood

[Verse 1]
All along I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword
It cuts you and it stabs me
All along I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth
But that's your hiding place
You say you love me but it's hard to see
'Cause when he's in your arms
You're throwing rocks at me

[Chorus]
Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want ya
If you can't answer
You know me, hee

[Post-Chorus]
(There is nothing in your eyes)
There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry)
But that's the way you cry girl (Cry girl)
(All is grand, all is bright)
All is grand, all is bright
(You're just studying my mind)

[Verse 2]
I Walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
When I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask, so I can see your face

[Chorus]
Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love, babe?
I don't want ya
If you can't answer
I know you, hee

[Post-Chorus]
(Heaven must be wary)
Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary)
You got me scared, girl
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, tears are due
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?)
Hey, hey, hey

[Bridge]
Hee, hee hee
Hee, hee hee

[Verse 3]
I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
And when I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask
So I can see your face

[Chorus]
Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?

[Pre-Chorus]
You're a whole new generation, you're dancin' through the day
You're grabbin' for the magic on the run
You're a whole new generation, you're lovin' what you do
Put a Pepsi in the motion

[Intro]
Are you doin' this work to facilitate growth or to become famous?
Which is more important?
Getting or letting go?
You can do anything, anything you can do (You can do anything)
You can do anything, anything you can do (You can do anything)

[Chorus]
Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful?
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon (Bitch, I'm back out...)

[Verse 1]
Yeah
To the left of that decimal, I need seven figures to play the joint
Turn up your decibels, peep how I decimate a joint
Check out my projects like them workers that Section 8 appoints
And you'll see how I flipped like exclamation points
My niggas shoot first as if they never played the point, more two guards
Enough straps to fill four U-Hauls
More death than World War II caused
Around these parts we pour the brown just to drown these thoughts
Of black corpses in county morgues, Lord, those images hauntin'
I ain't been asleep yet, it's ten in the mornin'
I'm sendin' a warnin', a problem with me is like the BET Hip-Hop Awards
I'm startin' to see you niggas don't want it
I'm sick of this flauntin', from niggas I know for sure ain't got mo' dough than Cole
Trash rappers, ass backwards, tryna go toe-to-toe
We laugh at ya, staff strapped up on top the totem pole to blast at ya
Bassmasters, look how they tote a pole
Gotta know the ropes and the protocol
Or they gon' for sure blow your clothes half off like a promo code
Made a lil' tune called "Foldin Clothes," and a nigga still ain't known to fold under pressure
Well, you know what Cole do
Make a diamond, they just rhymin', me, I'm quotin' gold
One phone call get you canceled like a homophobe in this PC culture
Address me as the G.O.A.T. like they call Chief Keef Sosa
In my sectional like a fuckin' three-piece sofa
I'm known as the chosen one
Another dead body lay frozen, that's how it go sometimes
When niggas weighin' coke and not the pros and cons
Well, I ain't with that sleepin' underground like a gopher, so I go for mines

[Chorus]
Everything come back around full circle (Nigga, gotta go for mines)
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful? (Yeah)
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon
Now I know why they call it blue moon (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Survival at all costs, every day, niggas get logged off
Bodies get hauled off
Passin' a funeral procession while holdin' my breath in the car, I thought
At times, it be feelin' the devil be winnin' but do that mean God lost?
Just got off the phone with my nigga, he back in the kennel, my dog lost
I brought him 'round close to me before but he
Became addicted to clout and all the hoes we'd meet
I slowly peeped jealousy on his breath whenever he spoke to me
Like on the low, he feelin' that in my shoes is where he supposed to be
I tried to ignore the signs, but they're in the back of my mind
It felt like lettin' a nigga come sleep on your couch and he eatin' up all yo' groceries
My nigga repeated this quote to me, I felt its potency
Said, "Most of these niggas gon' hang themselves, just give 'em the rope and see"
Shit, I heeded that, and what got showed to me
Was screamin' that, some niggas, you gotta leave 'em back
Unfortunately we seen the trap
Niggas be on that demon clock resultantly
They fiend to clap as often as the Genius app misquotin' me, uh
Meanwhile, I see that yo' diamonds is glistenin'
I'm glad that you shinin', but need I remind you my niggas is dimin' and nickelin'?
Scrapin' up whatever coin they can find, the pettiest crime, they committin' it
Just to get by for a limited time, the steepest of mountains, they tryin' to climb
I'm here tryna find the derivative, you niggas don't feel me
You see the clout, you don't see the real me
If I was sick, you niggas wouldn't heal me
Therefore I'm healin' myself, gettin' in tune with my God
Slowly revealin' myself, buildin' my wealth
A nigga touch mine, I'ma kill 'em myself, trust me

[Chorus]
Everything come back around full circle
Why do lies sound pleasant, but the truth hurtful?
Everybody gotta cry once in a while
But how long will it take 'fore you smile?
This is that come-back-to-life shit
My niggas pick me up and we gon' light the city up as if the sun had the night shift
And paint the town red for my nigga found dead too soon
Now I know why they call it blue moon (Yeah)

[Outro]
Bitch, I'm back outside, nigga
I'm back outside
I'm back outside
I'm back outside
Everybody mentions suicide prevention
Man, they even made a hotline
To call up when there's tension, but I got a question
What about a fuckin' homicide?
Need a number for my niggas to call
Whenever there's a urge to get triggers involved
Need a number for my niggas to call
Whenever there's a urge to get triggers involved

[Intro]
Your every kiss, your every touch

[Chorus]
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, uh

[Verse 1]
Sip from the bottle for shit that we bottlin' in
Goin' live, but we not on the 'Gram
This the land of supply and demand
Where my young niggas choppin' up grams
And them choppers won't pry from they hands
Packin' lead like they got a exam
If it's beef, my niggas look just like homewreckers
They got they eye on your mans
I pray to God that it jam
Too many done died in these parts
So we gotta be smart if we tryna see August
Some niggas won't make it past summer regardless
I'm tryin' my hardest to stack my deposits
These niggas be lookin' at me like I got it
Deep down inside, though, I still feel as broke
As that nigga who just graduated from college
Scrapin' up change that got left in my pockets
I'm tryna make nickels turn into a dollar
Ridin' the train, way too shy to go holler
Just watched her get off at her stop, I'm a coward
Fuck it, though, you got a way bigger target
I'ma do it so big, they won't know what to call it
Sound like a whole Lambo' truck in my stomach
Bitch, I ain't hungry, this feeling is starving
Gotta move mama from out them apartments
Gotta put 'Ville on the map, we forgotten
Gotta hit hoes you hang up in your locker
Gotta get rich, 'cause my granny picked cotton
Gotta make hits, 'cause if not, then I'm floppin'
Gotta stay me in the process
Niggas dissed me, it was nonsense
I sat 'em down like his father
My nigga asked, "Why you bother?
We should've caught him and mobbed him"
I said, "We gotta move smarter"
Don't wan' be the reason for one more sad song
I tried to warn niggas they wouldn't last long
I hope that you see how they came and they went
They shots never hit, but they made they attempts
May have a good year like that name on the blimp
But you know what it takes to be poppin' this long?
Dedication on another level niggas never seen in they life
Celebratin' all your first downs like they touchdowns bring a price
Young Simba had the bustdown, yeah, the Lion King on ice
Niggas wanted me to look the part, had to stop takin' advice
Put the jewelry to the side, had to find me, had to find God
Half the time, we be pacifyin', what they expect from us?
But that's treacherous, that shows less of us
I need y'all to see every part of me
Every scar and every artery
Every story that I can recall, then I can fall

[Chorus]
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie (Uh)

[Verse 2]
Lately, I reflect on the times a nigga was low
I got it up off the floor, I'm stronger than ever before
I'm stronger than ever before just like I planned to be
They wanna see me fold, it ain't no thang to me
Thoughts when I was broke, if only I could be
Pockets holdin' hope, it ain't no thang to me
At night, I hit my knees, I prayed for better days
Then found a better me, I got my head on straight

[Outro]
Up, up, and away, just ridin' my wave, I ain't never gon' say nothin'
Nigga throw a shot my way, I just jot down names, ain't never gon' say nothin'
Know you be stressin', hate only block your blessin', I'm never gon' say nothin'
Quit all that flexin', niggas live check to check, I'm never gon' say nothin'
Know that it's destined

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Post-Chorus]
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Verse 2]
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Bridge]
Oh, whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are not alone, I am here with you)
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
(Though you're far away, you and me)
But you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are always in my heart)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh)

[Outro]
You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh!
Together, together
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
You believe in me!
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
Not alone, oh!

[Verse 1]
On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won’t understand
"Don’t accept that what’s happening
Is just a case of all the suffering
Or you’ll find that you’re joining in
The turning away"

[Verse 2]
It’s a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud

[Verse 3]
On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
Mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It’s not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there’ll be
No more turning away?

[Guitar Solo]

[Instrumental Intro/Guitar Riff]

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
You better make your face up with your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter down your door
You better run!

[Instrumental Pre-Chorus/Guitar Riff]

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
You better run all day and run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box
You better run!

[Synth Solo]

[Part 4 (8:40-11:08)]

[Verse 1]
Remember when you were young
You shone like the Sun

[Refrain]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Verse]
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky

[Refrain]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Chorus 1]
You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine

[Verse 3]
You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon

[Refrain]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Verse 4]
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light

[Refrain]
Shine on (Shine on), you crazy diamond (You crazy diamond)

Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver, you seer of visions
Come on, you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine

[Part 5 (11:08-13:32): Instrumental]

[Acoustic Guitar Intro]

[Verse]
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change, did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
Runnin' over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here

[Instrumental Outro and Scatting]

[Verse 1]
The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

[Bridge]
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

[Verse 3]
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Money, get away
You get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four-star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Ah, don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

[Saxophone Solo]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise, it's no surprise
That they're giving none away

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, ooh...

[Spoken Outro: Interview excerpts]
- Yeah -- (chuckles) -- I was in the right!
- Yes, absolutely in the right!
- I certainly was in the right!
- Yeah, I was definitely in the right; that geezer was cruising for a bruising...
- Yeah
- Why does anyone do anything?
- I don't know, I was really drunk at the time...
- I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in number two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground

[Chorus]
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

[Verse 2]
Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one

[Chorus]
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

[Instrumental]

[00:27]
Have your baggage and your passports ready and follow the green line to customs and then to immigration. BA 215 to Rome, Cairo and Lagos

[01:54: Roger Manifold]
Live for today, gone tomorrow. That's me
*Laughs*

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour and Richard Wright]
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour and Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on (Come on, come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

[Chorus]
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Chorus]
I have become comfortably numb

[Verse 2]
Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Instrumental Intro/Guitar Riff]

[Chorus]
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

[Verse 1]
You better make your face up with your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter down your door
You better run!

[Instrumental Pre-Chorus/Guitar Riff]

[Chorus]
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

[Verse 2]
You better run all day and run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box
You better run!

[Synth Solo]

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
I know This place is doomed
Because now it's haunting me

[Bridge]
I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it
OW

[Verse 2]
There's a tapping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughing and a yawning
Where a restless soul is going

[Bridge]
I don't understand it
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
Hey
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Don't understand it

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby? She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy

[Verse 3]
There's a tapping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling

[Bridge]
Don't understand it
(Got a ghost, got a break in the walls)
Yeah yeah
(Got a ghoul, got a break in the halls)
Don't understand it

A suckin' ghost of jealousy
OW

And who gave you the right hurt my baby? She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back, shot an arrow in me
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?

[Verse 1]
I know it's been a while, but I'm glad you came
And I've been thinking 'bout how you say my name
You got my body spinning, like a hurricane
And it feels like you got me going insane
And I can't get enough
So, let me get it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazing
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up
That's what I'm saying

[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot'
Hot, hot, hot, hot (Hot)

[Interlude]
So, are you warming up yet?

[Verse 2]
You got me hypnotized
I never felt this way
You got my heart beating like an 808
Can you rise to the occasion?
I'm patiently waiting, 'cause it's getting late
And I can't get enough, so let me get it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now

Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot (Hot)

[Post-Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Let me break the ice
Let me break the ice

[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot

[Outro]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot (Hot)
(Hot)

[Intro]
Me, now...

[Verse 1]
Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Verse 2]
Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There's a spark in-between us
When we're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I'm asking you tonight

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Spoken Interlude]
If I said I want your body, would you hold it against me?

[Bridge]
Give me something good
Don't wanna wait, I want it now
Drop it, like a hood
And show me how you work it out

[Breakdown]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Outro]
Would you hold it against me?
Would you hold it against me?
Would you hold it against me?
Would you hold it against me?

[Intro]
People can take everything away from you
But they can never take away your truth
But the question is
Can you handle mine?

[Verse 1]
They say I'm crazy
I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty
But I don't give a damn
Getting boys is how I live
Some ask me questions
Why am I so real?
But they don't understand me
I really don't know the deal about my sister
Trying hard to make it right
Not long ago
Before I won this fight

[Chorus]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
That's my prerogative
(It's my prerogative)
It's the way that I wanna live
(It's my prerogative)
You can't tell me what to do

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong
I'm really not souped
Ego trips is not my thing
All these strange relationships really gets me down
I see nothing wrong in spreading myself around

[Chorus]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
That's my prerogative
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
That's my prerogative
It's the way that I wanna live
(It's my prerogative)
You can’t tell me what to do

[Bridge]
Why can't I live my life
Without all of the things
That people say?

[Chorus]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
They say I'm crazy
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
(They say I'm nasty)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
(It's my prerogative)
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
(It's my prerogative)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions
That's my prerogative (It's my prerogative)

[Chorus]
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
Love the guy, love the guy, love the guy...
Love the guy

[Post-Chorus]
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal

[Chorus]
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
Can't deny, love the guy...
Love the guy
Woke up this morning with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Woke up this morning with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Woke up this morning with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah

I'm walking and talking with my mind
Stayed on freedom
I'm walking and talking with my mind
Stayed on freedom
I'm walking and talking with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah

Ain't nothing wrong with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Oh, there ain't nothing wrong with keeping my mind
Stayed on freedom
There ain't nothing wrong with keeping your mind
Stayed on freedom
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah
I'm singing and praying with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Yeah, I'm singing and praying with my mind
Stayed on freedom
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you used to talk about
Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house

[Chorus]
But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still
Go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway

[Chorus]
But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Seven summers ago (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Seven summers ago (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Seven summers ago (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Seven summers ago (Ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for the can of Gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

[Verse 1]
You should come back to our place, baby
Don't be afraid of our love
On the second floor, darling
In a second flat, hurry up
'Cause down in Arkansas the stores are all closed
The kids in their hoodies, they dance super slow
We're white-hot forever and only God knows

[Chorus]
You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for the can of Gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

[Post-Chorus]
We'll be white-hot forever (Forever, forever)
White-hot forever (Forever, forever)
White-hot forever
And ever and ever, amen

[Verse 2]
Could I come back to the ranch, baby?
I had to get away for a while
Just to rest my nerves, darling
Can I make you laugh with a smile?
You knew when you chose me
I was nothing but ordinary
And now the wind's blowing, reminding you of what you know

[Chorus]
You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for that can of Gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

[Post-Chorus]
We'll be white-hot forever (Forever, forever)
White-hot forever (Together, together)
White-hot forever
And ever and ever, the end
White-hot forever (Forever, forever)
White-hot forever (Together, together)
White-hot forever
And ever and ever, amen

[Outro]
You should stay real close to Jesus
If you don't pray, you'll never learn
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
You know what I'm sayin'?
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
I like living here
Trade this body for the can of Gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

[Intro]
Ayy, let me hear that ho, Jeff

[Chorus]
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear (Cardo got wings)
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Ayy
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Ayy

[Verse]
Park him on the spot, park him if he say he hot
Park him while his friends watch
I am everything you not
They say shame on me, I got the underground on lock
That's what hoes say, that's what the bros say
I tell a freak bitch, "Baby, let's roleplay"
I like the kinks bitch, fuck me 'til the OJs
I mean my chain a woo-sah, I mean my game a woo-sah
I want some head in my new car, bitch, I don't care who drive by
You know I could make you famous
You know life bring changes
Shit, I changed locations soon as that big bag came in
That's a mighty fine ass you got
Thought I forgot?
I can make the play and cash it out
Thought I forgot? Whoa

[Chorus]
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear (Cardo got wings)
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Ayy
Bitch come here, I love money, get this shit clear
I will park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Don't make me park yo' ass (I will park yo' ass)
Ayy

[Verse 1]
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Verse 2]
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Bridge]
You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
(Ah, ah, ah)
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

[Outro]
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Verse 1]
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Verse 2]
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

[Verse 1]
Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

[Verse 2]
Something med school did not cover
Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
And some things you just can't speak about

[Bridge]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve (With you I serve), with you I fall down (Down), down (Down)
Watch you breathe in (Watch you breathe in), watch you breathing out (Out), out (Out)

[Outro]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

[Verse 1]
What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Verse 2]
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
They say "move on," but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Bridge]
I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but

[Outro]
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that

[Verse 1]
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Verse 2]
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Bridge]
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you

[Verse 1]
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

[Chorus]
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

[Chorus]
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

[Verse 3]
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

[Chorus]
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah)

[Verse 1]
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

[Outro]
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times

[Verse 1]
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Verse 2]
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying

[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

[Chorus]
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Outro]
At least I'm trying

[Verse 1]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Outro]
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"
(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car")
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
("Meet me behind the mall")
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

[Verse 1]
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Bridge]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

[Verse 2]
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won’t tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long

[Verse 1]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces

[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Verse 2]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Bridge]
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

[Outro]
Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight

[Verse 1]
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Verse 2]
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Bridge]
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign
Ah, ah

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 1]
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

[Chorus]
And they said
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"

[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

[Chorus]
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

[Outro]
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time

[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

[Bridge]
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

She said, who wouldn't do what they said they would
I'm sorry, but I know I can make it up to you
'Cause I know how I feel when I get close to you
I said, walk into Louis, get whatever you want
I know money don't buy love, but I said it's a start, and
I'll show you the life you want in your heart, and

It's that (It's that)
Damn, Pliz
There go your tag

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I made everything I'm in, it's some exclusive shit
You ain't gotta test my diamonds 'cause they too legit
I just got rid of my wallet, all I need's a safe
On my grind twenty-four seven, I don't need a break
Front yard full of cars, I don't need a whip
Eighteen hour flight to China, we can take a trip
Pouring shots of McQueen, told her take a sip
Money long, this that Bokhara scent

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I might drive my '62 with the gold rims
I might put the diamonds up and bring the gold in
I remember when I had a flip cell phone
Bad bitch, thick thighs and her hair long
New vibes, let her hop in, tell her test drive
Talkin' big, I don't keep the flex light
Turks and Caicos trips, we on the next flight
Seven hundred horses runnin' red lights (Red lights)
Red lights (Red lights), red lights (Red lights)
Strippers know I'm tippin', see them red lights (Red lights)
Red lights (Red lights), red lights (Red lights)
Walk up in it, kill these niggas, that's a grave site

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I made everything I'm in, it's some exclusive shit
You ain't gotta test my diamonds 'cause they too legit
I just got rid of my wallet, all I need's a safe

Money long, this that Bokhara scent

[Verse 2: Toosii]
Steerin' wheel got a grip for drag, uh
New car, skrrt, might crash
0 to 100, go fast
Got no limit when I hit the gas
My engine go vroom, blast
When I cop don't look at the tag
Rear view, put him in the past
Switch gears like I switch my swag
Pop the trunk put the bag in it, I be lag switching when I skrrt-skrrt
840 horsepower, hit the gas, leave him in the dirt-dirt
Loyalty, love, and cars
Got a bad broad but I'm here when the bag talk
Better move off the road when we on the road 'cause we 'bout to turn you to asphalt
Yeah, my family like the mob
When I move the squad, we got a hundred-one rods
We got a hundred-one broads
Ain't in a Wraith, but we can look up at the stars
I say a prayer to God
Give Him my all, I can tell that you floss
Switch whips like I'm switching my car
Shittin' on him, I just came out a stall

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I made everything I'm in, it's some exclusive shit
You ain't gotta test my diamonds 'cause they too legit

[Verse 1]
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Bridge]
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Outro]
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Pocketful of honey and I'm ready to go
No, I ain't got no money, but I'm letting you know
That I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)
Body make you silly, make you do what I want
Oh baby, I can make it pretty, I could string you along
But I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I couldn't live without your touch
No, I could never have too much
I'll breathe you in forever and ever
Hallucinate

[Chorus]
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name

[Verse 2]
Put you in my hall of fame, middle of the wall
Yeah, you're my one, my favourite, my ride or die, oh
Yeah, I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I couldn't live without your touch
No, I could never have too much
I'll breathe you in forever and ever
Hallucinate

[Chorus]
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Call my name
Call my name
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name

[Count-in]
...three, four

[Verse 1]
Some days I look
I look at you with eyes that shine
Some days I don't
I don't believe that you are mine

[Chorus 1]
It's no good asking me what time of day it is
Who won the match or scored the goal
Some days I look
Some days I look into your soul

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I laugh
I laugh to think how young we were
Sometimes it's hard
It's hard to know which way to turn

[Chorus 2]
Don't ask me where I found that picture on the wall
How much it cost or what it's worth
Sometimes I laugh
I laugh to think how young we were

[Chorus 3]
We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real
Inside each one of us is love
And we know how it feels

[Verse 3]
Some days I cry
I cry for those who live in fear
Some days I don't
I don't remember why I'm here

[Chorus 4]
No use reminding me, it's just the way it is
Who ran the race or came in first
Some days I cry
I cry for those who fear the worst

[Chorus 3]
We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real
Inside each one of us is love
And we know how it feels

[Verse 1]
Some days I look
I look at you with eyes that shine
Some days I don't
I don't believe that you are mine

[Chorus 1]
It's no good asking me what time of day it is
Who won the match or scored the goal?
Some days I look
Some days I look into your soul

Some days I look
I look at you with eyes that shine

[Intro]
I got this light shinin' in my—
You can turn that light off
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything is on purpose
Everything is on purpose, on purpose, yeah
Everything is on purpose, yeah
Everything is on purpose, on purpose, yeah
Mmm-hmm
Hell yeah, okay

[Verse]
You can bet I never tell a lie in my songs
You fakin', how the fuck you coming flexin' with a Scion?
I'm buyin' anything I put my eyes on
No bygones, no motherfuckin' bygones
You need to do better, I keep it hot, I choose weather
That's God level, solid, I'm all metal
You soft Jello, I am flyin' higher than falsetto
What's on special? Short bus dropped to the floor bus
Full course, got her pussy wetter than pool shorts
They waitin', never playin' like the side of the hoop court
Decided to do more, I'm runnin' my own shit
I know I look fantastic, I'm so happy you noticed
You should focus on yourself, why your lips so loose?
You talk a lot of shit, but you don't sip no juice
High on opinions, but you low on funds
Shit, it's my time and it's your time of the month
Rhymin' ain't really nothin' but boredom
I just absorb, then I'm on
Gee, I'm exitin' orbit, but more importantly
I'm gettin' up every mornin'
Too many squares in your circle
You way too out of proportion, so act accordingly
Normally I'm torn between good and bad
How I'm 'bout to knock 'em down, uppercut, hook or jab
I ain't seen this much food since back in cookin' class
Let me see what else inside this goody bag
Everything is on purpose
Temperature is risin', my hand is on the furnace
Adventures of a dyin' breed
I was way too high to even try to see
But finally, I'm glidin' on the surface
JuJu on Burfict, lights out, picture-perfect right now
Not concerned with your bullshit, pipe down
I might just pull up to the White House
Shit... Unlikely
The president say my name again, he gotta fight me
I ain't puttin' that politely, that's word to Spike Lee
Somethin' don't seem right, not at all
Little tiny-ass pants, why your pockets small?
One foot in front of the other, I'm 'bout a hundred tall
Overkill, Jonah Hill numbers with the Moneyball
I called a lot of shots, missed a bunch of calls
See the phone, Al Capone, it's on silent
Home on a solid gold throne, when in Rome
Tell 'em all, "Keep quiet and please leave me alone"

[Verse 1]
You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less l love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Bridge]
No
No, no, no, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you'll see me cry)
Ahhh
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Chorus]
'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes

And don't come with no trouble stuff
You'll get jumped just like double Dutch (Bitch)
I roll a double Dutch to see the huff and puff

And if them hoes got clothes, throw some cash on 'em (Throw some cash on 'em)
I need them hoes with some titties and a ass on 'em (Big ass)
Flat-back bitches, I'ma pass on 'em (Yeah)
Money over hoes, on a money overflow
And hoes comin' in from the Poconos (Come on)
You know how it goes

If there's cake in my reach, then I better get a piece (Better get a piece)

[Chorus]
If you 'bout your money, throw your hands to the sky
'Cause the cream gon' stand by your side
Get, get that, get that (Yeah)
And if you 'bout your dollars, put them hands in the air
If you got enough money to share

Every part in my heart, I’m giving out
Every song on my lips, I’m singing out
Any fear in my soul, I’m letting go
And anyone who asks, I’ll let 'em know

[Pre-Chorus]
She’s the one, she’s the one, I say it loud
She’s the one, she’s the one, I say it proud
Ring a bell, ring a bell for the whole crowd
Ring a bell, ring a bell

[Chorus]
I’m telling the world
That I’ve found the girl
The one I can live for
The one who deserves
To give all the light
A reason to fly
The one I can live for
A reason for life

You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain

This is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

[Bridge]
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers I need

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know why

Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So, choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

[Drop]
(We were born to die)

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So, choose your last words
This is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

[Verse 1]
I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all alone
I had to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand?
I've changed my plans

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I (I), I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself

[Verse 2]
I know supposedly I'm lonely now (Lonely now)
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone (Someone)
But aren't I someone? (Aren't I someone? Yeah)
I'd (I'd) like to be your answer (Be your answer)
'Cause you're so handsome (You're so handsome)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know better
Than to drive you home
'Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again

[Chorus]
But I (I), I'm in love (Love, love, love, love)
With my future
And you don't know her (Ooh)
And I, I'm in love (Love, love)
But not with anybody here
I'll see you in a couple years

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
27 missed calls lightin' up my cell phone
Sending you a text sayin', "Call you when I get home"
Taking off my work clothes, workin' in a cold one
45 group texts, 50 group DMs
Send another text askin' me if I've seen them
Pushin' back a deadline, gotta make my bedtime
Then I crack a smile, 'cause I love you and I'd do it all again

[Chorus: Laura Les]

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
I don't need to tell you why you going every night
I don't have a thing anymore
You've been looking everywhere to find me
And really I've been mad at you
Throwing my phone at the wall
If you knew all the days I messed up
I broke some promises, made mistakes
We can't make it back from this

[Bridge: Dylan Brady]
Used to love that ringtone when you called me
Now it makes me sick (Sick)
Used to love that ringtone when you called me
Now it makes me sick (Sick, sick)

[Chorus: Laura Les]

Whisper in your ear a little bit, but never too much
It's on the hush, I'd rather tell you with the way that I touch
You, every inch of your skin
My fingertips are dancin' with you, you my ballerina
You do a split, I split the difference
Yeah, you love to talk, I love to listen
And girl, it's a promotion every time we change positions
Okay, I'm swimmin' inside your linen like it's a ocean
Let me mix you a potion
Let me shake the walls, put this in motion
Let me get you goin'
My ears is open when you speakin'
Yeah, we playin' hookie, stay in bed, but we ain't sleepin'
Ain't a need for leavin' ever

I feel like this could be a part of something good
I don't know who you are
But let's try it, try it, try it, try it
Let's try it, try it, try it, try it
Let's try it, try it, try it, try it
We can have a house, yeah, we could build a home

[Verse: Laura Les]
Okay, we've been talking for like a minute and like, texting and that's been really cool but like, here's a warning
Wanna be close to me?
Read my lips: big mistake
I've got baggage from the wall to the window
And I'm really insecure and I'm not single
And I'm bad at Instagram and I'm addicted to energy drinks, yeah, I- I'll admit it
But if you want to we can do a thing
We can have a house and we can have rings
But if you think we'll have money you're wrong
'Cause my music sucks!

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I feel like this could be a part of something good
I don't know who you are
But let's try it, try it, try it, try it

[Pre-Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Feel just- I'm just happy
I can't feel so I just walk away
"Alright," I said, "I'm done with this"
But now it seems less wrong

[Chorus: Laura Les]
And now when I fuck it up
Even though now when I fuck it up
I never hit the ground I fuck it up
I fuck it up, I fuck it up

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
We could be all alone tonight
We could be something real (something real)
We could go anywhere tonight
We could take all night
We could go anywhere

[Verse: Laura Les]
Lately I've been feeling suffocated
Tired and empty, pigeon-holed and overrated
Even though I'm not rated high
And lately I've been thinking we could leave here
Buy a ticket, tour us on a long vacation
Sun dresses and photographs

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
We could be all alone tonight
We could be something real
We could go anywhere tonight
We could take all night
We could go anywhere
Ground control to Major Tom
Ground control to Major Tom

Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground control (Nine) to major Tom (Eight)
(Seven, six) Commencing countdown (Five), engines on (Four)
(Three, two) Check ignition (One) and may gods (Blastoff) love be with you

This is ground control to major Tom, you've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare

This is major Tom to ground control, I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
Here am I sitting in a tin can far above the world
Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles, I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much, she knows
Ground control to Major Tom, your circuits dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you...

Here am I sitting in my tin can far above the Moon
Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do
Yo, what's up, everybody?
This is Lil' Jen, aka MC Gelfling!
I'm about take you on a little journey!
Raise up your glasses, y'all
And get ready for the story of the Dark... Cris... tal!

Once upon a time, in the distant land of Thra
There was a huge-ass super-sized bottle of Cristal
Living under three suns, all the peeps were having fun!
They were clinking and drinking, Cristal for everyone, but then there was a drive-by
Oh, snap, hit the deck! It was the Skeksis in a Lexus with a tech!
Bond got wrecked, it split two different races to two different places
The Skeksis headed West with their creepy dead bird faces
The UrRus waited on the East Coast for all their help to come
They were a bunch of Mystics who liked to sit around and hum...

Aw, yeah, that sounds good right there
In step, the prophecy, there's no stopping me!
Gelfling's gonna help things, pretty soon we'll be poppin C-R-I-S to the T-A-L
Full throttle, fix the bottle, and break that spell!
The whole world is ugly; no one's sipping on bubbly
Want to get busy, but without the fizzy, the ladies won't love me
I've gotta save the land of Thra; I hear a foreign distant call
Gonna wreck me some Skeksis and go get that Cristal

I went to Aughra and got that cracked up shard of Cristal
Then I met Kira and Fizzgig, he was a little fuzzy ball. (Sup, y'all!)

Jumped on a Landstrider, rode to the castle, faced off with the Skeksis. Man, those dudes are crazy assholes!
I put the cracked shard of the bottle back into the right spot!
Now the East and West Coasts got back together, and this joint is f***ing hot!

Yeah, this party's a blast, Cristal's flowing fast
I'm thinking I wanna get up in Kira's ass
We're all having a ball, so there won't be no last call
West and East, squashed the beef! They're all drinking Cristal
But the people still coming, and the Mystics still humming, they go...

(Yeah)
That's the end of the Dark Cristal
Hoes!

Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield & Pete Rock]
Add a little sugar (Ow!), honeysuckle and (Woo!)
A great big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't miss (Uh-huh) with a dozen roses
(Mr. West) Such would astound you
(Pete Rock) The joy of children laughing around you
(Uh) These are all the makings of you (Woo!)

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Pete Rock]
Pete Rock, hit me one time
I give 'em my life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine
They wanna give me gray skies, get me drunk
Get me high, get me something to get me by
I gave her a handshake, only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now there’s crumbs all over the damn place (Uh-huh)
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood Planned Parenthood
'Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won’t make it to the family will
If I don’t make it, can’t take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they don’t know how insanity feel
Don C. just had a shorty, so it’s not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield & Pete Rock]
Add a little sugar (Woo!), honeysuckle and (Come on)
A great big expression of happiness (Ow!)
Boy, you couldn't miss (Uh) with a dozen roses
(Kanye) Such would astound you
(Pete Rock) The joy of children laughing around you
(Uh) These are all the makings of you (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
No electro, no metro, a little retro, ahh, perfecto
You know the demo, your boy act wild
You ain't get the memo? Yeezy’s back in style
Now one room got Gidget—the other got Bridget
What’s more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters
Nah, you ain't listen; they black—they sistas
They mama named 'em after white bitches
So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelry’s Egyptian, know the hunger’s Ethiopian
Stupid questions like, "Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?"
This beat deserves Hennessy
A bad bitch, and a bag of weed: the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life’s cursed? Well, mine’s an obscenity

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield & Pete Rock]
Add a little sugar (Ow!), honeysuckle and (Uh-huh)
A great big expression of happiness (Woo!)
Boy, you couldn't miss (Uh) with a dozen roses
(Uh-huh) Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you (Woo!)
These are all the makings of you

[Interlude: Kid Cudi & Pete Rock]
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now
Don’t let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (One-two, okay)
Don’t let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (One-two, okay)
Don’t let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now, yeah
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, when you don't, shit
And you do when you can, one-two when I wanna
And you— and don't stop, oh

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield & Pete Rock]
Add a little sugar (Ow!), honeysuckle and (Come on)
A great big expression of happiness (Yeah)
Boy, you couldn't miss (Ah) with a dozen roses
(We did it) Such would astound you (Let's go; let's)
The joy of children laughing around you (Let's)
(Ah!) These are all the makings of you

[Intro]
Whose fault?

[Chorus]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game, for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, name, for sure

[Bridge]
I'll call you bitch for short
As the last resort, as my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end now, now we both for wrong

[Chorus]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
And it is I not fighting you, for sure
Let's call names, names, I hate you for
One day for sure you have to knock on the door

[Verse 1]
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else" (Someone else, someone else)
I took a piss and dismiss it and off it
And I went and found somebody else (Else, else)
Fuck arguing and harvestin' the mum-puh-nuh
I'd rather be by my fucking self (Self)
Till about two o'clock and I call back up in the suhm-puh-nuhm-puh suhm-puh-nuh you dealt (Dealt)

[Chorus]
And I just sing to play the blame game, I love you more
Until it's up, thum-puh-nuhm-nuh for sure
And call names, names, I hate you more
Is there anything I can do to hold, like, uh-f-fuh

[Verse 2]
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around and some feelings might surface
When I ought for too long to— uh, think since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this kind of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine

[Chorus]
And play the blame game, I love you more
Take uh-seh, ah-puh-luhm-suhn-do
And call names, names, I hate you, whore
You can't do somethin', damn, like "God", suhm-hoah

[Intro: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Nah, nah, who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: "What you gon' do now?"
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh, look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
That's the monster with the flows, monster with the shows
Monster with clothes, monster with the hoes
Buy 'em new heels just to keep 'em on they toes
Keep it Drew Hill, fly steps from the door
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, "Dutty Wine" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Outro: Bon Iver]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide (no)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

[Verse 1]
Diamonds leave me frozen cold
By now you should know me better (Better)
I would rather spend your time
I don't need these hollow treasures

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at me now
Look at me like you (Ooh)
You don't really care, you (Ooh)
I want you there, you (Ooh)
If you don't listen, man

[Chorus]
You gotta go
If you still don't know
That my love is your top, top dollar (Ah)
Rollies and gold
No, they don't come close to my love
I'm your top, top dollar (Ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, you
No, you can't afford to lose me
You can't buy my money 'cause
I'm your top, top dollar (Ah)
Hey, you
You should know a thing about me
You can stack your money but
I'm your top, top dollar (Ah)

[Verse 2]
Even when I fall asleep I believe in simple pleasures
Maybe we're not meant to be
'Cause I don't need these precious metals

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at me now
Look at me like you (Ooh)
You don't really care, you (Ooh)
I want you there, you (Ooh)
If you don't listen, man

[Chorus]
You gotta go
If you still don't know
That my love is your top, top dollar (Ah)
Rollies and gold
No, they don't come close to my love
I'm your top, top dollar (Ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, you
No, you can't afford to lose me
You can't buy my money 'cause
I'm your top, top dollar (Ah)
Hey, you
You should know a thing about me
You can stack your money but
I'm your top, top dollar (Ah)

[Bridge]
(I'm your top, top dollar)
Look at me now
Look at me like you (Ooh)
You don't really care, you (Ooh)
I want you there, you (Ooh)
If you don't listen, man

[Chorus]
You gotta go
If you still don't know
That my love is your top, top dollar (Ah)
Rollies and gold
No, they don't come close to my love
I'm your top, top dollar (Ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, you
No, you can't afford to lose me
You can't buy my money 'cause
I'm your top, top dollar (Ah)
Hey, you
You should know a thing about me
You can stack your money but
I'm your top, top dollar (Ah, ah)

[Intro: Stuart Price & Dua Lipa]
(Dance)
Woohoo

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa & Madonna]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride (For a ride)
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life (For life)
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like (I like)
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa & Madonna, Madonna]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is liberating
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Madonna, Madonna]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me (Come and dance with me)

[Verse 2: Madonna]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see it written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
No, we're never gonna be apart

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna with Dua Lipa]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is liberating
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Madonna, Madonna]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me (Baby, won't you come and dance with me)
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me (Come on, dance with me)

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa & Madonna, Madonna]
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride (Baby, let me take you for a ride)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride (Can't stop it, baby)

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
Let's go!
Boy, I'm advanced, got my real tight pants
When I back it up, I put you in a trance (Woo)
If you wanna dance, then show me all your bands
'Cause tonight, I might give you a chance
(Let's get it, skrrt) Pull up in the coupe
Ooh, that dude, he look hella cute
Yeah, he lookin' at me like "Ooh"
Suck my breasts like Betty Boop (Woo)
Oh my, my, my (My, my)
Get to stuttering like "I-I-I" (I-I)
I'm a freak, I like to play shy
But I will get it poppin', anything, I'll try it
Say I'm on his top five list
On a Major Key like Khaled
Don't speak, open up your eyelids
I can be your girl if you keep it private

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa with Madonna, Madonna]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is liberating
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Madonna, Madonna]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
(Come and dance with me)

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa & Madonna]
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
(Come on, let me take you for a ride)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
(Come on, let me take you for a ride)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Madonna]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (You are my starlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me (Come on, dance with me)
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Outro: Dua Lipa & Madonna, Dua Lipa & Madonna]
Woohoo
I'm levitating (Woo)
Come on, come on, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
(Come on, let me take you for a ride)
I'm levitating (Woo)
Come on, come on, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating (Woohoo)
(Can't stop it baby, ah)

[Verse 1]
Give me a minute
Just one will do
I'll say goodbye, to gossamer skies
The city will move out of frame
But it’s still you who remains

[Verse 2]
Give me a minute
Kiss me again
I'll say goodbye, to cloudy blue skies
I trade all I got in my name
For you instead of this pain

[Bridge]
Maybe it's time to forget you
Maybe it's time to throw dirt upon your name
Or place blame
But it's no one's fault
No, it's no one's fault
We're just late

[Outro]
I'll give you a minute
Let you have peace
I'll say farewell, to what I can't tell
I bet that you'll do just the same
And maybe I'm what remains

[Part 1: Nothing]

[Verse 1]
I don’t wanna leave
So tell me why I’m going
I don’t wanna leave
But I’m gone
I don’t wanna leave
But I’m already running
And if you ask what’s wrong
"Nothing"

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I’m so sorry
I am a fool
I’m so sorry
For what I’m about to do

[Chorus]
Here’s your shirt I stole
Take back what you gave me to hold
I can wear my own coat when it’s cold
I don’t need yours, mmm
‘Cause I don’t think I can do this anymore

[Outro]
I’m not sorry
That I loved you ‘til I couldn’t breathe
It was lovely
But I know that it’s not what I need
It was good, but it’s time for me to leave

[Part 2: Sad N Stuff]

[Verse 1]
Something doesn’t feel right
Maybe it’s the time
Something doesn’t feel like it used to
And nothing really rhymes
Maybe it’s the changing of the seasons
Or maybe it’s a sign
Hmmm, hmmm

[Verse 2]
Something doesn’t sit well
Maybe it’s the food
Something doesn’t fit
Well, I think I always knew
That it could be the way I don’t speak Spanish
Or it could be you
Hmmm, hmmm

[Chorus]
He feels good to come home to
But not to stay
I’m afraid
That he feels good to hold on to
But it feels good to say
That I’d be okay
Without you, I’d feel the same

[Bridge]
I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m alone all at once
And I don’t know, I don’t know how to get back what was
Is it something in the wind or the rain that makes me sad and stuff?
Or is it just you?

[Outro]
He feels good to come home to
But not to stay

[Part I: Over-the-Ocean Call]

[Intro]

[?] the corner
No
Please, just—
No, hold on, I'm—hold on

Alright, just back off, back up
No, 

[?] start

[?] seven days

[Verse 1]
Does this make sense to you?
'Cause it doesn't make sense to me
Does this have weight for you?
'Cause it doesn't have weight for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I think my mind is far away
Sort of strange, this is
But I think I'll call you anyway
Call collect, 'cause baby this is

[Chorus]
An over-the-ocean call
And I thought I could make it short
But my brain's all out of sorts
I can't hide it
And I'm staring at my wall
And I thought that I wouldn't cry
But breaking your heart breaks mine
I can't hide it
An over-the-ocean call
Is how I told him
This isn't working anymore

[Verse 2]
I needed space from you
But this doesn't look like space to me, oh
And you hate the things I do
And sometimes you hate me

[Pre-Chorus]
But I think my mind is far away
Sort of strange, this is
But I think I'll call you anyway
Call collect, 'cause baby this is

[Chorus]
An over-the-ocean call
And I thought I could make it short
But my brain's all out of sorts
I can't hide it
I'm staring at my wall
And I thought that I wouldn't cry
But breaking your heart breaks mine
I can't hide it
An over-the-ocean call
Is how I told him
This isn't working anymore

[Bridge]
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'll call from over the ocean
This time, this time, this time
I'll break your heart through the phone, I
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'll call from over the ocean
This time, this time, this time
I'll break your heart through the phone, I
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'll call from over the ocean
This time, this time, this time
I'll break your heart through the phone

[Chorus]
With an over-the-ocean call
And I thought I could make it short
But my brain's all out of sorts
I'm staring at my wall
And I thought that I wouldn't cry
But breaking your heart breaks mine
An over-the-ocean call
Is how I told him
This isn't working anymore

[Part II: Andrew]

[Verse]
Let me count all the freckles
On your arms alone
Let me smooth out the wrinkles
In the nicest shirt you own
Oh to love you is sweet like a peach
I think your laugh is my cure
Oh to love you is summer in reach
Kiss me and tell me I'm yours

[Chorus]
Andrew, I'm falling
Without a warning
Until the morning
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Just kiss me slow, oh
I love you, you know

[Verse 1]
I knew that you loved me
When you walked me to class in the dark
I knew that you loved me
When you ran to the store for a card
You couldn't find a pencil, you asked someone sweetly
You wrote out a note and you ran back to meet me
And gave it to me on the bridge
I said I would never forget this
And I never did

[Verse 2]
I knew that you loved me
When you walked me back home one night
I knew that you loved me
When I saw that my shoe was untied
You bent down to tie it in the middle of the street
There was snow everywhere, it was turning to sleet
But I knew when you looked up at me
This was where I was meant to be

[Chorus]
So why?
Why did you have to go?
Why did you have to go so soon?
Why?
Why did you leave me there?
Why did you leave me without you?
Why did I think I knew?

[Verse 3]
I knew that you loved me
But you told me we just weren't right
And I knew that I loved you
When I couldn't fall asleep that night
I miss hearing all of your favorite songs
And I wish I could tell you, "turn it all off," one more time
And everyone laughs and then it is quiet

[Chorus]
Why?
Why did you have to go?
Why did you have to go so soon?
And why?
Why did you leave me there?
Why did you leave me without you?
And why did I think I knew?

[Verse 1]
I am good with directions
I can find my way just by looking at stars
I have not lost my senses
I can find my way through a room in the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't know
How to figure out where to go
From here

[Chorus]
I'm lost and confused
Where do I go without you?
Where do I go without you?

[Verse 2]
I'm the breeze on a fall day
And I don't stop to think, I don't catch my breath
I have memorized places and feelings
I know them all like the back of my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know
How to figure out where to go
From here

[Bridge]
And now I'm alone on this island
I drink so I don't think of you, oh oh
And now I'm alone
I don't know if this was the right thing to do

Where do I go without you?

[Verse 3]
I wanna tell you I miss you
But that contradicts what I told you before
I wanna tell you I love you
But do I really know how I feel anymore?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know
How to figure out where to go
From here

[Chorus]
I'm lost and confused
Where do I go without you?
Oh, where do I go without you?
I'll go softly
So you don't hear a thing
I won't waste my time
Saying things that I don't mean

'Cause we're too young
And I don't want to fall just quite yet
It was you, love
But now I'm alone again

[Verse 1]
If I had the chance
To see the Northern Lights
I would book the next flight
And I'd buy a jacket

If I had the chance
To see snow fall for the first time
I would stop and rewind
To re-find the magic

[Pre-Chorus]
But if there was ever a chance to tell you
That I think about you every single day
I don't know if I could take that chance
Or take your hand and say

[Chorus]
You are on my mind (Oh, oh)
When I miss the snow (Oh, oh)
You show up when I hear that song or
I finally start watching that TV show
I don't know why every time that I think of home
I can picture you standing in the cold
But I, I'm scared 'cause I don't know
If you and I are in the same boat

[Verse 2]
If I had the chance
If you asked out of the blue
How I really truly feel about you
I don't have a clue how that would go

Oh, if I had the chance
Would I really tell you?
Would I bare my soul and maybe end up crying in the bathroom?
Or would I ask you to kiss me slow?

[Chorus]
'Cause you are on my mind
When I miss the snow
You show up when I hear that song or
I finally start watching that TV show, oh-woah
I don't know why every time that I think of home
I can picture you standing in the cold
But I, I'm scared 'cause I don't know
If you and I are in the same boat

[Verse 1]
I'm a little scared you'll leave
Even though you tell me you won't
I'm a little scared of being
Someone that you're scared to love
You don't talk the way he did
And you don't say the things he did
I'm not who I was back then but still

[Verse 2]
I'm a little scared to speak
'Cause I can't find the words to say
And I don't want to make this about me
I just can't hold it in today
But you don't play the games he did
And you don't make me feel like shit
And my mom likes you more than him
But still

[Chorus]
How do I tell you that I've come to like the pain?
How do I tell you that I don't know what it means
To be happy with somebody?
Don't know anything 'bout that
Who the hell can write a love song without making it too sad?
That's all I've been
How do I tell you?
How do I tell you I got it from him?
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
I'm a little prone to feel a little overwhelmed with it all
'Cause you are someone I want to know
And I hope you don't let me fall
You make sure I get home safe
And you always know what to say
I feel like I found my place
But still

[Chorus]
How do I tell you that I've come to like the pain?
How do I tell you that I don't know what it means
To be happy with somebody?
Don't know anything 'bout that
Who the hell can write a love song without making it too sad?
That's all I've been
How do I tell you?
How do I tell you I got it from him?
How do I tell you I got it from him?

[Verse 1]
Headstones and landmines
Flowers and red wines
They buy you nice things
And they sing pretty songs
But it doesn't help
Oak trees and dirt piles
Funerals and mistrials
They say pretty words
And they hug from six feet
But it doesn't help
And nothing works but time
And it all hurts but it's fine

[Chorus]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mhmm, hmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mhmm, hmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
Chaos and carpet
A study in scarlet
The room doesn't talk
And the furniture nods as I pass
Heights marked in pencil
Kitchen utensils
The books don't say sorry
They don't crowd and touch
They're just observers collecting their dust
They know that nothing they say is enough
So they don't say a thing

[Chorus]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mhmm, hmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mhmm, hmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, hmm

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, only "baby"
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right

[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
It’s just the last one left a scar that made you bleed
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be

[Verse 2]
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you tonight
Mama says you don't look happy
Close your eyes

[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
It’s just the last one left a scar that made you bleed
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
I'm everything they said I would be

[Bridge]
La la la
La la la la
La la la
Oh-ah-ah
Ah, oh

[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
It’s just the last one left a scar that made you bleed
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me, oh

[Outro]
Angels like you can't fly down here with me

Them hoes jump ship like Yachty, I should've stayed on a Lil Boat
My nigga killed Albert, I was armed and dangerous tryna get an elbow (L-Bro)
He gave away all his sprite, but he had to sell coke

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Lil' baby takin' off her panties, I just want your throat
I took a break, there be little kids still calling me "Goat"
Send 30 thousand to my sister to get me a coat
That shit so real, I can't even be in it around smoke
My bitch don't hold no secrets, she know that I gotta know
Anything and everything, bitch I gotta know
Don't let me find out from the streets, bitch that's "Adios"
Since age 17, I been the one to fuckin' boast
I talk shit like I do up shit
With the 5'9 

[?], they on that fuck shit
Snatch her phone before she walk in, she a duck bitch
Prolly shouldn't have her 'round, but her throat deep
And her ass sit fat like a pumpkin
Brought a pump in the function, 'cause I'm paranoid
Nigga try me, leave a mark like an asteroid

[Chorus: Rylo Rodriguez]
Four tennis chains like Serena Williams
Domestic violence, first night I hit her

[?], gotta pay me just hear you
Only time I saw my pops, when I ate cereal
No extend Glocks, real dick, I'm real hard

I insist on takin' percs, hope I don't pass out

Four tennis chains like Serena Williams
Domestic violence, first night I hit her

[Intro: Daniel Johnston & Lana Del Rey]
But don't give, but don't give
True love finds you in the end
But don't give, but don't give
True love will find you in the end

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I told you once that I made it (Made it)
That everything would start changin' (Changin')
Been wakin' up when it's rainin', but I ain't one for complainin'
And I ain't one to tell somebody what to do
With their own life, own life (Life)
People say what I should do with mine
Well, that's the shit that I don't like
I go nice with that numbness (Numbness)
Me usin' drugs with my crutches (Crutches)
Got purp inside of these Dutches
Double cup and that's what I fuck with (Fuck with)
'Cause everybody got substance (Yeah)
And everybody addicted (So?)
Everybody got a life to live
But not everybody go live it (Huh)
I seen some people conflicted
They lose their minds to these riches (Riches)
Testin' all of their limits then burnin' all of their bridges
How beautiful are these women? (Women)
But I be callin' them bitches (Bitches)
And I be fallin' a victim to
Everything in their system (System)
I'm tryna tell my own story (Story)
Tryna make up my own mind
So why you tellin' it for me? (For me)
Pick on somebody your own size
Don't know why I'm so high
On a blind hunt for that goldmine
I look more, one more time
What happens to a star that don't shine?

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Daniel Johnston]
Don't be sad (I know you will)
Don't give up until (Don't give up until)
True love will find you in the end

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I'm goin' back and forth in my head
No, I won't sleep 'til I'm dead
My thoughts run like they off the leash
With shit I need to confess
I'm sick of thinkin' 'bout stress
My family think I'm a mess
'Cause when I'm not at my best
Why does everybody obsess, sayin':
"Get a little bit of exercise
Get a little bit of time to refresh the mind"
And, and I guess I'll testify that
I've had some better times before (Whoa)
When will I learn to let it go?
I'm not tryna be emo (Emo)
Still love a bitch with a deepthroat (Deepthroat)
Still ballin' like a Marino
With my homies watchin' Casino
People on the damn internet think I'm doin' blow by the ski slope
Fuckin' hoes with a trio (Trio)
They know nothin' 'bout me though (Me though)
I think often, feel blessed
Live life, but I know death (Death)
Work hard, progress
Let it go, don't stress (Stress)
Diplo gave me this beat
Said, "Spit though" (Though)
Lookin' out my bedroom window
Wonder when does all of this go (This go)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Daniel Johnston & Mac Miller]
Don't be sad (I know you will) (Wonder when does all of this go)
Don't give up until (Don't give up until)
True love will find you in the end (Wonder when does all of this go)
Don't be sad (I know you will) (Wonder when does all of this go)
Don't give up until (Don't give up until)
True love will find you in the end (Wonder when does all of this go)
So first of all, I'm obsessed with, like, pretty much all of these tracks, and it was really hard to figure out like what I wanted to write first because I had thoughts for all of them, so, unbelievable archives, I can't believe you have this just, like, laying around, that's ... ridiculous, these are unbelievable. But anyway, the first one that I... I was working something up for is the "Maple" one? And I came up with this thing, and it's probably gonna obviously like be sequencing differences like, you know, different lengths and different verses and whatever, but this is just like a rough, uh, thing. 

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Living in a gold age
Sneaking to my bird cage, I
I knew you
Laughing like a damn fool
Breaking every damn rule, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Instrumental Break]
And then, I have like this-- there's like a break, because I don't really know what's gonna happen here, but I do have like a... I think it's here? Was where I was putting a-- a bridge thing. 

[Bridge]
And to kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
Now I'm bleedin'
I'm bleedin'

[Instrumental Break]
We'll work on that and not make it bad. And then, um, there's all this time, but when the, like, kind of major chorus comes back in, I wait til then, and then, I start singing again. I don't think it's right now, but... there it is. The ending. 

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter leaving Wendy, I
I knew you
Dancing in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
That when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a stolen kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
I knew I'd wish you would've changed your mind
I knew you'd miss me once the moment died
I knew to love would be to lose my mind
And then, I don't know. You let me know what you think. And, uh, that's just kind of like a rough idea of... something. Let me know if you like it. 

[Intro]
Watch it, watch it
Watch it, watch it

[Verse 1]
Lost in the cracks of the landslide
My body's melting through the dark side
I'm feeling lost, feeling untied
And you're the ocean flooding my mind

[Verse 2]
Deep in the black of the night time
I used to soar on the live wire
Two purple hearts on the love line, oh
And now we stop like we're outta time

[Chorus]
I can't take it
On the day I felt my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you, baby
Earth keeps shaking
And I can't take it
On the day I felt my heart start breaking
No one saved me

[Interlude]
Watch it, watch it

[Chorus]
I can't take it
On the day I felt my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you, baby
Earth keeps shaking
And I can't take it
On the day I felt my heart start breaking
No one saved me

[Bridge]
Watch it, watch it
Watch it, watch it

[Chorus]
I can't take it
On the day I felt my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you, baby
Earth keeps shaking
And I can't take it
On the day I felt my heart start breaking
No one saved me

[Outro]
Watch it, watch it
Watch it, watch it

[Refrain: Syl Johnson]
Oh-ohh, oh-ohh
Something is holding me back
Oh-ohh, oh-ohh
Something is holding me back
Oh-ohh, oh-ohh
Something is holding me back
Oh-ohh, oh-ohh
Something is holding me back
Oh-ohh, oh-ohh
Something is holding me back

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, mm
(Perfect!)

[Chorus]
You say you got it all figured out, oh well, I'd like to disagree
I don't think that you understand what you meant to me
I'm somewhere doing better, all you are is a memory
You said we're enemies, well, keep that energy
I'm somewhere doing better, gettin' high right now
I can't believe I ever let you in my life right now
Pour a cup, mix it up to ease my mind right now
Fuck love, I got money on my mind right now, oh

[Verse]
I can't believe I used to cry about you (Oh)
I'm doing so much better in my life without you
Bitch, you're the past, I'ma leave your ass behind, without you (Bye-bye)
My new bitch better than my last, I vouched too
Promise, know I got it, she won't stop callin'
Ballin', something like Jordan, unless she all in
I'm mobbin' deep with these hoes, R.I.P. to Prodigy
Poppin', she know I'm poppin', she put it all on me

[Chorus]
You say you got it all figured out, oh well, I'd like to disagree
I don't think that you understand what you meant to me
I'm somewhere doing better, all you are is a memory
You said we're enemies, well, keep that energy
I'm somewhere doing better, gettin' high right now (Oh-oh, oh)
I can't believe I ever let you in my life right now (Oh-oh, oh)
Pour a cup, mix it up to ease my mind right now (Oh-oh, oh)
Fuck love, I got money on my mind right now, oh (Oh-oh, oh)

[Outro]
Ah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Lyrics Unfinished]

[Eminem]
Shady family
We hold it down like a mothafuckin canopy
And I don't even know
What a canopy is
What yo I gots to flow
This is my mo or my dimo
When I throw your mothafuckin demo
Out the limo window of it
And I don't care what the fuck the public
Really thinks of it they can shove it
Up their mothafuckin assholes or their whole ass
They don't know the ass I hold in the ground so fast
I can come with this delivery ya'll can't get wit me
Shiver me timbers here we go ya'll wimpers
And whinin and we be designin the rhymes
Off our mind and the top of our domes
While you're on your cellular phones
Tellin your man yo Eminem Proof is on the microphone
Yo hurry up and go dial and keep it locked in
Cause we be shockin

[Proof]
Yo here he is a lot of people out there is curious
They say my freestyles is furious as Shade 45 yes yes ya'll
In the place to be I wreck your body like cholesterol
The best of all I test the balls any man that wanna
Come and ???? I'm in the game for a minute now
Yo the Green Lantern bout to spin it now
Ayo yo when in doubt hit the man off right now
Ya'll come on come on

[Eminem]
Let's see if I can go off the top of the head
With the same flow that I kept on this record already been said
Yo here I go again, once one more time
When I be kickin this fuckin flawless rhyme
And ya'll don't understand cuz ya'll can't ever beef wit me
Battle me whatever scadattles you cuz you go to Seattle
And you can see from here to Satelite radio
Its Slim Shady on Shady forty five radio
And I can say it slow or I can say it fast
It don't matter cuz really on the mic I whoop your ass
I whoop your mothafuckin ass from here to thurr
And I can't even see you but I don't even curr
Cuz I'm sure that if you try to fuck wit me but luckily
People steppin up to me really don't wanna fuck wit me
Cause if they try to do they gon' get fuckin fucked up gee
Cause listen to the rhyme and you be tryin walk up to me
And step to me with that mental telepathy when ya life is in jeapordy
And mothafuckas know they can't step to me
Pull out the fuckin weaponry the pepper spray
Here we go so step away from the fuckin microphone
This is ??? Yo yesterday I seen this girl from around the way
And she had nice titties and ass and I said damn I can't let you pass
So I walked up to her and said miss can I give your asshole a kiss
She said yes, she said no then she said yes but spank me slow
So I did then next thing you know she said
Here's my number holla at the kid I said holla at the kid
I don't understand holy shit the damn chick was a man
Oh god oh lord no lord please don't applaud cuz I'm really not sure
If that was the right thing to do

[Unfinished Lyrics]

[Eminem]
Yo here we go me and my man Proof again
They want the drunk freestyle so we gon' slurr
We gon' slurr and all type of shit can ocurr
I got my pen back yo thank you very much
Yo yo you need a ladies touch
Then you better go ask your man R--
Whoops oh whoop hey hey ho only playin
This is ??? and I am and listen now
Lay down sit back what I'm sayin
Its real and I feel shit is always mad real and the feel
You get killed fuck around and lay down
On the muddy playground which is bloody now
You're suddenly gay now and didn't even mean it
But yo all of a sudden you and ya home boy just stuck his penis
Right up your bung hole and here we go we're bout to let one go
Proof get on the mic and tell these ladies what you do and dont like

[Proof]
I like a girl cuz I'm a lebria, I like a girl to smoke cheeba
I like a girl thats fat and old like a reaper
I like a girl when I see that she comes through my speaker
I like a girl that got stretch marks I like a girl that loves to fart
I like a girl that takes my heart and that takes me home at night
Yo when its dark I like a girl

[Eminem]
You like a girl? Yo I like a girl too, a girl thats my world
A girl that kinda reminds me of a squirrel
Cause she always got my nuts in my mouth
I mean her mouth its what I meant to say
I don't put my own nuts in my mouth cuz they wouldn't fit
Hey okay so listen to what I'm tryna say
Now let me rewind and gain composure
Now here we go its the explosion of the edosure
Edosior the indonesia that I be smokin havin a seizure
When I'm attackin this mic and I fuckin freeze ya
At my leizure, I had my own leizure
Cause I ceased the mic so here we go lyrical miracle
Spiritual spirical sperial on the stereo its the imperial
And I eat them C's like cereal captain crunch
You get slapped in lunch for actin tough
Like back in the day we smackin the gays
I said we smackin the strays on top of that we clappin wit gays
Gay meanin happy, nappy, scrappy yo come slap me
Pretty girls cuz I like the girls I like the girls
With the pretty little curls

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
I guess you think you know the story
You don't, the real one is much too gory
The phony one, the only one you know
Was cooked up years and years ago
And made to sound all soft and sappy
Just to keep the children happy
Twisted fiction, sick addiction
Gather round children, zip it, listen

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?"
You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?
Stupid, but what the fuck do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines
And then they make noise

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Justin Vernon & (Kanye West)]
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(Saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb’ just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yah
Main bitch out your league too, ah
Side bitch out of your league too, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I’m a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

[Verse 2]
Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry, ah
I come alive in the fall time, I
No competition, I don't really listen
I’m in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I don’t see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I’m a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin’ starboy

[Verse 3]
Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

[Intro: ?]
All of the lights
Lights, lights
All of the lights
All of the lights, all of the lights
(All of the lights)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, stripper life (All of the lights)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, stripper life (All of the lights)

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Gettin' mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Gettin' right, babe
You should go and get ya own

[Instrumental]

[Outro: ?]
I am rich and I am brilliant

[Verse]
Yeah, some people say that we just crazy
We don't know shit, we just lazy
Livin' in, the world is changin'
Simple things, yeah, the love we makin'
And I could change the way I feel
I could swear to God that it ain't for real
I could close my eyes, I could disappear
But before I die, better start livin', yeah

[Chorus]
We could head down to the river
I hope the water don't dry
It's too warm to be winter
You too yours to be mine
And this storm is a killer
It'll keep you inside
It'll take everything that it give ya
If you don't take your time

[Outro]
You be where the waves end, woah
Where the days ends, oh, oh
Said, I couldn't change brand new faces
Everyday will be you wasted, your favorite
I might be unchangin'
Alright, I gotta take a piss

[Intro]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah

[Chorus]
You will never have it all
So be good with what you got
As long as I got you, I got a lot
And I don't wanna feel this way forever
Soon as I make my bed, I'll make you better (Yeah)

[Verse]
Stop, look, and listen, my key is in the ignition
Start up, swallow my pride, pick my heart up, I be so driven
My motto is "Never follow," I'm runnin' into tomorrow
With all the weight on my shoulders like boulders
Still never borrow your hands
There ain't no problem, this is part of the plan
I'm in here until I disappear, they'll never see me again
It was way easier, I didn't need a reason for comin'
People don't need me for nothin'
I feel that deep in my stomach, I keep on peelin' this onion
Too many layers to it
I'm makin' music from a soul that's full of aches and bruises
I don't feel safe, I just feel numb, I don't feel shit
I don't wanna die here, please don't leave me like this
I keep that weed in my spliff
Long as I'm breathin', no quittin', I will not cease to exist (Yeah)
I am no genius, just a hand that's on my penis
Produce semen you spit
And you wonder why I'm bein' a dick

[Outro - Phone Call]
Quentin "Q" Cuff: "This is a happy home, Malcolm"
Mac Miller: "Hahaha, how you feeling?"
Q: "I feel great, nigga, but, I'm excited for Horror Nights. I need the address to your studio whenever"
Mac Miller: "I got you, I'ma text it to you now, I'm here now"
Q: "Alright"

[Chorus: Choo Jackson]
I witness highs, I win the low (Ayy, ayy)
One thing you know, I got the glow (Ayy, ayy)
Can't trap the mind, now nigga, you know (Ayy, ayy)
Oh, that's your ho, but yeah, she mine, yeah (Ayy, ayy)

Oh yeah, she mine, yeah (Ayy, ayy)
Oh yeah, she mine, yeah (Ayy, ayy, uh, go)

[Verse 1: Choo Jackson]
Oh Lord, please don't talk about my penmanship
We can talk about all the things that I did this year
I'm a wrestler, might hit you with the finisher
Tried to take my style, take it back, give it here
Little nigga, don't you ever try to tell me I ain't ready
Did you see my damn wrist? Pissed on R. Kelly
And a bad bitch here, put the dick up in her belly
And I'm walkin' round town, grill on like I'm Nelly (Coco)
Oh yeah, I can make it come down like confetti
No sense in gettin' mad 'cause you peanut butter jealous
Put a ho on a flight, I'ma send her straight to Dallas
If she disrespect me, I'ma cut her like a mullet, ayy (Cut her off)
Remember, got a crown and it's all day (All day)
And we run the town, what ya gon' say? (Gon' say)
Car lookin' butter, yeah, that's part cake (Skrrt, skrrt)
Pull up in this butter, yeah, that's parkin'

[Chorus: Choo Jackson]
I witness highs, I win the low (Ayy, ayy)
One thing you know, I got the glow (Ayy, ayy)
Can't trap the mind, now nigga, you know (Ayy, ayy)
Oh, that's your ho, but yeah, she mine, yeah (Ayy, ayy)
Oh yeah, she mine, yeah (Ayy, ayy)
Oh yeah, she mine, yeah (Ayy, ayy)
Oh yeah, she mine, yeah (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Hear the flow takin' off like all her clothes before we fuck
Eyes have opened up like Folgers caps
I woke up, found the dope and rolled a blunt
Ain't sober much, I'm stoned as fuck
Smokin' drugs so blunted, the flow cold-blooded
But I know what it's like, broke, no money
No hundreds, no twenties, low budget, so hungry
You don't wanna be a nobody
Okay, most of the time, my head is close to the line
Of blowin' up, like shakin' up soda
Fall into a coma on the sofa
Rise from the sun, throw up and roll okra
Yessir, when the goin' get tough, guess what?
You fold up like yoga, well, you know, uh
Boss, you know that don't ya? Yoda
Work on the road, you drove a Toyota Corolla
And you stay below the, speed limit, yeah
Geniuses
I'm on the Beatle shit, "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"
Go to Boca Raton, Florida
Slow up, why don't ya?
Lay low, stay close to the ground, king cobra
Boa constricted, restrictions
Tryin' to get quicker with decisions
Why do I need to get lifted?
I'm too unstable, keep your distance, yeah
Yeah, they say, "Why don't ya grow up, what's the hold up?
We know you're faded
Show up late with no idea what the fuck you're doin' here" (Okay)
"Do you have a license to drive that vessel?" (Skrrt)
"Do you have the paperwork to drive that vessel?" (Skrrt)
"Yeah, you walk around like you're clueless
Your head is in the clouds, you actin' stupid"
I got nothin' to do with this bullshit

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay
You drivin' slower
You smell the weed smoke aroma when I'm comin' over
It's fuckin' seven in the mornin'
Time to go the fuck home and
Go to sleep, maybe make some food

[Intro]
Yeah
Aight man, I'ma try this one out

[Verse 1]
Got my chick makin' drinks with that cream
While I'm takin' sips of that lean (Lean)
Life ain't a bitch, well, if you make a wish
You might break a record like me (Me)
Got a mil' at the age of nineteen
But I may just give that back (Back)
To show my friends I could do it again
If I started all from scratch, huh
All I do is rap (Rap)
You could run and tell them hoes that (That)
More pipe than a plumber, I might get her number
You like her, I love her, that's that
This rap shit what I do (Do), get hyphy if you can (Can)
Pharrell just hit me up, said this might just be the jam (Jam)

[Chorus]
She get good grades, suck good dick
What more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck
What more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love
What more could you ask for?
What more could you ask—
W-W-What more could you ask—

[Verse 2]
Go a hundred miles an hour (Woo!), ride around the city (Woo!)
Smokin' on that sour, couple bad ones with me
Twenty grand in my jeans (Jeans), thirty grand on my neck (Neck)
You heard around by word of mouth that I get these hoes all wet (Yes)
I just put out my album (Album), about to throw it on cassette
Sell another hundred thousand, then buy my pops a Corvette
Never claim no sets (Sets), and I never start no beef (Beef)
But I promise I know some crazy people if you fuck around with me (Hey)

[Chorus]
She get good grades, suck good dick
What more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck
What more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love
What more could you ask for?
What more could you ask—
W-W-What more could you ask—

[Verse 3]
I'm switchin' up my flows (Flows)
Sellin' out these shows (Shows)
Pop a bottle of Dom P, then cop my moms a Merlot (Oh)
Now I'm actin' so grown (Grown)
Made a business all on my own (Own)
These labels callin' my phone
But I made this bidness all on my own (Woo!)
I'm knockin' out your speakers (Speaker)
Knock you out your sneakers (Sneakers)
I'm in the game, I'm on the field
You watchin' from the bleachers (Bitch)
Win the Heisman, I'm MVP
Dan Marino, you Sandusky
I'm MC Hammer, you can't touch me (Me)
Skateboard P, he be on that beat (That beat)

[Chorus]
She get good grades, suck good dick
What more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck
What more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love
What more could you ask for?
What more could you ask—
W-W-What more could you ask—

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just can't take it
Sometimes I just can't take it and it isn't alright
I'm not gonna make it
And I think my shoe's untied (Ooh-ooh)
I'm like a broken record
I'm like a broken record and I'm not playin' right
Drocer nekorb a ekil mi
'Til you tell me on your heavenly phone

[Pre-Chorus]
To hold tight
Come on, come on
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Come on, come on
Yeah, don't let go oh, oh, oh-oh
Hold tight, hold tight
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
"It's alright, it's alright" she said
I've got my hands up shakin' just to let you know

[Chorus]
That you've got a higher power
Got me singing every second, dancing every hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know, ooh

[Verse 2]
This boy is electric
This boy is electric and you're sparklin' like the universe connected
And I'm buzzin' night after night after night (Oh-oh)
This joy is electric
This joy is electric and you're circuiting through
I'm so happy that I'm alive
Happy I'm alive at the same time as you

[Chorus]
'Cause you've got a higher power
Got me singing every second, dancing every hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know
(I wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)

[Bridge]
You've got

[Part I: Perfect Circle]

[Intro]
(I shot the sheriff right after I shot the deputy)
Ohh—ohh—ohh—ohh—ohh
(Right after I shot the deputy)
Ohh—ohh—ohh
(I shot the sheriff)
Yeah
Ohh—ohh—ohh—ohh—ohh
Ohh—ohh
(I shot the sheriff right after I shot the deputy)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I came for whoever is in charge (Here)
Suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard (Here)
They need some coffee, everybody sleeping on me
Going around door-to-door, setting off alarms (Beep beep beep)
All that horse shit, you should have left it at the barn
Keep a stallion, tell her gallop to the store and get cigars, yeah
Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made (That's the ball game)
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase
Me and my bizarre ways (Lord have mercy)
I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant, you can see it from the scarface
Hidden in a dark place, swimming in a shark tank
Give a bitch a little bit of change, she a game in an arcade
(Time crisis) Not a second to lose
I’m the motherfuckin' Bible, that’s forever the truth (Amen)
And this is not another case of the celebrity blues
I shot the sheriff and the deputy, too

[Chorus]
Murder, murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all (I do)
Got what you need if you like breaking the law
My mother raised me a God (Hey)
(Come again, I'm a buffalo soldier)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Blame the drugs, got me sinning on a weekday
Drunk as fuck, do a buck sixty on the freeway (Skrrt)
Giving y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase
That's hidden in a subwoofer, beat case
Used to wanna know how a freak taste
Now I’m in it in an instant like replay
Broad’s a baton, pass her off like relay
Why I’m so mad on my B-Day?, she say
“I thought you got sober,” then I said
“I wish you’d stop being a bitch and get to minding your business”
Told me “Money has changed ya”
I get to thinking, how rarely do I visit? How’d I get so egotistical?
I’m a Buffalo Soldier
Heaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer
I’m only 23 but my mind is older, and it’ll forever be
Dead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies

[Chorus]
Murder, murder, murder, murder, what would you do?
Have you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do
Can you draw a perfect circle?
Lot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?
I wash these pills down with liquor and fall
Leave it to me, I do enough for us all
Got what you need if you like breaking the law
My mother raised me a God (Hey)

(I'm a buffalo soldier, I'm a buffalo soldier)

[?]

[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Mac Miller]
A goddess told me “good morning” when I woke up
You know I had a good morning when I woke up
Gotta thank God every morning that I woke up
Would you remember me if I never woke up?
Bye bye
I've been a sinner, I’m just tryna stay
Warm through the winter, and I’ll be on my way
I’m just a drifter, the weather speaks in whispers
I just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind

[Refrain]
Woo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

[Part II: God Speed]

[Interlude: Miller McCormick]
“Hey man, I wish you were here, happy holidays
Um, I love ya. And I hope you have a good night/weekend/I hope I talk to you soon, alright, godspeed”

[Verse]
Oh yeah
I thought I’d have it figured out by now
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past by now
Me and the homies would be sittin' on millions
Reminiscin' on times when we were so broke and livin' in Oakland just chillin'
I thought I’d have it in the bag by now
I thought that we’d be kickin' back by now
I know that life is a bitch
I know that life is a bitch, I thought we’d put her in a cab by now
But I’m stressin', I can’t relax
Swallowin' my pride and I’m hidin' what’s making me mad
Everybody saying I need rehab
'Cause I’m speedin' with a blindfold on and won’t be long
Until they watchin' me crash, and they don’t wanna see that
They don’t want me to OD and have to talk to my mother
Tell her they could have done more to help me
And she’d just be crying
Saying that she’d do anything to have me back
All the nights I’m losing sleep
It was all a dream, there was a time that I believed that
But white lines be numbin' them dark times
Them pills that I’m popping, I need to man up, admit it’s a problem
I need to wake up before one morning I don’t wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I’m too obsessed with goin' down as a great one
But if you wait too long they gon' find someone to replace ya
So I guess this is a letter
To all my brothers, Most Dope, that’s forever
I love you more than words could express
And this the part that Q start cryin', if he ain’t already yet
I did my best to be a leader you respect
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret
So tell my baby I love her
And if she give me the chance I’ll put a seed inside her, make her a mother
Just know that there’s a place
Where all my people worry free and e'rybody straight
Every devil don’t got horns, every hero ain’t got capes
Opened up my eyes, shit, I’m finally awake, good morning
Yeah, good morning

[Hook]
I'm in a Range Rover, On Vogues, kushed up
My money strong like my stash doing push-ups
My money strong, my money strong, my money strong

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
Keep thinkin' that I'm seein' water
You're playing tricks on me in the sun
See your shadow in the courtyard
Stays until the day is done
The desert don't end, the rain don't fall
And I can't pretend I don't want you all
'Cause I want you all
You all, you all, you all

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
Oh, babe, I really need you (Need you)
My feelings gettin' deeper (Deeper)
My mind is in a free fall (Free fall)
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
You play with my emotions (Emotions)
I'm flowin' like the ocean (Ocean)
I pray for your devotion (Devotion)
'Cause there's nothing I can do when it comes to you

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
My oa, my oa, my oasis
My oa, my oa, my oasis
My oa, my oa, my oasis
There's nothing I can do when it comes to you

[Verse 2: Burna Boy]
Wait a minute, tell me why you're movin' like that
Na, you wey I choose, but you make it so hard
I gave you my heart, you're makin' it so dark
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
You takin' it for granted
A lot of silence, the river don't end
'Cause I want you all, yeah
You all, you all, you all

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
Oh, babe, I really need you (Need you, oh, baby)
My feelings gettin' deeper (Deeper)
My mind is in a free fall (Free fall)
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
You play with my emotions (Emotions)
I'm flowin' like the ocean (Ocean)
I pray for your devotion (Devotion)
'Cause there's nothing I can do when it comes to you

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
My oa, my oa, my oasis
My oa, my oa, my oasis

There's nothing I can do when it comes to you

There's nothing I can do when it comes to you

[Outro: Burna Boy]
I remember say me tell you
You're my all and you're my everything
And me tell you 'til it's all over
Oluwa Burna, oh

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

[Intro]
Here I stand
Look around, around, around, around, around
But you won't see me
Now I'm here
Now I'm there
I'm just a
Just a new man
Yes, you made me live again
Come on, rock with me
Yes! Everybody
Go

[Verse 1]
A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Don't worry, baby, I'm safe and sound

[Chorus 1]
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love her so?
Yeah, she made me live again
Yeah

[Verse 2]
A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

[Chorus 2]
Down in the city just Hoople and me

[Guitar solo]
Come on, baby
Hey, rock on!
Hey, alright
Come on, baby
Go, go, Johnny, go!
Yeah

[Bridge]
Whatever comes of you and me
I'd love to leave my memory with you, yeah

[Spoken Word: Freddie Mercury]
So long
Goodbye, Montréal
Thank you for being such a good sport
Hey, hey, hey
Alright
Let's go get fucked!

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah, ma, ma, ma, oh, oh
Ha
You gotta shake it out
Shake it out
Shake it out
Ooh, yeah
Love, a little bit of love
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, eh
Hey, ooh, ooh, ooh
My babe, babe, baby
Secure
Keep yourself alive!

[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you to be a superstar
But I tell you just be satisfied and stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

[Guitar Solo]
Yeah
Hit me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well I’ve loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

[Intro]
This is called "Killer Queen"

[Verse 1]
She keeps a Moët et Chandon in her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake," she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation, you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime)
Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

[Verse 2]
To avoid complications, she never kept the same address
In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime)
Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Get your party gown, get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating, baby
Got my timing right, got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight, my little school babe
Your momma says you don't and your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
There is no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Hey

[Chorus 1]
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors, I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight

[Verse 2]
"You're such a dirty louse, go get out of my house"
That's all I ever get from your
Your family ties, in fact, I never heard
A single little civil word from you guys
But you know I don't give a light, I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart in hand to put a stop to all that
Shouting, fightin' goin' on
Come on

[Chorus 2]
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Send your little brother swimming with a brick, that's alright
Tie your mother down, yeah, tie your mother down
She ain't no friend of mine
Go, ain't no friend of mine

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Ooh, your mommy and your daddy are gonna plague me till I die
They don't understand it, I'm just a peace loving guy

[Chorus 3]
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Big, big, big, big, big, big daddy out the door
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight

[Outro]
Give it to me, over here
All your love tonight
Everybody
All your love tonight
Hey
All your love tonight
Hey
Hello Brazil (Hello)
Hello to you (Hello)
Do the bang

[Intro]
Is everybody happy?

[Verse 1]
Fear me you Lords and
Lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers

[Chorus]
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Fear me you Lords and privy counselors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust

[Chorus]
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye
Yeah

[Bridge]
Sister— I live and lie for you
Mister— do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever, ever, ever

[Intro: Eminem & (Royce Da 5'9")]
What's your favorite scary movie?
Yo, Slim Shady (Yo, Royce 5'9")
Y'all wanna make a movie? (What, what?)
We got the film right here

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Yeah, I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really have to, I really slap you
King of Detroit, who they namin' the city after
Scandalous partners whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with content, yo, who wanna start with?
Expert, Bad & Evil is comin' soon
MCs get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin'
Leavin' all of you cats shittin' kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggas be cockin' pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splittin' the profits with you
Six percent of y'all niggas is just pretend
Cliques with clits, pussy niggas stink with dicks
Niggas act bully and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggas packin' semi
Speak darts — yo, you get paid?
Rhymin' about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
5'9", a street nigga with deep feelin'
I keep illin', my steez willin' to keep killin'
Fuck rap! A lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that, you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder, stick to my guns
Niggas is finished before they gimmicks: one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'm a pitbull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw
Split y'all, holler, "It's on!" – then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggas get pissed on claimin' you pissed off

[Chorus: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directin' and starrin' in it
Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directin' and starrin' in it

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin'
Any man plannin' to battle'll get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this — and you better inhale!
‘Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is gettin' taken advantage of, like Monica Lewinsky (Leave me alone!)
Came home in a frenzy, pushin' a ten speed
Screamin' to Aunt Peg
With three spokes stickin' outta my pant leg
Fuck a headache! Give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
You should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowin' you wack
You act up and I'm throwin' you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwin' you back up them
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em! The rap struck 'em
Harder than gettin' hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-fallin' feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

[Hook: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9"]
Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers comin' in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directin' and starrin' in it

[Outro: Eminem & (Royce Da 5'9")]
Bad, the Bad (Uhh, when the Bad meets the Bad, yo)
The Evil (Take the Evil with the Evil)
Put 'em together (What? Nine-nine)
Two times, Slim Shady, Royce da 5'9"

[Intro]
Come on, keep yourself
Everybody, everybody
Keep yourself, keep yourself, keep yourself alive
Keep yourself, keep yourself, keep yourself alive, yeah
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you to be a superstar
I tell you just be satisfied and stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

[Guitar Solo]
Hey
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
Grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
Told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, rode a million miles
I'd still be where I started, same as when I started

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

[Verse 1]
I have sinned, dear Father
Father, I have sinned
Try and help me, Father
Won't you let me in?

[Chorus]
Liar!
Oh, everybody deceives me
Liar!
Why don't you leave me—?

[Verse 2]
Sire, I have stolen
Stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should

[Chorus]
Liar!
Oh, nobody believes me
Liar!
Why don't you leave me alone?

[Bridge]
Liar, liar
Liar, liar
Oh, they won't leave me alone
They won't leave me alone
Yeah

[Outro]
Oh

[Intro]
I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart

[Verse 1]
This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
But it happens to everyone

[Pre-Chorus]
You win, you lose
You just ah, da, da, da, ah, da, ba
Oh yeah, fell in love
But now you say it's over, I'm falling apart
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each other's heart
It's a long, hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love

[Verse 2]
I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
It's just a simple case of mind
But it happens to everyone

[Pre-Chorus]
How it hurts deep inside
When your love has cut you down to size
Life is tough on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
Waiting for love

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's a hard life
True lovers together
To love and live forever in each other's heart
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in every way
It's a long hard fight
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself and say I did it for love

[Outro]
Yes, I did it for love
For love
Oh, oh, oh, I did it for love
Oh

[Intro]
Around, around, around, around
Think I'm gonna stay around with you
Around, around, around, around
I think I'm gonna stay around with you
With you, with you, babe
Now I'm here
Now I'm there
I'm just a, I'm just a
Yeah, everybody
Just a new man
Yes, you made me live again
Everybody rock 'n' roll, yeah
Come on!

[Verse 1]
A baby I was when you took my hand
The light of the night burned bright
The people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Don't worry, babe, I'm safe and sound

[Chorus 1]
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love you so?
Yeah, she made me live again
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Ooh
A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your matches still light up the sky
Many a tear lives on in my eye

[Chorus 2]
Down in the city just Hoople and me

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Whatever comes of you and me
I'd love to leave my memory with you

[Verse 3]
Now I'm here
Think I'll stay around (Around), around (Around), around (Around), around
Down in the city just as you and me
You and me, babe
Shootout

[Verse 1]
Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law?
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today?
The world that we created

[Verse 2]
You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Oh

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone?
If there's a God up in the sky, looking down
What must he think of what we've done
To the world that He created?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse]
Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase
Oh no I'm compromised, I must apologize
If my mother should discover how I spent my holidays
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah

[Outro]
Come on, come on, come on
Give it to me one more time
Yeah

[Intro]
Yeah!
Aye, aye, aye
Okay, "Hammer To Fall"
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Here we stand, here we fall
History don't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight

[Chorus 1]
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
Comes to you as to us all
And it's time for the hammer to fall, yeah

[Verse 2]
Every night, every day
A little piece of you is falling away
Lift your face, the Western Way, babe
Build your muscles till your body decays

[Chorus 2]
Tow your line and play their game
Till the anesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
Then it's time for the hammer to fall

[Bridge]
Rich or poor or famous
For your truth is all the same (Oh no), oh no (Oh no)
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane (Oh no), whoo!
Baby, now your struggle's all in vain

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
Just wanna scream it louder and louder and

[Chorus 3]
What the hell we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
Just got time to say your prayers
Till it's time for the hammer to, hammer to fall

[Outro]
Hey
Going to fall
Going to fall, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Waiting for the hammer to fall, yeah
Give it to me one more time!

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't wanna die
Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Yeah

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

[Intro]
(Radio)

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
(Radio)

[Verse 2]
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly (Radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
Had your time, had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)
Everybody

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Verse 3]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years (Radio)
Hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
Had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you!

[Bridge]
Radio ga ga, Radio ga ga
Radio ga ga (Radio)

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo

All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you!

[Outro]
Loves you!
Goodbye
Thank you

Everybody

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
I want to break free, you sing it
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self-satisfied, I don't need you
I want to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free

[Verse 2]
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
This time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love

[Bridge]
Strange but it's true, eh
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh, how I want to be free, baby
Oh, how I want to break free
Oh, how I want to break free

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
But life still goes on
I can't get used to living without, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby, can't you see?
I've got to break free

[Verse 1]
Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
Mud on your face, big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singing

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
We will, we will rock you
Yeah, we will, we will rock you

[Verse 2]
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
Blood on your face, big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place, singing

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
We will, we will rock you
Everybody, we will, we will rock you

[Verse 3]
Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna get you some peace someday
Blood on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place, singing

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
We will, we will rock you
Everybody, yeah
We will, we will rock you
Yeah
We will, we will rock you
One more time
We will, we will rock you, listen

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
On, on, on, on

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
On, on, on

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Outro]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end, oh
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world!
Yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "please don't go," and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Pre-Chorus]
And I said: "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, said, said, said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"

[Outro]
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say "yes"

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: "Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'"

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
Oh yeah
That's the way it should be

The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return

Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous
Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hoo!

You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A Smooth Criminal

Aaow!

You know you want me

Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee! Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous (Hee! Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

Hoo!
Hoo!
My baby
You been, you take, uh
You don't, don't, don't
You turn, my baby

Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
You don't, you don't, don't

You take steps to get to the sex, I just flex (Aha)

Suplex City, bitch
You know the vibe, your boy been immortalized
Yellow M5 glide like water slide (Oh, so true)
Black trench like the ‘taker (You know me)
Black tint so they can’t make us (The fucking Undertaker)
I fly the plane better than Tom Cruise
Drive cars like Dale Sr. with my feet up
Lotus pose like Shiva on the floor
For the fight with my seat next to Jeter
I told that motherfucker roll the weed up, please

[Chorus]
I might not be able to touch my toes
But I will still fuck these hoes

[Verse 2]
My new shit, Only for Dolphins
Then let the slammer off like Dolph Lundgren
You know the Bronco starts howling once the light dims
And he ain't stoppin' 'til the night ends
So go ahead with your pitty pat
My swimming trunks hold fifty racks
Don't make me hit you with the Diddy dance
I carved a hundred skulls into the handle of the mini-Mac
Your boy keeps acid in his sack, daddy
Been hot since miggity, miggity, miggity mac daddy
And that’s a long time
And I could care less what them motherfuckers sayin’
And that’s no lie
Bitch, I’m living la vida loca
Yellow grove, figaro, choke me
Laughing in the mirror like the Joker with the Oakleys
My whole team out for dead presidents like Bokeem
It’s young baklava, you know me, yeah

[Chorus]
I might not be able to touch my toes
But I will still fuck these hoes
I might not be able to touch my toes
But I will still fuck these hoes
Yeah, I might not be able to touch my toes

I might not be able to touch my toes
But I will still fuck these hoes

He said he'd be here, "Second round's on me"
I paid for that shit, that first round
He said he'd be up here
Well I hope he hurries the fuck up, I ain't got no money
I don't know, the motherfucker might be broke right now
He ain't had no CD out in three damn years
Man, fuck him anyway, that motherfucker ain't shit
I got that first CD, that shit was dope
Well, I mean kinda, but, it was actually kinda wack
I mean, I don't know, I wasn't even feelin' it really

Everybody's soul loves to wander so

[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go straight to hell
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go straight to hell
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

[Intro]
Yeah (Money on my head)
This that, this that futuristic pain (Baby)
Yeah, RIP Pooh

[Chorus]
It's okay to cry (Ooh), yeah (Ooh)
It's okay to cry (Ooh), yeah, yeah (Ooh)
It's okay to cry, baby (Ooh)
Plus it's when it's time to rise, baby (Ooh)
Deep down, I hate these homicides, baby (Ooh)
Deep down, I really hate homic– (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Early morning cries with the guys
Laughing about us ducking homicides
They say what makes you laugh, it'll also make you cry
They say what lets you live, it'll also let you die
I travel with the stick 'cause I've seen murder in my eyes
Devil hunting on me while a nigga tryna strive
I had ran it up, and then I helped him beat his trial
He been gone 11, and I still take care of his child
Money on my head
Stay at home 'cause there's money on my head
We don't talk, but I just know that you my man
Nigga play with you, I'm leaving him where he stand, yeah
Rose gold roses on the casket, ain't that romantic?
I killed the care man, my family raring
It's just a cold world, I'm polar bearing
Tryna think to myself, but I was only staring
I'm seeing ghosts, baby, it was at my show, baby
I done took a life, and it's driving me crazy
She just want her coke, baby, she ain't tryna have no baby
She ain't trying to settle down, she'd rather run around
I had a talk with the Devil and it didn't go right
I keep my phone on silent, don't need no more nights
Have you ever woke up to a call that said he died last night?
Got me wondering how it is in paradise

[Chorus 2]
It's okay to cry (Ooh), yeah (Ooh)
It's okay to cry (Ooh), yeah, yeah (Ooh)
It's okay to cry, baby (Ooh)
Plus it's when it's time to rise, baby (Ooh)
Deep down, I hate these homicides, baby (Ooh)
These niggas wanna see me die (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, all my people dying, and I can't stand it
I hit the pulpit, I'm tired of being abandoned
I'll rush 'em down myself, I don't gotta call no ambulance
Shit, they gon' take 40 minutes anyway
Got me taking shrooms and relaxing with my bae
Rather keep it cool with the niggas round my way
Just bought another tool 'cause I keep bumping heads with the Devil
Told my mama, "Don't let 'em dig my grave with a shovel"
Keep my sisters with me 'cause I'm realer than ever
Half a million, it got my bro outta shackles, yeah

[Outro]
Mama... God, mama, mama, God no
It hurts so bad
They killed my bro, they all rolled up, then they fucking killed my bro
Stop, he's fucking gone, I just want him, please
God, I'm sorry for what I did, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry God, please believe me, please believe me, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, this

[Verse]
Yeah, well
I thought my angel was supposed to save me
Instead she wanna strangle me, choke me, break me
Ride around the city in an old Mercedes
Always wanna drive but you drove me crazy
She was supposed to teach me how to fly
All she did was teach me how to lie, yeah
Cross my heart, put a needle in my eye
She made the demon in my mind
But the sex so good and I need it
I tell the whole entire world, it ain't a secret
A lot of screamin'
Jesus Christ, don't be polite
You see, fuckin' is how we fight

[Intro]
For the next joint, I like to go back to the classics
Ayo, Kris, hit 'em with another one!

[Verse: Eminem]
Peace to Thirstin Howl, A. L., and Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerd cursed with badly disturbed nerves
Who wanna be the one to step up and get served first?
99% of aliens prefer Earth
Come here to rule the planet, startin' with your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a word search
With smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts
Hang with male chauvinist pigs and perverts
Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerbers
My first words were "Bleed, bleed!" and "Curse, curse!"
Never had it and I still don't deserve dirt
My breath still stinks, and I'm on my third Cert
Digging out my stitches, hollering, "Nurse, nurse!
You said this shot would numb it, this shit just hurts worse!"

[Verse 1: Akon]
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
And I don't wanna go back
Never go back to where I was
God changed my way
Gave me a new heart
And I'll never be the same again
And you have my devotion forever
It's amazing that nothing would ever
Separate me from His love
My Creator from above

[Pre-Chorus]
Who gave us life
Who gave us life
Who gave us life, yeah
Gave us life and that's why...

[Chorus]
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life

[Verse 2: Akon]
Now, no stress, no strain
No pain, no gain
No, I'm not who I was
I'm not the same
And you're not to blame, no
Now, I don't complain
And from my past show no shame, no
'Cause we all been down that road before
Hoping one day we will explore
What's behind the golden door
They say your friends ain't family
You're lost along the way, how can it be?
That you're here today and not tomorrow
Nothing is here for certain, yes, that breath you take is borrowed

[Pre-Chorus]
That's right
He gave us life
He gave us life, yeah
Gave us life and that's why...

[Chorus]
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life

[Verse 3: Mali Music, Akon]
It's probably you, you already made up your mind
You ain't seeing nothing because you already know
All about this business singing to you
You pray before you eat
You rock your Jesus piece, you're spiritual (spiritual)
You heard it all, you've seen it all, you know it all
You go to church sometimes or you heard the stories before (Oooh)
Well, that's all good, 'cause all I'm suggesting is that you get to know the Lord

[Chorus]
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life
I got my back to the wall
Hands to the sky
Tryna do right
I got a new life
I got a new life

Ain't no love out here
No love out here
No love out here, no
No love out here

[Verse 1]
I found myself searching
And I just couldn’t find
It seems they're all working
Waiting for the right time
Just tryin' to survive
Surrounded by crime
While I’m just tryin' to provide for you
I face some time, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna think that I'm going crazy
It seems like everything changed from the way the streets praise me
Ain't no code that everybody live by
Too many died, can't let that shit slide
When you showed a sweet love, you got all my life
Baby girl, love saved me

[Chorus]
Oh baby, you
You got what I need
'Cause you kept me out the pit
And made sure I never went back again
By giving me sweet love, sweet love, yeah
Sweet love, sweet love
Yes, that sweet love, sweet love, yeah
Sweet love, sweet love

[Verse 2]
So dangerous when you had me falling
Oh yeah, I'm head over heels for you, on the concrete crawling
So you’re the reason I made that change
And never again will life be the same

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t wanna think that I'm going crazy
It seems like everything changed from the way the streets praise me
Ain’t no code that everybody live by
Too many died, can't let that shit slide
When you showed a sweet love, you got all my life
Baby girl, love saved me

[Chorus]
Oh baby, you
You got what I need
'Cause  you kept me out the pit
And made sure I never went back again
By giving me sweet love, sweet love, yeah
Sweet love, sweet love
Yes, that sweet love, sweet love, yeah
Sweet love, sweet love

[Outro]
So dangerous
So dangerous
So dangerous
So dangerous

[Verse 1]
I had to do bad, so you can do better
I was locked in the pen when I wrote you this letter
But you was way too young, don't understand no evil and no better
It's time that I tell you who I am, so I can protect you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause a bad role model is something I can't afford to be (To you)
'Cause only me and God knows what I did just to eat

[Chorus]
I steal for you, I deal for you
That's what I did for you
To get a meal for you
Nearly died for you
Did the time for you
I survived for you
To provide for you
All this for you
Did this for you
All that I do
I do for you

[Post-Chorus]
So you don't have to...
So you don't have to...
So you don't have to...
So you don't have to...

[Verse 2]
Made a couple trips home
Had a couple bricks on me
And always kept a stick on me
Can't let 'em make a victim of me
Risk my life for you
Dodging blue lights for you
Working overnight for you
So you're growing up to be just like me

[Pre-Chorus]
A bad role model is something I can't afford to be (To you)
Only me and God knows what I did just to eat

[Chorus]
I steal for you, I deal for you
That's what I did for you
To get a meal for you
Nearly died for you
Did the time for you
I survived for you
To provide for you
All this for you
Did this for you
All that I do
I do for you

[Post-Chorus]
So you don't have to...
So you don't have to...
So you don't have to...
So you don't have to...

[Bridge]
Did it so you don't have to
Did it all so that you never have to (Oh, no, no, no)
Did it so you don't have to (Don't do it)
Did it all so that you never have to (Oh, no, no, no)
Did it so you don't have to (I did it)
Did it all so that you never have to (Oh, no, no, no)
Did it so you don't have to (Don't do it)
Did it all so that you never have to

[Chorus]
I steal for you, I deal for you
That's what I did for you
To get a meal for you
Nearly died for you
Did the time for you
I survived for you
To provide for you
All this for you
Did this for you
All that I do
I do for you

[Intro: Akon]
Mama hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the streets and died
"Oh why? Oh why?", is what she cry, she cry

[Verse 1: Akon]
The biggest problems in the city
Is them daddies ain't there
And if it ain't about the money
Then nobody don't care
And then spoke to an OG
He tried to mentor me, he said:
"Boy, these streets will suck the love right out your heart
So don't believe that bullshit"

[Chorus: Akon]
You know goddamn well this system ain't for us (Oh, no no no)
And you know goddamn well the president don't love us (Oh, no no no)
Sinking down to the ground on the ghettos and we can't get no lower
So I'm askin' God how do we dig ourselves out if when we can't afford the shovel

[Verse 2: Akon]
If there's a problem in the hood, everybody come together just to solve that problem
But that's the problem in the hood, nobody comes together unless you involve violence
'Cause we was taught to be the tough guys and was told to just remain silent
But then you got them niggas telling on the next guy
Instead of tellin' 'em what it takes to solve it
Is there a problem that I don't know about? (Oh, no no no)
Is there a problem that I haven't heard about? (Oh, no no no)
'Cause I speak of kids robbing each other, pimps, prostitutes and drug dealers
We won't get much further unless we start helping each other
But them non believers will sink

[Chorus: Akon]
You know goddamn well this system ain't for us (Oh, no no no)
And you know goddamn well the president don't love us (Oh, no no no)
We're sinking down to the ground on the ghettos and we can't get no lower
So I'm askin' God how do we dig ourselves out if when we can't afford the shovel

[Verse 3: OG Boo Dirty]
We were 16 brothers with no father around
I was 16, 14 robbers now
Two went to school and got a degree
One went to jail, the other one's stuck in the streets
Damn, so nobody really made it out
Errbody sellin' bricks just to build a house
Momma working two jobs while babysitting hard
And I ain't even seen my dad when we was in a drought
Life crazy, can't dig success with a shovel
And now the hoes around digging me with no shovel

[?]
No Rihanna in the rain, somebody grab my umbrella, yeah

[Outro: Akon]
Mama hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down by police and died
"Oh why? Oh why?", is what she cry, she cry
Mama hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down by police and died

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't no peace out in these streets
Said ain't no peace out in these streets
Refuse to be defeated by enemies
Refuse to be mistreated by these police

[Chorus]
'Cause ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace

[Verse 1]
Shoutout to the ghetto, life ain't even fair
Born with an old soul, but ain't been nowhere
Seem too much than a child could bear
Searching for love when it's just not there

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't no peace out in these streets
Said ain't no peace out in these streets
Refuse to be defeated by enemies
Refuse to be mistreated by these police

[Chorus]
'Cause ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace

[Verse 2]
So why me? Lord, tell me why me
I'm just tryin', just tryna provide for my family
So show me that sign for I'm so blind
And I won't know it unless you show me outside this grind

[Chorus]
'Cause ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace
Ain't no peace

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Death penalty, the future for a kingpin
Got a suite up at the Ritz for the season
Blonde bitches in the palace like it's Frankie Valli
Rich nigga out in Cali, all black Dinali
Got the soldiers and the powder and it's all the power
Sticks and the bricks and I want a 

[?] a hour
Pull up in it, leavin' a lucky bastard
Heavy set but they really know who run the record
If she wet then she might just be the total package
Better yet, then she might just really want it lavish
Watch fat boy, walk a tight rope (Hahaha)
Two hunnid for a boat, full of white dope
Testifyin' that'll get you where the mice go (M-M-M)
Mink coats, maybe when the lights low
Gotta stay strapped 'cause the dice roll
If you gangsta then you buried with your ice on

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
To all my killers and drug dealers (Maybach Music)
These streets ain't got no love for you (No love for you, no)
To all my killers and drug dealers (Ooh yeah)
These streets ain't got no love for you

Better get out while you can (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Get out while you can (Yeah-yeah-yeah)

Get out while you can (Get out, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out

[Verse 2: Akon]
I was young, I joined a whole gang
They said they'll kill me if I ain't bang
Here's the product, nigga, go slang
Best believe I sold the whole thang
That your boy hustler, a student to the game
That's the kinda crazy shit a nigga gotta do, just to maintain
These niggas ain't got no love for you
Do what you gotta do, just to maintain
These niggas ain't got no love (No, oh-oh)
No love

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
To all my killers and drug dealers
These streets ain't got no love for you (They ain't got no love for you)
To all my killers and drug dealers
These streets ain't got no love for you (No, no, no love for you)

[Chorus: Akon]
Better get out while you can (Get out, yeah-yeah-yeah)

'Cause I remember ('Cause I remember)
Looking forward to when they set you free, my nigga
Oh, I remember (oh, I remember), yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause this life that I'm living (This life that I'm living)
It's got a partition (It's got a partition)
One half good, the other half hood
Makes the town think I'm trippin' (But I ain't trippin')
Even after makin' all this money
The nigga still wanna go back (Go back)
Even after makin' all this money
The nigga still wanna go back (Go back)
'Cause I can't shake the memory (I can't shake it), no (I miss the hood, y'all)
Just can't shake the memory (I can't shake it), no (I miss the hood, y'all)

[Verse 2]
Remember how we ran the streets, my nigga? (My nigga)
'Cause I remember
All them foreign whips we never leased, my nigga
Do you remember? (Do you remember?)
Loud ass system with them beats, my nigga (My nigga)
Do you remember? (Do you remember?)
With the rooftop missing the other seats, my nigga
Do you remember? (Do you remember?)
Even if you aren't here, my nigga (What up, D?)

'Cause you was there to always give me what I need, my nigga
And I'll never forget it (Never forget it)

[Chorus]
That's why this life that I'm living (This life that I'm living)
It's got a partition (It's got a partition)
One half good, the other half hood
Makes the town think I'm trippin' (But I ain't trippin')
Even after makin' all this money
The nigga still wanna go back (Go back)
Even at the making of all this money
The nigga still wanna go back (Go back)
Because I can't shake the memory (I can't shake it), no (I miss the hood, y'all)
Just can't shake the memory (I can't shake it), no (I miss the hood, y'all)

[Verse 3]
It's hard to believe, my nigga
But I'll always remember (Always remember)
We started from the dirt to make at this cheese, my nigga
And I'll always remember (And I'll always remember)
Even harder to believe, my nigga
And I'll always remember
We went from asking G's "what you need, my nigga?"
And I'll always remember (I'll always remember)
Remember when I said I'd never leave, my nigga
And I'll always remember (I'll always remember)
It's time I get back to the streets, my nigga
I'll always remember (I'll always remember)

[Chorus]
'Cause you know this life that I'm living (This life that I'm living)
It's got a partition (It's got a partition)
One half good, the other half hood
Makes the town think I'm trippin' (But I ain't trippin')
Even at the making of all this money
The nigga still wanna go back (Go back)
Even after makin' all this money
The nigga still wanna go back (Go back)
'Cause I can't shake the memory (I can't shake it), no (I miss the hood, y'all)

Gave you them whiskey eyes
Those California dreaming nights
I never thought we’d be this high
We’re dancing side by side
And she drinking on the lime
Her heart can lie tonight
She holding onto mine
The feelings won’t subside
I don’t know why

It feels like, it feels like
I don't know what to feel like
But I know that it feels right
It feels like, it feels like
I don't know what to feel like
But I know that it feels right

Gave you them whiskey eyes
Those California dreaming nights
I never thought we’d be this high
We’re dancing side by side
Now we drunk in love tonight
Staring at the sky
The stars a passing by
Don’t you let me try
If it’s just this one time
It feels like, it feels like
I don't know what to feel like
But I know that it feels right
It feels like, it feels like
I don't know what to feel like
But I know that it feels right

Daddy used to take me walkin' down the street
Daddy used to take my hand, say, "Follow me"
Daddy used to leave me back home all the time
I got big enough to run around, Daddy left me outside

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
He said, "Find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby
Find your way back
Don't let this life drive you crazy
Find your way back
Come back home 'fore the street lights on
Find your way back
Find your way back"

It's been a long time, but remember who you are
Circle of life, but one day, I might not make it

"But you just gotta find your way back
Big, big world, but you got it, baby

Runnin' 'round wild, had to tie my shoes
Itty bitty child with a smile like you
Wild, wild child, look a lot like you
Daddy used to teach me all my tricks
Runnin' 'round wild, had to get my fix
Daddy used to teach me all my plays
On a marathon, had to run my race

Pocketful of honey and I'm ready to go

No, I couldn't live without your touch
No, I could never have too much
I'll breathe you in forever and ever

I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my

Don't wait, you can push to start, lose control
Kill me slowly with your kiss
Wrap me 'round your fingertips
Damn, I need another hit

Bend, little willow
Wind's going to blow you hard and cold tonight
Life, as it happens
Nobody warns you, willow, hold on tight

[Chorus]
Nothing's going to shake your love
Take your love away
No one's out to break your heart
It only seems that way, hey

[Verse 2]
Sleep little willow, peace going to follow
Time will heal your wounds
Grow to the heavens, now and forever
Always came too soon

[Chorus]
Nothing's going to shake your love

[Verse 2]
Sleep little willow, peace going to follow
Time will heal your wounds
Grow to the heavens, now and forever
Always came too soon
For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intricacies of life
We could jaw through the night
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like
Oh yeah

But we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time

For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intricacies of life
We could jaw through the night
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like

But we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time
Wake up from your dream, come and take the day
You wanna look bright, but you don't know what to say
Hold on to your love, hold on to the string she gives you
Never runs away, never runs
Never runs away, never runs

For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intricacies of life
We could jaw through the night
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like

But we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time
...back to the song we were singing
At any particular time

Hang on to your hat while you make a move
You wanna be bold, but there's nothing left to prove
Go on and enjoy the love that is staring at you
Never runs away, never runs
Never runs away, never runs

For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intricacies of life
Yeah, we could jaw through the night
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like
But we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time
Always came back to the song we were singing
Oh yeah
Cross my heart and hope to die
I don't need another guy
To fight my battles
To overshadow me
Don't you know I'm dangerous?
Fire burning in my blood
I got this handled
I don't need rescuing

You can call me a princess all you like
'Cause you like to keep me helpless by your side
But it ain't what I want, I'ma show you, I'ma show you
How to treat me like a queen
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can I get a "Yes, your majesty"?
So treat me like a queen
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
She go skiin' in the summer
Maxin' out her credit card just to slow dance to the thunder
Her picnic's by the reservoir
And her dad's old beat up station wagon
Get in and drive away
She lived in fear, we disappear to our secret hidin' place, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I thought I saw her smile this afternoon
By the water, lyin' naked
As the wind began to whisper her the truth

[Chorus]
Hold on
Let go

[Verse 2]
She wakes up, wakes up
Opens up her eyes that covers up the lies
She hides behind her makeup
Give up, she wants to give up
It's all too heavy on her mind, gettin' high, too many lines
Completely numb

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Fake a smile for this photograph
I'ma count to three, please smile for this photograph, girl
I just wanna hang a picture on the wall
Fake a smile for this photograph
I'ma count to three, please smile for this photograph, girl
I just wanna hang a picture on the wall

[Chorus]
Hold on
Let go
Hold on
Let go

[Verse 1]
The lazy guy is sleepin' on your couch again
Responsibility it would seem is now drownin' him
"You get another suicidal thought," I told him, "Count to ten
Or go up to the roof and look down at all the happy people"
My shit is mad cerebral, paintings on a magic easel
Bunch of saints acquainted with Satan, now they actin' evil
A walkin' magnet, absorbin' your core's energy
Squeezin' beetle juices from Lennon to form remedies
A bit menacing, sadistic feelings festerin'
Beat you while you sleepin', let you dream with all that hemorrhagin'
A world of lemmings, zombies and happy endings
People that keep pretendin' they entertainin' a fantasy
In the shallow water you treadin'
Put your feet down, you might just meet ground (Meet ground)
It all started with a freestyle (That's where it started)
It's gon' end with a beatdown (Yeah)

[Interlude]
You wish to enter into the forbidden cave where the monsters and goblins and fungus lives amongst the roses? There is no light here. There is nothing here for you. You would be better off if you just turned around and went back to your happy little life
(No, no!)
(Woo!)

[Verse 2]
Okay, live from a house that's made of porcelain
I ain't poppin' Mollys no more, I'm snortin' 'em
A bunch of powder I bought from Dr. Kevorkian
Do a line, stand up, start to play the accordion (Magic show)
I'm bored again, my mind is runnin' suicides and hamster wheels
Lose your mind when you decide to swallow all Amanda's pills (Current events)
I pour liquor inside my chamomile
Eat banana peels and post up in the south of France
Fuck, I think I conjured up the wrong shit (The wrong shit)
And now I'm being haunted (Fuck!)
Must be hallucinatin' all of this booty shakin'
(What an ass, what an ass, what an ass)
Ah! Haha, yeah
Defeatin' Dracula to go and post in Africa
Open up Pandora's box and fuck it (Fuck it)
We live amongst the rubbish, but all my bitches busted when compared to me
Apparently the fairest in the land, bitch, I'm ghost (Gorgeous)

[Outro]
Hahaha
If you could love, would you? (No, no)
Would you take the risk (No)
Of being vulnerable? (No, no, no, I would not)
I am not a man, but a mice with a hand (Woah)
I ate sushi twice in Japan
There's not a price on understanding this life that I'm reprimanding
There's no planning in the way that I be tanning in the sun (And jammin')
The burnt one (The burnt one)
Shot from a Nerf gun with my third son
Don't alert none
'Cause you're for sure dumb when the herb come
I be getting—hahaha, what am I talkin' like that for?
Back me up, bro, more hip hop

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I wonder, can I make a little money without sellin' my soul?
I know you'll never be the shit if you ain't smellin' your own (Smellin' your own)
And even God gave the Devil a home
Now the evil live in all of us, wherever we go
I had plans to be a innovator
This flight simulator, flyin' through the Himalayas
Sips from a blissful nature
There's blood on the hands they've been grippin' paper
The man in the mirror always my biggest hater
Bullshit for later, Malcolm, need to focus
I know you got emotions that are kinda hard to cope with, but
You gotta stay strong and always act cordial
Shit, I do drugs 'cause they help me feel normal
I'm a man of good morals, got millions in the plural
Would go to outer space if you informed to where the portal is
Knew I was the one, but never got to hear from Morpheus
Life get interestin' when you realize how short it is

[Chorus]
And you don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
But you still try
'Cause you won't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Until you die, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, six thousand dollar Versace shoes
I would burn 'em in a second, materials are nothin'
But I'm addicted to stuntin'
And I grew into a person I'm kinda wishin' I wasn't
I'm so happy when I'm drunk though
Feelin' so free when I'm high
Two packs a day, you could say I upgraded
But fuck bein' famous, I just wanna be alive
Sometimes I can't sleep, I can't live with myself
I don't even know what it is I don't like
The hot days and cold nights start to feel repetitive
The exorcist tried to take his own life
While trippin' on acid, I started to bug
'Cause the things I did to her make it harder to love
Before I sunk deep in this yellow submarine
Had to realize where I was

[Chorus]
And you don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
But you still try
'Cause you won't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Until you die, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, oh (Aight, some shit like that)
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Doh-doh-doh-doh, da-doh-doh
Da-da-da-da, da-doh-doh
Da-da-doh-doh
Doh-doh-doh-doh, da-doh-doh
Da-da-da-da, da-doh-doh
Da-da-doh-doh

[Verse 3]
I got this motherfuckin' friend
That I kinda get at her friends
Have fun on 

[?]
Have fun on the way to Venice
I got money on my mind
And 

[?]
If you gotta get in front of
The front of the race
I hardly try to fill the fun and the smile a waste
I be the bank, when I'm 

[?] face
I got a buncha motherfucker that lie to my face
And everybody at the night,

Bitches fuck like we devils, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Yes, we live that mothafuckin' thug life
She gon' suck this dick 'til she get tongue-tied
Hop out on your set, throw up the Blood sign
Ratta-tatta, tatta-tatta, doves fly
It's ratta-tat-tat-tatter scatter or get splattered
Data it don't matter, get your shadow shattered
'Specially if you rata taddle
Get that ratta-tat to your tail
Or put the ratta-tatter in your madulla
Oblongata it'll rattle, earthquake to Saturn
Stop all the chatter, slap up your madem
Hop back in the Phantom, screamin' out the anthem

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last

[Verse 1]
Satellites flashing by
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
We're nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side

[Chorus]
In your eyes, love's alive
You've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

[Verse 2]
Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display
Let's run and hide

[Chorus]
In our eyes, love's alive
We've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

[Bridge]
If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe

[Outro]
Satellites flashing by
Satellites

[Verse 1]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

[Chorus]
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (Run)
And smash into you

[Verse 2]
Ears closed
What I hear, no one else has to know
'Cause I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong, oh

[Chorus]
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
Smash into you
Oh...

[Bridge]
Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love (Your love)
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

[Chorus]
Ohh, I wanna run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (Run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (Run)
Smash into you

You havin' fun (Oh)

When it get cold, let it up, yeah (Yeah, oh, oh)
We goin' up, yeah (Yeah, oh, oh)
All these girls, they with us, yeah (Yeah, oh, oh, oh)
And we don't never stop, 'cause we never get enough

[Verse 1]
Big joint that I fill
New lights on the grill
Gold D's on the wheels
Roll with me need skills
I can tell you how it feel
Diamond chain for a pill
Buy the waves for a mil
Ain't even tryna flex
Some of them niggas want the trophy
I want mind and respect
Rapping these verses
Breaking these purses when it's time to collect
Don't even buy just one, we get 'em in sets
Ain't talkin' clothes, I'm talking the ice on her neck
I give you a start and make you work for the rest
Make you a boss, have you signing them checks
Checkin' the books and make sure my papers correct
Look, I done turned you to a threat

[Chorus]
You havin' fun (Oh)
If your nigga find out, he gon' be upset (Oh, oh)
Put the top down (Oh, oh)
When it get cold, let it up, yeah (Yeah, oh, oh)
You're goin' up, yeah (Yeah, oh, oh)
All these girls, they with us, yeah (Yeah, oh, oh, oh)
And we don't never stop, 'cause we never get enough

[Verse 2]
Letting 'em up
Who knew that after years of hard work, the truth would be us
Two girls in the back, let our seats up
Cell phones off, so they can't reach us
I got an extra one, bitch, keep up
Put the kush in the joint, call it secret stuff
How you a boss and you rollin' in the cheapest one?
Me and my squad do our job, that's keepin' the bleachers filled up
They know way better than to steal from us
They work, so if we take a loss then shit we still get up
They wonder what's in my garage, if I'm gon' switch it up
I don't pull nothing, I make y'all go get some different work
We leave up out here and make all the bitches disappear

[Chorus]
You havin' fun (Oh)
If your nigga find out, he gon' be upset (Oh, oh)
Put the top down (Oh, oh)
When it get cold, let it up, yeah (Yeah, oh, oh)
We goin' up, yeah (Yeah, oh, oh)
All these girls, they with us, yeah (Yeah, oh, oh, oh)
And we don't never stop, 'cause we never get enough, yeah

[Outro]
Get enough, get enough
Get enough, get enough

You need coolin', baby, I'm not foolin'

I'm goin' to give you my love, oh

[Chorus]
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

Goin' to give you my love, hey, alright, yes, sir

[Chorus]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

[Chorus]
Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed, now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Chorus]
And it makes me wonder
Ohh, woah

[Verse 5]
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

[Outro]
And she's buying a stairway to heaven

[Verse 1]
In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home with a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

[Verse 2]
Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

[Outro]
I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbours say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part

[Verse 1]
The leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Verse 2]
Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though "Our health" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Bridge]
I tell you no lie

[Verse 3]
Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

[Outro]
Ramblin', I'm gonna shake (Sing my song)
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way, going 'round the world
Baby, baby (Ramble on)
Do do do do do do do do, my baby
I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my baby I think "we gots to part"
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I gotta keep on searching for my baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, baby
I can't find my bluebird!
I listened to what my bluebird said, but I, I can't find my bluebird!
I keep rambling, baby

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Ah, ah, child, way you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting
Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, I can't keep away

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I gotta roll, can't stand still
Got a flaming heart, can't get my fill
Eyes that shine, burning red
Dreams of you all through my head
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ahh

[Bridge]
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Tell me would you do me now
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Move me while you groove me now

[Verse 3]
Take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out
Spent my money, took my car
Started tellin' her friend she' gon' be a star
I don't know, but I've been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 4]
All I ask for, all I pray
Steady rollin' woman gonna come my way
Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ahh

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Hey baby, pretty baby, oh baby
Hey baby, pretty baby, oh baby
Hey baby, pretty baby, oh baby
In my time of dying, want nobody to mourn
All I want for you to do is take my body home
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Jesus gotta make out, sure know
Jesus gonna make out
Jesus gonna make it my dyin' bed

Meet me, Jesus, meet me
Ooh, meet me in the middle of the air
If my wings should fail me, Lord
Please meet me with another pair
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Oh-whoa, well, well, well, so I can die easy
Jesus gonna make out
Somebody, somebody, oh, oh
Jesus gonna make out
Jesus gonna make it my dyin' bed

Oh, Saint Peter at the gates of Heaven, won't you let me in?
I never did no wrong, I never did no wrong
Uh, oh, Gabriel, let me blow your horn, let me blow your horn
Oh, never did no wrong, did no wrong
I've only been beyond once
I never thought I'd do anybody no wrong, no, no one, sir
Aww, good
Oh, I did s-somebody some good
Somebody some good, yes, oh
Oh, did somebody some good, yeah
I musta did somebody some good, yeah
Oh, I believe I did
I see the smilin' faces
I know there must be lipstick traces, oh

Ah

And I see them in the streets
And I see them in the field, yeah
And I hear them under my feet
And I know it's got to be real
Oh, Lord, deliver me
All the wrong I've done
Ooh, you can deliver me, Lord
I only wanted to have some fun

Oh, hear the angels marching, they're marching
Hear them marching, hear them marching, they're marching

Oh, my Jesus, oh, my Jesus, oh, my Jesus, oh, my Jesus

Oh, a-take me home
Come on, come on, I can hear the angels singing
Oh, here they come, here they come, here they come
'Bye-'bye, 'bye-'bye, 'bye-'bye, 'bye-'bye, 'bye-'bye
Oh, it feels pretty good up here, pretty good up here
Oh Georgina, Oh Georgina, Oh Georgina

Take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, ooh yes, c'mon, uh
Oh, yeah
Oh, don'tcha make it, my dyin', dyin', dyin'... cough

[Verse 1]
You said I was the only
With my lemon in your hand
Exhibition is your habit
Emotion second hand
Had to pull away to save me
Maybe next time around
And she said, don't you want it?
Don't you want cocaine, cocaine, cocaine?
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to
Try it, fry it, na na na na yeah

[Verse 2]
Heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned
Oh, oh, babe, damned
Down in the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground
Oh, hello underground
Wine and roses ain't quite over
Fate deals a losing hand
And I said, didn't mean to
Did not mean to f-fail
You didn't plan it, you over-ran it

[Verse 3]
You want do it, you want to
You want do it when you want to
You want do it, do it when you want to
When you blow it, babe
You got to blow it right
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama
Baby, fake with all your might
When you fake it, mama
Please fake it right for yourself, babe
When you fake it, baby
You're faking it for your life, for your life
For your life, for your life
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Oh, I can have you, baby
But I don't know what to do, yeah
Sometime, baby, nothing I could do
On the balance of a crystal
Paying through the nose
And when they couldn't resist you
I thought you'd go with the flow
And now your stage is empty
Bring down the curtain, baby please
Fold up your show
Hadn't planned to
Could not stand to fry in it
Hadn't planned it
I over-ran it, frying
For your life, for your life

[Verse 1]
Greasy slicked down
Groovy leather trim
I like the way you hold the road
Mama, it ain't no sin

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

Ooh, trouble-free transmission
Helps your oils flow
Mama, let me pump your gas
Mama, let me do it all

[Chorus]
Talking 'bout love

Check that heavy metal
Underneath your hood
Baby, I can work all night
Believe I got the perfect tools

Automobile with comfort
Really built with style

Heat begins to rise
Guaranteed to run for hours

Grooving on the freeway

Devil he taught me to roll
Devil he taught me to roll
How to roll the lot you like

[Hook]
Nobody's fault but mine

How to kick that gong to light

[Hook]
Oh, it's nobody's fault but mine

Got a monkey on my back
M-m-m-m-monkey on my back, back, back, back
Gonna change my ways tonight

[Outro]
How to kick that gong to light
N-n-n-n-n-no, nobody's fault

[Verse 1]
Close the door, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know?
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through

[Chorus]
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step, ooh
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you, oh

[Chorus]
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
Oh!
The pain, the pain without quarter, oh yeah!
They ask no quarter (without quarter, quarter, quarter)
They give no quarter (giving me, giving me no...)
Oh (The dogs of doom are howling more!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Been working from seven
To eleven every night
Really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right

[Verse 1]
I've really been the best, the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah
Cause I love you, baby, how I love you, darling
How I love you, baby, my beloved little girl, little girl

[Chorus]
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Everybody trying to tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you, I really did the best I could

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been, I've been working from seven
To eleven every night
I said it kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag, drag
Lord, yeah, that ain't right, now, now

[Chorus]
Since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Watch out

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I said I've been crying, yeah
Oh, my tears they fell like rain
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?

[Verse 3]
Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me
You didn't want me no more, yeah
I open my front door, I hear my back door slam
You know, I must have one of them newfangled
Newfangled back-door men

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been a-working from seven, seven, seven
To eleven, eleven every night
It kinda makes my life a drag, a drag, drag
Ah yeah! It makes it a drag

[Chorus]
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose, I'm about to lose, lose my worried mind
Oh yeah
Just one more, just one more, ooh, yeah
Since I've been loving you, I'm gonna lose my worried mind

[Verse 1]
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talk and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah

[Verse 2]
You hurt and abuse telling all of your lies
Run 'round, sweet baby, Lord, how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you, baby, here I come again

[Extra Verse]
If you're going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're gonna meet a lot of gentle people there

[Verse 3]
Every day I work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay
Try to love you, baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again

[Instrumental break 1:58-5:25]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Take it easy, baby, let them say what they will
Did your tongue wag so much when I sent you the bill?

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

[Chorus]
Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed, now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Chorus]
And it makes me wonder
Ohh, woah

[Verse 5]
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

[Outro]
And she's buying a stairway to heaven

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I had a dream, oh yeah
Crazy dream, oh ho
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
Hear my song, yeah
People won't you listen now?
Sing along, oh
You don't know what you're missing now
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow now, push, push, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu Starbright
The song remains the same, ooh yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
All you gotta do now, all you gotta do now
Sing out Hare Hare
Dance the Hoochie Koo
City lights are oh so bright
As we go sliding, sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding
Through

[Verse 1]
Walking in the park just the other day, baby
What do you, what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sitting on the grass with flowers in their hair said
Hey, boy, do you wanna score?
And you know how it is?
I really don't know what time it was
Woah, oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay a while

[Verse 2]
I didn’t notice but it had got very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me
And asked us said please, hey, would we care
To all get in line, get in line
Well, you know, they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Oh, oh, oh
He said that his friends would all drop by, ooh

[Verse 3]
Why don't you take a good look at yourself
And describe what you see?
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rusting
Ah! Not trying to fight it
You really don't care if they’re coming?
Oh, oh, oh
I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh (No, no, no!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
If you go down in the streets
Today, baby you better
You better open your eyes
Folk down there really don't care
Really don't care, don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm going to do now
So I’m packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly, ooh

[Outro]
I really don’t know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I really don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I really don’t know

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

[Verse 2]
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Ooh, baby, I been flying
No yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Oh, ooh, yeah I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying

[Verse 4]
Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

[Verse 5]
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

[Verse 6]
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Ooooh

[Verse 7/Outro]
Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there
Oh..Come on, oh, let me take you there...let me take you there
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, let me take you there...let me take you there

[Verse 1]
You need coolin', baby, I'm not foolin'

All the good times, baby, I've been misusin'

Shake for me, girl, I want to be your back door man
Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh!

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Yes, it has

[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since The Book of Love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from
Whoa, whoa, oh

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

[Verse 3]
Oh! Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Oh yeah, open your arms, opens your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in!
Yeah!

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

[Intro]
Hmmm-mm
Hmmm-mm

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow skies
It's so crazy, I could drink it like tequila sunrise
Put on that Hotel California
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name

[Chorus]
God knows I lived, God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I loved, God knows I lied
God knows I lost, God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow lights
On Monday, they destroyed me
But by Friday, I'm revived
Put on that Hotel California
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame

[Chorus]
God knows I lived, God knows I died
God knows I loved, God knows I lied
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I lost, God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried

[Bridge]
So let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life, light up my life
Let there be light, let there be light
Light up my life, light up my life

[Outro]
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried

[Verse 1]
Baby, you're making me crazier than I am
So lately, I've been taking my violets, my oranges, my reds
Take the gun and put it to my head
So I forget, so I just forget again
You make me forget again, yeah

[Verse 2]
And baby, you're making me make up all my own plans
What's a girl to do when everyone looks bright
Nothing to forget about that don't turn to night
What’s a man to do when nothing isn't right
Like to say, like to say the future don't look bright
Lyrics from Snippet

I gave you all of me
For none of you
Something that I don't ever do
You made me feel like I'm not good enough (Uh)
And I don't want to walk away
That's the last thing that I want but hey
I guess right now I have to do whatever is best for me
Best for me

I can't hold my breath no more
Inside I have your selfish love
I can't...
Lyrics from Snippet

And I'm still getting too fucked up
That's (?) to my past, I just want to feel numb
Livin' life outside of my body, want to feel somethin'
But I can't feel, none

Always said that I wanna go back to better days
But in reality, there was no better days
Is it everything that I ever asked for

[Intro: The Kid LAROI]

Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I remember times when I ain't have shit
No food in my crib, now I live lavish (Oh, no-no-no)
They say they love me to my face, but they can't stand it
Them hoes ain't fuck with me back then, now they attracted
FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know
Made it out the mud, with or without you, I'm good
Did it for my lil' bro, just to show him one day you could
I did this for my mama 'cause I told her one day I would

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
My life been tragic, thank you for askin'
I've seen too many of my fam end up in caskets
I've seen too many of my friends turned into ashes
Wish I still had them
Light a blunt, put it to the sky, I'm tryna get high (High)
They won't stop, look me in my eyes, tell me it's alright (Alright)
Had to cut plenty people off, money on my mind
I can't fuck with 'em, I can't trust nobody but I (Yeah)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I remember times when I ain't have shit (Yeah)
No food in my crib, now I live lavish
They say they love me to my face, but they can't stand it
Them hoes ain't fuck with me back then, now they attracted
FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know
Made it out the mud, with or without you, I'm good
Did it for my lil' bro, just to show him one day you could
I did this for my mama 'cause I told her one day I would

[Verse 2: YoungBoy Never Broke Again & The Kid LAROI]
They hate so bad-bad, huh, my money up, they fake as fuck
I know they mad-mad, huh, I still ain't done, I ain't switchin' up
I ain't givin' up, I'm goin' in, word to my friends
I ain't thinking clear, tell me what I did, I just whipped the Benz
I'd give it all back right now just to see you smile
I'd give my hoes back, on slime, just to hear you now
They ain't my friend, ain't my woadie, ain't my dawg
For to get some money be the only reason that they come around
And the top down, everythin' goin' smoothly
Hope they don't try me, come out on top, I'm shootin' 'round
When I'm up in town
Haters after me but got so many of 'em for me (Yeah), I can't let 'em down

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI & NBA Youngboy]
I remember times when I ain't have shit (Yeah)
No food in my crib, now I live lavish (Top)
They say they love me to my face, but they can't stand it
Them hoes ain't fuck with me back then, now they attracted
FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know
Made it out the mud, with or without you, I'm good
Did it for my lil' bro, just to show him one day you could
I did this for my mama 'cause I told her one day I would

[T’yana Wallace:]
Hi; my name is T'yana Wallace, and I wanna thank all my dad’s fans and friends.

Yes, he was The Notorious B.I.G., but to me, he was just my dad.

I love him and I miss him a lot.
Lyrics from snippet

[Intro]
Perfect
Oh yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
If I'm being honest
I've been so dishonest
Running from my problems
Anxiety got me nauseous
I'll show you that it's okay
Uh, I can't call in, no I can't call, I can't come (Let's go)

[Verse]
Baby (?) let's (?)
Another hit bitch I can't help myself
Tell me I'm the only one
The type that can't help myself
Bitch took me to hell and I still wish you well
Fucking up my health
Diamonds (?)...
Lyrics from Snippets

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
Okay hol' up, light that bitch, it's smoking, what's the hold up?
Your love, don't really mean nothing to me no more
Poe' up, I be in my feelings, I be on one
Hennessy, memories is one hell of a drug
I got somebody else, but she don't do what you do
And every time I hold her I wish I was holdin' you
Why you acting brand new? I just want the old you
'Cause my new bitch already fighting, it feel like old news

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Ooh-woah, you got it, you got it
Can't find the words to describe it
Ooh-woah, you got it, you got it
Can't find the words to describe it
Ooh-woah, you got it, you got it
Can't find the words to describe it
Ooh-woah, you got it, you got it
I can't find the words to describe it

[Verse 2: TheHxliday]
Is it love? Is it hate? It's the same thing
Does this mean that you care what they're thinkin'?
Yeah, my mind in the gutter, mind had been sinkin'
And my mind on the drugs, yeah, mind on the drinking
I just want the version of you from the past tense
Shawty, why you actin' like you don't know what happened?
Shawty, why you tweakin'? Shawty, why you cappin'?
Bae, I lost my heart, yeah, can you help me map it? (Ooh)
Tell me bae, where you gotta go? (Oh, oh)
Tell me baby, who you really know? (Oh, oh)
Baby, tell me who you really want? (Oh, oh)
Thinkin' that I'm scared to fall in love
Still in love, baby
And I know I want you (I want you)
I'ma trust, baby
And I know I can't trust you (I can't trust you)

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Ooh-woah, you got it, you got it
Can't find the words to describe it
Ooh-woah, you got it, you got it
Can't find the words to describe it
Ooh-woah, you got it, you got it
Can't find the words to describe it
Ooh-woah, you got it, you got it
I can't find the words to describe it

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

[Verse 2: Sheryl Crow & Michael Jackson]
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Sheryl Crow]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson & Sheryl Crow]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Sheryl Crow]
I just can't stop loving you (Oh)
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

[Bridge: Michael Jackson, Sheryl Crow, Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, hey, farewell to sorrow
This is my life, and I
Want to see you for always

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Sheryl Crow]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby) (No)
I just can't stop loving you (Say it again now)
And if I stop (Oh)
Then tell me just what will I do
(What will I do?) (Hee, hee, hee)

(Hee hee hee, all my life, baby)
I just can't stop loving you
(All my life, baby)
And if I stop

[Verse 1]
She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

[Verse 2]
It's out of my hands
It's...can I come down there?
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands, oh yeah
She's out of my hands

[Bridge]
So I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love don't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

[Verse 3]
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my...life, mhm

[Spoken Intro]
Now we're gonna give you the old songs the old-fashioned way
Everybody clap your hands

I Want You Back

[Verse 1]
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (back in your heart)?
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now, since I see you
(I want you back)
Yes, I do now
(I want you back)
Ooh, ooh, baby
(I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I want you back)
Na, na, na, na
(I want you back)
The Love You Save

[Spoken Intro]
Everybody clap your hands

[Verse 1]
When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be It
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit
When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing

[Chorus]
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
(Stop the love you save may be your own)
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for the danger zone

I'll Be There

[Verse 1]
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there (I'll be there)

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
Yes I will

[Verse 2]
If you should ever find someone new
I know he'd better be good to you
'Cause if he doesn't, I'll be there (I'll be there)

[Outro]
Don't you know, baby, yeah
I'll be there
Everybody, I'll be there, oh oh
Just call my name (I'll be there), I'll be there
Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh
I'll be there
Everybody sing it (I'll be there), I'll be there - you're beautiful
Just call my name
And...I'll, I'll be...
Can you feel it, girl?

[Scatting]
I think I wanna rock

[Verse 1]
Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Just relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta feel the heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you, yeah (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away

Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow, yeah
We got so far to go

[Pre-Chorus]
When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you, yeah (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away, yeah

And when the grove is dead and gone
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever on

Oh yeah, rock with me, all night long (All night long)
Shake your thang (Shake your thang)
Come on, girl, rock with me

Come on, girl
Rock with me 'til the morning
Hee, heeeee

[Verse 1]
Reaching out
Across the night-time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the night-time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?

[Verse 2]
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

[Chorus]
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way

[Refrain]
Ha-wah-oh-wah
Ha-wah-wah

[Verse 3]
Reaching out
Into the night-time
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
Everybody sing

[Chorus]
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
Everybody, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, "Why? Why? Why? Why?"
Ooh, tell them
Why does he do me that way?
If they say, "Why? Why? Why? Why?"
Ooh, tell 'em
Why does he do me that way?
I like living this way

[Outro]
Ha-wah-oh-wah
Ha-wah-oh-wah
Wah...

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by—
You've been hit by a smooth criminal
OW

[Verse 2]
So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats intimidations

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by—
You've been struck by a smooth criminal
OW

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
(Annie, are you okay?)
I don't know
(Will you tell us, that you're okay)
I don't know
(There's a sound at the window)
I don't know
(That he struck you a crescendo, Annie)
I don't know
(He came into your apartment)
I don't know
(Left the bloodstains on the carpet)
I don't know
(And then you ran into the bedroom)
I don't know
(You were struck down, it was your doom, Annie)
Daggone it
(Annie, are you okay?)
Daggone it, Annie
(Will you tell us, that you're okay)
Daggone it, baby
(There's a sound at the window)
(That he struck you a crescendo, Annie)
Woo, woo
(He came into your apartment)
Daggone it
(Left the bloodstains on the carpet)
(And then you ran into the bedroom)
(You were struck down, it was your doom)

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
You've been hit by—
You've been struck by a smooth criminal

[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying, "That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says, "There's no turnin' back"
She trapped me in her heart

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying, "That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I wanna go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star"

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

[Post-Chorus]
Diana, baby
Diana, mama
Dirty Diana, no
Woo-hoo

[Verse 3]
She said, "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleepin' alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright"
Diana walked up to me
She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright
But unlock the door
Because I forgot my key"
"He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me"

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, OW

[Outro]
Come on, hoo
Come on, hoo-hoo
Come on, hoo
Come on
Come on, hoo
Come on
Come on, hoo
Come on
Come on, hoo
Come on, hoo-hoo
Come on, hoo

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurkin' in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
This is thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh woo, oh

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination
But all the while you hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're outta time

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller. OW

[Spoken Interlude: Vincent Price]
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, hee hee hee, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
Thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul could ever dare try
Thriller, hee hee hee, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, OW
Thriller

[Verse 1]
They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face. You better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it, huh
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]
Beat it (Beat it), beat it (Beat it)

[Verse 2]
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it, huh
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]
Beat it (Beat it), beat it (Beat it)
(No one wants to be defeated)
Showin' how funky strong is your fight

[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean
I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"
Hey-ay

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover, hoo
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son, hoo
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
Take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told, "My baby, we'd danced 'til three"
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin'
His eyes looked like mine (Oh, no)
Do a dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
(Don't break no heart)
But she came and stood right by me
With the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room, hey-ay

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover, hoo
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
(No no no, a-no no, a-hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (Daggone it)
She says I am the one (Hee, hee)
But the kid is not my son
A-hee hee hee

[Bridge]
Hee, woo

[Chorus]
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No, no, no, oh)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(No, you didn't dance with me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
(No no no, no no)
She says I am the one (Go with your kid, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Go with your kid, yeah)

[Outro]
She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breaking my heart, babe)
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover (OW)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover (Don't call me Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover (None of what you see)
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hee)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind
Pretending not to see their need?

[Pre-Chorus]
A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind you know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Nanana, nanana, nana, nana, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of
A selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?

[Pre-Chorus]
A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind you see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Oh)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Oh)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that, change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (You better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change

[Bridge]
You gotta get it right
While you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart
You can't close your, your mind
That man, that man (Man in the mirror), that man (Oh yeah)
That man, that man, that man, that man
(I'm asking him to change his ways - you better change)
That man, that man
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

[Outro]
Hoo, hoo, hoo
(Nanana, nanana, nana, nana)
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Gonna feel real good, yeah (Oh yeah)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(Nanana, nanana, nana, nana)
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, shamon (Change)
Just lift yourself
You know it
You've got to stop it yourself (Yeah)
Hoo (Make that change)
I've gotta make that change today
(Man in the mirror)
You got to move, you know it, you know it
Yeah, brother
(Yeah! Make that change!)
Here for the brother
(Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you do
(Yeah! Make that change! Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you do, ooh, oh
(Yeah! Make that change!)
Gonna make that change today, yeah
(Man in the mirror)
Yeah yeah, stand up for me
(Yeah! Make that change!)
Stand up for me
(Man in the mirror)
Stand up for your brother, ah, stand up for it
(Man in the mirror)
'Cause, uh, you know it, you know it, you do, woo
(Yeah! Make that change! Man in the mirror)
Stand up
(Yeah! Make that change!)
Stand up for your sister, stand up for your brother
(Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know
(Change)
Make that change

I love you
I love you
Good night, everybody
Thank you
I'm gonna make that change, shamone
I love you
(Yeah! Make that change! Man in the mirror)
(Yeah! Make that change! Man in the mirror)
(Yeah! Make that change! Man in the mirror)
(Change)

Yeah, yeah I've been trying (Trying), to work through this change
But every day, every day, this shit feel the same
I've been trying (Trying), to work through this pain
But every day, every day, it won't go away
I've been trying, so tell me, who do I call?
Now you're gone, you left me here, I got my back on the wall
I've been trying, so tell me, who do I call?
Now you're gone, you left me here and now I'm losin' control
But I've been trying

[Verse 1]
And now I'm fine, that's
What I keep on tellin' myself every night, and
I got all these problems, I can never justify them
And I know I need help but I don't ever take the time, and
I keep this shit low, low, low, I keep it on silent
You tell me it's gon' do me harm if I keep it inside, man
I won't ever know, know, know, about how they found me
Overthinking all the time, my mind always crowded

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh well, I gotta keep it movin'
Or l'll go crazy, I might just lose it
Crazy and lose my brain
Without you right here, it don't feel the same

[Chorus]
I've been trying (Trying), to work through this change
But every day, every day, this shit feel the same
I've been trying (Trying), to work through this pain
But every day, every day, it won't go away

Now you're gone, you left me here, I got my back on the wall
I've been trying, so tell me, who I do call?
Now you're gone, you left me here and now I'm losin' control
But I've been trying

[Verse 2]
Trying, why in
The fuck do I keep pouring up? I just be wildin'
But fuck it, I don't need no drugs, I'll just be flyin'
Off this Hennessy, maybe you should try it
Lying to myself, yeah, I'm lying to myself
But I don't really care long as in I'm lying in my wealth
Like, how did I get here? No one to blame but myself
But ever since you left, I felt a change in myself, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh well, I gotta keep it movin'
Or l'll go crazy, I might just lose it
Crazy and lose my brain
Without you right here, it don't feel the same

[Chorus]

The warden led the prisoner down the hallway to his doom
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
And I heard him tell the warden just before they reached my cell
Let my guitar playin' friend fill my request

Let him sing me back home a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Sing me away and turn back the year
Sing me home before I die

I recall last Sunday morning when the choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers there's a song my mother sang
Can I hear it before you travel on

Sing me back home a song I used to hear
Make my old memories come alive
Sing me away and turn back the year
Sing me back home before I die

[Verse 1]
Imaginary girlfriend, imaginary whores, imaginary virgins (Virgins)
Imaginary Gods, imaginary evils, protect me with a cross (Cross)
Imaginary senses
Go and fight a war for imaginary vengeance (Vengeance)
My old bitch imaginary pregnant
Guess I'll be a dad with imaginary presents (Presents)
Pockets full of imaginary money, ask me how it feel
I imagine that it's stunning (Stunning)
In my dreams, I imagine that I'm running
Very fast, away from an imaginary something (Something)
Imaginary enemies
Live under my skin with imaginary tendencies (Tendencies)
Meet imaginary Suzie
Killed herself tryna reach imaginary beauty (Beauty)

[Chorus]
Imaginary, imaginary, imaginary, imaginary
Imaginary, imaginary, imaginary, imaginary

[Verse 2]
Imaginary problems
I like to close my eyes and imagine I'm forgotten (Forgotten)
Imagine I belong in this world with the rest of you
Imaginary goblins (Goblins)
Asleep in this imaginary coffin
Finally get a break from my imaginary conscious (Conscious)
Imaginary images
Killed a man in front of these imaginary witnesses (Witnesses)
Imaginary love
Trippin' balls, high off imaginary drugs (Drugs)
Life and its imaginary sequel
Swimming in a sea full of imaginary people (People)
Imaginary lives
We kill each other seeking an imaginary prize (Prize)
God and his imaginary eyes
Watching what we do, I imagine he's surprised (Surprised)

[Chorus]
Imaginary, imaginary, imaginary, imaginary
Imaginary, imaginary, imaginary, imaginary

[Outro]
You sir, is it you?
I forbid you any entrance
There's pinks and blues and flowers and trees
All things you won't be able to enjoy
Where you're going
Because where you're going
Is someplace far from here
Enjoy the ride
Your shoes are untied
Hello to everybody listening to Smile, it's Katy Perry.
I wanna say a very special hello to all of my incredible, beautiful, loyal, encouraging KatyCats all around the world.

Thank you so much for being on this journey with me every single time I put out a record, and for being excited and letting the music, um... work its magic on you, and for showing up at the shows, and all the little places, and for being such an incredible team and a support system that I can always rely on.

I am so incredibly grateful for each and every one of you, and the things that you make online, that make me laugh, and the care that you show, and... all of it, I am so profoundly grateful.

And that's what a lot of this record is: it's, it's a... a record that I never really set out to make, but here we are. You know, after continuing my writing process for 2 years, I would get a little message and just be a vessel for, um... different songs or ideas over the past 2 years, and we had many of them so we felt like, maybe it should be a record. Maybe the record should be called "Smile", and it should be about finding your smile once again.

Um... I don't know about any of you, but sometimes I can feel super low, and alone, and really in my head, and be my own worst enemy, and let that horrible negative voice that trickle, trickles in and out of my, of my head, take over. And, in this past couple of years I've really, um, tried to work on that; and I think a lot of these songs reflect walking through that process, walking through that valley, and coming out the other end alive, and giving live, and, um...

So, I just, I'm so grateful you guys are listening, I, um... I'm excited, I wanna know what your favorite songs are. I have one more song that you're about to hear, um, this song is kind of a funny, sassy song. Definitely don't @ me when you hear it, but thank you once again for listening to all the songs. I hope these songs are encouraging and can lift you out of whatever you're feeling, or give you a little umpfh, or, um... give you whatever you need for today. And if you lost your smile, it helps you find your smile again.

God bless you! I love you.
Since we kissed I never knew the thrills I could have tasted
Since we kissed I never knew the years that I was wasting
But now I know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life?
Oh don't you know that until we touched I never knew the touch was of revealing
Until we touched I never knew my heart was really beating
But now I know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life
Oh where you've been, where you've been

[Solo]
Now don't you know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life
Where have you been, where you've been, where you've been, when I was feeling blue
Where have you been, where you've been, where you've been, when I was needing you
Oh where you've been, where you've been
Where you've been
Darling where have you been all my life

Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh

Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang

And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Have you lost your mind?

We’ll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin’ to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play, 'til I roll over
I’mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin’ to on Oscar day
'specially if she can’t get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn’t rent her, they couldn’t take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, “Get away”
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on

[Bridge]
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the-with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
Fuck with the-with the lights on
Fuck with the lights on
With the- with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the- with the lights on
Fuck- Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the- with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the- with the lights on

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
I guess you think you know the story, you don't
The real one is much too gory
The phony one, the only one you know
Was cooked up years, and years ago
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
And makes to sound all soft and sappy
Just to keep the children happy
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children; zip it; listen

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murciélago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?"
You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?
Stupid, but what the fuck do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

[Chorus: Jon Anderson]
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines
And then they make noise

[Chorus: Jon Anderson]
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]
At the mall, there was a seance
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(Saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

[Chorus: Jon Anderson]
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

All of the lights
All of the lights, all of the lights

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, stripper life
(This copy is for Hype Williams)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
The courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights) Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life, stripper life (All of the lights)

Gettin' mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah

[Chorus: Elly Jackson & Kanye West]
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life and live my life (Yeah)
Just to get off and throw my hands up high

[Verse: Kanye West]
I paid for them titties, get your own
It ain't safe in the city, watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats, she learning a new word, it's 'yacht'
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called, told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors, ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story, True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
I'm a freak, huh?! Rockstar life
The second girl with us, that's our wife
Hey, boys and girls, I got a new riddle
Who's the new old perv that's tryna play second fiddle?
No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money, I put Monie in the middle

[Chorus: Elly Jackson & Kanye West]
I've been waiting for a long, long time (Where she at? In the middle)
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life and live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high, high, high, high

[Refrain 2: Justin Vernon]
Swilling little licks and mixes ’til mornin'
That's warnin', ooh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find
Yeah I always find something wrong

You been putting up with my shit just way too long

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Run away from me, baby, ah, run away
Run away from me, baby
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
Then, run away
Babe, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can
Run away from me, baby, run away
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
Run away from me, baby
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
Why can't she just, run away?
Baby, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus: Kanye West]

Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags

Run away fast as you can

I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time

I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still, down the time

[Chorus: Kanye West & Justin Vernon]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
I'm building a still, to slow down the time
Down for the night, said she’s down for the night
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
Slow down the time (Ooohh)
I'm lost in the world, lost in the world, been down on my life
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
I'm building a still, to slow down the time
Down for the—

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
Run from the lights, run from the night, run for your life
I'm new in the city, down for the night
I'm new in the city, run from the night, down for the night, down for the night

[Chorus: Kanye West & Justin Vernon]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
I'm building a still, to slow down the time
Down for the night, down for the night

[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Gil Scott Heron & Kanye West]
Ooohh Ooohh Ooohh Ooohh
Who will survive in America? (Ooohh)

Who will survive in America?

I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind

I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
I'm building a still, to slow down the time
Run from the night, for of your time

[Outro: Gil Scott Heron]
Us living as we do upside down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's hole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys. America stripped
For bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes. The signs of Truth
Were tattooed across our often-entered vagina
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter
Of the mother country whose legs
Were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom: free doom
Democracy, liberty, and justice were
Revolutionary code names that preceded
The bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
Bubbling in the mother country's crotch
And behold a baby girl was born
Nurtured by slave holders and whitey racists
It grew and grew and grew screwing
Indiscriminately like mother, like daughter
Everything unplagued by her madame mother
The present mocks us, good Black people
With keen memories set fire to the bastards
Who ask us in a whisper to melt and integrate
Young, very young, teeny
Bopping revolt on weekend young dig
By proxy what a mental ass kicking
They receive through institutionalized everything
And vomit up slogans to stay out of Vietnam
They seek to hide their relationship with the world's prostitute
Alienating themselves from everything
Except dirt and money with long hair, grime, and dope
To camo-hide the things that cannot be hidden
They become runaway children to walk the streets downtown with everyday
Black people sitting on the curb
Crying because we know that they will go back
Home with a clear conscience and a college degree
The irony of it all, of course
Is when a pale face SDS motherfucker dares
Look hurt when I tell him to go find his own revolution
He wonders why I tell him that America's revolution
Will not be the melting pot but the toilet bowl
He is fighting for legalized smoke, or lower voting age
Less lip from his generation gap and fucking in the street
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
Where is my parallel to that?
All I want is a good home and a wife and a children
And some food to feed them every night
Back goes pale face to basics
Does Little Orphan Annie have a natural?
Do Sluggo's kinks make him a refugee from Mandingo?
What does Webster's say about soul?
I say you silly trite motherfucker, your great grandfather
Tied a ball and chain to my balls
And bounced me through a cotton field
While I lived in an unflushable toilet bowl
And now you want me to help you overthrow what?
The only Truth that can be delivered to a four year
Revolutionary with a hole card i.e. skin is this:
Fuck up what you can in the name of
Piggy Wallace, Dickless Nixon, and Spiro Agnew
Leave brother Cleaver and Brother Malcolm alone please
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it; Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool"
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever; who has it?
You blowin' up, that’s good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: "What you gon' do now?"
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
That's the monster with the flows, monster with the shows
Monster with clothes, monster with the hoes
Buy 'em new heels just to keep 'em on they toes
Keep it Dru Hill, five steps from the door
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
And then they make noise

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it

Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, "Dutty Wine" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Outro: Bon Iver]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide

And I'll, I'll let God decide (no)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

Uh, uh
I love it though
I love it though, y'know?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions, oh, she do it
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She {?} her make up, and casually allure
Text message break ups, the casualty of tour
The money dreams take up everything I'm dreaming of
I got the {?}, what am I leaving off?
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
{?} Why you frontin like you want it, huh?
{?} summertime

[Chorus: Kanye West]
{?} to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the constellations
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When the sun go down, it's the magic hour
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
And it's a million colors {?} fill up the skies
You got money on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme", not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me? Could you be more phony?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
(This copy is for Hype Williams)

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield & Pete Rock]
Add a little sugar (Ow!), honeysuckle and (Woo!)
A great big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't miss (Uh-huh) with a dozen roses
(Mr. West) Such would astound you
(Pete Rock) The joy of children laughing around you
(Uh) These are all the makings of you (Woo!)

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Pete Rock]
Pete Rock, hit me one time
I give 'em my life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine
They wanna give me gray skies, get me drunk
Get me high, get me something to get me by
I gave her a handshake, only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now there’s crumbs all over the damn place (Uh-huh)
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood Planned Parenthood
'Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won’t make it to the family will
If I don’t make it, can’t take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they don’t know how insanity feel
Don C. just had a shorty, so it’s not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield & Pete Rock]
Add a little sugar (Woo!), honeysuckle and (Come on)
A great big expression of happiness (Ow!)
Boy, you couldn't miss (Uh) with a dozen roses
(Kanye) Such would astound you
(Pete Rock) The joy of children laughing around you
(Uh) These are all the makings of you (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
No electro, no metro, a little retro, ahh, perfecto
You know the demo, your boy act wild
You ain't get the memo? Yeezy’s back in style
Now one room got Gidget—the other got Bridget
What’s more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters
Nah, you ain't listen; they black—they sistas
They mama named 'em after white bitches
So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelry’s Egyptian, know the hunger’s Ethiopian
Stupid questions like, "Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?"
This beat deserves Hennessy
A bad bitch, and a bag of weed: the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life’s cursed? Well, mine’s an obscenity

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield & Pete Rock]
Add a little sugar (Ow!), honeysuckle and (Uh-huh)
A great big expression of happiness (Woo!)
Boy, you couldn't miss (Uh) with a dozen roses
(Uh-huh) Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you (Woo!)
These are all the makings of you

[Interlude: Kid Cudi & Pete Rock]
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now
Don’t let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (One-two, okay)
Don’t let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (One-two, okay)
Don’t let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now, yeah
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye; one-two, when you don't, shit
And you do when you can, one-two when I wanna
And you— and don't stop, oh

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield & Pete Rock]
Add a little sugar (Ow!), honeysuckle and (Come on)
A great big expression of happiness (Yeah)
Boy, you couldn't miss (Ah) with a dozen roses
(We did it) Such would astound you (Let's go; let's)
The joy of children laughing around you (Let's)
(Ah!) These are all the makings of you

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
30,000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

[Chorus: Kanye West & CyHi The Prynce]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yuugh!

[Chorus: Kanye West & CyHi The Prynce]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes (yeah)
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous (CyHi)
Fucking ridiculous
Yeah

[Verse 3: CyHi The Prynce]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[Chorus: Kanye West, CyHi The Prynce, RZA]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, you know this shit is fucking ridiculous

[Intro]
Whose fault?

[Chorus]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Bridge]
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

[Chorus]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
And not because I love fighting you for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
For one day for sure you dun-nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh

[Verse 1]
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else" (someone else, someone else, someone else)
I took a piss and dismiss and up
And I went and found somebody else (else, else)
Fuck arguing and harvesting the moment
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self (self, self)
Till about two o'clock and I call back
And it's opening up with something I'm dealt (dealt)

[Chorus]
And I just seem to play the blame game, I love you more
And take us up, dun-nuh-nuh-nuh, for sure
And call names, names, I hate you no
There isn't anything I could do, to hold right on to the thought

[Verse 2]
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been an over too long since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this kind of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine

[Chorus]
And play the blame game, I love you more
And take this up, right outside the door
And call names, names, I hate you, hoe
I can feel something like this right outside the door

[Chorus: Kanye West & ???]
I'm probably always be by your side, oh
I-I'll always be by your side, though
(You and I will always be)
I'm probably always be by your side, oh
I-I'll always be by your side, though

[VERSE 1]

[Beck]
Welcome to the land of the prominent sun
Where the flowers aren't melted and the future is fun
The freeway 

[?]
Oh I'm feeling so good
And one way trip back to west Hollywood
Let's go

[Chorus]
Feels so good to have a perfect soul
It feels so good to be in total control
It feel so good to have a perfect soul
It feels so good to be in total control

[VERSE 2]

[2D]
There were spotlights flying through the sky
From a winter wonderland, catching out
The bees fighting in the clouds
No future, Batman
Done before Christmas
Not very likely
One hundred million viagra tablets
Stored in a warehouse in a valley

[Chorus]
Feels so good to have a perfect soul (uh huh)
It feels so good to be in total control (uh huh)
It feel so good to have a perfect soul (uh huh)
It feels so good to be in total control (uh huh)

[VERSE 3]

[Beck]
It's so convincing
But something's missing
The sun is kissing my face and erasing my doubts
I'm going out with a bang and the fangs of a parasite
I'm feeling alright alright all night alright alright alright alright

[2D]
I'll take two dreams, etcetera and forever
I hope
Said no one

[Beck]
She's a plastic Cleopatra on a throne of ice
She's a 

[?] with a dying battery life
Candy coloured fingers and 

[?] eyes
Thinking airbrushed thoughts with a logo on her mind
It's so delightful
It's so enciteful
It's so frightful
Feeling it every single fucking day
It's time to party, it's time to party

[2D]
In the valley where you wake up every beautiful day
And the world you created in your image is golden

[?] oh the light is so bright
You can feel like a pagan, you can feel like a pagan
In the valley (x6)

Feel like a pagan

[Verse 1: Beck]
Welcome to the land of the permanent sun
Where the flowers are melted and the future is fun
The freeway lizards are feeling so good
On a one-way trip back to West Hollywood, let's go

[Chorus: 2-D & Beck]
It feels so good to have a perfect song
It feels so good to be in total control
It feels so good to have a perfect song
It feels so good to be in total control

[Verse 2: 2-D]
There was spotlights flying through the sky
From the winter wonderland, catching out
The bees hiding in the grounds, no future Batman
Long before Christmas, not very likely
One-hundred million Viagra tablets
Stored in a warehouse… in the valley

[Chorus: 2-D & Beck]
It feels so good to have a perfect song (Uh-huh)
It feels so good to be in total control (Uh-huh)
It feels so good to have a perfect song (Uh-huh)
It feels so good to be in total control (Uh-huh)

[Bridge: Beck]
It's so convincing, but something's missing
The sun is kissing my face and erasing my doubts
I'm going out with a bang, and the fangs of a parasite
I'm feeling alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

[Bridge: 2-D]
Untainted dreams, et cetera and forever
I hope, said no one

[Verse 3: Beck]
She's a plastic Cleopatra on a throne of ice
She's a hemophiliac with a dying battery life
Candy-colored fingers and Schadenfreude eyes
Thinking airbrushed thoughts with the logo on her mind

[Bridge: Beck]
It's so delightful, it's so insightful
It's so frightful, and I'm feeling it
Every single fucking day-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
It's time to party
It's time to party (Woo)

[Refrain: 2-D]
In the valley where you wake up every beautiful day
And the world you created in your image is golden
In a valley made of mirrors, oh, the light is so bright
You can feel like a Pagan, you can feel like a Pagan
In the valley where you wake up every beautiful day
And the world you created in your image is golden
In a valley made of mirrors, oh, the light is so bright
You can feel like a Pagan, you can feel like a Pagan

[Outro: 2-D & Beck]
In the valley (Feel like a pagan)
Yeah, I live in the valley
In the valley (Feel like a pagan)
I heard there's a good shaman out in the desert
In the valley (Feel like a pagan)
Getting really transcendental and hiking
In the valley (Feel like a pagan, feel like a pagan)

[Intro: Male Voice LL Cool J Alicia Myers]
Eh yo L! L! Check this out
I know you doing out all thinin' thing, right?
But I was talkin' to Suga Daddy
He said "Why don't you do somethin' for the culture?"
"Why don't you ring it back to the Bentleys"
"That old school club, not the car."
By the way, can I hold your show?
Got applause for the liquors that ain't here
We said some when the people caught up to the struggle
Yeah. Bottom to the top
But we ain't forget you
Let's ride
I've been tryna find my way
Not with all this hurt and pain
I try to bread in that and all the high...
Machines

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
This one for those who feel ignored
My man, Rockstarr getting hit at the board
People boostin' the stores that they can't afford
For my grandmother tellin' me to "Remember the lord"
For all my gangsta that died by the sword
We use to smoke blunt to the back of Encore
Drive up town, I like ten cars or more
Tryin' to see some that we never seen before
For them kids in new town, and new gun laws
That would easily pass if that kid was yours
These are the side effects, what's the cause?
At a minimum, we got to put the sh*t on pause
I'm belling you
Cause I'm cravin for some food cravin for some food and I figure you
Can serve me dinner in bed dinner in bed On the menu there is so much
I can choose so much I can choose and i know that
You will do your best to keep me fed you'll keep me fed
You give me beautiful delicious food for thought delicious food
For thought and the tastebuds
Vibrate all up in my head
I'm the spider and you're the one I caught you're the one
I caught We're tangled in my web on the
Spread in my bed dinner in bed oishi nee
Oishi nee dinner in bed
Dinner in bed Oishi nee
Oishi nee Oishi nee
Oishi nee Dinner in bed, Dinner in bed Oishi nee
Oishi nee
I smell the fragrance and my body feels
The heat body feels the heat you take me on a trip and
I'm never misled never misled
I can't get enough of this fresh and raw meat
Fresh and raw meat a perfect example of the menu
I read the menu we shared
Appetizer, main course and some dessert course and some dessert
I've had my meal
I've had my dinner in bed dinner in bed Oishi nee
Dinner in bed Oishi nee
Oishi nee Oishi nee
Oishi nee Dinner in bed, Dinner in bed Oishi nee
Oishi nee Only the black widow
Knows the true purpose of Cupid's arrows

My darkest hours
My darkest hours

[Verse 1]
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

[Verse 2]
Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

[Bridge]
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home

[Chorus]
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no

[Verse 1]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why?
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Post-Chorus]
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Verse 2]
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Bridge]
Oh, whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are not alone, I am here with you)
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
(Though you're far away, you and me)
But you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are always in my heart)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh)

[Outro]
You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh!
Together, together
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
You believe in me!
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
Not alone, oh!
I’d like to buy the world a home
And furnish it with love
Grow apple trees
And honey bees
And snow white turtle doves
I’d like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
I’d like to buy the world a Coke
And keep it company

It’s the real thing
What the world needs today
I’d like to buy the world a Coke
And keep it company
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
A Monday morning you meet me at the hotel, and
You bought me coffee just to spill it on yourself
But you never take things seriously
It's kinda why I like you so much, honestly
And I wrote a note and left it folded in your pocket
You taped it to your wall in your New York apartment
Kissing in the taxi cab
'Til the driver gives us dirty looks back

[Chorus]
Oh, it's L-O-V-E, or something like that
You're crazy, but it's not in a bad way
Dancing on the highway
You make me feel older than seventeen
Yeah, this is L-O-V-E, or something really close
Hey, baby, I think you're really dope
I honestly don't know why
I should ever leave your side
'Cause this is love, right?

[Intro]
La, la, la-la, la

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own (Uh)
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes (Your ropes)
Forever and ever, no more (No more)

[Pre-Chorus]
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true (Yeah, yeah)
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (Loved by you)

[Post-Chorus]
La, la, la-la, la

[Verse 2]
She got her hair pulled back 'cause the sweat's drippin' off of her face (Her face)
Said, "It ain't so bad if I wanna make a couple mistakes"
You should know right now that I never stay put in one place
Forever and ever, no more (No more)

[Pre-Chorus]
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true (Yeah)
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)

[Bridge]
Oh
I don't hide blurry eyes like you
Like you

[Chorus]
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, you know
I don't need to be loved by you
See his hands 'round my waist, thought you'd never be replaced, baby
Ooh, you know it's true (Yeah)
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (Yeah)

[Outro]
La, la, la-la, la
La, la
You know it's true, you know it's true
Loved by you

[Chorus]
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill, yeah

[Verse 1]
Jimmy pulls up in his blue Chevy Nova
I have been dyin' for him to come over
I'm in my party dress, he say "You such a mess"
I am the New Jersey dance queen
He is the gangster action king
He knows that I be selling the body
My man the best 'cause he knows what’s up

[Pre-Chorus]
He knows it's a big bad world
Knows that I'm a good girl
He understands the sale of self
'Cause cash comes quick when looks can kill

[Chorus]
And there's nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill, yeah

[Verse 2]
J is a romantic roller coaster
He don't do anything he's supposed to
I like 'em tough and mean
Jim is the worst that I've ever seen
I am the trailer park darling
He is the one-time comeback king
He knows that I be looking to die
He said "Baby, pay respect to the high"

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not invincible
But cash come quick when looks can kill

[Chorus]
And there's nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

[Bridge]
I like your ultraviolent swing
I like it when you treat me mean
You turn my mood from black to blue
Ruby Tuesdays at Citgo
I loved you then, you'll always know
I loved you then, you'll always know

[Chorus]
But there's nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

Ooh yeah

(Hannah be free)
When a shot turns a stare
Into a smile
And a smile slips off the strap
From her dress
(Hannah be free)
She has no confidence
She fears His holiness
Her life is nothing but a test
(Hannah be free)
Cause the Bible commands her to resist the things she most appreciates
(Hannah be free)
So she hides all her demons with her makeup
Hoping that he'll open the gates

[Chorus]
Hannah be free
(Be free) Free
Free
(Hannah why won't you listen to me)
Hannah be free

Ooh Hannah
Why don't you meet my friend Evelyn
(Evelyn's free)
Her lips are cold
High heels open toes
Shes hardly wearing any clothes
(Evelyn's free)
She's got her confideant
Her friend don't like men
But does what Evelyn says
(Evelyn's free)
And right beside her bedside
In a miniskirt that isn't ever hers
(Evelyn's free)
They may call it the bedside
It's the only side I hope she preserves

[Chorus]
Evelyn's Free (So free)
Free
Free
Oh Evelyn, Hannah why don't you be like Evelyn

Don’t bring your gun there
Don’t bother bother me

[Verse 2]
I’m not on seven, I’m on eleven
The difference is kinda like Devon and Yemen
When I go Oman I say "Yeah Man"
I open up a club and fill it strictly full of woman
My mama go to church she says "Amen"
She also says "Why are men teaming up with Demon?"
I love all men they all take me heaven
I can’t keep myself in check like a Mormon

[Hook]
Baby got back, I got front

You got some junk, throw it in the bank
You think you get this but this ain’t what you think

Laughing all the way to the bank
For all y’all boys cheap talking

Police chalkin’, my flow’s needing markers
You so flea market, so don’t be startin’
Cause Cole retarded, I be shittin’ on you boys
And my throat be fartin’, and won’t even say excuse
Usually, the groupies don’t amuse me
Wanna say I raped her, take my paper, yeah my loose leaf
But could I take a little dip in your jacuzzi?
I ain’t baby but I got you feelin’ juicy
Oo she, feeling like she never before
And I bet she’ll never forget like an elephant won’t
Ayo, my name J. Cole I got a hellavuh flow

Or if you tryna be rich, in this economy? Shit..
Anything making money, this is quality is

Empty spaces - what are we living for?
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for...

Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?

The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?

I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the...
On with the show
The show must go on

[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
I've been thinkin' 'bout ya lately
Reminiscin', goin' crazy
Miss the way your kiss would keep me up
Ayy, wish that you were here tonight
Drinkin' vodka soda, extra limes
And we could just get back to bein' us

[Chorus: Kane Brown]
'Cause I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah

[Verse 2: Kane Brown]
Do you ever think about
The days we couldn't live without each other?
Where the hell did we go wrong?
Ayy, how'd we go from that to this?
How'd we let a good thing slip?
Do we really have to go move on?

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Nelly]
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah (Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, cool again
I really wish that I was kickin' back with you again
Atop the penthouse, somewhere checkin' out the view again
'Cause every time we do it, it's like new again, it feels like new again
Do I need you so?
I'm missin' all that body
Oh, the head to toe
Can't somebody, anybody, tell me? Oh
I just need to ask 'em, "Where the love did go?"
I just wanna be (Cool again, cool again, cool again, cool again)

[Chorus: Kane Brown, Nelly, Kane Brown & Nelly]
'Cause I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again (Cool again, ayy)
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers (Oh)
All tangled in each other nights (Ayy), still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah

[Outro: Kane Brown & Nelly]
Let go

Y'all know that I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again (Cool again)
Mast summer with you (Cool again, cool again, cool again)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & JID]
You should've been downtown (Word)
The people are rising (For real?)
We thought it was a lockdown (What? Yeah)
They opened the fire (Man)
Them bullets was flyin' (Ooh)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie (Ugh, look)

[Verse 1: JID]
It's a war going on outside, I swear to God
I'm on the front line, no front, no cap, no fun-size
Sunshine, cinnamon skin
People blend in together and ride side by side, organized
We bust guns at the same time, harmonize (Ooh-ooh)
Form a line, pick a lead, take a leap
Lead with love, please, you sound like Dr. King
People tired of taking beatings from beasts covered in sheets
I love niggas, but we too forgiving for how they treating us
Reparations, bit', we tryna get even
Just run the paper maybe, then we can start the conversation
Common ground, prison compounds full of my fuckin' people
How you still sleepin'? Have you had your coffee this evening, Karen?
'Cause you seem a little off
All the black girls missin' and endin' up inside the coffins
But you mad when they hashtag "BlackLivesMatter" on front your sidewalk
Diabolical thoughts, diatribe from dialogues
Damaging images of men and women who died off
Fighting for civil rights, a simple necessity
Given when you given life, but we been trippin'? Right (Skrrt)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You should've been downtown (Ooh)
The people are rising (Ah)
We thought it was a lockdown (Shit)
They opened the fire (Bah, bah, ooh-wee)
Them bullets was flying (Lockdown)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie
(We ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to)

[Post-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Downtown, where I got popped with the rubber bullet
Trey-pound, got it in my name now, I'ma shoot it

[Verse 2: Noname]
Uh, maybe this round two
Government cinematic, American drive-thru
Eat their apple pie in the morning then bury the strange fruit
Then marry the strange fruit and call it the Black love
So when he bleeds, I bleed, the sacred riddle
Ain't no money I can make to make the cops get little
We seen 'em murder the indigenous, the Passage Middle
The Constitution, a life for a bag of Skittles
So when we bleed, I load the sacred pistol
And if you need, I'll read Assata with you
And if you rich, I pray that God forgive you
Supposed to share the garden, grow the Holy in you
Maybe everything is a metaphor, one God
An African liberation is ready to take arms
They telling you, "Stay calm," they double-barrel the shotty
And stand on a graveyard and tell you to slave on

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Downtown (Down)
The people are rising (Look around)
We thought it was a lockdown (Shit, lockdown)
They opened the fire (Had to get low, fire)
Them bullets was flying (Down, down)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie (Ooh—)

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Turn on your tube, dawg, look how they do us
Knee on our necks, bullets in backs, stimulus checks
Strictly for Blacks? History repeating
People scared to eat a chicken, everybody going vegan
What they put in it?
Look at the world we living in, they got us shook in it
You go on your jog, then your color might get you took in it
Man in the mirror, don't look away, you better look at it
Black lives matter, so what it means when they shoot at it?
Generation, genocide, what happened to enterprise?
Heard the man infiltrated, Black Panther, re-energize
Nothin' to figure out, they tryna kill us out
If I take a kneel, see my fist, I'm a killer now?
Just think, bullshit you gotta filter out
Are you really ready for the smoke like a Swishahouse?
Ready for the revolution, who ready to ride?
It won't be televised, so tell me, who ready to die?
Know the difference from a 'pan' and a 'plan'demic
Just a bunch of bullshit, how we land in it?
You either fall for anything or you stand in it
It's a lot going on on this damn mission
Big B.G. used to sell microchips
Now he out here pushing vaccines?
It's 'bout to be another lockdown
Feelin' like D.C., fuck you mean?

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Downtown (Down)
The people are risin' (Look around)
We thought it was a lockdown (Lockdown)
They opened the fire (Had to get low, fire)
Them bullets was flyin' (Down, down)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie (Ooh-wee)

[Post-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to
Downtown, where I got popped with the rubber bullet
Trey-pound, got it in my name now (Uh), I'ma shoot it
Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to
Downtown

[Outro]
Citizens of Los Angeles
I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly
And in the name of the people of the State of California
I command all those assembled
Right here
On Lomitas Avenue
(Let's go, let's go)
Come on, right here

[Verse]
(Citizens of Los Angeles)
(I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly)
(And in the name of the people of the State of California)
(Command all those assembled, right here)
Let's go, let's go (What the fuck, come on)
The destroy-let's go

[Chorus]
You should've been downtown (Word)
The people are risin' (For real?)
We thought it was a lockdown (What?)
They opened the fire (Damn)
Them bullets was flyin' (Ooh)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie

[Verse 1]
Oh my
Time heals all, but you out of time now (Now)
Judge gotta watch us from the clock tower (True)
Lil' tear gas cleared the whole place out
I'll be back with the hazmat for the next round
We was tryna protest, then the fires broke out
Look out for the secret agents, they be planted in the crowd
Said, "It's civil unrest," but you sleep so sound
Like you don't hear the screams when we catchin' beatdowns?
Stayin' quiet when they killin' niggas, but you speak loud
When we riot, got opinions comin' from a place of privilege
Sicker than the COVID how they did him on the ground
Speakin' of the COVID, is it still goin' around?
And won't you tell me 'bout the lootin'? What's that really all about?
'Cause they throw away black lives like paper towels
Plus unemployment rate, what, forty million now?
Killed a man in broad day, might never see a trial
We just wanna break chains like slaves in the South
Started in the North End but we in the downtown
Riot cops tried to block, now we got a showdown
(Citizens of Los Angeles) Down
(I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly)
(And in the name of the people of the State of California)

[Chorus]
You should've been downtown (Command all those assembled)
The people are risin' (Right here)
We thought it was a lockdown
They opened the fire (Ooh)
Them bullets was flyin'
(Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop because they tell us to)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie

[Post-Chorus]
And downtown, where I got popped with the rubber bullet
Tre pound, got it in my name now, I'ma shoot it

[Verse 2]
Uh, okay
Never understand why they do it
Someone cut the channel off the news 'fore I lose it (Nah)
I ain't even trippin', if you wit' it, then we lootin' (Nah)
Help me put this Louis in the back of Suzuki (Ooh), o-he
Had to break it down so smoothly (Smooth)
They gon' say, "It's not about race," but we movin' (Fuckin') ho, power
Copped the tre pound, had to put that in my name
Wish a nigga play now (Yeah)
Any given day, I'll be headed to the pulpits (Yeah)
Say a lil' prayer, matter fact, I need two of 'em, ooh
Won't he do it? Won't he do it?
Ooh, this ain't '92 so we into new rules
Niggas got hip, so we don't loot the projects
'Bout to hit Rodeo with my lil' cousin Marcus
Someone threw a whole brick in the Neiman Marcus (Ah)
Help me put the whole mannequin in the Charger

[Chorus]
You should've been downtown (Down)
The people are risin' (Look around)
We thought it was a lockdown (Lockdown)
They opened the fire (Had to get low, fire)
Them bullets was flyin' (Down, down)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie (Ooh-wee)

[Post-Chorus]
Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to
Downtown, where I got popped with the rubber bullet
Tre pound (Uh), got it in my name now, I'ma shoot it
Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to
Downtown

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You should've been downtown (Word)
The people are risin' (For real?)
We thought it was a lockdown (What?)
They opened the fire (Damn)
Them bullets was flyin' (Ooh)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Oh my
Time heals all, but you out of time now (Now)
Judge gotta watch us from the clock tower (True)
Lil' tear gas cleared the whole place out
I'll be back with the hazmat for the next round
We was tryna protest, then the fires broke out
Look out for the secret agents, they be planted in the crowd
Said, "It's civil unrest," but you sleep so sound
Like you don't hear the screams when we catchin' beatdowns?
Stayin' quiet when they killin' niggas, but you speak loud
When we riot, got opinions comin' from a place of privilege
Sicker than the COVID how they did him on the ground
Speakin' of the COVID, is it still goin' around?
And won't you tell me 'bout the lootin'? What's that really all about?
'Cause they throw away black lives like paper towels
Plus unemployment rate, what, forty million now?
Killed a man in broad day, might never see a trial
We just wanna break chains like slaves in the South
Started in the North End but we in the downtown
Riot cops tried to block, now we got a showdown
(Citizens of Los Angeles) Down
(I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly)
(And in the name of the people of the State of California)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You should've been downtown (Command all those assembled)
The people are risin' (Right here)
We thought it was a lockdown
They opened the fire (Ooh)
Them bullets was flyin'
(Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop because they tell us to)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Turn on your tube dawg, look how they do us
Knee on our necks, bullets in backs
Stimulus checks strictly for blacks?
History repeatin', people scared to eat a chicken
Everybody goin' vegan, what they put in it?
Look at the world we livin' in, they got it shook
And then you go on your jog, then your color might get you took
And yet the man in the mirror, can’t look away, you gotta look at it
Black Lives Matter, so what it means when they shoot at it?
Generation, genocide, what happened to enterprise?
Heard the man infiltrated, Black Panther, re-energize
Ain’t nothin' to figure out, they tryna kill us out
If I take a kneel, see my fist? I’m a killer now
Just think, bullshit, you gotta filter out
Are you really ready for the smoke like a Swisher house?
Ready for the revolution, who ready to ride? It won’t be televised
So tell me, who ready to die? If downtown goin' up
Where we at with the shits? We at the liquor store, nigga
‘Bout to get us a fifth, know they 'bout to start lootin’
Grab the gloves and masks, watch out for them tanks
When they rollin' past, yeah, ahaha

[Verse 3: Anderson .Paak]
Uh, okay
Never understand why they do it
Someone cut the channel off the news 'fore I lose it (Nah)
I ain't even trippin', if you wit' it, then we lootin' (Nah)
Help me put this Louis in the back of Suzuki (Ooh), o-he
Had to break it down so smoothly (Smooth)
They gon' say, "It's not about race," but we movin' (Fuckin') ho, power

[Post-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to
Downtown, where I got popped with the rubber bullet
Tre pound (Uh), got it in my name now, I'ma shoot it
Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to
Downtown

[Intro]
I know what she want, I know what she like
I know what she want, I know what she like, yeah
I know what she want, I know what she like
I know what she want, I know what she like

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Well, this that long night, raw white
Shit that keep your jaw tight
Godlike, not Christ but always keep the sauce right
Top flight, all ice, give these bitches frostbite
I'm gone, they be holdin’ on longer than a dog bite
I'm born light
Nausea with some pretty little blonde dykes
Tried to keep my hands clean and my socks white
Mob life, do your job right, keep your squad tight
And we can ball, live a long life, shit, it's alright
The whiskey on ice never made my wrongs right
But in a bar fight, I hit ’em with the hard right
I roll the dice, play my cards right
Ain't a movie star, but I'm sparrin' with the Dark Knight
I'm too far, gettin' yards like Favre might
Higher than a Mars flight when this cigar light up like the star bright
I work hard, so the car nice
You doin' right, it's all mine when the card swipes

[Chorus]
Oh, you special, anybody ever told you? (Told you)
Ooh, you so special, has anybody ever told you? (Told you)
Do they know you so special? (I know what she want, I know what she like)
You so special (I know what she want, I know what she like)
You so special (I know what she want, I know what she like)
You so special (I know what she want, I know what she like)
Yeah (I know what she want, I know what she like)
I know what she want, I know what she like
I know what she want, I know what she like, yeah, yeah
I know what she want, I know what she like

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Well, I was born with a bored mind, chip on my shoulder
A sword and a war cry, I’ve been a soldier
Fight the horns for the Lord’s side
Before five I was fresh out the store fly, with a bitch courtside
Tint the windows by the doors, let the four ride
Speakers knockin', they can hear me in the north side
And I keeps the liquor pourin’ 'til the storm dry
The haters said I wouldn't make it 'til the pork fly
These days, got a lot of dick to swallow
They rather me hit the follow than hit the lotto
It’s like my trip on auto-pilot, 'til tomorrow I been chillin'
You way behind the wave, you at the shoreline
I'm Walter if it's Disney, Arnie Palmer when I hit green
The ganja in the '60s, I'm Obama if it's this week
The God inside my city, the monster in your kid's dream
Bottle of the whiskey got my head feelin' like, shit
The first dollar in your piggy bank
I'ma drink away until my liver break
Yeah, one in a million like findin' love on a Tinder date
Livin' great, swear I'm Justin Timberlake
Sharp as scissor blades or winter skates
I been in the kitchen like Minute Maid
And these bitches on my dick parades
But I leave 'em quicker than a lizard's legs
Oh well, they love me like I'm Nick Lachey
Triple play, in your face, fuck 'em all, give 'em AIDS
I eliminate then go away on Christmas break
I ain't dealin' wit' your shit today
You're gettin' finished like a dinner plate
Or a Philly steak

[Chorus]
Oh, you special, anybody ever told you? (Told you)
Ooh, you so special, has anybody ever told you? (Told you)
Do they know you so special? (I know what she want, I know what she like)
You so special (I know what she want, I know what she like)
You so special (I know what she want, I know what she like)
You so special (I know what she want, I know what she like)
Yeah (I know what she want, I know what she like)
I know what she want, I know what she like
I know what she want, I know what she like, yeah, yeah
I know what she want, I know what she like

[Intro]
This is, uh, this is very very old: 1974, we're going to now. You have to imagine: lots of hair, more makeup than I've got on, much more makeup... what else? What shall I put on tonight? Nothing on, same old clothes, Emperor's New Clothes in this song; all about watching video to try to understand how to do sex. What a ridiculous subject for a song, it's called "Drive-In Saturday"

[Verse 1]
(Do-doo-ah)
Let me put my arms around your head
(Do-doo-ah)
It don't matter, here instead 

[?]
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh, Babe, it'll be alright
(Do-doo-ah)
Pour me out another phone
(Do-doo-ah)
We'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book, we can read up alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw

[Chorus]
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her head away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
(Drive-in Saturday)

[Verse 2]
Jung the foreman prays at work
(Do-doo-ah)
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
Hard enough to keep formation
Amid this fall out saturation
(Do-doo-ah)
Cursing at the Astronette
(Do-doo-ah)
That stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The bureau Supply for ageing men

[Pre-Chorus]
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Where once had raged the sea that rages no more
Like the video films we saw

[Chorus]
His name was always Buddy
(Do-doo-ah)
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
(Do-doo-ah)
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
(Do-doo-ah)
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
(Do-doo-ah)
It's a drive-in Saturday
(Drive-in Saturday)

[Outro]
Saturday
Sat-sat-sat-sat-saturday
It's a
Yes a, yes a, yes a Saturday
Drive-in Saturday
Drive-in Saturday
Drive-in Saturday
Thank you very much

[Verse 1]
Question time that says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
Seems that I've blackened the family name
My mother says that she can't stand the neighbours talking
I've gotta pack my bags, leave this home, start walking
I'm guilty, I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime

[Chorus]
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me

[Verse 2]
Remember when we used to go to church on Sundays?
I lay awake at night, terrified of school on Mondays
It's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again

[Chorus]
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me

[Bridge]
As I pass a recreation ground
Remember my friends, always been found and I can't

[Chorus]
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me

[Verse 3]
Now I leave them all in the never never land
The station seems so cold, the ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name, "Hi, Dave
Drop in, see around, come back
If you're this way again"
I'm on my own, I've got a long long way to go
Hope I make it on my own

[Chorus]
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

[Outro]
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me (I can't help thinking about me)
Can't help thinking about me (I can't help thinking about me)
Can't help thinking about me (I can't help thinking about me)
Can't help thinking about me (I can't help thinking about me)
Can't help

[Prelude 1: Cadenza]
Ooh, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ooh, ye-ye-yeah!
Ooh, ah, ooh
...BLAZERS BLAZERS!

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
If I talk too much, I say less
I'll give you my word, I play less
So forget about you, I'm careless
When I put you through my sight, I'm fearless
When I offer you flowers like a florist
I know my intentions not the purest
I'm new to this, not a tourist
For the judgment, I don't need a tourist

[Pre-Chorus: M.I.A. & *Cadenza]
If you got the key, show me where the door is
And I'm going through something, hope you notice
You might not see it on the surface
But I'm tryna live my life with a purpose (*BLAZERS BLAZERS!)

[Chorus: M.I.A. & *Cadenza]
Oh, amen, ball again
My body is my temple, my mind I keep it zen
Oh, amen, here we go again
I'm praying for my sins, and I won't cheat again (*BLAZERS BLAZERS!)

[Verse 2: M.I.A. & *Cadenza]
These modern day prophets
Ain't no matter what they promise
I been the richest and the poorest
Here living in this concrete forest
I know what it is to have success
And it ain't all about the ways that I can flex
And I try to live my life with no stress
Living in the light that's my address (*BLAZERS BLAZERS!)

[Pre-Chorus: M.I.A. & *Cadenza]
If you got the key, show me where the door is
And I'm going through something, hope you notice
You might not see it on the surface
But I'm tryna live my life with a purpose (*BLAZERS BLAZERS!)

[Chorus: M.I.A. & *Cadenza]
Oh, amen, ball again
My body is my temple, my mind I keep it zen
Oh, amen, here we go again
I'm praying for my sins, I hope we meet again (*BLAZERS BLAZERS!)

[Verse 3: M.I.A. & *Cadenza]
They say we're lustful creatures, and I'm hunting gods off till we 

[?]
Can you forgive me like Jesus, from the feeling insecure or jealous
In my baggy jeans and the headdress, on my knees begging, I'm tryna confess
Is there a certain set of things to tempt us?
Is the heat always relentless?

[Pre-Chorus: M.I.A. & *Cadenza]
If you got the key, show me where the door is
And I'm going through something, hope you notice
You might not see it on the surface
But I'm tryna live my life with a purpose (*BLAZERS BLAZERS!)

[Chorus: M.I.A. & *Cadenza]
Oh, amen, ball again
My body is my temple, my mind I keep it zen
Oh, amen, here we go again
I'm praying for my sins, I hope we meet again

[Prelude 2: Cadenza]
Ooh, ah, ooh
Ooh, ah, ooh, ye-ye-yeah!
Ooh, ah, ooh, ye-ye-yeah!
Burning alive like you set me on fire
Feeling the flames rise, this fever's getting higher
And I'm like oh-oh oh-oh, you set me on fire
I'm like oh-oh oh-oh, you set me on fire
I'm burning alive!

Stand up that body, and she's all I wanted
From the moment I stop her, all I saw was a goddess
Like 12 ak gun, and I'm the one that she aimed at
Already get her talking, and now I've got to bang back

If I knew what I know now, I'd hold on to the heart you stole
But all I can do now is just stop dropping row

Burning alive like you set me on fire
Feeling the flames rise, this fever's getting higher
And I'm like oh-oh oh-oh, you set me on fire
I'm like oh-oh oh-oh, you set me on fire
I'm burning alive!
I'm burning alive!
I'm burning alive!
I'm burning alive!
She's a first class dive
Not a hood red skiza??
Every time I see her
She makes the whole place shakin'
Shine a light on her body
Oh-oh, don't break me down like a nickel ban
Oh-oh, don't show with nobody
No, type of one you wished you had


If I knew what I know now, I'd hold on to the heart you stole
But all I can do now is just stop dropping row

Burning alive like you set me on fire
Feeling the flames rise, this fever's getting higher
And I'm like oh-oh oh-oh, you set me on fire
I'm like oh-oh oh-oh, you set me on fire
I'm burning alive!
I'm burning alive!
I'm burning alive!
I'm burning alive!

Burning alive like you set me on fire
Feeling the flames rise, this fever's getting higher
And I'm like oh-oh oh-oh, you set me on fire
I'm like oh-oh oh-oh, you set me on fire
I'm burning alive!
I'm burning alive!
I'm burning alive!
I'm burning alive!

[Verse 1]
It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
And her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her father has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
As she walks through the sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

[Pre-Chorus]
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause she's lived it ten times or more
It's about to be lived again
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Piano solo]

[Verse 2]
It's on America's tortured brow
Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
And the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

[Pre-Chorus]
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As they ask you to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in this best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Outro]
Thank you very much, thank you Michael. Mike Garson, ladies and gentlemen. Let's have some people on stage, let's have some people on stage. Good evening everybody

[Intro]
These first two songs are from the new album 'hours...' The first song is called "Thursday's Child"

[Verse 1]
All of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same
Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
Breaking my life in two, yeah

[Chorus]
Throw me tomorrow, oh-oh
Now that I've really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow, oh-oh
Everything's falling into place
Throw me tomorrow, oh-oh
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow, oh-oh
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's child

[Post-Chorus]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet
Lucky old sun is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
I'm innocence in your arms

[Chorus]
Throw me tomorrow, oh-oh
Now that I really stand a chance
Throw me tomorrow, oh-oh
Everything's falling into place
Throw me tomorrow, oh-oh
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow, oh-oh
Only for you I don't regret
That I was Thursday's child

[Post-Chorus]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Thursday's child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Thursday's child, yeah

[Outro]
Oh yeah
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Thursday's child
Oooh yeah
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Thursday, Thursday, Thursday's child
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday born I was
Thank you

[Intro]
This is the second song from 'hours...' and this one's called "Something in the Air"; first time we've ever done this one ever, ever

[Verse 1]
Your coat and hat are gone
I really can't look at your little empty shelf
Tagged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Don't look me in the eye
We lay in each others arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we lived it out, there's something in the air
We smiled too fast then can't think of a thing to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Lived with the best times
Now we're left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
And there's nothing left to say
Let's take what we can
I know you hold your head up high
We've raced for the last time
A place of no return

[Chorus]
But there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long, yeah
Something I have to say
There's something in the air

[Verse 2]
Abracadoo, I lose you
We can't avoid the clash, the big mistake
Now we're going to pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Can't believe I'm asking you to go
We used what we could to get the things we want, oh
I guess we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted anyone else than you

[Pre-Chorus]
Lived all our best times
Now we're left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
You can say what you will, yeah
Say what you will
We raced for the last time
Well I know you hold your head up high
But there's nothing in our eyes

[Chorus]
But there's something in the air
There's something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
Wasn't there something I have to say
But there's something in my eye
There's something in the air
I've danced with you too long
And there's something in the air

[Outro]
Thank you

[Intro]
This song is from an album called Station to Station and it's called-- I'm singing all the tough ones in the beginning, I can't believe I've done this, oh well-- it's called "Word on a Wing"

[Verse 1]
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
I don't need another change
Still you forced a way into my scheme of things
You say we're growing
Growing heart and soul
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again
You're born once again
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything in Heaven or Hell

[Chorus]
Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, oh Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

[Verse 2]
In this age of grand delusion
You walked into my life out of my dreams
Oh sweet name, you're born once again for me
Just as long as I can see
I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and still you're glowing
Just as long as I can walk I'll walk beside you
I'm alive in you
Oh sweet name, you're born once again for me
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things

[Bridge]
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready ready ready
Ooh, ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh, ready ready ready
Ooh...

[Chorus]
Lord, I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Oh, oh Lord, Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
And, and I'm trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land, but I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, oh Lord, my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

[Outro]
Thank you

[Intro]
Let's dip back into the murky past; this is a song I originally recorded-- it's the first song I recorded as David Bowie in 1966, so... you won't know it very well, but it's fast, it's nice... it is nice, it's called "Can't Help Thinking About Me"

[Verse 1]
Question-time that says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name
My Mother says that she can't stand the neighbours talking
I've gotta leave this home, pack my bags, start walking, yeah
I'm guilty

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime

[Chorus]
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

[Verse 2]
Remember when we used to go to church on Sundays
I'd lie awake at night, terrified of school on Mondays

[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again, but

[Chorus]
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me

[Bridge]
As I pass a recreation ground
I remember my friends, always been found but I can't

[Chorus]
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

[Verse 3]
Now I leave them all in the never never land
The station seems so cold the ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name
She says "Hi Dave
Come back, drop in, see you around
If you're this way again"

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on my own
I've got a long way to go
I hope I make it on my own

[Chorus]
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me
Can't help thinking about me

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl

[Verse 1]
I could escape this feeling with, with my China Girl
I'm just a wreck without my little China Girl
I hear her heart beating, it's loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing

[Verse 2]
I'm just a mess without my little China Girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China Girl?
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down

[Chorus]
I'm feeling tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl, she's so

[Verse 3]
I stumble into town just like some sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head, plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes

[Bridge]
My little China Girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything that you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
But I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

[Chorus]
And when I get excited
My little China Girl, she says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says "shhh"
She says "shhh"
Yeah
She says

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl
Oh-oh-oh-oh, little China Girl

[Verse 1]
Every chance, every chance that I take
Take it on the road
Kilometers and the red lights
Always looking left and right

[Chorus]
I'm always crashing in the same car

[Verse 2]
Jasmine, I caught you peeping
As I put my foot down to the floor
I was going around the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to 94

[Chorus]
And I'm always crashing in the same car

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Always crashing in the same car
Yes I'm always crashing in the same car
Thank you
By now that's... that's twenty years old that song

[Intro]
Um, this song is a new song and it's from 'hours...' and it's called... it's quite pertinent actually, it's called "Survive"

[Verse 1]
Oh my, naked eyes
I should have kept you, I should have tried
I should have been a wiser kind of guy
I miss you

[Verse 2]
Give me wings, give me space
Give me money for change of face
These noisy rooms and fashion pants
I loved you

[Chorus]
Where's the morning in my life?
Where's the sense in staying right?
Who said time is on my side?
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But I survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You alone across the floor
You and me and nothing more
You're the big mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hated when you lied
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

[Verse 3]
Beatle boys, all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs every night
Wish I'd sent a Valentine
I loved you

[Outro]
But I'll survive
My naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
My naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
Thank you; I like doing these new songs, they're good to play live. That was nice, I like that; I like that one

[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Still don't know what I was waiting for
Time was running wild, million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed peace was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see this faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, didn't want to have to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Oh changes, just wanted to be a better man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Interlude]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
Still the days seem the same, just the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
They're immune to your consultation
They're quite aware of what they're going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, looks like you left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah, changes are taking the pace I'm going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Oh Changes, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Outro]
Thank you very much
Oh Paris, I love Paris in the springtime, I do, I love Paris in the Fall... I got engaged to my wife here, you know, along the Seine... ah, that won't interest you. Look I'm only supposed to do 45 minutes, thank you for coming. Well, we're only going to do another 20 minutes, I've got to be very strict about this or we'll have to stay after school. Please indulge me, we're going to do, a new song, a couple of old songs, a couple of more obscure songs... is that OK?

[Intro]
We'll do a new song first; it's very gentle, it's called "Seven"

[Verse 1]
I forgot what my father said
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
As we laid upon your bed

[Pre-Chorus]
City full of flowers
A city full of rain

[Chorus]
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

[Verse 2]
I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
Really don't regret anything at all
I remember how we wept

[Pre-Chorus]
On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry

[Chorus]
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart

[Chorus]
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

[Verse 3]
The gods forgot that they made me
Well I forgot them too
I listen to the shadows
And I play among their graves

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart was never broken
My patience never tried

[Chorus]
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
I got seven days to live my life
And seven ways to die

[Outro]
Seven
Seven
Seven
Seven
Seven
Seven
Seven, oh
Seven
Seven
This is, uh, this also another quite old one from the album Lodger, for all you closet Lodger fans...

[Intro]
Alright, this is... I think this is one of my favorites, this called "Repletion."

[Verse 1]
Johnny is a man and he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through you when you ask him how the kids are
He'll get home around seven
'Cause the Chevy’s real old
And he could've had a Cadillac
If the school had taught him right

[Chorus]
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

[Verse 2]
Well, the food is on the table but the food is cold
Don't hit her
Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook?
Well, Johnny is a man and he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through

[Chorus]
And he could've married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could've married Anne with the blue silk blouse
It shows through
Yeah, he could've married Anne with the blue silk blouse
It shows through
It shows through

[Outro]
Give me a guitar

[Intro]
You know I can't let the opportunity go by without doing one Tin Machine song. Someone's gotta be stubborn around here-- you'll like this one! That was him just testing you

[Verse 1]
I can't read, I can't write down
I don't know a book from countdown
I don't know which shadow gets me
All I've got is someone's face

[Verse 2]
Money goes to money heaven
Bodies go to body hell
I just sit and watch the chase
Switch the channel, watch the police cars

[Chorus]
I can't reach it anymore
I just sit back and ignore
I just can't to get it right, I just can't get it right
I can't reach it, I can't reach it

[Verse 3]
When you see a famous smile
No matter where you run your mile
To be right in that photograph
Well, Andy where's my fifteen minutes?

[Chorus]
I can't reach it anymore
I just sit back and ignore
I just can't to get it right, I just can't get it right
I can't reach it, I can't reach it

[Outro]
Thank you, yeah
New song

Mark Plati on guitar
Sterling Campbell on drums
Gail Ann Dorsey on bass guitar
On dresses and dance interpretation Emm and Holly

[Intro]
This is a new song, it's called "The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell..."

[Verse 1]
What to wear?
What to say?
What to do on a sunny day?
Who the phone?
Who to fight?
Who to dance with on a Sunday night?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm reaching the very edge, you know
I'm reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
I'm reaching the very edge

[Chorus]
You're still breathing but you don't know why
Life's a bit and sometimes you die
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell

[Post-Chorus]
I am a drug, I am the dragon
I am the best jazz you ever seen
I am the dragon, I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secret, I found gold
I find you out before you grow old
I find you out before you grow old

[Verse 2]
What is eternal? What is damned?
What is clay and what is sand?
Who to diss? Who to trust?
Who to listen to? Who to suss?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm reaching the very edge, you know
I'm reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
I'm reaching the very edge

[Chorus]
You're still breathing but you don't know why
Life's a bit and sometimes you die
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell

[Outro]
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out but they wore it well
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out but they wore it well
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out but they wore it well
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out but they wore it well
Yeah! I tell you now!
You're still breathing but you don't know why
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell
You're still breathing but you don't know why
Life's a bit and sometimes you die
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell
Oh well, hey

[Verse 1]
Remember how we used to party up all night?
Sneakin' out and lookin' for a taste of real life
Drinkin' in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet 16 and we had arrived
Walkin' down the streets as they whistle, "Hi, hi!"
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hands, swayin' in the wind
Oh, she starts to cry
Mascara running down her little Bambi eyes
"Lana, how I hate those guys."

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen

[Verse 2]
And that's where the beginning of the end begun
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job
With the boss
Sweet 16 and we had arrived
Baby's table-dancing at the local dive
Cheerin' our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' cherry schnapps in the velvet night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Yeah, we used to go break in
To the hotel pool
Glimmerin' we'd swim
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screamin', "Get us while we’re hot."
We don't give a what?

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen

[Bridge]
The prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshman generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something?
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away and was wavin' on the train platform
Cryin' 'cause I know I'm never comin' back

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
To all the little queens, do you know what you're worth?
I'll tell you everyday till you get it, girl
It's all gonna happen
This is what makes us girls now, baby
This is why we rule the world now, baby
This is what makes us girls now, baby
Why we rule the world now, baby, oh
This is what makes us girls now, baby
This is why we rule the world now, baby
This is what makes us girls now, baby
Why we rule the world now, baby, oh

Drinkin' Pérignon in the velvet night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Yo, we used to go break in
To the hotel, glimmerin' we’d swim
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screamin', "Get us while we're hot, we don't give a what?"

And that's where the beginning of the end begun
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job
With the boss
Sweet 16 and we had arrived
Baby's table-dancing at the local dive
Cheerin' our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' Pérignon in the velvet night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Yo, we used to go break in
To the hotel, glimmerin' we’d swim
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screamin', "Get us while we're hot, we don't give a what?"

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen

[Bridge]
The prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshman generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something?
They were the only friends I ever had
I got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, wavin' on the train platform
Cryin' 'cause I know I'm never comin' back

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we puttin' love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen
This is what makes us girls now, baby
It's why we rule the world now, baby, oh
This is what makes us girls now, baby
It's why we rule the world now, baby, oh

[Verse 1]
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes hurt
It was like James Dean, for sure
So-so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater, and I know
That love's mean (uh-oh), and love hurts, (uh-oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby

[Chorus]
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more, than them tricks before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember, oh baby, hoo
I will love you till the end of time

[Verse 2]
Big dreams, gangster
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, "No please, stay here
We don't need no money, we can make it all work"
Headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waitin', anticipatin' and pacin' but he was
Chasing paper, "Got caught up in the game" it was the last I heard

[Chorus]
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more, than them tricks before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember, oh baby, hoo
I will love you till the end of time

[Verse 1]
Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name
You open up a beer
And you say "get over here
And play my video game"
I'm in his favorite sundress
Watching me get all dressed
We gonna go downtown
I say you're the best best
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
Go play your video game

[Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now you do, mm

[Verse 2]
Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

[Chorus]
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now you do
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now you do

[Verse 1]
You said I was the most exotic flower
Holding me tight in our final hour
I don't know how you convince them and get them, boy
I don't know what you do, it's unbelievable
And I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted, and flawed as you

[Chorus]
One for the money, two for the show
I love you, honey; I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Verse 2]
You got the world, but baby, at what price?
It's something so strange, it's hard to define
It isn't that hard, boy, to like you or love you
I'd follow you down, down, down, 'cause you're unbelievable
If you're going crazy, just grab me and take me
I'd follow you down, down, down; anywhere, anywhere

[Chorus]
One for the money, two for the show
I love you, honey; I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus]
One for the money, two for the show
I love you, honey; I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Outro]
I don't know
You're screwed up, you're brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Intro: Drake & Ronald Isley]
Ayy
(Now you know how)
Now I gotta tell you how lucky I am
(Oh, now you know)
This shit could have went a hundred different ways on a thousand different days for real
Yeah, whoop, ayy

[Verse: Drake]
On my way to the boat like I ain't just have on a coat when I landed
Owl branded
Perched at the edge of the branches
They don't wanna talk mansions, mine look like a campus
And I'm all about my brothers like the niggas I'm samplin'
I'll leave you red-shirted like the twins from Kansas
Really livin' my dreams I used to have in my aunt's crib
Might throw a Rockefeller chain on in the Hamptons
This shit sound like I'm parked in the alley by ransom
My uncle went bankrupt and he was the last hope
My faith started to dwindle 'cause that was the cash flow
My mom would never walk again, that's what the doc said
So much medication, I was worried she'd drop dead
For real
And I was the good guy, my friends were the hotheads
Times when I thought I should of stuck with my old friends
I might've been at the end of my rope on both ends
The kids I went to high school with got trust funds
But we had more fun, trust
Textin' my promoter, homie beggin' for one plus
Girls wrote me off, didn't think I'd become much
Dinner and a movie all for nothin', that's tough love
Meanwhile, rappers from other cities is cuttin' up
We ain't had the means to really make it, we comin' up
But local niggas actin' like we made it and runnin' up
My heart beatin' fast 'cause I needed to toughen up
We needed to huddle up
I felt like we was doin' all we could but it wasn't enough
Spent a year in Brampton with my girl, just cuddlin' up
'Til one of my niggas hit my phone like you want it or what?
And now, the sound is champion
The singles is dancin', the pills is Ambiens
The lightin' is ambient
The housewives is outside the booth 'cause they can't be in
"Oh, you fancy, huh?"
Oh yeah, I'm the fanciest
They said summer was canceled but I got plans and shit
Where my advances is?
Ladies, it's June, July, where all the Cancers is?
Show me your hands and shit
Even if you ain't a Cancer, throw up your hands to this
'Cause most of y'all cancerous
Michael B. Jordan call you right now, you answerin'
Even if you got a man that love you, you scandalous
You gon' take the chance and shit
You know that relationship is probably in shambles
And you know you a fan of his
Know if he gon' bring you to Miami, you scramblin'
And pack all your luggage, get on the plane and land in it
Yeah, I'm just talkin' outta pocket now, I know y'all sick of me
I looked at the score and y'all can't be countin' the victories
It's still all love between us, despite all the history
It's still October forever, minus the trickery
Talk about a flip the switch challenge
It's been challengin' for ten years
'Cause niggas been out here switchin' on me
And showin' how much realer that some of they bitches can be
This shout goes out to Hov 'cause it's him and then me
For real
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got bricks all in my wall, man I live with the coke
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
Fuck your plug, come shop with me, got deals on the dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I sold a million records but I'm still sellin' dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got a good price on them thangs, that's if you really want some work
Metro on the beat
Metro PCS, I make a half a mil' a week
Cash smell like cocaina, got Febreeze for all my cheese
And I care less 'bout what you think of me, it's 40K to link with me
15K to drink with me, 10 bands just to smoke with me
Prayin' to the trap god that this boss don't get knocked, hopefully
50 bands, Hammer pants, watch that fine ho dance for me
No this not my fetish bitch, but I got ice all over me
Extendo make my pants sag lower than they 'posed to
And I'm runnin' for another term, nigga come and vote for me
Remote control for your girl, hit a button and she squirt for me
Fucked her out and catch a nut, I quit cause bitch you overworkin' me
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got bricks all in my wall, man I live with the coke
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
Fuck your plug, come shop with me, got deals on the dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I sold a million records but I'm still sellin' dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got a good price on them thangs, that's if you really want some work
When a brick was twenty-six, it got me goddamn rich
Taught me how to flip a pack and move them goddamn bricks
Boy if you ain't gettin' no money, go hit a goddamn lick
I rep 12 and 22nd for my niggas slanging bricks
It's ZooWap from the bando, boy this ain't what you want
Rubber grip on my handle, I crush your ass for fun
Not anywhere I can't go, I pull up where I want
Anything is on the counter it's like Fetty tryna stunt
Everyone in my camp go, four others got a gun
Don't you think that we're lackin', the chopper's in the trunk
Hear that shit when it's blastin', I love the way it dump
Used to sleep in the trap house, wake up next to my gun
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got bricks all in my wall, man I live with the coke
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
Fuck your plug, come shop with me, got deals on the dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I sold a million records but I'm still sellin' dope
Still sellin' dope, still sellin' dope
I got a good price on them thangs, that's if you really want some work

[Verse 1]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I've made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naive
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus 1]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 2]
You won't find me in church (no) reading the Bible (no)
I am still here and I'm still your disciple
I'm down on my knees, I'm beggin' you, please
I'm broken, alone, and afraid
I'm not a saint, I'm more of a sinner
I don't wanna lose, but I fear for the winners
When I try to explain, the words run away
That's why I am stood here today

[Chorus 2]
And I'm gonna pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna

[Bridge]
Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-to-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-to-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

[Chorus 2/Outro]
Oh, and I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray, maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna pray

We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began

Do you remember us holding hands
In each other's eyes we'd stare

She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts."
And mother always told me, "A-be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth9"
Hey hey

[Verse 1]
The way I talk, I guess I got it from my pops
Product of some kneelin' down
In a town where the doors don't lock
And there's a million other people like me
From a scene a little more podunk than pop
I didn't choose being born in the sticks
And I'll be damned if I sound like something I ain't
For some folks, a backroad gets old
But for me, it just can't

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country

[Verse 2]
Somewhere now, someone's out there
Sippin' on some hundred proof
Every day, a baby's born with some baby blues
A good ol' boy's got on his faded boots
Workin' a nine to five
I'm just another southern hell raiser
Ain't breakin' ground
Makin' sound for them drop-it-down tailgaters
But y'all, that's all I know to say
So if you think I'm full of it, ain't done it, check the resume

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country
I've been gone too long
I know i've been gone far too long
And since I left home
You're still the one I dream of
Who do you dream of?

Will you hold me when I come home?
Will you hold me when I come home?

Your Instagram, embarrassing
Living a poser life
Got bigger lips and paid friendships
But losing the light in your eyes
Your only friend, your reflection
Arching your back for likes
I knew you when we'd laugh at them
Now you're the stereotype (Stereotype)

[Chorus]
Oh babe, you got high on your supply
You fell in, and now you're trippin'
Yeah, you got high on your supply
Bought the hype and now you're slippin'
You got a head so swollen
You got a vibe so broken
Why oh, why do you keep telling yourself all of them lies

[Post-Chorus]
High on your supply
High on your supply
High on your supply
Tell yourself another lie
High on your supply (Hi-high)
High on your supply (Hi-high)

You're cooler than these sycophants
Who wanna be part of the show
It's hard to hear, but oh so clear
You're not in on the joke
I'm only here because I care
I know it's a lonely road
I knew you when we had nothin'
And that's why I don't blow smoke (I won't blow smoke)

[Chorus]
Oh babe, you got high on your supply
You fell in, and now you're trippin'
Yeah, you got high on your supply
Bought the hype and now you're slippin'
You got a head so swollen
You got a vibe so broken
Why oh, why do you keep telling yourself all of them lies

[Verse 1]
Just hung up the phone and I
Could already tell that you're comin' home intoxicated, ooh
So you better take your time with me
'Cause I remember last time you wouldn't make love to me
Then you fell fast asleep (I hope you niggas sleep)
Wouldn't even talk to me, no
Say— Say I'm so crazy, baby (I'm so crazy)

[Chorus]
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
Please, for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to race my mind, mind

[Verse 2]
They said you got high as the sky
Up all night just dancin', huh
I hit you like, "Please come home to me" (Come home to me)
But you're not understandin', no
You gon' make me beg, make me plead (Plead)
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
I just figured you could make time for me
Since that you're comin' home intoxicated, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Race my mind, I got the keys, please

[Verse 3]
Picture me rollin' through downtown in a A4
Picture my signature on a pair of some J 4s
Picture me carin' what niggas sayin' on Wi-Fi they don't pay for
Knew I needed love, but I think I value the hate more
To push towards things that I prayed for
Retrograde energy shifts are what I was made for
And don't you dare hit me back with no "K, sure"
Soon as I tell you that you the one I would wait for
You too saucy, too flossy, you moved in and moved off me
All to be with niggas who just startin' to move bossy
Maybe I just handled you too softly
Them boys got no Kelis in they blood
If your whole heart wasn't in it, I know a piece of it was
Posted that pic you sent me, it wasn't recent enough
How I'm supposed to wife it? You not Ayesha enough
You love getting T'd up
Love showin' the cakes, you know that they eat it up
Love touchin' the road as soon as it's heatin' up
Invited you over, you said that you showin' up
All them spelling mistakes, I know that you drunk as fuck
All them other mistakes, let's let it be what it was
Them niggas just can't understand it
I want you to change my mind, I'm praying you pulling up
Know who you be around, I know that they teaming up
Telling you you better off leavin' me in the dust

[Chorus]
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
Please, for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to race my mind, mind

[Intro]
(Wheezy beats)

[Chorus]
Only reason I fucked with her is 'cause I thought it was over for us
I bought a Range Rover with a bowtie over the book
I bought your birthday gift that you ordered, yeah
I know it's real love when we make no money and that's why
I wanna love you more, I wanna love you more
I wanna love you more than you ever loved me
I wanna love you more, yeah
More than you ever loved me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, more than you ever loved me
Your wedding ring come truly frosty
Before we move forward, you gotta truly trust me
Honeymoon, you gotta come with tricks up your sleeve
And I want you to take Ritalin, mommy
If you was food, you'd be my tenderoni
I got by so many bitches calling me "Papi"
Because my money different colors, Monopoly
Eating pieces like Reese's Pieces
I granted you with a big stone, you believe in me
I'll quickly right my wrongs if you leave
I'll turn this shit to a prom dress and some trenches
I turned your whip to pink slip, no rent, no
I came a long way from bandos and kicked doors
My money stretched from here way to the other side of the globe
Before I run out of drip, I'll buy another load, yeah

[Chorus]
Only reason I fucked with her is 'cause I thought it was over for us
I bought a Range Rover with a bowtie over the book
I bought your birthday gift that you ordered, yeah
I know it's real love when we make no money and that's why
I wanna love you more, I wanna love you more
I wanna love you more than you ever loved me
I wanna love you more, yeah
More than you ever loved me

[Verse 2]
At least I remember the day we met
I remember the first day that you made me spend a check
I respect the reason you let me blow it down in 

[?]
I respect the reason we've always fucked when you got that check up
I love your mama like my mama, ain't gotta flex
I'll let your daddy book a few shows and run up his check
I'll let your nephew stay at my house and rock my drip
I'll let your Auntie get away with being stale
Moschino with T-Rex, oh, for real
I bought everybody a whip before my deal
I told the cops this Ac' was NyQuil
I convinced her out her lifts before I Leered
Tom Ford turtleneck, sex appeal
Thought about fuckin' you from the back inside a Leer
Sleepin' at 

[?], we in the sky booth
We can see the whole view, just I and you

[Chorus]
Only reason I fucked with her is 'cause I thought it was over for us
I bought a Range Rover with a bowtie over the book
I bought your birthday gift that you ordered, yeah
I know it's real love when we make no money and that's why
I wanna love you more, I wanna love you more
I wanna love you more than you ever loved me
I wanna love you more, yeah
More than you ever loved me

[Verse 1]
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
What the fuck happened here?
I guess is what they meant when
They paid the price
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Where are the trailer parks?
And where all the Christmas lights?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I had a boyfriend
He came from this town
We used to pretend we were married and start again
He read the Bible
Showed me what Jesus said
He said I should rewrite (He only read the red)

[Chorus]
I want Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Nothing looks familiar here
No one even that I like
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
I was so much happier when
I was gonna be your wife

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We had a deal and
I fucked it up when
I made the decision to become someone
We had the one thing that no one ever had
True love
It's true love

[Chorus]
I ask Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
I never meant to hurt you baby
It's so hard to be true
In this world where everything's so black and blue
I never meant to hurt you darling
It's so hard to be good
In this world where you do what you know you shouldn’t

[Chorus]
I want Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Your kisses have a higher power
Your body, baby, it's divine
Every time I see you smile
It's like I've seen the light
Sleeping next to you is Heaven
But you already know 'bout that
Wanna glorify every part of you so bad

[Chorus]
Don't get me wrong
I'm a God fearing Christian man
But if you were a religion then, damn
I don't know what I'd do
Yeah, I might have to worship you
I might have to sing your praise
I might have to go to church, yeah
Every single night and day
Yeah, I might have to hit my knees
'Cause you lay it on me like the truth
And you love me like Hallelujah
I might have to worship you
Yeah, I might have to worship you
I might have to worship you (I might have to worship you)

And I ain't saying you can walk on water
Or that you can turn it into wine
But, girl, it feels like a miracle that you're mine

[Verse 1]
Never been a hopeless romantic
Never really could understand it
I thought Hollywood was just pretending
In all them movies with happy endings
Never saw it work out, just drama
Started with my old man and my mama
Figured that's just the way it works
Someone always ends up getting hurt

[Chorus]
I didn't know what love was
Thought it was just a word that people used
Until they say goodbye
'Til they go and find someone new
Thought I could live without it
But baby, I was wrong and so confused
I didn't know what love was, love was
Until you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now you got my undivided attention
Publicly displaying my affection
Can't help kissin' on you all the time
Thank God I got to make you mine
'Cause I can't remember life before you
I'm obsessed with you, girl, I adore you, yeah
I'm convinced I was born to
Fall in love with you

[Chorus]
I didn't know what love was
Thought it was just a word that people used
Until they say goodbye
'Til they go and find someone new
Thought I could live without it
But baby, I was wrong and so confused
I didn't know what love was, love was
Until you, yeah

[Bridge]
I didn't know, I didn't know
Until you

[Chorus]
I didn't know what love was
Thought it was just a word that people used
Until they say goodbye
'Til they go and find someone new
Thought I could live without it
But baby, I was wrong and so confused
I didn't know what love was, love was
Until you, yeah

[Outro]
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know until you
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know until you

[Verse 1]
I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
I like the way your name echo
You are so fine"
I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Do you wanna help me let go
Of my dark mind?"

[Chorus]
If you want it, it's yours
It's free, but of course
You're my sunshine
I say, "J, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine"

[Verse 3]
I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
You are on another level
You are so fine"
I say, "Hey Jimmy, let's go
I've been in love since I met you
You are all mine"

[Chorus]
If you want it, it's yours
It's free, but of course
Take a high ride
I say, "J, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine."

[Bridge]
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy me a hot dog, kiss me in the dark
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy me cotton candy, kiss me in the dark

[Verse 4]
I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Hey, I like your heavy metal
Do you like my mine?
I said, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
You were smashing from the get-go
This is your time"

[Bridge]
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy pink cotton candy, kiss me in the dark
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy me something pretty, kiss me in the dark

[Outro]
Jimmy Gnecco, Jimmy Gnecco, Jimmy Gnecco
You are so fine
Leaders walk among us
And I hope they hear our call
Maybe it's a woman
Or a black man after all

Lookin' for a leader
To bring our country home
Reunite the red white and blue
Before it turns to stone

Lookin' for somebody
With the strength to take it on
Keep us safe together
And make this country strong

Walkin' among our people
There's someone to lead us on
Need a rainbow of colors
In a broken world gone wrong

Yeah we had Barack Obama
And we really need him now
The man who stood behind him
Has to take his place somehow
America has a leader
Buildin' walls around our house
Who don't know black lives matter
And we got to vote him out

We got our election
But corruption has a chance
We got to have a big win
To regain confidence

America is beautiful
But she has an ugly side
We're lookin' for a leader
In this country far and wide

Just like his big new fence
This president's going down
America's moving forward
You can feel it in every town

Scared of his own shadow
Buildin' walls around our house
He's hiding in his bunker
Something else to lie about

We don't need a leader
Building walls around our house
Who don't know black lives matter
And it's time to vote him out
We're lookin' for a leader
With the great spirit on his side
Lookin' for a leader
In this country far and wide

We're lookin' for a leader
With the great spirit on his side
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rare, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we had grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

Keep a place for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's I never, 'cause I made you use your self control
And you made me lose my self control, my self control

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
The likes of you may never be
Attracted to the likes of me
But accidents will happen and I'll be around
And maybe there’ll be no one else but me around

Forevermore may never start
You may ignore my hopeful heart
And chances are not the one to make you fall
But accidents will happen after all

A smile may show it
Your eyes may glow
Before you know it
I'm sure I'll know

So if you fall in just that way
Oh, wouldn’t I be thrilled to hear you say
I had a lovely accident today

Your eyes may glow
I'm sure I'll know

[Verse 1]
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Outro]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Lyrics from snippet

[Intro]
Ayy, f**k that nigga Haan, man

[Chorus]
You got a lot of baggage girl, it's hard to handle
Why you tryna hide it from me? You know I know
Why you, why you tryna go to the places I go?
But you already been here before with somebody else
Why you tryna lie to me, that ain't cool
Girl I know about all of the things you do
Uh, bad news, wait bad news
Why you tryna lie girl, I know about everybody else
You got a lot of baggage girl, it's hard to handle
Why you tryna hide it from me? You know I know
Why you, why you tryna go to the places I go?
But you already been here before with somebody else

[Verse]
...Oh I see you got some new shoes (You do)
But you don't got that money for some new Louboutins (Oh-oh)
I know that you got them for somebody else
And you don't need nobody else
Why the fuck you lying to yourself?
Ay yeah, I don't like the other side of Henny
Already fell in love, tripped off of the heartbreak already
Saying fuck love but hear I am again back to making amends
I know my ex down bad but oh well..

[Chorus]
You got a lot of baggage girl, it's hard to handle
Why you tryna hide it from me? You know I know
Why you, why you tryna go to the places I go?
But you already been here before with somebody else
Why you tryna lie to me, that ain't cool
Girl I know about all of the things you do
Uh, bad news, wait bad news
Why you tryna lie girl, I know about everybody else
You got a lot of baggage girl, it's hard to handle
Why you tryna hide it from me? You know I know
Why you, why you tryna go to the places I go?
But you already been here before with somebody else

[Verse 1]
One look was enough, enough for me
The whole room stops
And it's not me to be one, to be one
One of many

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's a hundred others speaking
I've been tryna make a step
A hundred others speaking
I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya, one out here for ya

[Chorus]
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya, that kind of woman
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still, let me show ya
That kind of woman (Woman)
(That kind of woman, woman; that kind of woman)
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman

[Verse 2]
I'll pick you from the crowd
Don't come to me
I want you to myself
No, I won't be, won't be one
Won't be one, one of many

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's a hundred others speaking
I've been tryna make a step
A hundred others speaking
I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya, one out here for ya

[Chorus]
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya, that kind of woman
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still, let me show ya
That kind of woman (Woman)
(That kind of woman, woman; that kind of woman)
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman

[Bridge]
(Gonna) Keep you close, next to me, I won't let you go
(You're gonna) Reminisce that you once met a girl like this
The first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya (That kind of woman)

[Chorus]
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya, that kind of woman (Woman)
(That kind of woman, woman)
(That kind of woman)
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
I bet we're higher than the people on cloud nine
This connection got me feeling like
I've known you my whole life, wow
Even our shadows know each other in the light
So I do, I think of losing you
And you're right by my side, huh

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true
And that's what I feel
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
We get lost creeping up

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So baby don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby if you ever (Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me

[Verse 2: Normani]
I got a little devil dancing in my mind
Playing tricks with my imagination
Ruining my night, well
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes
All the voices in my head keep tryna
Tell me it's goodbye, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
We get lost creeping up

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Normani]
So baby don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby if you ever (Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me

[Bridge: Dua Lipa]
So baby don't you let go
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I feel
Like what if you left me here
Like what if you left me here
And I feel the floor with my sequin tears

[Chorus: Dua Lipa, Normani, Both]
So baby don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke (Heart broke)
Such a sad disco (Disco), if it ain't me
And baby if you ever (Ever) (Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see (Find another)
I'll be dancing with my heart broke (Heart broke)
Such a sad disco (Disco), if it ain't me

[Verse 1]
Feels like we're all alone but we're here in a crowded room
Your eyes all on me and my eyes are looking right at you
Feels like I've known you for a lifetime but it's just day two
So into you (So into you)
Something about you in the way that you just say my name
It makes me wanna throw my hands up 'cause you know I'm game
Wanna unlock the movies I got playin' in my brain (In my brain)
Of you and me (Of you and me)

[Pre-Chorus]
Honestly for you there's no one but me
And honestly I want you

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
I need you all to myself
All to myself, all to myself
I hope there's nobody else (Ooh-ooh)
I want you all to myself (Ooh-ooh)
All to myself (Ooh-ooh), all to myself (Ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
Up in the canyon with the flowers, they were all in bloom
Your hand on the lower part of my back, so close to you
You know the feeling when you're falling?
Well, I fell for you (I fell for you)
You know it's true (You know it's true)

[Pre-Chorus]
Honestly for you there's no one but me
And honestly I want you

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
I need you all to myself
All to myself, all to myself
I hope there's nobody else (Ooh-ooh)
I want you all to myself (Ooh-ooh)
All to myself (Ooh-ooh), all to myself (Ooh-ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
Baby I say goodbye to all the rest
You're the one that gets me best
Only, only one, only, only one
Baby just say goodbye to all the rest
'Cause I'm the one that gets you best
Only, only one, only, only one

[Pre-Chorus]
Honestly for you there's no one but me
And honestly I want you

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
I need you all to myself
All to myself, all to myself
I hope there's nobody else (Ooh-ooh)
I want you all to myself (Ooh-ooh)
All to myself (Ooh-ooh), all to myself (Ooh-ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
Baby I say goodbye to all the rest (Ooh-ooh)
You're the one that gets me best (Ooh-ooh)
Only, only one (Ooh-ooh), only, only one (Ooh-ooh)
Baby I say goodbye to all the rest (Ooh-ooh)

Only, only one (Ooh-ooh), only, only one (Ooh-ooh)

[Verse]
I don't go outside no more, I stay remote
Keep my spirit clean from all the demon folk
Kiss my niece, then I make some green tea
Just closed another deal before she fell asleep
That's meditation, hydration, both'll do
That's good pussy, good books, good view
So what's the inside joke? What's the inside joke?
You will never know, that's the Morse code
Felt so lost, gettin' caught, red-handed on spot
Thought I was good in them white K-Swisses
My momma had puttin' pen on box
Back when my Velcro straps was fadin'
Grandma's on the housin' list, we grew impatient
Damn, did the government stop their payments?
Hidin' in the closet when CPS came in
Ayy, I can't help but feel neglected
Changin' up your schedule, your calendar refreshin'
Time pass and we move on, nobody says shit
So how am I 'posed to act when my morals won't respect it?
And how you 'posed to act when your feelings ain't protected?
I'm cashin' checks just to get some neck and some necklaces
So what's next? War and turbulence, I'm prayin' on this plane
Success, got a taste of it, never was the same

[Verse 1: Amber Bain]
Listenin' in on everybody else
Talkin' about somethin' meaningless
Wishin' that someone would film the way I'm lookin' at you right now
I wanna watch it back and then kill myself
And I know it's not very sexy when somebody loves you this much and knows you this well
But it's the way it is
And I sense it's not the best time to be tryin' to fuck with your head and diggin' up old ground
So I squash it down

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Step on up
Pay them no mind
You're alone with this one
And they're angry
Well it won't do no good
Together, with your problems, doll
Live alone, willingly (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Amber Bain]
I've been thinkin' about our storyline
And how your past becomes your present if it's always on your mind
We played Dionne Warwick, "Walk On By"
And Freddy put his head between his legs and cried

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Step on up
Pay them no mind
You're alone with this one
And they're angry
Well it won't do no good
Together, with your problems, doll
Live alone, willingly (Yeah)

[Bridge: Amber Bain]
Listenin' in on everybody else
Talkin' about somethin' meaningless
Wishin' that someone would film the way I'm lookin' at you right now
I wanna watch it back and then kill myself

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Step on up
Pay them no mind
You're alone with this one
And they're angry
Well it won't do no good
Together, with your problems, doll
Live alone, willingly (Yeah)

[Outro: Amber Bain]
Wishin' that someone would film the way I'm lookin' at you
Wishin' that someone would film the way I'm lookin' at you
Wishin' that someone would film the way I'm lookin' at you
Film the way I'm lookin' at you
Film the way, oh dear

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

[Verse]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned

You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You love the things I say I do
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you
You take away, when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned

You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned

You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and (Mike Shinoda)]
You like to think you're never wrong (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned

You want someone to hurt like you (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Verse 1]
Ancient tombs like sand-filled wombs of
People's life past, understand everything
Melted iron, untold aeons
Crafted demise, destroying everything

[Verse 2]
Black sand timelines, shifting skylines
Faded guide signs, revealing everything
Ancient Thracians from lost nations
Long gone people understand everything

[Chorus]
Some, some, some of us see
Some, some of us don't
Assured everything turns into dust

[Verse 3]
Rigor mortis, fossil tortoise
Remains dormant underneath everything
Ageless microbes reveal xenophobes
Endless plague thus infecting everything

[Verse 4]
Sapien rituals born of mind tools
Sects of false gods fade into everything
Eternal tribes of purgatory scribes
Ancient words thus foretelling everything

[Chorus]
Some, some, some of us live
Some, some of us die
Assured everything turns into dust

[Outro]
Some, some, some of us live
Some, some of us die
Everything turns into dust

[Chorus]
I'm still tryna get you out of my head
And I know I cannot take back what I said
I heard you talking about me to your friends
And you gon' tell 'em you don't ever wanna see me again
I'm still tryna get you out of my head
And I know I cannot take back what I said
I heard you talking about me to your friends
And you gon' tell 'em you don't ever wanna see me again

[Verse]
And I'm sorry 'cause I fucked up
Remember all the things I do when I'm fucked up
Shit, drunk text you, like I love you
Thinkin' 'bout our memories when it was just us
Crazy, you called me
I know that you hate me, I know it
I wish that you'd forgive me and forget
If you give me one more shot then I'll be all in

[Chorus]
I'm still tryna get you out of my head
And I know I cannot take back what I said
I heard you talking about me to your friends
And you gon' tell 'em you don't ever wanna see me again
I'm still tryna get you out of my head
And I know I cannot take back what I said
I heard you talking about me to your friends
And you gon' tell 'em you don't ever wanna see me again

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
I'm still tryna get you out of my head
And I know I cannot take back what I said
I heard you talking about me to your friends
And you gon' tell 'em you don't ever wanna see me again
I'm still tryna get you out of my head
And I know I cannot take back what I said
I heard you talking about me to your friends
And you gon' tell 'em you don't ever wanna see me again

[Refrain]
Everyone forgot about the boy who died
3, 4, 5 months, all you guys run
3, 4, 5 months, all you guys run
3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5 months

[Chorus]
Riot, riot, riot
Riot, riot, riot

[Verse 1]
Daisies come and daisies go
If I shout it in the forest
Tell me how would Daisy even know
If I didn't spit the truth
How would Daisy even grow
You don't know what's good for her, yeah
You don't know what's good for us all
What's good for us all, yeah
Auntie really tryna clown us
And the funny thing about it
Is she don't even know about us
And fuck it, I would say it louder
You don't even know about us
Keep your sicko rants on the counter
And if you count me, gotta count her too
Cause Imma bet on me with you

[Chorus]
Riot, riot, riot
Riot, riot, riot
Riot, riot, riot
Riot, riot, riot

[Verse 2]

[?] yeah, I'm fucked up
Rich bitch, so stuck up
Got a little something for you tucked up
We don't really care about your thumbs up
So we toast to the fact that we fucked up
And they can never tell us when the fun's up
Live all night until the sun comes
Live all night until the sun comes
Just got to comprehend it
Can't you just understand me
Always lie, you can ask for guys
Working on the low, smoking on a high

[Chorus]
Riot, riot, riot
Riot, riot, riot
Riot, riot, riot
Riot, riot, riot

[Refrain]
Keep it, keep it cool, man I try
All this bullshit that I just don't buy
3, 4, 5 months, just passed by
Everyone forgot about the boy who died
3, 4, 5 months, just passed by
Everyone forgot about the boy who died
3, 4, 5 months, all you know is wrong
3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5 months

[Chorus]
Riot, riot, riot
Riot, riot, riot
Riot, riot, riot
Riot, riot, riot

[Verse]
Something's movin'
I can't feel her
Won't stop goin' through my head
I know you're sharin' beds, well
I'm a fuckin' mess
Just tell me it wasn't Jess
But I know
I know, I know

[Intro]
Hey, hahaha
I'm all grownsed up, man
Yeah, ha
Alright, look, hey

[Verse 1]
I'm so drunk, it's a bad idea to talk
'Cause I ain't makin' any sense, I'm just here to rock
Not sleepin', all grown up
Now the places that we go, they know us
Tell me, "Mac, it's so good to see you blow up"
'Cause now I be with cheese like cold cuts
And I ain't dealin' with a ho got no butt
Gotta do more than chillin', just show up
I'm just out my mind
Stay dealin' with some girls who be out all the time
And the higher that I get on this mountain I climb
To the clouds, I'ma rise over balcony, shine
From the light of the sun, tonight'll be fun
'Cause the night is still young and the rhyme to the drum
Is flowin', an island
See the ocean when I'm chillin', got me smilin', like

[Pre-Chorus]
"Ayy", tonight will be great
Walkin' through the door with a smile on my face
Like hate me or love me
Chase dreams, ain't worried 'bout money
I'ma get it then spend it, the way it's gon' be
And you ain't know me if you ain't part of the team
If you ain't part of the team
You ain't know me if you ain't part of the team, like

[Chorus]
Ayy-ayy, hey, hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey)
Hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ayy, tonight will be great (Ayy-ayy, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Walkin' through the door with a smile on my face
Like hate me or love me (Hey, hey)
Chase dreams, ain't worried 'bout money (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Too many people always thought I wouldn't ever do shit
I'm ruinin' my life and I'll never get rich
Forever I'm this, never goin' back
Don't fade to black, I'ma stain the map
Yeah, I'm changin' rap and my name is Mac
Trust me, then I'm ready when the cameras flash
'Cause the boy got presents like Santa's bag
Travel everywhere, homie, Alabama and back
My fans in the back in the stand and they clap
Give me love all day so I'm handin' it back
They believe, so they family
I'm ready right now, kinda antsy
And I don't got nothin' like a plan B
Just go and cop a crib in Miami
Get a Grammy and a Oscar
'Cause mother always said, "Act proper," hey

[Chorus]
Ayy-ayy, hey, hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ayy, tonight will be great (Ayy-ayy, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Walkin' through the door with a smile on my face
Like hate me or love me (Hey, hey)
Chase dreams, ain't worried 'bout money

[Chorus]
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"
'Cause I'ma be okay
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"
'Cause I'ma be okay

[Verse 1]
I used to have a dream, now it seem that I'ma live it in real life
Gettin' free jeans, good weed, feelin' real nice
Used to think that I was too short or too dumb
Just a newcomer to the game tryna do somethin'
Used to runnin' after ice cream trucks
But now I just stroll, lacе my Nikes up
I'm a nice, clean cut, good lookin' individual
Fillin' up a notebook with rhymes when I be in the school
Learn quick that nobody here invincible
We feel big, but in reality, we minuscule
Try and make a million bucks before I reach my pinnacle
Supernova status from basically invisible
Growin' up thinkin' it was cool to be a criminal
Until I saw a couple homies go down
See, now that isn't me or anything I'm finna be
I want the money, cars, hoes, clothes, a kid can dream
I used to talk to girls that wasn't even into me
Now they hit me up wantin' intimacy
But nah, I got a girl and she down for me
My little Juliet chillin' on the balcony
If I need it, she gon' run a hundred miles for me
Love me for me, not who I'm 'bout to be
And if they didn't believe, then I can do without 'em
'Cause at the end of the day I'm just Malcolm

[Chorus]
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"
'Cause I'ma be okay
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha" (Yeah)
'Cause I'ma be okay (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Just a little snotty nose tryna find his pot of gold
Stayin' up late on the phone, always callin' hoes
Never thought I'd blow, no one took me serious
Now they see me walkin' down the street like, "Oh, there he is"
As a kid, anything was possible
But mama knows the hottest flow don't put me on the honor roll
Grades started slippin', the classes I be skippin'
Tried to tell me that I was a fool, I wouldn't listen, no
As a youngin' I was playin' pretend
My wonder years, never woulda thought they could end
Back, back in my glory days, way before the haze
A good night sleep had me energized for the day
When I would look up at the planets in they orbit
Before this life got distorted
Before the money was a plan
Before I ever thought that I would need to be a man
Somethin' like a Peter Pan, nah, I ain't tryna grow up
'Cause bein' old sucks, I just wanna go nuts
Before I drank a beer or ever took a hit of weed
When entertainment was my mom's readin' mysteries
Takin' you back to them nursery rhymes
When I thought the world just deserved to be mine
Said I'm takin' you back to them nursery rhymes
Back to the beginning, put the verse in rewind

[Chorus]
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"
'Cause I'ma be okay
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"
'Cause I'ma be okay

[Post-Chorus]
Back in the day, when it was a dream
Nobody believed in what I could be
But now I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"
I'm laughin' at 'em like, "Ha-ha-ha"

[Outro]
Haha, yeah
So this goes out to
Any of y'all, haha
That ain't tryna get old, haha

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Same old shit, gibberish
Why the fuck you wanna choke me?
I don't give no kisses, I have no wife
Buncha toddlers wanna sleep in my crib
Well, niggas, sorry, you're in bad luck, you're not welcome
Watermelon dripping from my head, it's a mess
Be the one who wants to fuck me
I already fucked a lot of people
Call the police, my brand new boots are on fire
Whoo, I wish I had a Twin Dre
I'm not happy by myself, uh
Why the thunder tryna scare me, ayy
Whoa, bitches, outta my face
We need the cops for these real nigga lawbreakers

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
These motherfuckers are making me motherfucking confused
Ride my Gucci Toyota, get me in my crib
Nothing like a baby carriage
Stop acting like a bunny you ass

[Verse 2: 50 Cent & Dr. Dre together]
Call the mf cops, I've had enough
There a lotta trouble
Still tryna fuck these babes
They gotta stop crying, you know (Dre) (50 Cent) with crying and screaming babies
Sold out, bitch

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
These motherfuckers are making me motherfucking confused
Ride my Gucci Toyota, get me in my crib
Nothing like a baby carriage
Stop acting like a bunny you ass

[Outro: Pooh Beatz]
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

[Intro: Big Sean & Anderson .Paak]
(G. Ry got me)
(Hit-Boy on the beat so, bitch, you gotta go berserk)
Yeah, yeah, okay, hmm

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Sometimes you need a friend
Not the ones that just show up and don't put nothin' in
You know the ones that lend a hand and wanna see you win
When you come up on a lick, make sure you cut 'em in
And then, huh
Sometimes you need a foe (You need a foe)

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
One that keep your eyes open, keep you on your toes
You know the ones that wanna keep you where you been before
But I can't go (No, I can't go), no, I can't go (No, I can't go)
And woah, huh
Sometimes I need a check (Check)
Not the sneakers but the ones that make you watch your step (Make you watch your step)
Fuck your chain, fuck your name, how 'bout your respect?
Givin' more than what I get, expectin' nothing back
In fact (Nothing back)

[Interlude: Anderson .Paak]
You know I sat down with my accountant
He said, "I got good news and I got bad news" (Okay)
I said, "What's the good news?"
He said, "The good news is you made a lot" (Whoa, okay)
I said, "What's the bad news?"
"The bad news is you spent more"
Okay, oh, shit, look

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak & Rick Ross]
Huh, sometimes you need the faith (You need to pray)
Sometimes you need to know your worth, sometimes you need to wait (May need to pray)
Shoot like the Golden Boy, but ain't from the Bay (I make it rain)
You can't negotiate with Dre, you gon' have to pay (You gon' have to pay)
But wait (Wait, wait)
Juggin' on the main stage, fuckin' up the main frame
Loosen up your face, baby (Ah)
Sometimes I need a vacay (It's the biggest)
Meditate, hydrate
Protect my energy before engagement (Huh)
(Maybach Music)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Grew up havin' nothing, you're labeled impatient (Huh)
But once the boss made it, you labeled amazin'
Meticulous with words, that's your force of nature (Boss)
I don't wanna seem absurd, but that boy's a gangster
Foc-focusin' on me, way from Tel-Aviv (Tel-Aviv)
Barbados with the hustle, pockets Elandis (Woo)
Distinctive destinations all I wanna see (See)
Oceanfront residences, three different ones a week
'Cause I deserve that (Deserve that), it's time to learn that (Learn that)
Mess around and put that thing up where your perm at (Your perm at)
Six figures every year, yeah, I earned that (I earned that)
At the front of this line is where my turn at, huh
(Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Sometimes you need a friend (Need a friend)
Not the ones that just show up and don't put nothin' in (Nothin' in)
You know the ones that lend a hand and wanna see you win (See you win)
When you come up on a lick, make sure you cut 'em in (Cut 'em in)
And then (Huh)
Sometimes you need a foe (You need a foe)

[Verse 4: Anderson .Paak]
Oh
Men gon' lie (Oh), women gon' lie (Oh)
You lookin' for the truth, then the numbers don't hide (Oh)
Lookin' for the root of all evil, then you need to go
Open up the briefcase, see it with your eyes (Oh)
Everybody claim to be greatest of all times
But they never spend a day in the rain in the front line (No lie, no lie)
Uh, stop playin' on my phoneline
Shoot, lock and load, pull up in the space coupe
With the roof optional, wonder why they follow suit
I've been groomed from the womb, came out of my mama coochie
With some brand new tennis shoes, faster than the speedin' bullet

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
Nah, nah, nah, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool (Don't play with it, baby)
Say what you gon' do with that (Stop playin' with it, baby)
Turn around, if you don't do it now (Don't play with it, baby)
Exactly, yeah, 'cause you're not built like that
It's not a game

[Intro: Method Man]
Fucker, I think it's 'bout time that you suffer
Fucker, I think it's 'bout time that you suffer

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I cracked a bulletproof vest on an emcee's chest
Yes, yes, to make you sweat like a full-court press
On a quest to show my flow's control
The movement of the massive bodies at a hip-hop show
From high to low, feel the audio ring
As the blood in your veins pump to this rhythm
While the beat maintains subterrestrial status
King of the lyrical amplifying apparatus

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
I meant what I say now
Connect one, dilate, and break down
I meant what I say now
Connect one, dilate, and brеak down

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Step back, I feel my personal space is violated
(The heat of my mind makes my pupils dilated)
Don't test this or you'll be wrecked from the best-est
Check this tape deck weapon pumps thumps through your chest-esest
Break your neck, feel it happen
As I'm rappin', you could feel your every bone snappin'
You deserve to feel the force of my fire
Cut me loose De La like telephone wire
Try-a style against me, to Kenji
Try your best, no less, just then you will see
My top-notch spot, the middle block, gold medal
Kenji has been sent to represent the next level

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
I meant what I say now
Connect one, dilate, and break down
I meant what I say now
Connect one, dilate, and break down

[Interlude: Method Man]
Fucker, I think it's 'bout time that you suffer
Fucker, I think it's 'bout time that you suffer
Fucker, I think it's 'bout time that you suffer
Fucker, I think it's 'bout time that you suffer
Fucker, I think it's 'bout time that you suffer
Fucker, I think it's 'bout time that you suffer
Fucker, I think it's 'bout time that you suffer
Fucker, I think it's 'bout time that you suffer

[Break: Mark Wakefield]
Spine grab, pinch down, now you preach lies
Little kids cry and bullets spins counter-clockwise
Just be ready to test your set
Emergency broadcast, though I'm not dead yet
Spine grab, pinch down, now you preach lies
Little kids cry and bullets spins counter-clockwise
Just be ready to test your set
Emergency broadcast, though I'm not dead yet

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield, Mark Wakefield & Mike Shinoda]
I meant what I say now
Connect one, dilate, and break down
I meant what I say now
Connect one, dilate, and break down
I meant what I say now
Connect one, dilate, and break down
I meant what I say now
Connect one, dilate, and break down

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
Alone again
You go away

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
What do you mean that you don't know
It's obvious you think you do
You think it's best to choose loneliness
Afraid of what's right in front of you
What can I do when you turn away except close the door
Figure out how I'm gonna try again
Play it through to be with you
But alone again is how it's gonna end

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Making my moves so carefully
Feel it when you stare at me
Making my moves so carefully
Feel it when you stare at me
Making my moves so carefully
Feel it when you stare at me
Making my moves so carefully
Feel it when you stare at me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
We could have been so long
But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I can't do anything that would say
It won't be the same as yesterday
Say you're afraid to be with me
And I just pray you let the fear go away
And I can't see you as a friend
So now I know how this has got to end
Make it so nobody wins
Ending this before it begins

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Making my moves so carefully
Feel it when you stare at me
Making my moves so carefully
Feel it when you stare at me
Making my moves so carefully
Feel it when you stare at me
Making my moves so carefully
Feel it when you stare at me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
We could have been so long
But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Alone again
We go away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
We could have been so long
We could have been so long
(We could have been so long) But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find—
(We could have been so long) But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out
But I guess you'll never find out
And I know you'll never find out
But I know you'll never find out
And I know you'll never find out
But I know you'll never find out

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say sounds forced and fake
How long will it take before you make everything
Break down around you?
Everything that you do reminds me of why it is I can't stand you
Everything I thought was real was not
Everything I remembered you forgot
Everything's a joke to you
I hope sometime you get hit by the punchline
In everything I do, I see a little bit of you
Reminding me of what you put me through
'Cause everything that goes up must come down
And everything you do hurts worse whеn it comes back around

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Now I see what I have, and I want you
To be with me, but you'll just stick and move
See what I have, and I want you
To be with me, but you'll just stick and move

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Nothing you say could make me stay
All the lies disguised have done nothing but make me ask why
Nothing is what I've got
After all of the same pain
You've brought I thought would never stop
Nothing has changed
All the things you said to me then have begun to follow me again
Even though I know there's nothing to be afraid of
The same place the shape came from is making me hide
Inside a place where everything's gray
Constantly forcing the night over the day
Where nothing exists but the things that you say
And nothing could make me want to be further away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Now I see what I have, and I want you
To be with me, but you'll just stick and move
See what I have, and I want you
To be with me, but you'll just stick and move

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Now I see what I have, and I want you
To be with me, but you'll just stick and move
See what I have, and I want you
To be with me, but you'll just stick and move
See what I have, and I want you
To be with me, but you'll just stick and move
See what I have, and I want you
To be with me, but you'll just stick and

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She can't hide no matter how hard she tries
Her secret disguise behind the lies
And at night she cries away her pride
With eyes shut tight and staring at her insides
All her friends know why she can't sleep at night
All her family asking if she's alright
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell
Well, all she's got to do is stop kidding herself

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long
(You're too weak to face me)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
When it comes to how to live his life, he can't be told
Says he's got it all under control
Thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with
But in reality, it'd be a problem to just quit
An addict, and he can't hold the reigns
The pain is worse, 'cause his friends have it the same
Tries to slow down the problem he's got
But can't get off the carousel until he makes it stop

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
(You're too weak to face me)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington]
Fly with me under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me, I'll save you
Fly with me under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me, I'll save you
Just follow me
I never know just why you run
And I'll show you what you want to see
The part you hide from what's inside
Just follow me
So far away, away from me
And I'll show you what you want to see

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, with Mark Wakefield]
Ridin' with a head full of buckets of red
And what I said still stuck in my head
A thoroughbred, thoroughly bled
And led to the land of the never-come-backs
Smaller than a thumbtack, coulda never run from that
Dark planetary signs risin' over the horizon
Smaller than a fly, I stand over lyrical land
The power of a gun in my cynical hand with a pen, once again
Swimmin' in the center of the hit or the miss
A list of the thoughts gettin' lost in the mist
Realize the one, not the size of the fist
And the killin' of the killer with thе flick of the wrist

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna live in another place
No one'll say that I will live for them
Still, I see it's not meant to be for me
I wanna be with the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, with Mark Wakefield]
The second is gone, the weapon of time is stronger than a nuclear bomb
Eternity of half-life, somethin' that math can't write
You can't fight, nor flee
Still be around if it wasn't for me
Way that first whatever my friends
You can see the attraction of the payback
Don't mean to say that, playback the thing now
Gettin' lost in the chaos, tossin' it down
Singin' the din to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectics
Set this to the tempo to be on time
An addict to the panic in my confine
Singin' the din to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectics
Set this to the tempo to be on time
An addict to the panic in my confine

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna live in another place
No one'll say that I will live for them
Still, I see it's not meant to be for me
I wanna be with the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Bridge: Mark Wakefield]
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds

I wanna live in another place
No one'll say that I will live for them
Still, I see it's not meant to be for me
I wanna be with the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Singin' the din to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectics
Set this to the tempo to be on time
An addict to the panic in my confine
Singin' the din to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectics
Set this to the tempo to be on time
An addict to the panic in my confine

[Intro: Drake]
Woah, woah
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 2: Lil Durk & Drake]
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 3: Drake]
When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Intro: The Kid LAROI & Devenity Perkins]
Gonna feel sad that I have to be forcing you
I don't know, I don't know what you're hanging up on me for
I don't know what, I don't know what you're doing
I don't- And it's none of my business in a way and then
It's not- It's not onto me because whatever, I-
Of course, I'm gonna feel the way that I feel
But I-
Yeah (Yeah)

[Chorus]
It's getting kinda late now (It is, it is)
I should probably go home (I should, I should)
I got way too lit last night (I did, I did)
Still ended up on my own (Oh-oh, oh)
I was with KD last night (Okay, uh)
That's why I ain't pick up your call (I didn't, I didn't)
You said that you need some time (You do, uh)
You said you need time alone

[Verse]
Uh, drunk texting my ex, yeah (Brr)
Tell her you're the best for real, yeah (Tell her you're the best)
Wake up in thе nest (Damn)
Like why the fuck I text her that? (Shit)
She didn't even text me back (Oh, no)
My new bitch just texted me (Oh, oh)
She wanna go to the club
Get fucked up, girl, I get checks for that (Oh, oh)
I need ten no less than that (Oh)
Matter of fact, more than ten for that (Oh)
She blowin' up my phone
DND, don't need those messages (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
It's getting kinda late now (It is, it is)
I should probably go home (I should, I should)
I got way too lit last night (I did, I did)
Still ended up on my own (Oh-oh, oh)
I was with KD last night (Shoutout to KD)
That's why I ain't pick up your call (I didn't, I didn't)
You said that you need some time (You do, you do)
You said you need time alone (Alone, oh)

[Intro]
Uh
Troy Taylor, you the G.O.A.T

[Verse 1]
Heard you're out here on the rebound
Bet you want me to put the D down
In the group text with the team now
Spill it, then we fill it, then you leave out, uh
Why is it every time that we say we're done
We always ending up, ending up back at square one?

[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck me once, shame on you
Fuck me twice, that won't do
Told me that last time would be our last time
Guess you like breaking rules
Girl, I can't act like you
Are the only one that's confused
'Cause I gotta do better with the choices I choose

[Chorus]
If you're lookin' for closure, don't take your clothes off
No matter how hard we try, we can't say it's over
We goin' in circles (Circles)
Keep goin' in circles
You know we're just gon' do this over and over, over and over
Over and over again
We goin' in circles (Keep goin' in)
Keep goin' in circles
Over and over again

[Verse 2]
It's a catch 22
'Cause when we win, we lose
I can't get over you
And over gettin' overused
Overdue, overtime
Overnight, over mind
Out of sight, out of mind
Shit been gettin' outta line
Feelin' like we back in time, rewind

[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck me once, shame on you
Fuck me twice, that won't do
Told me that last time would be our last time
Guess you like breaking rules
Girl, I can't act like you
Are the only one that's confused
'Cause I gotta do better with the choices I choose

[Chorus]
If you're lookin' for closure, don't take your clothes off
No matter how hard we try, we can't say it's over
We goin' in circles (Circles)
Keep goin' in circles
You know we're just gon' do this over and over, over and over
Over and over again
We goin' in circles (Keep goin' in)
Keep goin' in circles
Over and over again

[Bridge]
Baby, we just cannot close that door
What we got right here is too real to ignore
But when you take me back, it's back and forth
'Cause we can't spell closure and unless we're sure
So let's be sure, let's be more
You can be mine, I'll be yours, oh, oh, oh
If you wanna make things right
Baby, just take my advice

[Chorus]
If you're lookin' for closure, don't take your clothes off
No matter how hard we try, we can't say it's over
We goin' in circles (Circles)
Keep goin' in circles
You know we're just gon' do this over and over, over and over
Over and over again
Goin' in circles (Keep goin' in)
Keep goin' in circles
You know we're just gon' do this over and over, over and over
Over and over again
We goin' in circles (Keep goin' in)
Keep goin' in circles
Over and over again

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left

I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall

(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse

I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall

(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you, too
Right inside your skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
(I feel the light betray me)
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
(I feel the light betray me)

It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Dorothy Moore, Dorothy Moore]
Six
Oh, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I'd get you off my mind
But I can't
Just the thought of you (Just the thought of you)
Turns my whole world Nipsey Blue

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg & Dorothy Moore, Dorothy Moore]
Six
Oh, homie
Just the mention of your name (Mention of your name)
Makes me wanna, paint my game
Listen to me, homie
When I think of the things we used to do, ooh, ooh
And my whole world turns Nipsey Blue

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Dorothy Moore, Dorothy Moore]
Six
Oh, oh, oh-oh, homie
I should forget you
Heaven knows I tried (I've tried)
Homie
When I say that I'm glad we're through
That's on myself, I know I've lied
I've liеd, I've lied
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Neighborhood Nipsey
Six

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Dorothy Moore, Dorothy Moore]
Oh, homie
It's been such a long, long time
Looks like I'd get you, off my mind
But I can't (Can't, can't)
Just the thought of you (Just the thought of you), my love
My whole world turns Nipsey Blue (Nipsey Blue)

[Outro: Snoop Dogg & Dorothy Moore, Dorothy Moore]
Six
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, homie
Oh I can't (Oh I can't)
Forget you
My whole world turns Nipsey Blue (Nipsey Blue)
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, homie
Oh I know (I know)
My whole world turns Nipsey Blue (Nipsey Blue)
Homie, homie, homie, homie, homie, homie
Homie, I can't forget you
My whole world turns Nipsey Blue

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors and then rapidly
Just turn around and start asking me
About things that you want back from me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place, to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
(Maybe someday I'll be just like you and)
Step on people like you do and
Run away the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should've known
That you'd wear out your welcome
And now you see how quiet it is, all alone

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Stay away
I am so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Sick)
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (Oh)
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Why?)
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (Stay away from me)
While I find a place to rest
Stay away from me (Motherfucker)

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break)

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to)
Break

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up
Shut up
Shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up
Shut up
Shut up
Shut up
I'm about to break

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to)
Break

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(It starts with one) One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually bе
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Rememberin' all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're somеone
You live what you've learned

You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You love the things I say I do
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you
You take away, when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned

You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned

You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and (Mike Shinoda)]
You like to think you're never wrong (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned

You want someone to hurt like you (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily façade, but then
I just end up getting hurt again

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself)
I ask why (Myself)
I can't rely on myself (Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
If I turn my back, I'm senseless
And to go blindly seems defenseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go, I'll be outrun
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outdone
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself)
I ask why (Myself)
I can't rely on myself (Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself (But in my mind, I find)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
How do you think
I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid (I'm so afraid, I'm so afraid, I'm so afraid)
That I'm out of touch (hcuot fo tuo m'I)
How do you expect (How do you expect)
I will know what to do
When all I know (When all I know)
Is what you tell me to?

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside
Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in
I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking

[Verse: Mk.gee]
Just be there in the moment, stay
Gotta lock the painting in your head
I guess it's hard to learn the right way
Can I stay a little longer
Leaving you won't make me stronger
I've traveled far and yonder
She's the strongest boy in town
But she's never been
Tuff enough for all the bigger boys
He's the sweetest girl around
But he's never been
Pure enough for all the other girls
Tell tell me I'm a tuff girl
Tell me I'm a pretty boy
Soft salty kiss
Pink pretty piss
Touch clutch clit
Wet wavy whisk
Body booty brisk
Tender bender bliss
I got my fears I got em dressed up
I got my demons they're a little messed up
Bless up fess up
Open up open wide
Do you wanna go outside
I put on lipstick I wear my velvet
Shake my body move my pelvis
Take me where the love is in the air

[Start from Take 1.]

[Verse 1]
The diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along, oh
To a handsome mannered baton

[Verse 2]
A blind class aristocracy
Back through the opera glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn

[Bridge]
Columnated ruins domino!

[Verse 3]
Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn

[Verse 4]
The music hall a costly bow
The music all is lost for now
To a muted trumpeter swan

[Bridge]
Columnated ruins domino
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?

[Verse 5]
Dove nested towers the hour was
Strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog
Two-Step to lamp lights cellar tune

[Verse 6]
The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne
The glass was raised, the fired rose
The fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting
While at port adieu or die

[Verse 7]
A choke of grief heart hardened, I
Beyond belief, a broken man too tough to cry

[Verse 8]
Surf's Up, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A children's song...

[Instrumental with wordless vocals]

Lyrics from snippet

Hey, I'ma visit the sky today
Hey, I’ma dance on the clouds today
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
Just 'cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us
No, nobody can be us
Lyrics from snippet

Girl, it's okay, you can call me by my real name
I kiss your legs, I kiss your eyes, I call you "Angel face"
And I've been single for half a decade
And I think I'm finally ready to settle down for like a bit
Until I hit the stage
And you got money, that's the last thing running through your mind
We always joke, but you can tell when you look me in my eyes
That I want you, that I want you, that I want you, babe
That I want you, that I want you, that I want you, babe
Come to my city, I like to say, I'm living pretty nice
4000 square feet at the Trump above the city lights
I got no furniture, I just moved here, but we can throw it down
Eviction number six from the Ritz, girl, I lost count of time

[Verse 1]
Medicate my soul with your lips, I need
I need to forget that my love's at peace
With another man who respects and treats
Treats her with a trust, and honesty

[Chorus]
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
But I just want to feel again, again
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"

[Verse 2]
Make me come alive, I just want to breathe
I've been up for days, I just want to sleep
Please relieve the stress, got me on my knees
So heal me with your warmth, give yourself to me

[Chorus]
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
But I just want to feel again, again
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh

[Chorus]
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
But I just wanna feel again, again
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
'Causе I'm about to break

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
'Cause I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
'Cause I'm about to
Break!

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I'm about to break!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to...

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up when I'm talking to you!

[Verse: The Weeknd]
The sun also rises for those who fail the call
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls
But I can do it if you think you really like that
I know what you really want, baby, baby, baby
I can do it if you think you really like that
You should run, baby, run, baby, run, baby, run

Walkin' on the water
Waitin' on a wave
To swallow all my pity
And wash it all away
Love me in the evenin'
Forget me with the moon
I'm callin' on my demons again

My head goes up
I don't hand me down, no more

'Cause all I need is you, mmm
Find me somethin' to believe in again
Again

My head goes up
I don't hand me down, no more

[Verse 1]
(Hannah, be free)
When a shot turns a stare into a smile
And smiles into removals of a dress
(Hannah, be free)
She got confidence, and her mind is so strong
And she's been loaded like a gun
(Hannah, be free)

[Pre-Chorus]
And the Bible compels her to resist the thing she most appreciates
(Hannah, be free)
And she hide all the demons with her makeup
Painting lies all on her face

[Chorus]
Hannah is free (Free), free (Free), free (Free, free)
Hannah is free (Free), free (Free), free (Free, free)
Hannah is (Hannah, be free), Hannah and Evelyn (Free)

Her lips, so cold, high heels, open toes
Hardly wearing any clothes
(Evelyn's free)
She's got confidant, this friend don't like men
But does what Evelyn says

[Pre-Chorus]
And the Bible compels her to resist the thing she most appreciates
(Hannah is free)
And she hide all the demons with her makeup
Painting lies all on her face

Evelyn's free (Free), free (Free), free (Free, free)
Evelyn's (Hannah, be free), Hannah and Evelyn (Free)

[Outro]
These girls keep touching on they bodies, ooh, yeah
These girls keep touching on they bodies, ooh, yeah
I think that they should get acquainted
Like "Hi, what's your name and your agent?"
These girls born in nineties are dangerous
So let's all get faded
These girls keep touching on they bodies
Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro]
Oh my god, uh
Oh my god, uh
Talk, talk to me
Yeah
Oh my god, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my god, bitch, you really got me fucked up (Fucked up)
Said I was done, but I keep pourin' out my cup, uh (Cup, uh)
Got all these kids around, they screaming "Fuck love" (Fuck love)
I get fucked up and start to wish that it was just us (Just us)

[Chorus]
Still got trust issues from way back, yeah (I do)
I wish you would hear me to make plans (No, no)
I don't want love, I wanna make bands
I need your company girl and it takes a lot to say that, but I need to say that to you, no

[Verse]
You say that its toxic, its so unhealthy
I know that you try, but girl, you can't help me
You gotta show me that you love me girl, and not tell me
Yeah, I got all this money but I still feel empty, uh woah

[Intro: Dylan Brady]
Oh, can you hear me now
I don't wanna go back, not now
It's been too long for us

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
I love you so much, I can't take it back, but I'll try
I can't see anymore you know
What do you want from me

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Oh, can you hear me now
I don't wanna go back, not now
It's been too long for us

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
Everything you said
Yeah, it cut me so deep, so deep, so deep
And I'll always look back
I don't wanna go back, go back, go back
I don't wanna see you again
I don't wanna see you, take you back, everything you said
Too much on my mind, throwing up on sidewalks
And I'm always feeling like I'm on a tightrope
And I said d-d-d-do you think I need a sweater
And you said "Well, I hope you get better"

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Oh, can you hear me now
I don't wanna go back, not now
Its been too long for us

[Post-Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I don't want anything more
I'm doing fine going alone

They think that anywhere you are, I should be leaving
I got all this flying money I'm receiving

Feels like I live with my head inside of a TV

Indiscernible lyrics

[Verse: Dylan Brady]
N-now no-now we back causing mischief
Hold it back, do you feel it?
See your face in the mirror
And your nails in the dresser
I-I I-I don't wanna read the letter
We don't have to talk, it's better
Sometimes I think you wanna kill me
Sometimes I don't know who I'm kidding

[Verse: Laura Les]
Look-look-look
I had to get a rhythm real quick
I'm taking pills that shorten my dick
Th-th-th-th-th-they're in my hand and in my tummy
We're smoking estradiol gummies
My ears are dripping blood onto the carpet
Open up the window, someone farted
Everybody's looking at me funny
Oh shit, I triеd to smoke my money
I'm pinching crumbs out of my pocket
I'm smoking weed that smells like dog shit
My phone is sitting on the table
Thank God, I thought I fucking lost it
I-I-I just bought an ounce for the weekend
Feels like I'm always fucking crying
I guess the devil's in the details
I guess its all about the timing

[Verse: S3RL]
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh
I want a hentai g-g-gec girl for me to make me happy
I want her so I can stop using my hand
Every single day, while watching anime
I'd pull her from my screen just like in my dreams
I want to feel her touch, really on my crotch (oh wow)
I want my own hentai girl and she would sing

I blow it out the window, I'll kick down my fucking house

What they feel like, I'm so basic
Shiny sorta, walk for miles
My diamonds feed the fire

Mhm
Could we speak a while in confidence?
Shall we blaze a trail through common sense?
The night ignites dreams of the past
The light invites thoughts to move past

As the dust warns me of it's coming, ooh
I'm reminded of the longing, ooh
Which doesn't spare me my fall
I can't get, I can't get through to you at all

Could we lie a while in silence?
Or shall we reconvene once we're cleansed of our sins?
The comfort of sex seems to bе (aah)
The only escape made available to me

As your skin soaks into my skin, ooh
It seems reason enough to begin again
But slowly I recall how
I can't get, I can't get through to you at all

Could you whisper another lie to me?
Shall we bask in false security?
I'd rather play dumb than sleep alone tonight
Pretend that I don't know a thing about you and him
It's enough to make me shiver, ooh
Almost enough to make me cry (cry)
But not enough to make me call
But I can't get, I can't get through to you at all

[Verse 1]
I found you once, and I'll find you again
Your cells are ringin' bells, singin, "God is dead"
God is dead, God is dyin'
The poison's in the dose, true
And I've had just enough of my fill of my failure to possess you
And for the second time today
I repeat something only we would say

[Chorus]
Now is it true you're goin' out of your head?
Riskin' perfection with somebody else
Oh, no more ridiculous than life itself

[Verse 2]
Buddy, what's wrong? Like the angel of death
Stopped by to ask about the extra room you rent
It's not like you, tell him to leave
Did you really have to ask him in? Sing him to sleep
And are you really so surprised
At just what a lost man's love looks like?

[Chorus]
Now is it true you're goin' out of your head?
Riskin' perfection with somebody else
Oh, no more ridiculous than life itself
Life itself

[Verse 1]
Flyin' on past in your voodoo mask
High on your own supply
And the way that you hold my hand to the bone
Honestly ain't half bad

[Chorus]
No
What about life on the ground
Makes you feel so strange
Without the blues you're tethered to
I'm sure you’d float away
"I had a dream and you were in it"
Is all you had to say

[Verse 2]
Guess what? I love you
Someone's gotta clean up the mess
There's parties to end in the kingdom of men
Someone's gonna need a new dress

[Chorus]
No
What about life on the ground
Makes you feel so strange
Without the blues you're tethered to
I'm sure you’d float away
"I had a dream and you were in it"
Is all you had to say
Is all you had to say

[Verse 1]
I was born on February 24th, 1970
The day I was delivered they said I would build a legacy
Picture me with influence that last generations
I was made out of love to keep you happy and educated
The first three letters of the alphabet my name
I made you laugh, I made you dance, I made you sing
I been around the world and back, you recorded my almanac
So dearly way before the fact me and pops was estranged
My father was a public figure, bigger than life
Lived as a winner, on stages alike
Rivers of people surely united, just to see our bond
Time carried on, that was a common thread
My perfect father had many flaws
Still they moved they legs and shook they heads in unison
He had more children, I was the oldest
We always played with each other 'fore they ruined 'em
He told me his personal secrets, childhood catching on beatings
Sexually touched and abused, never seen life in a school
The price of being iconic was demonic and screwed
I stood on stage and had to watch my father on the news
Stress on the head of my spirit, I was lost and confused
I knew both sides of the story, but still, I couldn't choose
See, it was more than humiliation and bein' sued
They crucified my affiliation for points to prove
And now my purpose for livin' makes no difference to you
My total existence was for makin' a smiling move
They said that I'll live forever
But the moment he died, more accusations arrived
I had to die too

[Verse 2]
I remember takin' my first breath August 28th, 1963
The whole nation had saved the day, I made it on TV
My come out was a standing ova', the crowd in disbelief
How could a group of words be so great?
Designed to make you think
Races and faces embracin' my conscience in letter form
How gracious was I speakin' on changes once outside the norm?
The person responsible, my creator
He never conformed or used hatred to form mass retaliation
Watch him perform with conviction
Two hundred and fifty thousand souls left they homes to listen
I gather his thoughts in abundance made to complete the mission
His life became heroic, then tables turned
My creator stripped from being a poet because he yearned
Other women, infidelity stricken, I can't say he was perfect
It made me nervous, they tear him down and forget me
I prayed that I survived in the midst of the controversy
How many lives'll fall on deaf ears if I'm not worthy?
I won't justify his personal problems, that's not my job
I was only born to make sure your children can play outside
And I imagine the other demons he hid before he died
If they came to surface this dream probably won't be alive
Because of you

[Verse 3]
I was born in paranoia, it's poison for us
We can't create with joyous ambition, we're out of luck
The critics formed a new coalition and huddled up
The non-creators are now elated and out of touch
Why can't you gladly appreciate the influence we give?
Stop starin' at me disgusted, my substance made sure you'd lived
You want the head of the messenger and the history from him
Which eventually takes away from the good you accustom
Think of a life without the likes of imagination that's prosperin'
The bodies that you consider genius, you like to box 'em in
The great debaters and thinkers, they gave you a voice
Why can't you prosecute the crimes and not the thoughts I employ?
Because your better judgement will always look down on me
But if I recollect how we connect, you'll account on me
I got a theory that most of y'all won't allow to see
It goes like this, talent doesn't choose morality
See, if Daniel Hale was a killer, would you not want a heart?
If Carl Benz was a racist, would you stop driving cars?
I can't help we jump in these bodies and you called them a god
Just know the Earth is just a rock without the voices of art
Sincerely yours

One thing I can't stand is a messy lil’ bitch
And a lotta y'all niggas undercover male groupies

[Chorus: Baby Keem & Kendrick Lamar]
Doing what I want, yeah, I'm filthy

Handsome, say she wanna fuck me 'cause I'm handsome
I'm the type that get sexy on a bitch
Put respect up on my name, ho, I'm heavy in this bitch, yeah

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Big chillin' with my foolies and we all cool

[Intro]
I woke this mornin' undecided
My demons takin' over my life, yeah
Sooner or later it's a family divided
These patterns gettin' hard to hide, yeah

[Chorus]
They say I should be satisfied
They tell me I got the world, but that's a lie
I wished the way I feel could be pacified, sometimes
I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Oh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

[Verse]
If I told you I'm 'bout to break would you look at me different?
Character out of place, would I lose your attention?
Let me know your intentions, cause lately I been watchin' everybody
It's apparent that transparency never seen monotony
Got off of tour, lookin' for closure
Mixin' emotions of bein' grateful and feelin' like some of y'all gettin' over
What's a puppet on stage, singin' and dancin' ablaze?
But trading his worth, distorted by the money that's made
A slave with a verse, I feel like Prince Rogers
I feel liberation is free, I feel I should miss the Oscars
Are you celebrating me as the artist or just a profit?
A question I have for the ones around me that's turnin' toxic
My lungs been heavy from all the smokescreen boobytraps
Reminiscin' on what it was, and knowin' that this ain't that
I vision a rock in a hard place
Hope my daughter isn't born with a piece of my heartbreak
You know stress carries on and your kids reap the mistakes that you made
And I admit that I can be dismissive if I can't relate
And I admit that I only commit to start playin' games
And I admit that I'm bad at talkin' myself out of shame
But who's to blame when the crowds stop cheerin' and they passin' dirty looks?
I now understand that I'll never be understood

[Bridge]
Isolation didn't work for me (Work for me)
Socializing didn't work for me even
Prayed about it, didn't work for me (Work for me)
You can't cure this disease
The pain too traumatic for relief
Pull up the curtains, let the audience see

[Chorus]
I wish I was somebody (Somebody else, oh, somebody else, oh)
Anybody but myself  (Somebody else, oh)
Oh, I wish I was somebody  (Somebody else, oh)
Anybody but myself

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Sunday Service Choir]
How many of us slept tonight?
And they still all deny us
And they still all deny us
Locked up, fighting fires
Prisoners, fighting fires
And they still deny us
And they sell and buy us
I might be biased
My soul

[Chorus: Kanye West & Sunday Service Choir]
I might be biased
Prisoners, fighting fires
And they still deny us (My soul)
And they sell and buy us
I might be biased, but my soul
This alone
Jesus come down, take control (My soul)
My soul

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Sunday Service Choir]
A life at risk, oh
Less they want storm, nights of mist, oh
Ahh, do do do,

Come down, lords enter my soul
Come down, lords enter my soul (My soul)

Oh no, my soul

[?]

[Outro: Kanye West & Sunday Service Choir]
My soul
My soul (My soul, oh)

[Verse 1]
Look at us lookin' out, out the world through glass
While the hands on the clock spin around too fast
Gotta say I've had enough
Time to live at last
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Lose yourself for a night
Make your own mistakes
Speak the words on your mind
That you never say
What's a day without a risk?
Do it differently
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby

[Chorus]
I wanna do more (Hey)
I wanna do everything I've ever dreamed of
I wanna do more (Ooh-hoo)
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I wanna do more
(I wanna do) More
(I wanna, wanna do) More
I wanna do more (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Finally I can see what my heart needs now
Hold my hand, dance with me, we can paint this town
What are we waiting for?
Time to live out loud (Eh-eh-ah-eh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby

Favorite drunken call
Oh, say you will be mine
Say you will be mine

[Chorus]
I wanna do more (Hey)
I wanna do everything I've ever dreamed of
I wanna do more (Ooh-hoo)
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because

I wanna do more (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Maybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright
Why don't we hold еach other, use each othеr, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes

[Post-Chorus]
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

[Verse 2]
In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)

[Post-Chorus]
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

[Bridge]
Maybe one day, I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
For tonight
Pretend that it's all alright
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes

[Verse 1]
I don't know, don't know how it seems but
I ain't tryna take your freedom
I just wanna know where your heart's at
'Cause it's been so long since you text back
Got me wondering what happened
I see them pictures of you laughing
I don't wanna run out of time to
Tell you how I feel about you

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I don't wanna overthink
But I don't wanna miss a thing
I'm not expecting anything
I'm just asking you to

[Chorus]
Try to believe I'm the one for you
Try to see from the other side
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could I would try
To put nobody before you
Give you all of me 'til I die
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could, I would try

[Verse 2]
You let me, let me, let mе love you
But only, only when you want to
It's good that we'rе both staying busy
I just wanna know if you miss me
Take a second and imagine
See it all before it happens
If you feel the vibe, make it times two
You don't have to ask, you know I do, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I don't wanna overthink
But I don't wanna miss a thing
I'm not expecting anything
I'm just asking you to

[Chorus]
Try to believe I'm the one for you
Try to see from the other side
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could I would try
To put nobody before you
Give you all of me 'til I die
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
'Cause you know if I could, I would try

[Bridge]
I've been waiting for you to give me something
All my patience, don't let it be for nothing
I've been (I've been) waiting (Waiting)
For you to give me something
I'm just asking you to

[Chorus]
Try to believe I'm the one for you
Try to see from the other side
Baby, give me a night or two
Try to believe I'm the one for you
Try to see from the other side
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
To put nobody before you
Give you all of me 'til I die
Baby, give me a night or two
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
'Cause you know if I could, I would try
'Cause you know if I could, I would try

But don't take me the wrong way
Cause God took me a long way
Everything you seeing on me
They wanna edit the interviews
They wanna take it to interludes
Cut a whole sentence to interlude
You know that it's fake if it's in the news
So I let it fly when I'm in the booth
The devil a liar and I been the truth
Living cause nobody living
And nobody getting it, doing it different

[Chorus]
Rain down on us
Holy Spirit, come down
Holy Spirit, come down
We need You now
Wash us in the blood
Whole life being thugs
No choice selling drugs
Genocide, what it does

Nobody's breaking me down

[Verse 2]
My body's against the wall
No attention anymore

[Chorus]
If towers fall, if nothing stands
I’ll build again the world by my baby’s hands
At the end of all, there’s all they claim and then

[Verse 1]
I saw the news again
To hear that the world’s to end in flames
I’d not complain, I’ve seen the love of my baby
Be on the take, or talkin’ of slaughter over cake
Would kneel and break
Speak of the love of my baby

[Chorus]
If towers fall, if nothing stands
I’ll build again the world by my baby’s hands
At the end of all, there’s all they claim and then

[Verse 2]
The angels can know their place
Let heaven hidе its face in sheer disgrace
Oh, look upon the lovе of my baby
Those who wield the chain
Are pushing the wheels of fear and shame
Forget their name
Hear of the love, the love, the love

[Chorus]
If towers fall, if nothings stands
I’d build again the world by my baby’s hands
The unamable, the unmade again
And then

[Bridge]
So hurry up and start
Can’t wait for the world to fall apart
‘Cus here unmarked
Would still be the love, the love, the love

[Intro]

Laid back the Maybach, this ain't a Challenger, yeah

[Verse 1]
Look at us lookin' out, out the world through glass
While the hands on the clock spin around too fast
Gotta say I've had enough
Time to live at last
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Lose yourself for a night
Make your own mistakes
Speak the words on your mind

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind goin' places it ain't wanna go
Sometimes I get a little too low
And I can't see myself through the fire and smoke
And you, like a neon light
Shinin' through a door that I can't keep closed
And you, like a rolling stone
Always buildin' cities on the hearts that you broke

[Chorus]
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I stay up all night
'Cause you don't ever talk to me in my dreams
And I think about eventually you're holdin' me
And dancin' to the record like a movie scene

[Chorus]
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Sometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind goin' places it ain't wanna go

[Chorus]
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I still feel high

[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Friends say, I'm away
Because I'm down with you every day
They say, break away
I'm missing out on the fun and games
But you smile and the words they tell me quickly disappear
You speak and there is no other voice that I can hear

[Chorus]
I spend my days (Ooh, ooh)
With you (I spend my days)
I spend my nights (My nights)
Thinkin' about you (Thinkin' about you, babe)
I spend my days (All day, all night)
With you (with you)
I spend my nights (My nights)
Thinkin' about you

[Verse 2]
You stay on my mind, oh
And I think about you all the time (All the time)
Day and night
Feels so right
And for us, there is no end in sight, ooh
Each day that I spend around you
Passes by too fast
Each night that I spend without you
Is longer than the last

[Chorus]
I spend my days (I spend my days)
With you (Thinkin' about you, babe)
I spend my nights (My nights)
Thinkin' about you (All day, all night)
I spend my days (My days)
With you (Thinkin' about you)
I spend my nights (My nights)
Thinkin' about you (Thinkin' about you, babe)

[Outro]
Ooh, you know I can't get enough of you (Can't get enough, yeah)
Uh-uh, you know that 24 hours won't ever, ever do (Yeah, yeah)
I spend my days, with you (With you, with you)
I spend my nights (my nights) thinkin' about you
I spend my days (I spend my days) with you (with you, baby)
I spend my nights (all day, all night) thinkin' about you (All day, all night)
I spend my days (thinkin' about you) with you (Thinkin' about you)
I spend my nights (I spend my days, oh yeah) thinkin' about you
I spend my days (with you) with you (thinkin' about you)
I spend my nights (thinkin' about you, baby)
Thinkin' about you
I spend my days (All day, all night)
With you (All day, all night)

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
I am black ambition
I am always whisperin'
They keep tellin' me I will not
But my will won't listen
Gravity on a black man
With everything on his back and
His family and passion
If the doors ain't crackin'

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
You gotta let go (Let go)
If you want to fly, take the leap
You gotta risk it all (Risk it all)
Or they'll be lots of things you'll never see
You gotta let, let go
'Cause you never know what's in store
Mister entrepreneur

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
In this position with no choice
A system imprison young black boys
Distract with white noise
The brainwashed become hype boys
Third eye dilate
You wasn't supposed to make it off Sеction Eight
Robbin' Peter just to pay Paul
Preparе to risk everything

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
You need let go (Let go)
If you want to fly, take the leap
You gotta risk it all (Risk it all)
Or they'll be lots of things you'll never see
Remember black is space
And its the color of your face
There will be no sunny days
If Black went away

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Uh, lies told to you, through YouTubes and Hulus
Shows with no hues that look like you do
Black Twitter, what's that? When Jack gets paid, do you?
For every one Gucci, support two FUBUs
Sippin' crip-a-Cola consumer and a owner, uh
'Til we all vertically integrated from the floor up
D'Usse pourer, sip Ace 'til I throw up
Like gang signs 'cept I bang mines for both ya
Serial entrepreneur, we on our own
Stop sittin' around waitin' for folks to throw you a bone
If you can't buy the building at least stock the shelf (Word)
Then keep on stackin' 'til you stockin' for yourself, uh
See, everything you place after black
Is too small a term to completely describe the act
Black nation, black builder, black entrepreneur
You in the presence of Black Excellence and I'm on the board
Lord Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord

[Intro]
It is if everyone dies alone
Does that scare you?
I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 1]
I look for you
Every day, every night
I close my eyes
From the fear, from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
Diе for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
Whilе my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
Die for, die for, die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
Die for, die for, die for

[Verse 2]
I long for you
Just a touch (Does that scare you?)
Of your hand
You don't leave my mind
Lonely days, I'm feeling
Like a fool for dreaming

[Pre-Chorus]
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile, smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
Die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
Die for, die for, die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down, down, down

[Outro]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway (Oh)
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Just want somebody to die for
Die for, die for, die for
Die for, die for, die for
Die for, die for, die for
Die for, die for, die for

Baby, I know you feelin' me
But you know that you're killin' me
And if I do know any better, I would a thought you're my enemy
By the way that you teasing me and you know you wanna give it to me
But you keep holdin' back on the cookie, saying that I got too many
But you know it's a lie, I'm the type of guy
That will make you feel so nice that you can't deny
Just so attached to me and you don't know why
And you gonna end up in a limo showing me how to ride

Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse]
I'm tryna get close to you
'Cause to be honest, I hate being alone, yeah
And to be honest I been did wrong so baby my heart cold
I just wish I could just show you
I got some feelings that I won't show you
Keep 'em aside, you won't ever know, yeah
Oh, you want me to open up, no
'Cause, I do not know what you gon' do with it whenever we fight

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's got you tweakin', girl it ain't easy for me to have a talk, imma keep it real
Talkin' 'bout you need me, she say "Do you love me?", I say that I do, but I never will (Ha)
Okay, let me keep it real, I'ma keep it a hunnid
I ain't gon' lie, that it ain't just you, there's a whole lotta others
And since you prolly know some of them', they on Gucci and Prada
And oh my God, I can't stop thinking this is somebody's daughter

[Chorus]
The way she bust it for the team, bust it for the team
If she don't do it for the 'gram, she gon' bust it off a bean
God damn, sellin' shit is something I ain't never seen
Something off a movie scene, I'm too focused on the green
To be worried 'bout the next bitch

[Chorus]
95 in the 60, the way you ride
I'ma give you all your fantasies
I ain't worried 'bout them panties, pull it to the side
I'ma give you all your fantasies
('Mano)

[Verse]
Make you feel something that you didn't know (Hmm, hmm)

I'll give you this love, you know it's nothing like (Hmm, hmm)
You know tonight I'll treat your body right (Hmm, hmm)

[Chorus]
95 in the 60, the way you ride
And we smoking on that good weed, going high
Got you living out your fantasies (Hmm, hmm)
Give you everything that you want and need

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, that's a side (Hmm, hmm)
She be on that brown, she on white (Hmm, hmm)
Slizzy Sity, she gon take a ride (Hmm, hmm)
She a good girl 'til the night (Hmm, hmm)
That's a side (Hmm, hmm)
She be on that brown, she on white (Hmm, hmm)
I might pop a bean, she gon' try (Hmm, hmm)
Paper planes floating, she so high
And I can't lie (Hmm, hmm)

[Bridge]
Truth or dare, maybe I should ask you more
Or maybe it'd be crazy if your clothes come off
Truth or dare, maybe I should ask you more
Or maybe it'd be crazy if your clothes come off

[Chorus]
95 in the 60, the way you ride
I'ma give you all your fantasies
I ain't worried 'bout them panties, pull it to the side
I'ma give you all your fantasies (Fantasies)

And we smoking on that good weed, going high
Got you living out your fantasies (Hmm, hmm)
Give you everything that you want and need

Yeah, that's a side (Hmm, hmm)
She be on that brown, she on white (Hmm, hmm)
Slizzy Sity, she gon take a ride (Hmm, hmm)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I lost all my friends, damn, I had to learn the hard way
Started from the bottom, damn right, we came a long way
Talk down on my name, yeah, they try to take it all away
Never had it easy, no, they always made it hard for me
Never gave me shit, had to get my own grip
I ain't perfect, I admit
I kept going, never quit
I provided for my fam, I made sure my dog's ate
Told my shawty 'Bae, I love you, I fuck with you the long way'

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't need no friends, I'm countin' bands in this new Chanel
Who gon' stick around to the end? Only time will tell
Tried to shoot me down, dig a hole for my funeral
'Said I fall off, little bitch, you delusional

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
Can't apologize, nah, bitch, it ain't no excuse
Where were you when I was down bad, wouldn't give me nothing
People only seem to come around when they need something
You left me in the storm by myself, I was all alone
Diamond cross necklace, hope it only ain't good to my soul
Homies got the judge and got me feeling like Tupac
I heard that's what you gotta go do when you're this sad

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I don't need no friends, countin' bands in these YSL's
Throw a couple racks at little shawty 'cause she bad as hell
Diamond audemar on my wrist, it's a two tone
Wait a minute, hold up, who is this? This a new phone

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

Lovin', some ****

'Cause love don't come easy, it don't come easy
Love don't come easy, yeah, givin' up easy

Times get hard, but nothing's easy

[Verse 2: Summer Walker, Aminé & Both]

And all I need's some

[Pre-Chorus: Both, Aminé & Summer Walker]
Lovin', some ****

Tell yourself you got this

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright

Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Don't worry, baby
I'm safe and sound

[Chorus]
Down in the dungeon
Just Peachеs and me
Don't I love her so?
'Causе you made me live again
Yeah

[Verse 2]
A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

[Pre-Chorus]
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

[Chorus]
Down in the front row, it's Freddie and me
Don't I love him so?
Don't I love him so?

With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?

Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too

How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And left me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Another one bites the dust, yeah
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah

And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah

I'm hanging on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat

I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh, how I want to be free, baby
Oh, how I want to be free
Oh, how I want to break free

[Verse 3]
But lifе still goes on
I can't get used to living without, living without
Living without you by my sidе
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, I got to make it on my own
So baby, can't you see?
I've got to break free

[Outro]
Oh, so Lisbon, can't you see?
God knows I want to
God knows I got to
God knows I want to break free

[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody (Somebody)
Somebody (Somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Let me hear this piano!

[Verse 2]
I work hard (He works hard)
Every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end (At the end of the day)
I take home all my hard-earned pay
All on my own (Goes home on his own)
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
'Til the tears run down
From my eyes, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

[Bridge]
(He works hard) Everyday (Everyday)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody always tries to break me down (Ooh)
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain (Ahh)
I got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, Lord)
Somebody
Somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm okay, I'm alright
I ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
One day, I'm gonna be free, Lord
Come on, clap

[Outro]
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Somebody (Somebody)

Somebody find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me?
Hey, whoo! Oh yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Can anybody find me?
Can anybody find me? Say yes!
I don't believe you
Can anybody find me? Yeah, yeah
Ooh, that sounds good
Can anybody find me, ha ha
Somebody to (Love)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Love don't give no compensation
Love don't pay no bills
Love don't give no indication
Love just don't stand still

[Chorus]
Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills, scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime, ruining your heartline
Stays for a lifetime, won't let you go
'Cause love, love, love won't leave you alone

[Verse 2]
Love don't take no reservations
Love is no square deal
Love don't give no justification
It strikes like cold steel

[Chorus]
Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills, scars you from the start
It's just a living pastimе, ruining your heartline
Stays for a lifetimе, won't let you go
'Cause love, love, love won't leave you alone
No, love, love, love won't leave you alone

[Bridge]
Love can play with your emotions
Open invitation to your heart
Love kills
It can play with your emotions
Open invitation to your heart
Love kills
Plays with your emotions
Open invitation to your heart
Love kills, love kills
Love, love, love, love, love

[Chorus]
Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills, tears you right apart

Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills, tears you right apart
It won't let go, it won't let go
Love kills

[Outro]
Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills

[Chorus]
What's sunshine with no rain
What's joy without the pain
And I'm still gon' do my thing
There ain't no holding me back
Aye I'mma get mine, believe that
And what's sunshine with no rain
And what's joy without the pain

[Verse 1]
The city fucked up, even thug niggas getting robbed
Know it's bad when the drug dealers getting jobs
Same niggas who skipped out on graduation
At the gas station filling out them applications, but
They ain't calling me back
Best friends be our references
Paychecks spent on necklaces
Down payments on thеm Lexus'
Debit in the nеgative
Overdraft, with the sky overcast
But I'm screaming fuck the pessimists
Cause ain't no holding me back
The lil' nigga had big dreams, to do big things
But in this game, everything ain't what this shit seems
Try hard, to climb up to the flag-pole
Just to find out that your heroes is some assholes

[Chorus]
What's sunshine with no rain
What's joy without the pain
And I'm still gon' do my thing
There ain't no holding me back
Aye I'mma get mine, believe that
And what's sunshine with no rain
And what's joy without the pain
What's sunshine with no rain
What's joy without the pain
And I'm still gon' do my thing
There ain't no holding me back
Aye I'mma get mine, believe that
And what's sunshine with no rain
And what's joy without the pain
But ain't no holding me back
I'mma get mine, believe that
Aye what's sunshine with no rain
Aye what's joy without the pain
Man I'm still gon' do my thang

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
It was all good just a week ago, niggas feel theyself
And that Watch the Throne drop, niggas kill theyself
What niggas gon' do, Hov?
This the new crack, on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that, niggas telling me, "You back!"
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
And if life's a bitch, bet she suck my dick, huh
And I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way, nigga, you should fucking quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli, I did it, joke's on you, motherfucker, and I get it, haha
No paper, ho, but you can have some more of me
Or-a-gy or are we speaking metaphorically?
Historically I'm kicking bitches out like Pam, nigga
Going HAM, nigga; me and Jigga
And a nigga still young, why I have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls, asses flat as shit
But the head's so good, damn, a nigga glad he hit
Got 'em jumping out the building, watch out below
A million out the door

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'm about to go HAM
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go HAM
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fuck y'all mad at me for?
Y'all don't even know what I've been through
I played chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been moved
I swam waters with Great Whites
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been chewed
I hustled with vultures late nights
Y'all muthafuckas woulda been food
Fuck wrong with these dudes? Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
Then maybe you could take a peek at these boos
Niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily
Like these rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like, "Really; half a billi,' nigga, really?" You got baby money
Keep it real with niggas, niggas ain't got my lady's money
Watch the throne, don't step on our robe
Bad enough we let you step on our globe
With my nephew die, daddy's dead
Nigga took the price on my uncle's head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncle's bread
Bow down, brother, pay homage
Don't spill hate all on my garments
Comme des Garçons, fuck yo' fresh
Head shots, nigga, fuck your vest
Fuck the pigs, no pork on my fork
Peace, God, 'cause you know a nigga just went

[Hook: Jay-Z]
HAM
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am
Yeah, I'm 'bout to go HAM
Hard as a motherfucker, let these niggas know who I am
Yeah, I'm 'bout to go HAM

[Outro]
Vivat rex in homine
Vivat rex in homine
Vivat rex in homine
Vivat rex in homine

[Chorus]
I was born to love you
With every little beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day
I was born to love you
With every little beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

[Verse 1]
You are the one for me
I am the man for you
You were made for me
You're my ecstasy
If I was given every opportunity
I'd kill for your love, yeah

[Verse 2]
So take a chance with me
Lеt me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream
And this drеam has come true
It's so hard to believe
This is happening to me

[Pre-Chorus]
An amazing feeling
Coming through

[Chorus]
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you, honey
Every single day of my life

[Verse 3]
I want to love you
I love every little thing about you
I want to love you, love you, love you
(Born) To love you
(Born) To love you
(Born) I, I was born to love you
(Born) To love you
(Born) To love you
Every single day

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
An amazing feeling
Coming through

[Chorus]
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life
I was born to love you
Every single day of my life

[Intro]
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba deh doh

[Verse 1]
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da doh

[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Verse 2]
Day day de
Da da da da da
Okay (Adam)
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Eе da ba ba ba
Ee da de
Be lap
Pеople on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da

[Chorus]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Bridge]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro]
'Cause love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

[Intro]
This song is dedicated to those who lost their lives last night in Orlando, Florida
And anybody that has been victim to any senseless violence or hatred

[Verse 1]
There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us?

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh

[Verse 2]
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh, yeah
Who dares to love forever
Oh, when love must die?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
So touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

[Chorus]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today
Who waits forever anyway?

[Verse 1]
Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Verse 2]
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another hеartache, another failed romancе, on and on
Does anybody wanna take it anymore?
I guess I'm learning (Learning)
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (Turning, turning), 'round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Bridge]
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday, will grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

[Chorus]
The show must go on, yeah, yeah
The show must go on, yeah
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

[Verse 3]
Ooh, I'll top the bill
I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
(On with the, on with the)
Show
The show must go on

[Intro: Brian May]
I wanna hear ya
Are you ready?

[Verse 1: Brian May & Crowd]
Ooh, love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me

[Chorus: Brian May & Crowd]
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me
Beautiful
The rest of you, don't be shy

[Verse 2: Brian May]
Ooh, love of my life, don't leave me
You've stolen my love
You now desert me

[Chorus: Brian May & Crowd]
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it mеans to me
Whoa, London's still the best

[Bridge: Brian May & Crowd]
You will rеmember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side
To remind you how
I still love you
I still love you, ooh
You guys are great!
Let's just have a few more of those lights, okay
Because they look so beautiful (Come on now, Brian!)
Let's make a universe, okay?

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude: Brian May]
Okay, for the rest of you
Let's go!

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
Oh, hurry back, hurry back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

[Outro: Freddie Mercury & Crowd]
Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
My body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro]
Alright, Sydney
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio (Radio)

[Verse 2]
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly (Radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)
Here we go!

[Chorus]
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All wе hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's nеw?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Bridge]
Radio ga ga
Radio ga ga
Radio ga ga
Yeah, yeah
Radio

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Outro]
You
You, yeah!

[Verse 1]
Here we stand and here we fall
History won't care at all
So make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won’t be home tonight

[Chorus]
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call, yeah
It comes to you as to us all
And we’re just waiting
For the hammer to fall, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, every night, every day
A little piece of you is falling away
So lift your face, the Western Way, baby
Build your muscles
As your body decays

[Chorus]
Tow the line and play their game
Yeah, let the anesthetic cover it all
'Til one day they call your name
Until it's time for the hammer to fall

[Bridge]
Rich or poor or famous
For your truth is all the same
Oh no, oh no
Lock your doors, rain is pouring
Through your window pane (Oh no)
Baby, now your struggle's all in vain, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder
And louder

[Chorus]
What the hell we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
Until it's time for the hammer to fall

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah
The hammer to fall, yeah
We're just waiting for the hammer to
Hammer to, hammer to fall!
Give it to me one more time!

[Chorus]
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it, I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

[Verse 1]
A-this thing (This thing)
Called love (Called love)
It cries (Like a baby)
In a cradle all night
It swings (Woo, woo)
It jives (Woo, woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
This crazy little thing called love

[Bridge]
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
She leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

[Break]

[Verse 2]
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride
On my motorbike until I'm ready
This crazy little thing called love
Brian!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh, yeah
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat (Ah hum)
Hitch-hike (Ah hum)
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready (Ready, Freddie?)
Crazy little thing called love, hey

[Chorus]
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready for

[Outro]
This crazy little thing called love (Yeah, yeah)
This crazy little thing called love (Yeah, yeah)
This crazy little thing called love (Yeah, yeah)
This crazy little thing called love
This crazy little thing called love
This crazy little thing called love, alright!

[Verse 1]
Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street
Gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Kicking your can
All over the place, singing

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

[Verse 2]
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shoutin' in the street
Gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face
You big disgrace
Waving your banner
All over the place

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you (Sing it again)
We will, we will rock you

[Verse 3]
Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes
Gonna get you some peace someday
You got mud on your face
Big disgrace
Somebody better put you back
Into your place

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you, sing it again
We will, we will rock you, everybody
We will, we will rock you, oh
We will, we will rock you, hey

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune
And everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge
Before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
Oh, we are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world
I pour my sake
Down the drain
Can't stand the thought of
Throwing up again
I feel my heart
Pound like the rain
Thinking “this could nothing or
This could be something”
Train car is lurching
Across the bay
The faces in the seats
Don’t ever change
Steetlights speed by
Like the days
Thinking “the world I come from
Is lost beneath the waves”

Life in Japan
Can we make it
Life in japan
Its what we wanted to be
Life in Japan
Can we shake it
Life in Japan
Ain’t what I thought it would be
Speakers blared out
First call to prayer
I marched to work
Through crowds in Thatcher Squarе
I saw you there in the crush
And just starеd
Thinking this could be nothing or
This could be something
Is your heart beating
Or pretend
And does it even matter
In the end
Your smile’s got the
The perfect bend
And your eyes are sparkling
Behind the latest lens

Life in Japan
Can we make it
Life in japan
Its what we wanted to be
Life in Japan
Can we shake it
Life in Japan
Ain't what I thought it would be
Arithmetic has gone backwards
Nothing adds up at all
Drifting though a town I know
And recognize nothing at all
This could be

All that I know
Is behind us
All that I know
All that I know
All that I know

Life in Japan
Can we make it
Life in japan
Its what we wanted to be
Life in Japan
Can we shake it
Life in Japan
Ain’t what I thought it would be
Can we make it
Its what we wanted to be
Can we shake it
Ain’t what I thought it would be

I’m home

[Verse 1]
We were hangin' in the morning
Feelin' all different kinds of things
We were talkin' about everything
From the past to the happenin'
We started talkin' 'bout devotion
The kind that goes on eternally
And I tell her I'm in love with her
But how can I know that I'll always be?

[Chorus]
She just said, "Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now"
That's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I in some kind of mood? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
She's in my—

[Verse 2]
I was happy just listening
No intention to be mentioning
We started talkin' 'bout the future
'Bout the notion I was motioning
I'm just so terrified to face her
Like any moment I might wake up
'Cause she's the only thing I think of
I told my mother that I love her

[Chorus]
She just said, "Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now"
That's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I being immature? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
She's in my—
In my—

[Outro]
I said, "We'll see, we'll see" (In my—)
We'll see
Ah, we'll see (In my—)
We'll see
Ah, we'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
See how it goes
Until we know what the future holds
Ah, we'll see
We'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see

Fit bae  gon' work out at home, she squat this pole like cardio
Too real Bobby got her jumping doing flips
Front flips, back flips

Stop me, stop me
And I'ma make you watch as I find
Find out different ways I can haunt you
So you lie, so you defy me
Defy me, defy me
Tell you everything, ooh
I'ma show the way I feel
Woah, oh yeah, woah, oh yeah
How you feel, I'ma show you how to feel
Woah, oh yeah, woah, oh yeah
It's time to go
I'm ready for love

This time it's love
I'm ready for her

Everybody there wants you
Ready for love

And I'll decide that you need me (I'll decide that you need to)
I'm ready for touch (oh yeah)

No, no, XO
No, ooh, oooh, eeeehe

Why would you wanna bring something between us?
There's nothing between us
Chill, stop, let it fall

And I walk with the Nina
And its late they ain't seen us (oh yeah)

And I don't stay till the morning
I've been gone
I-
And I can't be what you wanna see
I'm giving up (on love)

No, no, XO
No, ooh, oooh, eeeehe
Nooo, non, not gonna be

I don't need love
I don't get high
I don't need love
I don't need that
And I don't need love
And I don't give timе
And I don't need love
And I don't get high
And I don't need love
And I don't need that
And I don't need lovе
And I don't need that
And I don't need love
And I don't need that
Won't let it be love
Won't let her get that

I don't need love
I don't need that

[Intro: Kanye West]
La, la, la, la, la
And everybody say, say
La, la, la, la, la
I know you—I know you—

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I know you thinking, thinking that it must be
Armor-All flow 'cause it never get rusty
I ain't gotta say it, man, dog, trust me
Bust somebody head, GLC, where was we?
Still rock the Prada—'fore that, rock the Starter
Niggas had the Georgetown, the Magic way harder
Thinking back to the projects, and they way they tore 'em all up
Like when I do a project, and come back and tear the mall up

[Chorus: Common & Kanye West]
We coming from the Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, side of the Chi

[Verse 2: Common]
The broads, the cars, the half-moons, the stars
I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars
Burn CDs with no regard for the stars
Come to the crib with conflict diamonds and they ours
Back in '94, they called me Chi-town's Nas
Now, them niggas know I'm one of Chi-town's gods
We eating, Joe, you still talking no carbs
A conscious nigga with mack, like Steve Jobs

[Chorus: Common & Kanye West]
We coming from the Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, Southside
Southside, side of the Chi

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
And I'm from Chi-town (town)
That's why I fly ? (round)
Keep some carrier frames over my eyes now (now)
We used to gang bang a lot of that done died down
Children of the ? keeping hope alive now
All but no high, I do it so fly
? Attack helicopter with the bow tie
I love my city really hope that God bless it
Have my Mom moving faster than that hog in the hedges
Welcome all of yall to my dog ?
This is where I keep the bars like bathtub edges
My ivories and doves my leavers and my ?
It takes half of your bubble bath to match the freshness
The belly of the best you know I'm from it
Im wrapper then a towel here goes my pow in the stomach
And I be on my green like Irish spring
Then I coast fudge with it, get a mouth full of soap

[Outro]
And this concludes our Chicago show, please stay tuned

[Verse 1]
A baby moonlight hits the spotlight
I'm on my flight to take you away
I'm feeling so free
You're making me crazy
That's what you do, that's what you do
Let's go now

[Pre-Chorus]
Lickety split
A girl in a bit as she falls in a pit saying, "Hello, darling!"
Twisted insanity
Fallen humanity
All I want is some tranquility
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Well, c'mon, boy

[Chorus]
Uh, c'mon and take me to the other side
I'm blown away when I look into your eyes
I'm so in love
I think I'm gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash
It's up to you
And I don't wanna give you clues
We're moving fast
I think we got enough to lose
So, don't look back
Or else we're gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash

[Verse 2]
Like the first kiss with a sweet list
Of some love songs, oh yеah (So sexy, life is sassy, sassy, sassy)
And with this melody falling ovеr me
It makes me weak, so damn weak
So, let's go now

[Pre-Chorus]
Lickety split
A girl in a bit as she falls in a pit saying, "Hello, darling!"
Twisted insanity
Fallen humanity
All I want is some tranquility
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Well, c'mon, boy

[Chorus]
Uh, c'mon and take me to the other side
I'm blown away when I look into your eyes
I'm so in love
I think I'm gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash
It's up to you
And I don't wanna give you clues
We're moving fast
I think we got enough to lose
So, don't look back
Or else we're gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash

[Interlude]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la (la-la) la-la-la (Oh, yeah)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la (la-la) la-la-la

[Chorus]
Uh, c'mon and take me to the other side

So, don't look back
Or else we're gonna crash and get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash

[Intro]
Well, Darnell Boat here
And it seems like we've come to an end
It's been a long four years, lotta ups, and a lotta downs
But I just want you to know, Boat
I'm so, so proud of you
And of course, I'm proud of you too, Yachty, you know that
Both of y'all have put on a lot of pounds
But you've made a lot of money
Surprised me, actually, surprised us all
Now, I know what those people have been sayin'
And what they've said, but you know I know you both
Before all of this, you guys are still the same
Don't let any of this cloud your mind
You are who you are (Uh), because of who you are

[Verse 1]
Rather stay around with that MAC-10
Told 'em break in my back for those who won't bend
This bitch gon' fuck when the racks spend
Pullin' up with my pack and my brothers with me
Cameras rollin', I see how you actin'
You be cappin'
Niggas ain't on my side, and I know
They want me to fail and I know
Niggas playin', bangin', they G on my soul
Mm-mm, we done made it too far to go back now
We done made all of these stacks, look at plaques now
Beat all on her back, she get tired
Only get excited for a wire, twenty thousand dollars for my tires
They thought I was expired, that shit had me inspired

[Chorus]
Mm-hm, I can tell niggas need some motivation
I'ma be the face of the new nation
Gimme my paper like a citation
(Gimme my muhfuckin' credit, my respect, all that shit)
Closet lookin' like the salvation
You ain't rich yet 'cause you be impatient
I ain't done yet, I ain't complacent
Need a hunnid spots like a Dalmatian
Crib in every state, that's the real goal

[Verse 2]
She gon' eat it hot like a egg roll
And I think she mixed like a Oreo
And she look young but she forty-four
She gon' go dumb when that door close
Suckin' on her thumb, know she want more
Get all in her gums on the GoPro
(And that, you feel me, windows tinted, you feel me)
I cannot lie to you, dawg
I'm up in the sky with you, dawg
RIP Juice WRLD, that was my dawg
(R-I-P my mothafuckin' brotha, these lame ass niggas suck, man
These niggas need some help)

[Chorus]
Mm-hm, I can tell niggas need some motivation
I'ma be the face of the new nation
Gimme my paper like a citation
(Gimme my muhfuckin' bills, man, for real, I deserve it)
Closet lookin' like the salvation (Yeah)
You ain't rich yet 'cause you be impatient
I ain't done yet, I ain't complacent
Crib in every state, that's the real goal

[Verse 3]
She want me to kiss on her pussy, ho
I got twenty racks sayin' you can make it out, dawg
I got twenty racks sayin' you can make it out, dawg
Without no help
Believe in yourself
(You don't need a muhfuckin' handout in this muhfucka)
Model bitches flyin' over me right now
My newest bitch badder than a racist
Short hair with brown skin like a Reese's
I'ma nut in her till my sister got nieces
Can't figure out where I wanna stay
Only reason why I keep doin' leases

[Chorus]
Mm-hm, I can tell niggas need some motivation
I'ma be the face of the new nation
Gimme my paper like a citation
(Need my cut and respect like I ain't been doin' what I'm talkin' 'bout)
Closet lookin' like the salvation (Come on)
You ain't rich yet 'cause you be impatient
I ain't done yet, I ain't complacent
Need a hunnid spots like a Dalmatian

[Outro]
Whole gang hit, she a train station
Tryna cuff me but I can't go
Three

[Chorus: Robert Smith]
Spinning around the world at night
Spin round in black and white
Spinning around until the sun comes up
Strange time to see the light

[Verse 1: 2-D]
I think I've fallen onto silken thread, my head is spinning
Suspended in a twilight web that keeps on giving
The looping dervish in the lodge is lost within the ringing
Far away, I can hear the sound of someone out there singing
I'm speeding through the forest, strange echoes of Belarus
Where presidents pin badges on disconnected youths
What will you be dreaming of? No horseplay, no diving
Cutting grass with scissors, whilst the great leaders reclining
In the golden hallways where we spin, the faithful will be silent

[Interlude: 2-D]
Existing or not
At the same time
Spinning

[Pre-Chorus: Robert Smith & (2-D)]
Spinning around the world at night (Strange timez)
Spin in and out of sight
Spinning around until the sun comes up (I helped you feel good)
Strange time to turn it on

[Chorus: Robert Smith]
Spinning around the world at night
Spin round in black and white
Spinning around until the sun comes up
Strange time to see the light

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Bottled water world, surgical glove world, beach washing world
I'm twitching in the grimy heat, I think I might be spinning
Unicorn degrading, no horseplay, no diving
Cutting grass with scissors, whilst the great leaders-

[Pre-Chorus: Robert Smith]
Spinning around until the sun comes up
Strange time to turn it on

[Chorus: Robert Smith]
Spinning around the world at night
Spin round in black and white
Spinning around until the Sun comes up
Strange time to see the light

[Outro: Robert Smith & (2-D)]
Strange time (Strange time) to be alive
Strange time (Strange time) to be alive

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
Oh shit, I just hit a boss bitch
Play soft with her, just to give her hard dick
Real dawg, when I walk you can see the paw prints
Heard a nigga beat her ass, don't be hittin' our bitch, nigga
(Pooh, you a fool for this one)
D to the A, Tree from the Bay
Got a freak in LA, flew her to me today
Me and Boat still locked in, ain't shit changed
Pint talk, nigga, we got more sixteens than a tenth grade
(Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
I'm a bitch breaker, move like The Undertaker
Grippin' on my blick in the crib in the elevator
Move with the amputators, rap niggas animators
Talkin' like thеy hard, on the net they just commеntators
My niggas is confiscators, take your lil' chain, pawn
I'm in that lil' Ghost, I'm in that lil' don
I'm in that lil' pussy, shit feelin' like a lil' pond
Tryna rob, you get shot soon as you steppin' on my lawn
Ah, boy be gone
Fucked her so good she went 'head and turned blonde
So she felt like a new person (Ooh)
Don't stop suckin' when I'm burstin', bitch, I reimbursed you

[Verse 3: Tee Grizzley]
Aight, last night I broke a bitch back and a bed
These lil' niggas do more cap shit than licks
Stacks so thick, it's to the point I can't spread
Jumped on the jet, that's the nation off the grid
Ayy, let a nigga play me like a bitch, it can't happen (At all)
Whole lot of blood on my piece, the chain graphic
Choppa spit that fire good, it can train dragons
Brodie get that blue cheese off the green, it ain't salad
Hood bitch, but she actin' like she ain't ratchet
Bust a nut on where she got her nigga name tatted
Touch my nigga Yachty, get your top ripped, brain splatter
I'm American, but I fry your taco like I'm Spanish

[Verse 4: Lil Yachty]
Habla no ingle mamacita
Boat won't spend one dollar on a puta
Booyah, run around we might shoot ya'
My niggas take your plate for the mula
Shoutout Meech on Mars that's my nigga (Slatt)
One-eighty cash for Bentley truck, go figure
Lean, not no liquor, it's all in her liver, she leanin'
I love God, but I be movin' 'round like a Demon

[Verse 5: Tee Grizzley]
Pull up in some European, fuck up Niemens
Probably with a bad bitch that's Indonesian
Fuck a restuarant, you hungry bitch? Then eat the semen (Suck it)
You know I'm fresh up out the streets, I'm from that cement
And my city bankrupt, they see a foreign, then they know it's mine
If I die, my niggas did it, 'cause my opps don't come outside
A westside nigga fuckin' eastside bitches (All of 'em)
You weren't in that field, I just looked at the attendance, nigga

[Verse 6: Lil Yachty]
From the state of Georgia to Michigan
Got my brodie five bands not to mention men
My niggas wipe your plate like it's Wimbledon
Boat emblem, rims tall as a grembelin
In Atlanta with that tomahawk, no Indians
I won't slime on my dawgs for the dividends
But I slime up that bitch, better not let me in
Better tell a friend I'm not real like an alien

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
How many times (Yeah)
I gotta tell you to lock that door? (Yeah)
Inside smell like Pine (Yeah)
My last bitch, she scrub my floor
Pistol like James Bond
Party pay, she want that coke, new crib panoramic
Panamera, bitch, don't panic (Brrt)
Show that titty just like Janet (Janet), now she slanted
Fuck that bitch up in my kitchen (Fuck), the table granite (Fuck)
Don't take me for granted (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm not on this planet (Yеah)
She keep sayin' it, she keep sayin it, she think I'm Satanic (Yеah)
She see six hundred, six-six thousand, she think she's gon' vanish
Uh, Patek on Pacific time (Go)
In that 'Rarri, I don't drive in lines
Rather pay the highway fines (Skrrt)
Brrat, blam, beep, fuck 'em
These lil' niggas, I ain't ever gon' trust 'em
Don't slide to the side, treat 'em just like Russ
Throw cash on the ground, watch it grow like a mushroom (Uh, slatt)
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' me a old school '64
Call up Big Gwaluh, gotta ask him to put the lick on
Yellow diamond teeth lookin' like straight pissed on (Ice, ice)

[Chorus]
Keep it one hundred, I don't really need new friends
VIP Boat in the back in the evenin'
Bad yellow bitch in the back gettin' a beatin'
I know (I know) you know it ain't easy
Fuck no

[Verse 2]
Countin' big racks by the truckload
Why they want me dead? (Slatt)
'Cause I get too much bread, that's what they said
Told 'em eat a dick, oh (Fuck 'em)
Bangin' on the set, oh (Brrt, slatt)
The flyest nigga doin' that, oh
Don't need no points, don't need cut of that
I'm on my set (Fuck)

[Chorus]
Keep it one hundred, I don't really need new friends
VIP Boat in the back in the evenin'
Bad yellow bitch in the back gettin' a beatin'
I know you know it ain't easy
Fuck no

[Intro]
I ain't ever been a nigga to try and keep up with the next nigga
I just be doin' what I do, regardless
And I promise I'm still ahead
Far, far ahead
It's Boat (Slatt)

[Verse]
And they know it's me from the jump (Uh)
I'm the same young nigga from the Gump
Young nigga play on my name, get stomped
Half a million dollars, I spend it on junk
Ask my mom, I ain't never been punked
Never been pussy, I ain't never been sweet
Six, seven cars and they all on E
Bitch on E (Slatt) give it up for the free
Eight hunnid thousand dollars made last week
I ain't do shit, not a show in sight
Four, six, pourin' in Sprite, thief in the night
I move with the wind, fuck my buddy bitch, I do it again
Just said they were sisters I knеw they were twins
It's a Monday mornin', shе booted again
Who lovin' these hoes? That's you and him
My bitch don't know what to do with him
By him, I mean me, I'm movin' out
She curious 'bout what I'm doin' out
No love for no ho if I flew her out
Might paint the whip white, might Jew it out
Ain't get rich overnight, no, I planned it
Sat down and I drew it out
Can a bitch get in front of my bands? No, never, she can't
I'm on the roof watchin' the ranks
I cannot lose and we pour the drank
She off a blue and I'm off a pink
I'm gonna do whatever I think
Don't know what the dude even gon' think
I'm poppin' up in schools and runnin' in banks
Not lookin' at you (Frrp), I'm never not talkin' in vain
It's not that I will do but it's more that you can't
I will not name (Oh no), I will not shame 'cause I know that pain
Nigga, this voodoo, the way I control you (Yes)
Bitch ain't let me fuck back then, oh why? That bitch is old news
I don't wanna put that time in, later on everyone just slid in
I remember they was puttin' they bid in
They ain't think I make it out this long
Said a nigga be a one-hit-wonder
What about when I got on my sixth song? (Six)
Got a bad bitch hoppin' out a gray thong (Gray)
And her boobs just feelin' like a payphone
Off her top, she makin' my day long

[Intro]

Fuck her two times, oh well, good riddance
Border ego in a room full of pigeons
Throw me that pussy, one hand catch, dig in'

I cannot stress it, ho did the boys and the girls get the mеssage
Give her somе ecs', I hope that she blessin'
If she get mad she tryna arrest me, she wanna sex me
These niggas pounds like the fresh level chest piece (Zoom)
Why would they test me? (Zoom)
Why would they press me? (Zoom)
Run up that sack, need a ESPY (Zoom)
Fuck on that bitch, I got technique (Uh)
Bro had a stretch where his Tec be (Zoom)
Bitches be actin' like they know me (Mmm)

Lames get treats, mmm

Yeah, down bitches only
Two Glocks, on me
Ice light up the middle of my chest, just like Tony
And I keep my friend list low, cause they phony
They don't need to know me
And I think they fuck with the boy, but it's okay
Broke niggas always got something to say
But I run from 12, like I'm OJ
Said I bet I fucked that bitch, but she easy
Bet I gave 'em hell, I do not play
Thirty round clip on my bro and it stay there
They don't want mе up, but I'm up, It's a sad case
And I ran a M' up too quick, in a fast pace
Hustle to my last day

[Hook]
Lеt's go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
New town, new car, new friends
New place, try to fit in
And I've never been the best at talking
Lockers and lunches here
The girls are all so weird
And I've never been the best at talking

[Pre-Chorus]
But I saw you across the room
Said hello and that I'm new
And I swear there's something about you

[Chorus]
So do you wanna hang out?
Maybe we can make out
Heard you like music
Hey, me too
Don't know if you're busy
Don't know if you like me
Don't know if it's weird
But I kinda do like you
This small town thing's not as bad as I thought
So do you wanna hang out or not?
Take off my disguise
I'm living someone else's life
Suppressing who I was inside
So I throw 2,000 ones in the sky
Together we're alone (Together we're alone)
In Vegas I feel so at home (In Vegas I feel so at home)
I'm falling only for the night
So I throw 2,000 ones in the sky (The sky)
How much to light up my star again
And rewire all my thoughts?
Oh baby, won't you remind me what I am?
And break, break my little cold heart

Call me up and I'll send for you
Take me down to your altitude
I don't know if I can bе alone again
I don't know if I can sleep alone again

Check my pulsе for a second time
I took too much, I don't wanna die
I don't know if I can be alone again
I don't know if I can sleep alone again
Count it up, it's all for you, count it up
Count it up, it's all for you, count it up
I don't know if I can be alone again
I don't know if I can be alone again

[Intro]
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up

[Verse 1]
We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

[Chorus]
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

[Verse 2]
I've been drinking
Maybe that's, maybe that's why I'm feeling
So mistaken
All this love, all this love got me bad
Hallucinating
Every time that you're next to me
I'm losing patience
So can we go, can we go all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time

[Chorus]
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

[Bridge]
Take the tension and
Just give a little love and affection
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
I hate the pressure
There wasn't any when I met you
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
Kiss, kiss and make up

[Chorus]
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

[Outro]
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile

[Verse 1]
Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Felt like I failed the test

[Pre-Chorus]
But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile

[Verse 2]
I'm 2.0, rеmodeled
Used to bе dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie
Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees
A Mona Lisa masterpiece

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm gratefu
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)

[Outro]
I'm so thankful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
Smile (Oh)
I'm so grateful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
Smile (Oh, oh)

[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
My kindness is both a gift and curse (Uh)
They was tryna knock me down for tryna make it work (Yeah)
All I'm tryna do is go and get what I deserve, but
At least I know the truth is in my heart and that's for certain

[Verse]
Ooh, you don't see behind the curtains
People that I used to know is tryna chase the Birkin
Bitches in my DM's that I knew they used to curve me
People I don't know on my Instagram lurkin' (Uh)
Waiting for me to slip up
And if it wasn't love back then, it ain't love
Funny how they all so quick to change up
There is not a soul in this world I can trust
Speculation, oh, speculation
"You done gained a couplе followers, congratulations"
Way too much money that I'm makin'
And I'ma die bеhind mine, you won't ever take it, no

[Chorus]
My kindness is both a gift and curse (Uh)
They was tryna knock me down for tryna make it work (Yeah)
All I'm tryna do is go and get what I deserve, but
At least I know the truth is in my heart and that's for certain

[Verse]
Ooh, you don't see behind the curtains
People that I used to know is tryna chase the Birkin
Bitches in my DM's that I knew they used to curve me
People I don't know on my Instagram lurkin' (Uh)
Waiting for me to slip up
And if it wasn't love back then, it ain't love
Funny how they all so quick to change up
There is not a soul in this world I can trust
Speculation, oh, speculation
"You done gained a couple followers, congratulations"
Way too much money that I'm makin'
And I'ma die behind mine, you won't ever take it, no

[Chorus]
My kindness is both a gift and curse (Uh)
They was tryna knock me down for tryna make it work (Yeah)
All I'm tryna do is go and get what I deserve, but
At least I know the truth is in my heart and that's for certain
We were inseparable
Everything I had to do I did it next to you
And the memories we made were so incredible
Then our love was interrupted by my schedule

There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby
You got used to

Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
OO you got used to being on your own

I saw it happening
But I didn't accept the truth, I couldn't fathom it
There was so much going on you couldn't handle it
Could have divided my time, I should have fractioned it
But there was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby
You got used to

Being alone, alone, (All alone)
You adapted (You adapted), now your use to
Being alone, all alone (didn't mean to leave you lonely girl)
OO you got used too being (Used to) on your own
(All on your own)

[Verse 1: Thundercat]
I feel kinda fly standin' next to you
Baby girl, how do I look in my durag?
Would you tell me the truth?
Stay with me and love me through the night, endlessly
I'ma keep on all my chains when I'm makin' love to you
Hold me close and let me squeeze you tight through the night
But, baby girl, how do I look in my durag?
Would you tell me the truth?

[Verse 2: Thundercat]
Do you like my new whip?
Watch me go zoom, zoom
Baby girl, how do I look in my durag?
Would you tell me the truth? (Lie to me?)
Stay with me and love me through the night, endlessly
I just wanna know how you feel
Tell me, am I doin' it right?

[Verse 3: Smino]
I tie my knot up right in the front  (Baby)
I let my cape fly on to the floor (See)
Throw a wholе tre-five up in the blunt (You know, I'vе been doing this for some time now...)
No cap, I let the cape fly, look like the magic carpet or something
Or Latin drapes, ahh
Your opinion don't make my European tour dates stop
So baby won't you make my day and tell me a straight lie
Tell me this the best you ever do-rag
The sway that it's the knot in the front
I made that kitty smoke her mom say "Uh-uh, not in the front"
("Dashawn, you know better not to be smoking in front of my house, take that to the backyard, I don't say nothing!")
Sorry mama, but your daughter's the one
We just finished round six, started at one
We harmonize when we bust (hmm), the art of the gun
I lay it down like my edges in the womb of my scarf
I got the blue one like Belly rode the Keisha in spark
I tie my knot up right in the front (Tie my)
I let my cape fly on to the floor (Oh)
Okay Smi J. Walker at your scalp (Uhh)
Weave all that fake bullshit out
Told them Quans to roll on out
Say this here your daddy house (He my dad...)
Condoms say so original, I got so many protective styles
Twist and turns, we gon jell so natural (Natural)
(See, baby, I know you think I'm handsome)

[Verse 4: Guapdad4000]
Martin Luther silk, come through putting balls on your scalp
Don't need no Head n Shoulders, I got used to get flaking out (Yeah)
The top your head, girl we moisturized from this point on out (Moistured)
I'm your man, can't you see that I've been doing shit
Big like Mannie Fresh, BG, Birdman, Turk, and Wayne as lil' children
Boy hot, I got the hots for you, you hot tea, no Lipton (Ha)
Hottie got me hot and bothered when she pulled out her silky
Hottie got me hot and bothered when she pulled out her silky
Teatree oil rained upon your vessel that's essential drip (Teatree)
She told me I never gave a fuck so I bought Fendi fits (Fendi, yeah)
Start diving headfirst into your headscarf, head hunted
(Aye, what that nigga Smi say earlier?)
Baby, they love love love you when you ass up
Every time you see my head it's wrapped up
Caught you in your bonnet that's why I give you backshots
Just hope you don't backstab me if I should call for backup
I need some help with that ass, it's too fat (That's crazy)
When I get tired from ahh, pick up the slack (That's lazy)
I took a power nap after she threw it back for me
My durag fell off, I was sleep, she put it back for me (Thank you)
I feel fire, I feel mythical, I'm fly, I'm a durag dragon
That's why I showed up to the Grammys with my durag draggin'
CNN, Vogue, Vogue Japan and GQ
And I did all of this to meet you

[Intro: The Kid LAROI & G Herbo]
Oh-oh
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
I'm smokin' dope, I get so high, I meet my demons (I do)
Just turned seventeen, the shit I've seen, they wouldn't believe it (They wouldn't)
Just two years ago, my mama was off the drugs, tweakin'
Now I'm in L.A. eating sushi next to The Weeknd (Huh)
Put that on my soul, they don't know what I've been through
These hoes used to curve, now I'm the one that they into (No, no)
I'm with big bro Swerv', bumping Juice WRLD, that no issue
Back then, we wasn't cool, now you hit me like "I miss you"
Okay, it's 'cause I got it now, flooded out the face, I'm on my way
M.O.B., fuck all these bitches, I'm focused on gettin' paid
Made fifty today, spent fifty today, I'm in my bag
Bought my mom a crib, fuck designer, I do not know Raf

[Chorus: G Herbo]
Lord, please, You hear me pleadin' (Uh)
My soul bleedin' (Bleedin'), heart screamin' (Heart screamin')
Fightin' demons (Fightin'), right now, I need You, uh (I need You)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Like give me a reason
She told me she seen me drinkin' out this cup, then she gon' leave me (Woah, woah)
Get too high when I say I'ma stop doin' all these drugs, I ain't even mean it (Oh)
She told me, "I don't pay attention," I told her, "I'm sorry, lil' baby, I need you" (Oh, woah, woah)
I turned you up and I took you out that Camry, I put you in the Lamborghini (Oh, woah, woah)
Make-up sex every time she get mad, she wake up, she'll grab my penis
I did some time in jail, I wrote her a letter, I told her, "Bae, don't leave me" (Leave me)
If you hear me talk to my dawg 'bout these streets, never repeat it (Oh)
I'm this mannish with it, I tell her, "Grab my head" every time I eat it
It's five stars (Yeah), get ahead in fast cars (Fast cars)
Shawty takin' them Xan bars (Xan bars)
Shawty got a good hand job (Hand), hand job, yeah, yeah
Go to Chanel and get ten slides (Ten slides)

Bae, don't leave me, gotta believe me, I'm the man now

[Chorus: G Herbo & Lil Durk]

Bae, don't leave me (Bae), bae, don't leave me (Bae, don't leave me)
Bae, don't leave me (Bae), bae, don't leave me, no, no

[Verse 1]
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel likе I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn mе on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Verse 2]
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back

Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Bridge]
I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

[Chorus]
(You make me)
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back (No)
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real (Oh-oh)
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Outro]
I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

[Verse 1]
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

[Chorus]
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop bop)

Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

[Chorus]
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop bop)

Oooooooo Oooo

The 1st love I let inside my life had me afraid to fly
Had my head in the clouds and me while he let me crash
The next guy he didn't even care enought to pay the fare
Took 1 look at all my bagagge and called himself a cab
Then I love you

There's a place for me
In the air
Can't wait to be withcha there

Buckle up
We're taking off(Oo Oo)
And all becuz of you

Handle my bags Like a skycap
Carry my load Like a skycap
Hеlp me help me Likе a skycap
Got me there like a skycap
And I..
I'm flying
Now I'm flying
I'm flying
Now I'm flying

(Timbaland)I'm falling
Now I'm falling
I'm falling

[Intro]
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

[Verse 1]
I'm the national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on", he said "Yes, yes, yes..."
(Of course we can, my darling)

[Chorus]
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yеah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yеah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

[Refrain 1]
Money is the reason we exist
Eveybody knows it, it's a fact kiss, kiss

[Verse 2]
I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He says to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real
Don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(Yes, of course I will my darling)

[Chorus]
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

[Bridge]
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel

[Refrain 2]
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

[Verse 3]
I'm the national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon
He says to be cool and I know he means it
He's loving my look
And I'm loving all his strategic ways
I said "do you think you'll kill for me one day?"
(Yes, of course I will, my darling)

[Chorus]
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on his stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

[Verse 1]
If you could see your seconds in an hourglass
If you could see the minutes of a life you had
Would you run and would you try
To win it back?
If you can see a future in a photograph
If you could see the light that you wish you had
Could you be strong and carry on
With what you have?

[Pre-Chorus]
Why we wasting life?
Should be chasing life

[Chorus]
If we're breathing for the very last time
I don't wanna hold onto goodbyes
If there's no tomorrow
You better make it last tonight
If we're standing when the walls come down
If we make it to the final round
If we're here tomorrow
We'll live it better than we did last night

[Verse 2]
If you werе on your knees, would you take a stand?
If you were in deep, would you takе my hand?
Could you lie and lose your pride
To live again?
If you could wake up and see through yourself
Could you find a room to blame someone else?
Could you change in just a day
And cry for help?

[Pre-Chorus]
Why we wasting life?
Should be chasing life

[Chorus]
If we're breathing for the very last time
I don't wanna hold onto goodbyes
If there's no tomorrow
You better make it last tonight
If we're standing when the walls come down
If we make it to the final round
If we're here tomorrow
We'll live it better than we did last night

[Bridge]
'Cause you're not alone, no, you're not alone
We've all been wasting time
No, it's not too late for us to make it right
But we still have today

[Chorus]
If we're breathing for the very last time
I don't wanna hold onto goodbyes
If there's no tomorrow
You better make it last tonight
If we're standing when the walls come down
If we make it to the final round
If we're here tomorrow
We'll live it better than we did last night

[Verse 1]
What's goin' on
When I gotta fight for a right that is rightfully mine?
What's goin' on
When the world can decide if a caged bird flies or ever gets a chance to grow?
Too many people are invisible
It's a problem, how can we ignore what's goin' on?
I got questions I need answers, it's been too long

[Pre-Chorus]
Why I, I cry, I-I, oh why?
Do these tears keep runnin' dry?
But I just keep fightin'

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't over, 'til it's over
It ain't over 'til it's done
'Til these shackles are broken
It ain't over
'Cause some wounds never heal, do you see what you've done? (See what you've done)
'Cause some wounds never heal, do you see what you've done? (See what you've done)
'Cause some wounds never heal, do you see what you've done? (See what you've done)

[Verse 2]
What's goin' on?
We got strength but no power
And all we've ever wanted was what's ours (What's ours)
Then one day we wake up and everything has changed
Who can I blame? (Who? Who?)
Who's gonna carry the shame? (Who? Who?)
After all of this pain, I'll never be this same

[Pre-Chorus]
Why I, I cry, I-I, oh why? (Why?)
But while I still got time (Time)
I'll just keep on fightin' (Fightin')

[Chorus]
'Cause it ain't over (No it ain't over), 'til it's over ('Til it's over)
It ain't over 'til it's done (Oh 'til it's done)
'Til these shackles are broken (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
It ain't over (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
'Cause some wounds never heal, do you see what you've done? (See what you've done, oh, ooh, ooh)
'Cause some wounds never heal, do you see what you've done?(See what you've done, oh, oh)
'Cause some wounds never heal, do you see what you've done?

[Post-Chorus]
We won't lay down, we're survivors (We won't lay down)
All my scars are my reminders (My reminders)
We won't lay down, we're survivors (Oh-oh, oh, oh)
All my scars are my reminders

Beyond human strength
Supernatural gifts, you shower on your faithful saints

Goodness and mercy follow
Glory dripping all over the place
Tables spread like a buffet
We ain't worried 'bout what pеople say
We gon' worship God anyway

Thought she was sweet, I knew she was a freak
But hey, man, take one to know one
Party in the hills, party on pills
That's why she can't keep still
Niggas be fake, but the hate be real
Somebody tell these broke niggas, "Chill"
Ass on fake, but it feels so real, so fuck it, I'm still gon' drill
Says she on go and she gon' go ha-hard, yes, sir, I bet she will
I'm just tryna get in her bed
She just tryna get in my will
I'm rollin' on two wheels
So, bitch, don't tell me, "Chill"
I don't drip, Bob just spills, she's tryna get a refill
Walls gotta get rebuilt
Lookin' for that nigga, he here
Tell her I hit it all night
And I was being so sincere
Said that she celibate, I know she sell a bit
Act like I never trick, she wants some evidence

[Chorus]
Ooh (She been tryna smash since the Elements), after hour (Hahahaha)
Ooh, after hour
Ooh, after hour (Oh wow, dude)
Ooh, after hour
I don't need a reason (Oh)
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
I don't need a reason (Oh)
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I want your stupid love, love (Oh, oh, woo)
We got a stupid love, love (Love, love, oh)

I want your stupid
I want your stupid
I want your stupid

Now, it's time to free me from the shame
I gotta find that peace, is it too late or
Could this love protect me from the pain?
I would battle for you (Even if we break in two)

Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now
'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah, hey yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah
All I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah, hey yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah (Hey yeah, hey yeah)

I want your stupid
I want your stupid
I want your stupid
I want your stupid
I want your stupid
Lyrics from CLB Merch

Put my feelings on ice
Always been a gem
Certified lover boy, somehow still heartless
Heart is only gettin' colder

[Verse 1]
I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead
Made you wait 'til our wedding night
That's the first and the last time I wear white

[Verse 2]
So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie them in a knot like a hangman's noose
'Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell
Before I'll see you with someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:

[Chorus]
Here lies the girl whosе only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go beforе I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

[Verse 3]
It won't be whiskey, it won't be meth
It'll be your name on my last breath
If divorce or death ever do us part
The coroner will call it a broken heart

[Pre-Chorus]
So put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:

[Chorus]
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

[Bridge]
I took your name when I took those vows
I meant 'em back then and I mean 'em right now
Oh, right now

[Verse 4]
So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie 'em in a knot like a hangman's noose
Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell
Before I see you with someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
And let the stone say:

[Chorus]
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
There'll be a stone right next to mine
And we'll be together 'til the end of time

[Outro]
I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead

Lyrics from Snippet

Bet I pull up in the back with the MAC-10
Strapped in my back with a blade in my bitch crack (Go)
Ready to dash, take it back like an eight-track
Stacking some racks, kittycat way this six-pack
(I’m working on dying)
Ain’t got much to say
You know what’s up with me
These bitches know what’s up with me-

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
I used to dream about Vegas (Uh), pourin' cream for the ladies (Yeah)
Coke err'where just like it was the '80s, fast forward, crazy (Uh)
BBC jeans futuristic like Darth Vader babies (Uh)
Sharp like a lightsaber swung by Luke
And that Comme des Garçons make your girl wanna puke
'Cause she with you (Bruh), and not with the dude
Sticky situation 'cause her eyes are glued
She admire my fire and the way I pitch her deals
She hungry for my time (Huh, what?), Richard Mille (Yeah)
Easy, homeboy, fast moves will get you killed (Yeah)
Think that nigga there for nothin'? (Get for real, get for real)
Don't get it twisted 'cause I smell like Teen Spirit
You know what that cost, don't lean near it (Move, nigga)
You could have it all, nigga, just like Adele
But you gotta stop actin' like you snort what you sell (Ha)
Imagination can turn shit stains to big things
Even big planes, but first you gotta spit game
Stop talkin' 'bout your old dollars and make some new sense (Yes)
Quit bein' a nuisance, where's your blueprint? (Where ya blueprint, nigga?)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Mac Miller]
(Huh) Dreams do the body good
Stop standin' around, y'all could do it too (You heard me), yes
Dreams do the body good (I hope y'all feel this out there)
A little creativity (Uh)
'Cause ain't nothin' else that I would ever be (Haha)
Skateboard (You feel me?)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey
It all started with a attic, a copy of Illmatic
I had it before the cash and the model bitches and actresses
Ass and tits, all this ass and tits
Got me trippin' like a set of Louis bags and shit
This sound like brand new diamonds, gettin' on planes
You let these girls fool you, you Ichabod Crane
Listen ma, no, you ain't in Kansas, this ain't Wichita
Twist a lot, now you see, me now you don't, sick mirage
They told me, "Get a job," now I got a big garage
Filled with cars, see? This what you get when you stay workin' hard
This don't come easily, Buddha on my chain
Tell ya, "'Kuna to matata," no worries, simple and plain
When I pictured what it is, well, shit isn't the same
Got some women who complain, makin' me go insane
I'm livin' better than I ever imagined
But the way some people fake it's like competitive actin'
I used to never have a clue, but
Now me and money gettin' closer than a crew cut
New shoes don't make a man
But they always make him feel like a hunnid grand
Yeah, uh-huh

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams, Mac Miller, Both]
(Huh) Dreams do the body good
Stop standin' around, y'all could do it too (You heard me), yes
Dreams do the body good (I hope y'all feel this out there)

[Chorus]
I swear that I

I lasted more than five mins
Why did you say five mins
It was more than five mins
Huge if true, just five mins
Think we need to rewind
Your sense of time is fucked up
It was more than five mins
Didn't mean to disappoint, disappoint ya

[Verse]
She said that I
I didn't last but
I told them I
Definitely lasted longer

Would be huge if true
Def huge if true

[Chorus]
But you said I lasted five mins
Why did you say five mins
It was morе than five mins
Sorry you're a liar, a big liar

[Intro]
Oh my God, were you looking at her butt?

[Verse 1]
You're such a good boy and let's keep it that way
You're going out with your guys tonight (Right)
And you can flirt, boy, shop the windows displays
They'll get you drunk, best behave, alright? (Alright)

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I let you walk the line 'cause you come home every time
And I will never give you reasons not to
You're such a good boy and let's keep it that way
Yeah, let's keep it that way
Yeah, let's keep it that way
(Come on)

[Chorus]
You can look but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (Don't touch)
You can look but you can't touch, uh-huh (Uh-huh)
You can look but you can't touch
You can look at her butt (Her butt)
You can look but you can't touch her butt (Uh-huh)

[Post-Chorus]
Don't touch, don't even think about it

[Verse 2]
I'll be your bad girl when you come later tonight
I'll be your treat to feed your appetite
You wouldn't dare leave me home alone too long
And get me thinking something's really wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'll let you tow my line, you'll be the captain every time
I'll let you think you're in control of this ship
You're such a good boy and let's keep it that way
Yeah, let's keep it that way
Yeah, let's keep it that way

[Chorus]
You can look but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (Don't touch)
You can look but you can't touch, uh-huh (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
You can look but you can't touch
You can look at her butt (Her butt)
You can look but you can't touch her butt (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

[Chorus]
You can look but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (That's all I'm saying baby)
You can look but you can't touch, uh-huh
You can look but you can't touch (That's all I'm saying baby)
You can look at her butt
You can look but you can't touch her butt (What?)

[Bridge]
I saw you looking at her butt, it's so J-E-L-L-O
You said you'd get me another drink, but I saw you say "hello"
You think I'm blind, you think I'm deaf and you think that I'm dumb
I ain't your Helen Keller, honey, I'm your number one
Don't you forget it

[Chorus]
You can look but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (Don't you forget it)
You can look but you can't touch, uh-huh (Punk)
You can look but you can't touch (Don't you forget it)

You can look but you can't touch her butt (Punk)

You can look but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch
You can look but you can't touch, uh-huh
(You can look but you can't touch)
You can look but you can't touch
You can look at her butt
You can look but you can't touch her butt
(You can look but you can't touch)

[Chorus]
You can look but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (Hey, hey)
You can look but you can't touch, uh-huh
(Oh, you can look but you can't touch)
You can look but you can't touch
You can look at her butt
You can look but you can't touch her butt

[Outro]
Look, look, look
Don't touch, don't touch (Uh-huh, oh-oh)
Look, look, look
Don't touch, don't touch (Uh-huh, oh-oh)
Look, look, look
Don't touch, don't touch (I'm gonna touch your man's wife, mhm)

[Verse 1]
I paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown
'Cause you like your women Spanish
Dark, strong and proud
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make it nighttime all today
So it'd suit the mood of your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue

[Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

[Post-Chorus]
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
I paint the house black
My wedding dress black leather too
You have no room for light
Love is lost on you
I keep my lips red
To seem like cherries in the spring
Darling, you can't let everything
Seem so dark blue

[Pre-Chorus]
But oh, what can I do?
To turn you on or get through you?

[Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

[Post-Chorus]
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah

[Bridge]
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, baby
Black beauty, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

[Post-Chorus]
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah

[Verse 1]
It was 4 AM, I couldn't sleep
So I did my hair and I fixed a drink
Sat on the porch with my guitar
Sang about how you broke my heart
Singing "la la la la la la"
And I went and tore your pictures up
Built a fire in my bathtub
Painted my toes while I watched them burn
Then put out the flames with your T-shirt

[Chorus]
If you think that sounds crazy, then you should've seen me
Sitting by the phone, all those nights alone
Believing lies you told me, thinking I'm your only
Putting off my friends to be with you again
Forgiving when you say, "I love you, baby"
That's what I call crazy

[Verse 2]
If the neighbor looked through my window pane
He'd say, "She's finally gone insane"
All the things I do 'round this old house
Like cussing your name, screaming out loud
My bedroom wall's got a hole in it now

[Chorus]
But if you think that sounds crazy, then you should've seen me
Sitting by the phone, all those nights alone
Believing lies you told me, thinking I'm your only
Putting off my friends to be with you again
Forgiving when you say, "I love you, baby"
That's what I call crazy (Crazy)

[Bridge]
I've been seeing red
Since you said goodbye
I might break a thing or two sometimes

[Chorus]
But if you think that sounds crazy, then you should've seen me
Sitting by the phone, all those nights alone
Believing lies you told me, thinking I'm your only
Putting off my friends to be with you again
Forgiving when you say, "I love you, baby"
That's what I call crazy
That's what I call crazy, crazy, crazy, yeah
That's what I call crazy, oh
That's what I call crazy
Singing la la la la la la

[Intro: Mark Wakefield]
I will be myself
Until it's time
For me to fly

[Chorus 1: Mark Wakefield]
And I will walk away
With this message on my board
And I will walk away…

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
You should be yourself
Until it's time
For us to fly

[Chorus 2: Mark Wakefield]
And I will walk away
With this message on my board
And I will walk away
With this message on my board

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda and Mark Wakefield]
The night in the corner in the back of the halls where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall (And I will walk away)
The night in the corner in the back of the halls where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall (With this message on my board)
The night in the corner in the back of the halls where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall (And I will walk away)
The night in the corner in the back of the halls where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
Callin' from all sides, they surround all around (Uhh)
You can’t see a thing, but you can hear the sounds
Fallin' from the sky, upside-down (Ohh)
To the beat of heart as your whole head pounds
Callin' from all sides, they surround all around (Uhh)
You can’t see a thing, but you can hear the sounds
Fallin' from the sky, upside-down (Ohh)
To the beat of heart as your whole head pounds

[Interlude: Mark Wakefield]
I will be myself

[Chorus 2: Mark Wakefield]
And I will walk away
With this message on my board
And I will walk away
With this message on my board

[Outro: Mike Shinoda and Mark Wakefield]
The night in the corner in the back of the halls where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall (And I will walk away)
The night in the corner in the back of the halls where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall (With this message on my board)
The night in the corner in the back of the halls where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall (And I will walk away)
The night in the corner in the back of the halls where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall (With this message on my board)
The night in the corner in the back of the halls where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall (With this message on my board)  (Uhh)
The night in the corner in the back of the halls where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall (With this message on my board) (Ohh)
The night in the corner in the back of the halls where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall (With this message on my board) (Uhh)
The night in the corner in the back of the halls where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall (Ahh!)

[Intro]
Yeah, woah
This what they been waiting on?
Critical, ain't no time left on the clock
When it's your time, give 'em something to watch
I picked out the locks 'til I buy out the block
And I know I'm a gift but I think out the box

[Chorus]
And they want me to stop but why would I stop?
Huh? I am unstoppable
Hold up, why would I stop?
Bitch, why would I stop?
Chill (Chill), chill
I don't jump, I dive in it
Hold up, hold up, hold up
This the reason I'm alive, ain't it?

[Verse 1]
This shit the antidote, this the cure cancer flow
Stop a pandemic and the globe
The product of old 'Ye chopping up the sample flow
Dilla and Pimp C, the triller
This shit might go too trill for Triller though (Woah)
I see you critical, I'm the hospitable
Favorite rappers, I done cut they umbilicals (Cut)
Rеd Wings jersey B.I.G., look like Pac
Thе blacker the berry, more they wan' see it rot (Rot)
I'm going down as one of the gods
G-O-D D-O-A, dead or alive
I'm laying low, they could be espionage
This ain't no walk in the park, you can't slide
Solution to everyone one else 'round me problems
Next episode, got the whole fucking world watching
I might leave the series, come back like I'm Rodman
Get it now or right now my only two options

[Chorus]
So why would I stop?
I am unstoppable
Hold up, why would I stop?
Bitch, this shit unstoppable
Chill (Chill), chill
I don't jump, I dive in it
Hold up, hold up, hold up
This the reason I'm alive, ain't it?

[Verse 2]
The DJ gon' drop this, we made it from scratch
I'm mindin' my business and all of it's black
My dawg on the same way, the mode is attack
I don't complain about life, I adapt
I'm at the point if I fuck with a lil' ho
It's not just a fling, it's a scandal (On God)
I can't be handin' out samples (No way)
I can't be havin' ten baby mamas
That shit sound like a job, not a family (Straight up)
And I do this shit for the family (Straight up)
Yeah, that's just the roots I had planted (On God)
D2, this shit the new standard (Grr)
Upgraded the city, it got a new feeling
The house that I built (Woah, woah, woah)
House in the hills
Ain't no hills in the D so we all in the field (Woah, woah)
Running shit, five K, three K, André (Run it, run it, run it)
Hero in my hood, when they dress like me, that's cosplay
Give a fuck 'bout a threat, nigga
I'm a threat leaving out the driveway (Swerve-swerve-swerve-swerve)
I never listen to what the odds say
Why? When the universe respond to what I say
(I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say)
(I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say)

[Intro: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]
(Body to body, cheek to cheek, soulful moanin')
Yeah

[Verse 1: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign, Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Don't just take your clothes off, take the problems off
Take the armor off, take all the drama off
Let go of your responsibilities you been holdin' down
Know it's a lot on your mind, but I need your focus now
I need that (Soulful moanin'), yeah
I give you that (Soulful moanin'), yeah
(Late night conversation, can you speak my body language?)

[Refrain: Jhené Aiko]

Cheek to cheek (I'll give you that), soulful moanin' (Yeah, fuckin' right)
Ooh, yeah (Yeah), ooh, yeah (Yeah)
Look

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I know, I had people in my circlе but they weren't in my cornеr
I had people in my business, but they didn't support it
But took advantage of me like they supposed to do with their moments
Everything you didn't do, but could've did if you wanted
Working overtime, it's time I could be taking you down
Real shit, I gotta quit acting like these niggas don't want my place
When I ain't around, even though niggas ain't threats
I know if I don't live with you, I gotta live with regrets
I might walk in while you showering
Hit you in yo' shower cap, you gripping on the towel rack
I'm bussin' while you buss back
In the bathtub pouring champagne on that ass like I'm Dame Dash
Goddamn, yo' last nigga blew it with his lame ass

[Refrain: Jhené Aiko]
Bring that body to me
Baby, come closer, closer
Bring it to me
Oh, yeah, baby, I'll give you ecstasy
Baby, come closer, closer
Bring it to me, ooh, yeah

[Verse 3: Jhené Aiko]
Late night conversations, can you speak my body language?
I ain't got no time to waste, you got me losing patience
I can't wait to get you over here and get you naked
I'm about to ride that dick so crazy, I might break it
I'm so horny, show me something
Body to body, cheek to cheek, soulful moaning

[Refrain: Jhené Aiko]
Bring that body to me
Baby, come closer, closer
Bring it to me
Oh, yeah, baby, I'll give you ecstasy
Baby, come closer, closer
Bring it to me, ooh, yeah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, I'm talkin' body to body
Cheek to cheek, soulful moanin'
And girl, your lips taste so sweet
Girl, I'm talkin' body to body
Cheek to cheek, soulful moanin'
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

[Outro: Big Sean & Ty Dolla $ign]
In the city of murder, mayhem and narcotics
We got enough problems
Now it's time for that (Soulful moanin')
(Ooh, baby, ooh, baby)

[Spoken Word: Erykah Badu]
Here I am, Miss Badu
Not Big Sean, but I don't fuck with you
It's 'cause I'm from the D, the other D
But Detroit has a special place in my heart
Creative, deep, rooted, organic, cosmic
Fantastic, futuristic, ancient, musical
When I think of Detroit, I think of these things
There's something in that dirty water that gives it its flavor
There's an invisible intelligence that runs through the streets
Like an underground rooting system
Millions and billions of memory of atoms of all of the beautiful music that has been created there
And I've seen it еvolve into things only felt in the hеart
I know this to be true
Thank you, Berry Gordy, for that little house
Thank you, Stevie Wonder, for always calling me and reminding me that it is there
That thing
I always long to reconnect with it when I lose my way musically
Thank you, J Dilla, for your peculiar, peculiar intelligence
Yeah, Detroit just has a magic, and I know it to be true
Not Big Sean, but I don't fuck with you
Live from Badubotron, Nubian phenomenon
Detroit, where the Nubians grow

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Woah, woah, woah
I know we gon' make it if Mike WiLL Made-It, yeah
New tags, toe tags (Woah, woah)

[Verse 1]
No more breaks, dawg, it's time to break hearts (Break hearts)
I don't take disrespect, I take charge (Woah)
I'm in the mirror lookin' at a work of art (Like, God)
Hard work don’t mean shit if it ain't smart (Ain't smart, ooh)
I'ma run the play up to the max (Like that)
So if I don't know you, don't owe you, I gotta tax (Woah, woah)
I got enough sense, and I slipped through the cracks (Woah)
And, nowadays, I wear my smile like a mask
I'm the idols I looked up to in my past
All natural, Doctor Sebi, you gon' have to CBD me
I been watchin' what they feed mе (Woah, woah)
I like when she tеll me with her body language that she need me (Yeah)
See my third eye is on Left Eye, I can't let them Eazy-E me
No sir (Sir), I don’t even do flu shots
Clique with me everywhere I go, so every pic a group shot (Shot)
I done wiggled out the noose knot (Damn)
They been lyin' to me my whole life, I finally found the truth out (God)
Like they don't gotta love you if they need you (Woah)
Got angels and demons on a three-way (Woah)
And they ain’t comin' to no agreement
And I still be feelin' broke up, I'm gettin' money
And my team ain't gettin' cream until we cremate (Whew)
Big headlines, I'm talkin' CNN (CNN, woah)
I see a hatin' bitch like, "Hi, it’s me again" (Me again, woah)
They like, "Why you feel so good?" (Man)
I'm like, "Why I need a reason?" (Straight up, straight up, straight up)
Lot of salt, lot of shade bein' thrown my way, man
I guess it's just the season (Damn, throw it)

[Chorus]
But I gotta thank God though
'Cause he got me workin' harder than my demons (Woah, woah)
God got me workin' harder than my demons (Woah)
God got me workin' harder than my, hol' up
God got me workin' harder than my demons
God got me workin' harder than my demons
God got me workin' harder than my—

[Verse 2]
Luther Vandross, never too much (Too much)
Now we two up, who, us?
Yeah, real ones learn the work through us (Through)
Baby girl wanna dance, wanna groove, wanna vibe
But you know my best move is the one where you end up on my side
The ground on the mountain top feel the same as rock-bottom (Bottom)
Quit my fuckin' job, that’s when the real work started
Still showed up every mornin', every evenin' of every season (Straight up, woah)
What's the reason? God got me workin' harder than my—

[Outro]
Demon (Mmm)
Harder than my demons (Demons, harder than my demons)
Harder than my demons, demons, demons, demons
I been fightin' every season
Harder than my demons

[Intro]
Mainly, whatever the fuck you say means something
That shit is in you
You ain't gotta try that hard
I just want you to know that
(Oh, yeah, yeah, oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
There’s no romancin' without the pain
Just like there's no loss without some gain
Just like there’s no day without a blessin'
Just like no paydays without finessin'
But when who hurt you's forgiven
And all the late nights you been wishin' (Finally pay off)
Finally pay off and go the distance
I pray you get everything you missin'

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Everything you missin', dawg
I pray you get everything you missin'
Everything you missin’
I pray you get everything you missin’
(Oh-oh, oh)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm ’bout to delete my Twitter and follow my intuition
Been in and out the mud, but somеhow I'm in mint condition
I wonder if Granddad would have seen thesе Instagram vixens
Every fifteen minutes, would he had did everything that he did or he didn't?
I wonder how it feel to be rappin'
Swear that’s my fuckin' passion, how it feel to go platinum?
Swear that's my dream, but he too blind to see that
If he doin' what he love in his freetime, then his dream already happened
It's not about the trophy, it's about what it took to grab it
And if you feelin' stagnant, just know you attractin' the energy
That you put out there, you a walkin' magnet
Life can be a struggle, but what isn't that's worth havin'? Huh?

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Dwele]
There's no romancin' without the pain
Just like there's no loss without some gain
Just like there's no day without a blessin'
Just like no paydays without finessin'
But when who hurt you's forgiven
And all the late nights you been wishin'
Finally pay off and go the distance
I pray you get everything you missin'

[Chorus: Big Sean & Dwele]
Everything you missin', dawg
I pray you get everything you missin'
Everything you missin'

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
New life start with a blank canvas
Tryna find yourself, you moved to Lost Angeles
Where the camera's off, you're still not off camera
And that meeting that's supposed to change your life keep getting canceled
Swear my prayers gon' get answered 'fore these execs'll answer
Shit, expenses get too expensive
But you gon' do what it takes to do the digits
Even do the dishes
'Cause you gotta prove to the world how you committed
You got a whole city to inspire
It's so cold in the D, so through they eyes, you on fire
Going platinum once like catching lightning in a bottle
But you do it fifty times
And you realize contracts say a lot between the lines
But through the ups and downs, you make a blueprint that the city can build they own way out
And when they do, it's gon' feel like that you almost did it
And you buy everything you want, but it barely make you different
And find out random bitches can't even compare to commitment
And you learn hearin' doubts doesn't mean you have to listen
And you can't believe how much you made, not money, a difference
And find out everything you had was everything you missin'

[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah (Oh yeah)

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I'm broken in pieces down to the soul
I know the whole world can feel it
I know that they can see it (Oh), uh
Oh, I hate to admit that I need you, I need you, I need you
Next to me
You said that you would ride for me
And I hear you
But right now I need to feel you right next to me
'Cause this is all I got, prove that you got me
(Oh yeah) Oh yeah, yeah
(Broken pieces)
'Cause this is all I got, prove that you got me

[Chorus: Earlly Mac, Anderson .Paak & Both]
Yeah
So if you say, "Nigga," then I'ma say, "Is that a Ritz?" Mmm
Ooh, fifty niggas deep (Deep), hundred niggas step
Million Man March (Mmm), cracker, don't you start (Yeah)
Hold yo' head, guard yo' heart
Hold yo' head, uh
Nigga, get yo' bread, uh, light yo' spark
Strike yo' mark, life don't stop
So hold yo' hеad, guard yo' heart
Hold yo' head, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Sean, Anderson .Paak & Wale]
Conflictеd in this free-based world of give and take (Take)
'Cause I always rather give than to be the one sayin' thanks (Woah)
Conflicted like bein' signed to Ye and managed by JAY
Conflicted like bein' cool with Pusha and Drake (Damn)
Conflicted like reppin' a city where I hardly stay (Stay)
Or knowin' that you wrong but it's too hard to say
Hold yo' head (Hold yo' head), guard your heart (Guard your heart)
In my life, those were the hardest parts (Yeah)
So many dark times, I wish I caught a spark
Or learned not seein' eye to eye could be fixed with a heart-to-heart (God)
So many lost, I feel lost, got me feelin' like a real nigga, Holocaust
Got me mournin' while it's dark (Dark)
Life'll eat you alive, we know how to be a meal
Shit, rather than see a mill', to make it out, you need a skill (Yeah)
Thought I was past my past, but let's be clear (Clear)
Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear (Swerve)
Regrettin' everything in life is my only fear (My only fear)
And you know what they say about not conquerin' fears (What?)
If you don't, then they'll always be near
As that reminder in your ear, shit that I ain't tryna hear (Nah)
Hold yo' head (Hold yo' head), guard your heart (Guard your heart)
In my life, those were the hardest parts (Swerve)
Oh, you mistake me fallin' down for fallin' off (Woah)
Or mistake me bein' soft for speakin' from the heart
I guess life hasn't taught you as much as you thought
Instead of pickin' up your missin' pieces, you pick me apart (God)

[Verse 3: Wale & Big Sean]
Boy, hold your head but guard your heart
Got tired of white silence, so the riots started
And the robbers robbed, you wylin' 'cause yo' product gone?
We mad that Eric Garner, Breonna, Gianna father gone
Yeah, a lot of trauma, we tired, exhausted
Ermias the prophet said it'd be a marathon, look
Seen all my dawgs shown me God was watchin' (Woah)
Pandemic slowin' 'em down, they fastin', Ramadan
The land of fifty stars, on Hollywood marchin'
White friends don't got us, I promise you, I'll block 'em (Straight up)
I'ma count my bread, I defied the odds
And fuck the Saint quarterback 'cause he ain't Saint Laurent
Boy, from here on out, we on Pyer Moss
If we leave Reebok, we still bring 'em pumps and all the broads
Yeah, I motivate (I motivate), I don't divide (I don't divide)
The 45 a coward for practicing otherwise
A burnt nation, still it's under God
Not gonna throw the towel in, I'm by my brother's side
Your niggas be yo' niggas when you level up
You see that yo' niggas and brothers different when luck is up
So I trust nothing, this industry's something
My biggest rival is my mind protecting my thoughts
As well as my heart

[Chorus: Earlly Mac]
It's fifty niggas deep, hundred niggas step
Million Man March, cracker, don't you start
Hold yo' head, guard yo' heart
Hold yo' head, uh
Nigga, get yo' bread, uh, light yo' spark
Strike yo' mark, life don't stop
So hold yo' head, guard yo' heart
Hold yo' head, yeah

[Intro]
Woah, woah, woah
Look, gotta have faith to be faithful (Uh-huh)
Gotta be great (Uh-huh)
Yeah
(Woah, woah, woah)

[Chorus]
Show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest)
Show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest)
You gotta show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest)
My squad run the atlas, yeah (Yeah, woah)

[Verse 1]
Look, I can't take it easy, I don't know how (Know how)
Once I lock it in, it's good as done now (It's done now)
All that patience shit done run out (God)
I'm sorry you can't have your way with me (Way with me)
The ups and the downs that created me
I got the, I got the faith in me
Gotta have faith to be faithful (Yeah)
Gotta be great to be grateful (Yeah)
I seen that look in your eyes
That one Cain had gave Abel (Jealousy)
She gon' hip roll, this that 48221, Six Mile block shit (Woah)
So turnt up with my team in the huddle, it's a mosh pit (Wow)
I don't owe you nothin' if you ain't grow up in my house (House)
Niggas be prayin' on my downfall 'cause they goin' through a drought
Done proved myself so much, it's been a while, though, I admit it
So I'ma go so fuckin' hard, these hoes won't forget it

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's time to show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest)
Show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest, go, go, go)
You gotta show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest, yeah)
My squad run the atlas (Straight, straight up, God)

[Post-Chorus]
Look what you made me
Look what you made me (Ayy, ayy)
Look what you made me (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
And I'm feelin' godly, bullets can't stop me
I feel like Gotti, soldiers beside me
Goin' hard body, I can't go lightly
I feel like Pac right there in the lobby
She own big body, I'm riding big body (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She got a big body, she riding me properly
I hit it twice and she ready to die for me (Woah)
I switched it up just to break the monotony
My whole life you told me I had trust issues (Trust issues)
Looked at her, said, "Nah, bitch, I got us issues" (Go)
Meet and greet, meet my demands
Can't bill us, we buildin' a brand (Woah)
I'm going all money in with my bros like I'm Nip and Blacc Sam
Back the fuck back, you in my entrance (In my entrance)
They tried to count me out, came to they senses (Oh my God)
In the trenches, it's a different type of tension (Yeah, I been there)
Made a way out of no way, I did shit different (Go)
Man, fuck that tea shit, this that "Supa Dupa Lemonade" (Uh-huh)
Took it back to where we started just to see how far we came
I heard you keep what you love that's valuable inside your safe
I keep mine inside my heart, I guess we value different things (God)
I make all my haters proud of me when I'm in this mentality
Had people that loved me doubted me, but that bring the best out of me
They studying my every move, go get your ass a damn degree
You listen to me, I listen to you, like that ain't it, chief

[Chorus]
I'ma show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest)
Show these bitches who the baddest (Baddest, baddest)
You gotta show these bitches who the baddest (Go, go, go)
My squad run the atlas (Yeah)
God (God)

[Post-Chorus]
Look what you made me (Ayy)
Look what you made me (Ayy)
Look what you made me (Ayy, ayy)

[Intro]
Dessessop m'i ekil yadot pu ekow I, yeah
Efil tsap ym morf revo 'nideelb seussi

[Chorus]
I woke up with too much on my chest
(I woke up and realized I didn't even remember my dream and...)
I didn't know I gave it everything 'til I realized that I had nothing else left
Issues bleedin' over from my past life (Tryna take care of everybody)
(I don't know)
I wonder
I wonder if my karma's up and this is my last life to get it right
Transcend (Transcend, transcend)

[Verse]
The days are getting shorter, I noticed
Seems like time is moving fast forward while I'm in slow motion (Slow)
Losing loved ones with really no one to cope with
It's cool, my third and my fourth eye open, damn
(Thank you, God, so much)
I dodged a cell, but still locked on the cell
I never thought I'd see the day my mom wouldn't agree with Oprah and Gayle
Myra Denise was my peace, a heaven on earth and living hell
Who gave me everything, but never took anything for herself
Imagine '06 Impala with zero mileage
Seventeen, baggy clothes, not like Billie Eilish
Some niggas grow old but not up, they still as childish
Demons wearin' mask as my friends, they favorite disguises (Woah)
But niggas not gon' forget about me like niggas forgot 'bout how
Harriet was supposed to be on top of that twenty dollars (Straight up)
Dawg, my life a scene out of Casablanca, you got it wrong, I'm the monster
Burning Man, Ayahuasca (Burning), my check up, no diagnostics (Woo)
You disappear in the D like you Jimmy Hoffa (Gone)
I play my part like Leo without the Oscar (Damn)
Underrated, but you still gotta watch it
Yeah, maneuvered through it, I had to do it (Do it)
Show's lookin' like Latin music
'Cept tonight we in Houston, the next night is Chattanooga (Oh)
But it's still Latins that's rappin' to it (Oh)
Pursuit of happiness, I had to prove it
The best part 'bout problems is problems all come with solutions
That's why I don't focus on no legacy shit
All I care about is pluggin' friends and fam, that's it (That's it)
And being the missing link to all their goals and dreams, that's it
And sinkin' the winning shot while I'm triple teamed for the chip, bitch

[Bridge]
And I'ma let my whole soul glow
I can't kick it with you no more, can't miss no more goals
Best linens and my bitch sound like she Yoko Ono
When the reaper say it's time to go, I'ma say, "No, no, no"
(How I'm supposed to leave all this? For what?)

[Interlude]
People are hungry for
For something that means, really means something
They're hungry, man, they're like, fucking
You know what I mean? They...
Because they're starving, they get so much bullshit, you know? Bullshit, there's so much of it

[Outro: Big Sean]
What's my purpose?
Why is my purpose?
Where is my purpose?
I am purpose
When I compare my purpose to someone else's
Then it is no longer my purpose
Disconnect to reconnect (Disconnect to reconnect)

[Intro: Tee Grizzley]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
(Hit-Boy)
Ayy, this that Clipse sample, ayy (G. Ry got me)
Fuck that talkin', let the clip slam 'em

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley & Kash Doll]
Yellow bands around them hundreds, you know how much that is (Tens)
Too much to give me cash, they had to wire me the backend (Send it)
Niggas in here lookin' tough, you know that I got mag in (What?)
Ask me am I only rappin', you know I got that bag in (You see it)
Bandman like Lonnie (Lonnie), want my head? Come find me (Come get it)
Lil' bro in that bitch chillin', he ain't tryna come home cocky (He chillin')
He comin' home to a dollar (Dollar), and a mansion and a chopper (What else?)
In the desert on a dirt bike (Skrrt), VLONE shirt and the Pradas (Fresh)
Big nigga fresher than you, fuck you and your stylist (Woah)
Paid ninety for my grill, then lost it, that's why I ain't smilin' (Damn)
You got Sean, you got Hit, you got Grizz
Kash Doll'll paint you red, throw you in the water, they gon' think you a lobster, nigga
Gang (Uh)

[Verse 2: Kash Doll]
I just dropped a kit, you dropped out of school
These hoes wanna be famous 'til they make the news
All my bitches winnin', how it feel to lose?
Nigga tryna get the box like he finna move
Bitch, I'm at my pinnacle, I used to shop at Pinnacle
Your nigga still drink Pinnacle, bitch, your taste is pitiful
I talk cash shit, you ain't cash shit
Call up Baby Choppa, Cash Kidd, and spend my cash, kid
You stay back like adlibs, I buy, I don't ask shit
I pop shit and pop tags, bitch, this new era be cappin', uh
Me, Sean, Tee off that Pusha T, ain't no pushin' me
Bro might put you on a tee, dot my I's and cross my T's
Bro might put you six feet or bro gon' put you on your feet
But bro can't put you onto me
A-plus pussy worth a B, nigga, uh
You niggas ain't worth no B, fuck outta here

[Verse 3: Cash Kidd & Payroll Giovanni]
I keep dyin' in my dreams, but life's great when I stay woke
Bet you love dreamin', that's the only time you ain't broke
Try me, 40 make you back up off me like DeJ Loaf and Big Sean
Get triggered down, Jhené Aiko
Gotta keep Glock in the fanny
Nigga, you not finna ham me, huh
Put a body on a ratchet, I feel like Dr. Miami
Niggas tryna ride my wave like they stoppin' a taxi
On a six in a Lam', but I'm not that bitch Mary (Helluva made this beat, baby, Four-One)

[Verse 4: Payroll Giovanni]
They counted me out, I came back with a vengeance
In back-to-back Benzes, back-to-back winnin'
Rap failed, oh well, give me back my scale
And a burn-out cell, I'll grow clientele (Yup)
Four-One P, I don't sell dreams, I wholesale P's (Uh)
Want halves, nigga, don't call me, don't insult me (Boy)
Wrist frosty, 'bout eighty what this shit cost me
Don't worry, I'll make it back before you sip coffee
I run with hustlers and bosses, bosses and hustlers (Yeah)
Had to find my hustle, I was lost in the gutter
Got out that jam, now it's foreigns with the seats peanut butter
Bitch, it's BYLUG for life, never crossin' my brothers

[Interlude]
(Let's go)
(Helluva made this beat, baby)

[Verse 5: 42 Dugg]
I fuck with 6 Mile, not too much the 7, they freed the 4s
That's your bitch, huh? Well, get her together, she fuckin' bro
You know them road trips still bring a dub in, sub in
Even if the party was seven, the strip club ten
I'm all in this bitch on the tether, I'm throwin' dubs still
I put her in the Bentley mansion rent-free
Told 'em keep the G-Wagon plain, don't even tint these
Can't be fuckin' with a lame, dog, you got her head big
Three hundred a line for the Wock', I'm sippin' red still
I know how the feds feel, I make it hard to catch me
Cuz sellin' corn still, codeword for reggies
I ain't signed a deal yet, fuck it, I don't need 'em
Everybody with me eatin', free my niggas 'til I see 'em
He ain't dead, we ain't even, Jet back, ante up, bitch
Free them boys

[Interlude]
(Shit hard)
(Where you at, Bo?)

[Verse 6: Boldy James]
We gon' make it off the ave, get a half, then I shake it
Somethin' like a bad habit, we ain't have it, we gon' take it
Came up off a fifty slab, now my bag big as yappers
Workers beggin' me for time off, askin' me for raises
Took me six hours to count it, bubble wrap it up, and tape it
All my bitches want allowance, plug askin' me for favors
I been out of town so long, had to get reacquainted
With the neighbors on the block, all this cash we been rakin'

[Verse 7: Drego & Big Sean]
Way before the rap when I was writin' verses
We was beatin' up the Ike like I was Tina Turner
We was loadin' up the Glock and fillin' up the hearses
Now I'm preachin' like it's Sunday, tryna teach the sermon
Tryna teach 'em how to get it, fill up they mamas' purses
So they ain't standin' front the judge, listen to the verdicts
'Cause we was standin' on the block, thuggin' with the serpents (Yeah)
Get caught with Kurtis Blow on me and they gon' close the curtains

[Verse 8: Big Sean]
Million-dollar calls you can't merge in, BasedGod how I got my curse lift
She gon' play her part so well, you thought that she rehearsed it
Don life worship
Holy temple, synagogue, tabernacle, churches

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Yeah (Hit-Boy)
Look

[Verse 9: Big Sean]
I can't even chill, I get active
Overdoin' everythin' my best and worst habit
Shit be impossible 'til it happens
I never thought I'd see Kobe go before Magic
That taught me first, no seconds to waste
Only waist I like is her legs wrapped around my face
Fuck you think she doin' over here? Watchin' Netflix?
Beard game, might just let it grow down to my necklace, uh
I don't hope for wins, I expect it, uh
Adrenaline in me like it got injected
My girl say I got communication issues, no, I don't
I just don't like sharin' all my problems more than the results
I bring the plan back to my team, tell 'em go wild
Godbody my physique and my profile
I did every single goal that I wrote down
Checked it off, it's old now
And that shit give me chills, fuck I gotta take yours?
I'm the originator, make it, then I make more
Written in stone, you can't forge
You ain't on my level even if we in the same buildin' on the same floor
Old boy black out
Dough boy cash out, payroll, contract maxed out
Cash kid, cash cow
Tapped in, I can't tap out
Bitch, keep thinkin' I'm sleepin' in
Tony on the monitor, I see your ass creepin' in
Lil' bitch, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't exist, you get the gist?
Fuck a cease and desist, they shootin' up seats and exits
Throwin' plays to my bros, I'm leadin' the league in assists
Hopscotch, blacktop, I ain't been skippin' a step since
Real estate, Zillow every day, bitch, I might just change my profession
Dodged so many rainy days, it changed my complexion
Hang up on your ass and say I lost the connection
I turned out to be the man that I manifested

[Interlude: Big Sean]
(Let's go then)

[Verse 10: Sada Baby]
Hmm, fuck the bullshit
I ain't here to make no friends, can't get bool with me
Since an adolescent, I was ignorant, up in school trippin'
Pistol at my desk, I was sittin' up in school with it
Put your bitch hand in my corner pocket, play pool with it
She gon' eat the dick, both balls licked, and do it to me
Ain't go to college, I ain't want no pussy nigga roomin' with me
Still could've went to college, Sada ain't no fool, nigga
Every clip we got extended, yellow Perkies look like minions
Put Church's Chicken on your niggas, scrape them boys for half a biscuit
Know I like the burner, but I'll beat your ass, this shit personal, huh
Hit a nigga in his shit with this fifty or thirty, duh

[Interlude: Big Sean]
(Let's go, Royce)

[Verse 11: Royce da 5'9"]
Name a nigga out of the D as solid as me
I unlocked a lot of dollars, nigga, knowledge is key
I did it all without a college degree
I went from hottest signed artists, don dada, to G
Street lord, rock bottom, Godfather, and P
D-Boy, Rottweiler, Sean, Sada, and Tee
Standin' on the corner three days
Phone is on Motorola prepaid
Diadora or gold Ellesses
These are ordered from the older East Bays
She either rollin' with the owners or the lessees
A kind man knows a blind man holds grudges
A wise man knows a wise man knows nothin'
I thought I told you motherfuckers I ain't need a budget
I ride with them guys that society begrudges
We been thuggin' worldwide, got arenas buzzin'
We survived gettin' fronted by Ilena cousin
Before you could sell that Cole and Adele
Or go NFL, be Kobe or Kells
The plight of the rich is to throw you in jail
The fight has been fixed since the openin' bell
And you know who postin' your bail? Who promotin' your L?
Who be hopin' you fail? Nigga, Oprah and Gayle
Ignore the hate, show the world that we love the opps
Call Lyor great while they make rape Russell docs
Nah

[Interlude]
(Okay, yeah)
(Hit-Boy)
Yeah
(G. Ry got me)

[Verse 12: Eminem]
Bitch, you have never said a clever line ever
You murdering in the booth is the furthest thing from the truth
Rest assured, I'ma treat this roof like I'm peelin' off (What?)
The plastic on a pill bottle, I'm tearin' the ceilin' off, yeah
Ripping rappers like they were wrapped in Saran, bitch
And I'm strapped up with ammunition
And single-handedly takin' over the game like I had an actual hand missing
But I only need one to clap
Animal ambition
The only butt-fuckin' way that you're strapped is for cash
Wish you could slap in the damn clip in that motherfuckin' imaginary little handgun you're brandishin'
Bitch, if you pull up with the stick
It's a car with a manual transmission
The chances are low to none that I will overcome my bipolar one
Voodoo dolls, I'm just pokin' fun, pins to me are like loaded guns
When I'm holdin' one, if I'm just fiddlin' with it
This motherfucker discharges like me checkin' myself out of the fucking mental hospital
And I get off like an acquittal, I spit it, you critique it
It feels like I'm bein' belittled by midgets
It's like holding a nuke or a damn bazooka
And walkin' right up in the middle of a little kids' fuckin' pillow fight with it
You want smoke? I'm like hookah
Man, I remember back when I used to get jumped for my fucking Pumas
Run home and go fuck my room up
These streets will try to vacuum you up
That's why the avenue where I grew up was 8 Mile and Hoover (What?)
'Cause it sucked like a Roomba
But even if I would've went the indie route
I don't have any doubt
I would still get blown like it's windy out
Shoot 'til the clip is emptied out
This is the beginning of the ending, but I'll put another clip in and spit these rounds
If I dig deep down when I'm in my bag like Fendi
Who am I offending now?
Got so many fucking detractors, feels like I'm gettin' plowed
Had to put my money on a diet, I got too many pounds
You would think I'm turnin' pages the way that I'm flippin' paper
Middle fingers, them bitches get to wavin' like friendly neighbors
I'm talkin' loot like I'm rioting
Dick is so big, I can't fit the entire thing through a tire swing
I don't think it'd be logic for me to say that I'm retirin'
But I should say bye-bye, earthlings
'Cause I'm back on Uranus fuckin' up this "Grindin'" beat, yeah
I took the pain and learned how to put that shit into a song
You listen for flaws and strip it and try to pick it apart
So when I'm rippin', it's hard to tell whether if it is really because
Of how offensive I am, or just what a bitch that you are
Like I never had to get my clothes at fucking St. Vincent de Paul
Like I don't make sure every sentence and bar with a pencil is sharp, and I'm quick on the draw
Yeah, so when I pull it, surprise (Pull it, surprise), like Kendrick Lamar
You need to walk the Yellow Brick Road and find the chick with the dog
'Cause y'all are missing a heart
Plus your bitch is giving out brain like the Wizard of Oz
This shit is like sitting in the principal's office getting scolded for skipping
Y'all got detention tomorrow
I'm severe like Benzo withdrawal
Bitch, your skin's gonna crawl
I'm invincible, I've been through it all
Like I never thought about just ending it 'til I got pissed off and put a fist through the wall
My back was against
Now I rap like I'm possessed, that's nine-tenths of the law
Oh
Oh, fuck it

[Spoken Word: Stevie Wonder]
Hey, this is Stevie
I was blessed to be raised in the west side of Detroit
I lived on Breckenridge, that was the first home that we lived in
My neighborhood, where I was raised up
When the girls came around, I would sing
On the front porch, beating on the stairs and singing
For hours and hours upon hours
Seeing a piano for the first time
But the amazing thing as well is
Through those experiences, I was able to understand how
My being blind because my mother allowed me to be free
Didn't mean that I had to be blind to the world
I may have had a visual disability
But did not stop my vision inside me
I didn't know what it was like being poor
Because God had made me rich
Even before I was born
Rich with the spirit of knowing that
Anything you imagine that's for the good is possible to be a reality
Because a few weeks before I was discovered, I-
I had a dream that I heard my music, my record on the radio
I had nothing out, no one knew who I was, and, um
Amazing, it really happened
And so you know, it's just, it's...
I- I- I can say to other young people as I said to my son Kailand
I said, "Listen, what you don't understand
Is that God gave you a brand even before you were born
All you had to do in life is walk into it."

[Intro: DOM KENNEDY & Big Sean]
Yeah, yeah
What about that part (Two)
Ayy, yeah
Talk your shit, what? Ayy
Look at all the souls I saved
Look at all the O's I made (Woah)
Same outfit, a couple days (Yeah)
Listen to Big Sean (Okay, praise, nigga)

[Verse: Big Sean]
This for my baby who comin' over to buss it open (Buss it)
Who get an Uber but really deserve a dozen roses (Damn)
Who got her hair done and didn't think I even noticed
She just happy she chosen
But she the one who chose me, that's what's more important (Woah)
I give her more game than problems, she love how I coach her
Under unrealistic measures is the only way you can measure who's chosen
I realized my mind frame is too big for the portrait
That's why I'm steady tryna teach the whole hood corporate
Off psychedelics while a psychic tryna read my fortune
But I know knowing too much of anything can be a torture (Yeah)
She like, "You supposed to meet my parents, you know that's important"
How narcissistic you think I am? Huh?
You think I did when I didn't (What?)
You think I paid for everything and didn't pay attention
Like my head is as big as my name (Come on)
Just tell a real nigga once, baby, never again (Swerve)
And I'll put you and all my loved ones on like it's my only obligation
I made all they solid wins a loud proclamation
A little pressure and a lot of patience
They tell me you amazing, I say no, God amazing

[Chorus: DOM KENNEDY & Big Sean]
Look at all the souls I saved (Straight up)
Look at all the O's I made (Yeah)
Same outfit a couple of days (What about that part?)
Listen to Big Sean (Okay, praise)

[Outro: Big Sean & DOM KENNEDY]
But just remember it's easier for mothafuckas to count you out than it is to count you in
So you gotta understand if they don't see where you comin' from or if they small-minded
And not thinking that it's enough for all of us to get it
That's why it's important to be your own boss
To some capacity you know, put yourself in control
Through the ups and downs, wins and losses, they all just chapters
Chapters in your life story and really
Some losses teach you how to win you know
Some losses teach you more than always winning ever could (Yeah, ayy)
And I been there back against the ropes, against the wall
(I ain't tryna waste nobody time, don't waste mine)
That's just 'cause you the one that can handle it, you know?
Shit man, you gotta prove yourself
You gotta rise the fuck up (Up)
Show 'em who you are, man (Yeah)
You ain't gonna give me a way? Okay, cool
I'ma make a way, you feel me?
(Look at all these roads I paved, nigga)
Ain't no mistakes, ain't no regrets
Regrets only there 'cause you ain't learned your lesson (All the times I ain't cave)
Or forgave yourself, either or (Yeah, ayy)
Yeah (All we do is elevate), elevate
(Big Sean) And I'ma just leave it right there
Detroit 2, ayy, what's fuckin with that, huh?

[Interlude: Dave Chappelle]
There's never been a single time
Not a, not a-one, that I've been to Detroit
Where it wasn't some kind of adventure
City is fucking crazy, it's like, it's palpably alive
It's an entity, it's not like just a place you go
It's Detroit
And one of the reasons that Detroit is my favorite market
Is because the audiences in Detroit, for a comedian
I find them to be particularly challenging
So when I go there, in this particular story
It seemed like a pretty bеnign night
And I'm sittin' in the dressing room at the Fillmorе
And there's an older gentleman in there
And I don't really talk to the guy much, but he was a nice guy
Cool energy, shit like that
And then, uh, famed Detroit rapper Danny Brown came in
Now at this time, I wasn't that familiar with Danny Brown's music
You know what I mean?
So when he asked me to smoke with him, I just smoked with him
I didn't hear all that "Adderall Admiral" and all that shit
I didn't know he was about that life (Haha)
I'm assuming it's weed, I don't know what the fuck it was
But, boy, I mean, I smoked weed a million times in my life
Never, ever remember feeling this way before
And as I was walking on stage, I told my road manager
"You know, my number's up tonight"
He's like, "What does that mean?"
"I'm going to bomb"
And true to my professional prescription, I did
But, there's bombing and then there's the shit that happens in Detroit
It's like, the crowd was with me
But the way the crowd responded to me widely
Was one of my favorite crowd interactions ever
And as the set is going terribly
When it's clear I'm not gonna be able to pull the nose up and I'm gonna have to crash this thing
I saw Danny Brown slipping out the room, which made me laugh really hard
Go back in the dressing room and everyone, you know there's a stink on ya after you bomb
Where everyone looks at you like, you know what I mean?
Like Headwound Harry, like, "Nigga, are you okay?"
But I really, I can't explain it to ya, I really didn't care
And then, and then, it turns out
That this kind older gentleman was Big Sean's father
And my goodness what the, the, he gave me a pep talk that only a dad could give
And it made me feel wonderful, man (Wow)
So shoutout to you Big Sean, shout out to Detroit
I'll never stop loving your city, and I'll never stop loving you, bro
You guys are the truth, much love to the Motor City

[Verse 1]
Thought she'd be coming back home, tomorrow
She wrote a note that she won't be
All of my tears have been borrowed
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me

[Chorus]
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me

[Verse 2]
Think I'd tell her that I loved her, tomorrow
Hope that she sees things the same way that I see
I learnt to swim through my sorrows
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me

[Chorus]
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me

[Outro]
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me

Out of my head, over how things are

Blacked out in my car

The blood's on your hands
Your heart's in your mouth
Chew and spit out
Baby

[Chorus]
It's hard to recall, there's no denying it
The bird's in your head, you're busy flying it
Oh, Oh, Oh
You've been seeing red

[Verse 2]
The gun's in your mouth
Finger on the the trigger
Which man turns out victor?
Baby

[Chorus]
It's hard to recall, there's no denying it
The bird's in your head, you're busy flying it
No need to recall, there's no denying it
The bird's in your head, you're busy flying it
Oh, Oh, Oh
You've been seeing red

[Verse 1]
Oh no
Just as things got better
Trouble comes along
To sing it's favorite song
And it sounds alright
A tune that you remember
So sing a bar or two
And wave goodbye to the new you

[Lupe Fiasco]
Welcome
This is, enemy of the state
It's a love story
Because, I feel like my fans really have love for me

[Intro]
Yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah
Lately shit ain't been the same like it used to be
And I know it gets hard sometimes, it get used to me
And I see shit in you that you cannot even see
Connection drop, this shit just ain't how it used to be

[Chorus]
Cause I just need some time
I just need to get here
I just need some time
Cause time with you is so different
I just need some time
I just need to get here
I just need some time
Cause time with you is so different

[Verse]
I need to know if
You're the one that I should focus on
They tell me that I lost it
Cause I've been bending over backwards for your ocean
I've been doing all the things I said I'd never do
I'm becoming what I know is gonna cost me
I've been making dumb mistakes, I'm a lost kid
Shawty say she trippin' off the pills and potions
Are you with me or not, lemme know
Imma pick up the phone when you call
Tell me you'll be here when I'm low
But you ain't been here anymore
You promised some things, yeah I know
But that just don't matter anymore
Where did you go, where did you go
I do not know, I do not know

[Chorus]
Cause I just need some time
I just need to get here
I just need some time
Cause time with you is so different
I just need some time
I just need to get here
I just need some time
Cause time with you is so different

[Bridge]
Don't talk like this forever
I can't cope like this forever (nah)
Don't talk like this forever
I can't cope like this forever

[Chorus]
Cause I just need some time
I just need to get here
I just need some time
Cause time with you is so different
I just need some time
I just need to get here
I just need some time
Cause time with you is so different

[Pre-Chorus]

You feel like summertime

You'll be my valentine in the summer, in the summer

Just dancin'; having fun
Out in the shinin' sun of the summer, of the summer

[Chorus]
Do love me, do love me, do
Do love me, do love me, do (Ayy)

I don't wanna lose this true romance, baby
All i want to do is make you there

[Pre-Chorus]
You feel like summertime

[Outro]
All i want to do is make you there
I don't wanna lose this true romance, baby
All i want to do is make you there
I don't wanna lose romance
In My Little Town, I grew up believing
God keeps His eye on us all
And he used to lean upon me as I pledged allegiance to the Wall
Lord, I recall, in My Little Town
Comin' home after school, flyin' my bike past the gates of the factories
My mom doin' the laundry, hangin' out shirts in the dirty breeze
And after it rains there's a rainbow and all of the colors are black
It's not that the colors aren't there, it's just imagination they lack
Everything's the same back in My Little Town
My Little Town, My Littlе Town

Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in My Little Town
Nothin' but thе dead and dyin' back in My Little Town

In My Little Town, I never meant nothin'
I was just my father's son. Mmm
Savin' my money, dreamin' of glory
Twitchin' like a finger on the trigger of a gun

Leavin' nothin' but the dead and dying back in My Little Town
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in My Little Town
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in My Little Town
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in My Little Town
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in My Little Town
Who's gonna shoe your pretty little feet
Who's gonna glove your little hand
Who's gonna kiss your ruby red lips
Who-ooh-ooh-a

Papa's gonna shoe your pretty little feet
Mama's gonna glove your little hand
And I'm gonna kiss your ruby red lips
Songs were made to sing
While we're young
Every day is spring
While we're young

None can refuse
Time flies so fast
Too dear to lose
And too sweet to last

Though it may be just
For today
Share our love we must
While we may

So blue the skies
All sweet surprise
Shines before our eyes
While we're young

Though it may be just
For today
Share our love we must
While we may
So blue thе skies
All sweet surprise
Shines bеfore our eyes
While we're young

[Verse 1]
It's ok to cry
Every day if you have to
It's ok to sleep
Peace from the war

[Verse 2]
It's alright to sing
Let it bring joy to the sorrow
It's alright to cry
Some more

[Chorus]
I don't know your pain but I will fight
I won't let this go even if doing what's right
Isn't easy
I'm tired, believe me, but
So are you

I don't know your pain but I will stand
I won't let this go so take my hand
It's not easy
I'm tired, believe me, but
So are you
So are you

[Outro]
It's ok to cry
Or to laugh if you need to
It's ok to sleep
Peace from the war

[Intro]
You-
You look so broken when you cry
You-
You look so broken when you cry
You-
You look so broken when you cry
You-
You look so broken when you cry

[Verse 1]
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen

You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Bridge]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
You just need a better-
You just need a better life-

[Verse 2]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad

[Bridge]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
You just-
You just need a better life-
You just need a better life-

[Outro]
You-
You look so broken when you cry
You-
You look so broken when you cry
You-
You look so broken when you cry
You-
You look so broken when you cry

You-
You look so broken when you cry
You-
You look so broken when you cry
You-
You look so broken when you cry
You-
You look so broken when you cry

[Verse 1]
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin’ on the screen

You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Bridge]
You can’t fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new

I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

[Chorus]
(Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I’m swimmin’ in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I’m swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision)

[Bridge]
You can't fight it, you can’t breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new

I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

[Chorus]
(Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Outro]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh
Widow, widow

[Verse]
This is a wake, lay your head on my pillow
By the time you're awake, baby, you'll be my widow
I taught you how to feel, you thought you never could
And I taught you how to love, nobody ever would

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight I gotta go, somebody's waiting home
So after tonight's rendezvous, I might as well be dead to you

[Chorus]
Widow (Ah), widow (Ah), widow (Ah), widow (Ah)
Widow (Ah), widow (Ah), widow (Ah), widow (Ah)
Widow (Ah), widow (Ah), widow (Ah), widow (Ah)
Widow (Ah), widow (Ah), widow (Ah), widow (Ah)

[Post-Chorus]

[?]
Oh, ohh

[Verse 1]
Ceilings, plaster
Can't you just make it move faster?
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

[Chorus]
Then you're driving me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before

[Interlude]
If I ever decide to show you this
Like when we end up getting married in like 10 years
And we're about to have kids or something, I don't know
That's far-fetched but
If you ever listen to this, you're great and thank you for being you
The end

[Verse 2]
Bed sheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos
(I don't even know what I'm saying anymore, it's 1:30 in the morning)

[Chorus]
But it's over
Then you're driving me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

[Outro]
But it's not real (Not real)
And you don't exist
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed
It hits me (Hits me) in the car
And it feels like the end of a movie I've seen before
Before

[Verse 1]
When I cry, you cry
Is this real life?
I wanna know
Take me down to the coast
It's a new feeling
Not thinking, just feeling
I wanna know
Is this feeling revealing my soul?

[Verse 2]
Sunburn on my nose
Sun in the sky
Your hand on my thigh
You pick up a rose
From the path down to the beach
You hold it out and say "You're beautiful"
Why'd you do that to me?

[Chorus]
This is bliss
When you kiss me
I am so oblivious to what's out there
Don't you worry if I start to stare
Oh, 'cause nothing's wrong
This is how it should have felt all along
Now I feel truly happy
I deserve to be happy

[Verse 3]
When it rains, I smile
Do you wanna stay a while with me?
Am I falling? Maybe, but it's TBD
Honestly, I love being alive right now
I hate saying goodbye but I love how it feels to lеt go
I know that it'll help me to grow

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, this is bliss
When you kiss mе
I am so oblivious to what's out there
Don't you worry if I start to stare
Oh cause nothing's wrong
This is how it should have felt all along
Now I feel truly happy
I deserve to be happy

[Verse 1]
You were a light
Like the moon
Shining bright
Wild and free
A bouquet of daises
A lark in a tree

[Chorus]
Oh, the mountains, they whisper
Flowers, they bend
When your name is spoken among them
They know who you were
And you'll always be hidden away
Among the sycamore trees
No one could ever replace you
My honeybee, mmm

[Verse 2]
You were the wind
Wild and undisciplined
You lift without fear
Loved with a passion
That helped people heal

[Chorus]
Oh, the mountains, they sing
And the flowers, they grow
When a memory surfaces of a time long ago
We'll never forget you
That much I see as the light dances off
Of the cabin and trees
No one could ever replace you
My honeybee

[Bridge]
No one could ever replace you
No one could ever erase you
From their memories
Oh my honeybee
Flying free

[Outro]
Mmm, no one could-
No one could ever replace you
My honeybee

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile, that smile

[Pre-Drop]
That smile, that smile, smile, that smile
Back that smile, that smile, smile, that
Finally got back that smile, that smile, smile, that smile
Back that smile, that smile, smile

[Drop]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile
(Oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)
Finally got back that smile
Finally got back that
(Oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)
Finally got back that smile
Finally got back that

[Verse 1]
Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Fеlt like I failed the tеst

[Pre-Chorus]
But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection (Alright)
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile, that smile

[Pre-Drop]
That smile, that smile, smile, that smile
Back that smile, that smile, smile, that
Finally got back that smile, that smile, smile, that smile
Back that smile, that smile, smile

[Drop]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile
(Oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)
Finally got back that smile
Finally got back that
(Oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)
Finally got back that smile
Finally got back that (Oh)

[Outro]
I'm so thankful (Oh-oh)
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
Oh (Oh-oh)
I'm so grateful (Oh-oh)
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
(Oh)
(Oh-oh)
Finally got back that smile
Finally got back that
(Oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)
Finally got back that smile

[Verse 1]
Every time you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
'Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out

[Verse 2]
Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something that I've been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

[Chorus]
Loha, loha, mahi, cahri
Yoha, yoho
Yoha, yoha, maha, cahrah
Yohi, yoho
You are the onе in my dreams that I'm waiting for
You are the onе in my dreams that I'm waiting for

[Verse 3]
So if you begin to think that my light might be supernatural
I'd have to say, "You're right. You're right, mon cher, it is."
I came from a place that your mind cannot even imagine
We sing, "Ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah."

[Chorus]
And we sing
Loha, loha, mahi, cahri
Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maha, cahrah
Yohi, yoha

[Bridge]
You are the one in my dreams that I'm waiting for
You are the one in my dreams that I'm waiting for

[Outro]
I need your love, babe
I need your love, babe
I need your love, babe
I need your love, babe

[Verse 1]
Every time that you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
There's someone I have never talked about
I know that we'd both be dead if you found out

[Verse 2]
Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something I have been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

[Chorus]
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi
Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi
Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

[Verse 3]
So if you begin to think that my light might be supernatural
I'd have to say, "You're right. You're right, mon cher, it is."
I come from a place that your mind cannot even imagine
Where we sing, "Maha, mahaha, mahaha, maha."

[Chorus]
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi
Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi
Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

[Bridge]
Where we sing, "Maha, oh, maha, oh, maha, maha."
I'll give my love, babe
I'm your devoted
I'll give my love, babe
I'm your devoted

[Outro]
Maha, maha, maha, maha
Maha, maha, maha
I've been a moonshiner
For seventeen long years
I've spent all my money
On whiskey and beer

I go to some hollow
And sit at my still
And if whiskey dont kill me
Then I dont know what will

I go to some bar room
And drink with my friends
Where the women can't follow
And see what I spend

God bless them pretty women
I wish they was mine
Their breath is as sweet
The dew on the vine

Let me eat when I am hungry
Let me drink when I am dry
A dollar when I am hard up
Religion when I die
The whole world's a bottle
And life's but a dram
When the bottle gets empty
It sure ain't worth a damn

[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse]
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I want my house in the hills
I want my whiskey and pills
You want a wife and a kid
I don't think I'm down

[Chorus]
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away

[Verse]
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us (For us)
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I do get drunk and obscene
I'm forever seventeen
You want your castle and queen
I don't think I'm down

[Chorus]
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away

[Outro]
I want my house in the hills
I want my whiskey and pills (Uh-uh)
You want a wife and a kid
I don't think I'm down (Uh-uh)
It's time to let it go (Uh-uh)
I go crazy (Uh-uh)
Slide away (Uh-uh)
Back to the ocean, it's time to let it go (Uh-uh)
Back to the ocean, it's time to let it go (Uh-uh)
Back to the ocean, it's time to let it go (Uh-uh)
Back to the ocean, it's time to let it go (Uh-uh)
Back to the ocean, it's time to let it go (Uh-uh)
Slide away, slide away
It's time to let it go (Uh-uh)

[Verse 1]
Here's to all the ones tryna hold you back
Tryna make you feel like you're less than that
Giving nothing more better than to make you crack
But really just trying to push your dreams off track
And you know in the end, it'll be okay
'Cause all that really matters are the steps you take
And everything else falls into place
There's no price to pay, I say

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, alright (Alright)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
We gonna get it
When we live it, livе it
Well, alright (Alright)
Yeah, yeah (Yеah, yeah)
We gonna get it
When we live it, walk, walk

[Chorus]
It's a liberty walk, walk
Saying goodbye to the people who tied you up
It's a liberty walk, walk
Feeling your heart again, breathing new oxygen
It's a liberty walk, walk
Free yourself, slam the door, not a prisoner anymore
Liberty, liberty, li-li-liberty, liberty, li-li
It's a liberty walk, walk, walk

[Post-Chorus]
Don't stop
Keep on walking it, and
Don't stop
Keep on talking sh-
Don't stop
Keep on walking it
Walk, walk, walk, walk

[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid to make a move

It's a liberty walk, walk
Saying goodbye to the people who tied you up

Free yourself, slam the door, not a prisoner anymore
Liberty, liberty, li-li-liberty, liberty, li-li
It's a liberty walk, walk, walk

Keep on walking it, and
Don't stop (Just walk this way)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I fucked up the rap game and you ain't even know it
I just fucked what's her name and you ain't even know it (you ain't even know it)
She got a *beep* tattoo and you ain't even know it (real talk)
We about to form a little group and you ain't even know it, let's get it
Stuck in a rock and a hard place
Eminem, Pac and where God stay
Timberlands pop that jaw bone
Now bitch nigga, tell me how that tar taste
And even Tarzan can get swung on
I never hung out with the loud mouth
You got a foul mouth
And that dead body gon' smell foul when it fouls out
She filed my nails in the Bahamas
We found ourselves in the Bahamas
She found God, meditation, and peace
I found myself without a condom
You know everybody having them babies
It's a beautiful thing it ain't crazy
If a rapper monogamous, you know what the problem is?
Too many bitches got rabies
And I hate a ho-hoppin' woman
Stank pussy-poppin' woman
You fuckin' fool don't know about you
But my dick need 17 years on it
Anything after that is just a bonus
And I been in the lab with my opponents
And since Sway done swayed that list
He got a flatscreen the next morning
Tell 'em I need my credit when it's due
Tell 'em I need my lettuce when it's new
Tell 'em I got a fetish for fine fabric, Franklins and saying, "Fuck you"
Tell 'em it's TDE 'til I'm DDT'd in that grave
And Top Dawg is proof
'til my nigga Whoo Kid get free, ain't shit comin' for free
I'm 'bout to rape you niggas 'til you recoup
(Dizzle)
Come on over, baby
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Yes, I said come on over, baby
Baby, you can't go wrong
We ain't fakin'
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on

Well, I said come on over, baby
We got chicken in the barn
Woo, I said come on over, baby
Really got the bull by the horn
We ain't fakin'
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on

I said shake, baby, shake
I said shake, baby, shake
I said shake, baby, shake
I said shake, baby, shake
Come on over
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Oh, let's go
(Hold on)

(Well, shake)

Well, I said come on over, baby
We got chicken in the barn
Whose barn, what barn, my barn
Comе on over, baby
Really got the bull by thе horn
We ain't fakin'
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on

Easy now, shake
Ah, shake it, baby
Yeah, you can shake it one time for me
Yeah-huh-huh-ha-ha, come on over, my baby
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on

Now let's get real low
Shake, baby, shake
All you gotta do, honey, is kinda stand in one spot
And wiggle around just a little bit
That's all you gotta do
Ooh baby, whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Now let's go one time
Shake it, baby, shake it
Shake it, baby, shake
Come on over
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Shake it, baby shake
I said shake it, baby, shake it
I said shake it, baby, shake it
I said shake it, baby, shake it
Come on over, whole lotta shakin' goin' on
She said call me, told me her name
Whispered something sweet then went away
I keep calling, every night
She don't answer but tonight she might
I get restless, pour my wine
Turning pages, tryna’ bide my time
The door's open, like my eyes
Was it truth she told or was it lies?

Wait, it's more than I can take
My eyes glued to the phone
Been silent for so long
Say, do you remember me?
Or are you on your own?
Happy all alone

She said call me, told me her name
Whispered something sweet then went away
I keep calling, every night
She don’t answer but tonight she might
I get restless, pour my wine
Turning pages, tryna' bide my time
The door's open, like my eyes
Was it truth she told or was it lies?
Wait, it's more than I can take
My eyes glued to the phone
Been silent for so long
Say, do you remember me?
Or are you on your own?
Happy all alone

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
I should take a shot in the mornin'
Cheers to all my fears
Last night, I was caught in a moment
How did I get here?
Reminiscin' old times I had
Smile from ear to ear
Maybe it's not that bad
I shouldn't even care

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
But I do
I care too much, I care too much
I care too much about you
But I do
I do
I care too much
I care too much about you
More than myself sometimes

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
It needs to be about me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
So let it be

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
I should push my 3 o'clock to no o'clock
'Cause I don't wanna disappear
This room got my head spinnin'
Like a carousel at a fair
I know I should give it up
But there's somethin' 'bout the chase
'Cause when our bodies touch
It erase everything

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
But I do
I care too much, I care too much
I care too much about you
Yeah, I do
See, I do
I care too much
I care too much about you
More than myself sometimes

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
It needs to be about me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me
So let it be

[Verse 3: Tierra Whack]
It's just me myself and I (Me, I)
Can't believe I tried (Me, I)
To help you, then you lied (Me, lied)
Like a million times (Times)
Yeah, I'm in my prime (Prime)
A few parkin' tickets, but I'm fine (Fine)
I ain't paid a dime (Dime)
Tell 'em stand in line (Me)
Baby, I got shit to do
If I was you
I would probably cry and miss me too
Dissin' who? This the new me
I'm gettin' chicken, boo
Whack and Alicia
Well, at least I feel invincible

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
But I do (Ah, ah, ah)
I care too much, I care too much
I care too much about you (Ah, ah)
Yeah, I do (Yeah, same)
See, I do (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I care too much
I care too much about you
More than myself sometimes

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me (What? Same, same, same)
It needs to be about me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me (Same, same, same)
So let it be

Something that I know you gotta scheme on
Just to get ya dream on, this ain't what it seems
Find, find another cut to pour some lean on
Just to get your sleep on, just to catch some zzz's
​iPhone​ in my hand go ring, ring, ring
Lightbulb in my head go bling, bling, bling
Eyeball in my head see everything, thing, thing
I just had a dream, what it mean, mean, mean?

[Verse 1]
Paper, scissors, rock, I'm rolling (Rolling)
This ain't state-run TV, we do what we want, we trolling
If y'all fall out over paper, that's not your homie (No)

Pearl a Swisher, box of stogies
Dodging vultures, ones that's bogus be the closest to you
Nigga, I see through you, niggas use you
Then be like, "We don't kick it like we used to"
It's funny, I'm a new me, but, shit, I never knew you

I see you clockin' us, bitch, you ain't anonymous

Fuck the world, it ain't monogamous
Even gave a second hand, but you wanted smoke
Push my buttons, bitch, I ain't remote

I was into you from the beginning even if you wasn't mine
Scared to admit my shortcomings led to overdraft in this affair, declining
Quicker than we started, evidence we misaligned
Man, I get more in love (More in love) with you each argument
Somethin' wrong with me, I like the way you screw your face up
Trigger me right when I need it
You wrong, but I can't get along without you
It's a shame and I can't blame myself, keep on lovin' you
You do it different

You still wit' it, when you want, ain't got to keep me, I am chill
Don't trip when you see me out, kickin' with my new bitch
I'll still hang around even though you cappin', cappin'
I could pretend you was my main nigga
Bet you love just how that feels (Oh, shit)
Out of my way, you out of pocket, need clear vision, boy (Vision)
Can't trust decision when you near me
Get myself caught in your crossfire
You a wild one, and I'm wading in you like it's cool water
Like it's cool when you pull up boo'd up with a new and it's not me

[Pre-Chorus: SZA with Ty Dolla $ign, Ty Dolla $ign]

A tap on the needle, Reagan was serving them whole things

You don't use uh, you don't use narcotics, do you B.o.B.?

[Chorus]
All that smoking can't be safe
All real niggas can relate
Too much commas in the safe
Too much drama in the way
Ain't no mixers in my drink
High in all them fifty states
Lately, I've been feeling godly
I know gods don't make mistakes
All that choking can't be safe
Suck me off of something gray
Take my mind off all the pressure
I just dropped about an eighth
How much longer can it take?
Turn a pound into some shake
And my mama ask me questions
All that smoking can't be safe
I been having visions

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the shit I be seeing be actually funny (Funny, funny)
Niggas always be deep when they ain't got your monеy
Vampires be siphoning enеrgy from ya
If you a winner they want you to fall
To steal your whole summer
Somebody gotta stay, yeah
And somebody gotta take the truth
Yeah, I hate to be blunt but I'm blunted
Your mind can get read like it's blushing
It's ironic, my trunk in the front
Guess that's why I'm always confronted with luggage, bands

[Chorus]
All that smoking can't be safe
All real niggas can relate
Too much commas in the safe
Too much drama in the way
Ain't no mixers in my drink
High in all them fifty states
Lately, I've been feeling godly
I know gods don't make mistakes
All that choking can't be safe
Suck me off of something gray
Take my mind off all the pressure
I just dropped about an eighth
How much longer can it take?
Turn a pound into some shake
And my mama ask me questions
All that smoking can't be safe
I been having visions

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I see through that cap like a snapback
Stay close to my .9 like a hashtag
Girl, where your ass at?
Pussy so fire it came with a CashApp
Ki-ki-ki-kicking this shit right now
Drugs, kicking in, shit, right now
She sipping this fifth right now
Might take an edible
Smoking vegetables in high decibel
They get fed up and turn federals
Enemies acting friendly
Enemies acting friendly
They pretending to be a different identity
Niggas be plottin' by any means
I swear niggas the epitome, bands

[Chorus]
All that smoking can't be safe
All real niggas can relate
Too much commas in the safe
Too much drama in the way
Ain't no mixers in my drink
High in all them fifty states
Lately, I've been feeling godly
I know gods don't make mistakes
Though sometimes I contemplate
I've been moving off of faith
Take my mind off all the pressure
I just dropped about an eighth
How much longer can it take?
Turn a pound into some shake
And my mama ask me questions
All that smoking can't be safe

[Outro]
All that smoking can't be safe

Do your dance, let it percolate, tell me how it taste
It's your b-day, shawty, blow it like a cake
Make a wish, she say I'm her bucket list
My Rolex cost a bit, time fuckin' with my wrist

Money is my therapy, don't know who else to talk to
I'm the type could fly, but two miles when I crawl through
Gotta make the play, I don't date when I ball through
Shout out to them girls say they don't trip if I don't call you
I'm married to the bag, that's the reason I ain't follow you, bitch

[Chorus: B.o.B]
What's your purpose?
I need my money urgent

It always start with the friendly shit
I ain't fucking with the friendly shit (Cash Clay)
When the friends get benefits

[Verse 1]
If your niggas scheme on you, then it's money well spent
I guess that's how much it cost to find out who the snakes is
Niggas ghost you, nigga, I don't know you (Bah)
If I was a different type of nigga, I'd probably smoke you
But, shit, I had to figure out all this shit by myself (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
Real niggas to the right, fake niggas to the left
And I step (Uh), step (Uh), step (Uh), step
Leave 'em in the past, guess they all get left
You won't catch me checking for no ex
So-so-sorry out of sight, you can argue with yourself
I'm on some after hour shit, yeah (Yeah)
And don't be hitting me up looking for some closure through a text

[Chorus]
She be leaving, she be leaving
Too soon (Le-le-leaving), too soon (So soon), too soon
(Don't be leavin', baby, don't you leave me, baby)
Never had the wisest tone, but she was true (Why you leave me, baby?)
(Don't you leave me, baby, she be leaving, she be leaving)
Leaving soon (Le-le-leaving so soon)
Never had the slightest clue, but the world is doomed (Don't you leave me, baby, yeah, why you leave me, baby?)

[Verse 2]
It's a no, no text back, bitch got three phones
She be super quiet when she tip-toe, yeah
She be super quiet when she tip-toe, yeah
She be pressed, brought a friend, double threat
Asking for address, hoes on deck, ain't no stress
You know, you know the fucking vibes, you forget?
Cut her off, she already obsessed
Probably shouldn't have fucked a nigga bitch, no way
Shouldn't have had that bitch in a crib, no way
If you come up once, then you gotta bring two
If you gotta bring two, then one of them niggas probably gonna be the one
To put you in your tomb, ooh, ooh
Ashes fall on you

[Chorus]
She be leaving, she be leaving
Too soon (Le-le-leaving), too soon (So soon), too soon
(Don't be leavin', baby, don't you leave me, baby)
Never had the wisest tone, but she was true (Why you leave me, baby?)
(Don't you leave me, baby, she be leaving, she be leaving)

Never had the slightest clue, but the world is doomed (Don't you leave me, baby, yeah, why you leave me, baby?)

[Verse 3]
That's how it start
It always start with the friendly shit
I ain't fuckin' with the friendly shit
When the friends always get benefits
Yeah, yuh, yuh
Yeah, yuh, yuh
Why you turned yourself into a mark?
If this really how you feel, you should've told me from the start
Well, that's just how it goes
Live a life niggas can't afford
When you rockin' ice niggas ain't chose
Catching flights, niggas gotta stay home (Home)

[Chorus]
She be leaving, she be leaving
Too soon (Le-le-leaving), too soon (So soon), too soon
(Don't be leavin', baby, don't you leave me, baby)

[Chorus]
Sometimes I don't wanna die
Sometimes I don't wanna live
Sometimes she be regular
Sometimes on the black mirror
She's so fine
Fine
Fine
Fine

[Verse 1]
Aggravated, but acclimated
Numb to the appeal, joy encapsulated
Stranger to my shadow, my past is shaded
The one that slayed Goliath, call me Aphrodavid
We ain't weak, the pleasure worse than the pain
Pleasure's worse than the pain, plеasure's worse than the pain
Wе ain't weak, you really love to let it build and let it fall apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Apocalypse in slo-mo
View the cameras and the GoPros
Fuckin' up my vibe, oh no
If you ain't tryna stay, bitch, go

[Chorus]
Sometimes I don't wanna die
Sometimes I don't wanna live
Sometimes she be regular
Sometimes on the black mirror
She's so fine
Fine
Fine
Fine

[Verse 2]
One, two, three, four, I'm just countin' thoughts
I can't feel my face, I can't even talk, no
One, two, three, four, come get in my car
We can't even think, we can't even walk
Oh, in slow-mo
Pain pills, we might dose
Downers know no dose
Calabasas livin' got my neck froze
We ain't weak, I'm a warrior, I need a 3 P
Perkys got me shy as hell, Chief Keef
Not a skater, but I'm grindin' up a G

[Chorus]
Sometimes I don't wanna die
Sometimes I don't wanna live
Sometimes she be regular
Sometimes on the black mirror
She's so fine
Fine
Fine
Fine

[Outro]
Higher (Huh)
Higher (Huh)
Higher (Huh)
Testin', testin', testin' my will
But gettin' too tired (Huh)
Tired (Huh)
Prayin', prayin', prayin' for good, yeah
'Cause I'm gettin' tired (Huh)
Guess, I've been used to bein’ used like this
Ain’t no difference
I’m immortalizing my thoughts
Praise to the most high for protection
Over my most prized possessions
Talkin' 'bout my sanity’s at a six-point seven
Handin' out poinsettias
To my dead homie mothers, prayin' they feel better
Might get shit mindin' my business
Might get chipped sharin' my vision

Might as well
Can you tell if it's even worth conversation?
Hear the prayer, do it even work?
All that's for real is forever
Moments stolen taste better

[Verse 1]
Summer's over and the money gone
I miss my mama when the tide is low
Moon corrals us to the water and my daddy calls on his
Favorite daughter for a host of loving words
I might oblige him
If the money right, is the pussy good?
I keep it tight for the right one
Save it all for the right one
Call it perfect timing

[Verse 2]
Make it bounce, baby, do a little more
I've been wiped out like three times
Beat that shit, call me nine lives
I got perfect time
I got perfect timing
Perfect

[Verse 3]
I can't stop till my shit shinе
I can't stop till I reach my
Perfect
Tic-toc, till it go away
Timе waits for nary man
I regret all the things we said in haste
Knowing the golden hour awaits for me
Twilight calls my name
Wrist froze, let the ice call my name too loud
Double zeroes by my name now
"And it all makes sense in the end," that's what they say to us
Spending our time smoking that angel dust
We on perfect time, perfect timing
We got per'

[Verse 1]
I've been running around in circles
Pretending to be myself
Why would somebody do this on purpose
When they could do something else?
Drowning out the morning birds
With the same three songs over and over
I wish I wrote it, but I didn't so I learn the words
Hum along 'til the feeling's gone forever

[Chorus]
Took a tour to see the stars
But they weren't out tonight
So I wished hard on a Chinese satellite
I want to believe
Instead, I look at the sky and I feel nothing
You know I hate to be alone
I want to be wrong

[Verse 2]
You were screamin' at the Evangelicals
They were screamin' right back from what I remember
When you said I will never be your vegetable
Because I think when you're gone, it's forever
But you know I'd stand on the corner
Embarrassed with a picket sign
If it meant I would see you when I die

[Chorus]
Sometimes, when I can't sleep
It's just a matter of time before I'm hearing things
Swore I could feel you through the walls
But that's impossible
I want to believe
That if I go outside I'll see a tractor beam
Coming to take me to where I'm from
I want to go home
In and out of breathing
Up all throughout the long night
Can't seem to come out either
In brighter days of harsh light

What stumbles to the gates now
Won't share a shed of empathy
Just seems to fall apart now
The rogue to chart a vagrant sea

(I come to)
It's on or just none other
(I want to)
Fingertips of fallacy
(I want to)
Holdin' on to anything
(I want to)
That gets down on bended knees

Within the confines of wilted hearts
Fall on hard times and fall apart
Within the motions to receive
The parting words I'll never read

[Verse 1]
I’ll take the wrong path
I think I've gone a little off track
And now there’s no way back
You took all the apples that I had

[Pre-Chorus]
But I heart you and I wanna be your girl
I heart you and I know you’ll rock my world

[Chorus]
‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

[Verse 2]
Big, bad, naughty rock star
Your claws are shinin' bright in the dark
Liftin' up my little red skirt
I know you’ll leave me here in the dirt

[Pre-Chorus]
But I heart you, and I wanna be your girl
I heart you, so come back and rock my world

[Chorus]
‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

[Bridge]
Life is like, like a little game
That we like to play, just for fun, just for fun
Yeah, we take nothing seriously
Nothing’s wrong, make me run, all night long
Hide and seek is how you play with me
Oh, you’re tempting me, just for fun, just for fun
I hear you calling me over city streets
Through the trees, mess with me, then you’ll leave
Oh, be still my heart, escaping in your cherry red car

[Chorus]
‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
‘Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

[Verse 1]
He's Jesus Christ
And I’m his babydoll
I'm his favourite human but he saved them all

[Pre-Chorus]
He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour

[Chorus]
Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend

[Verse 2]
He's my personal saviour
He's my personal angel
My God thinks I’m smashing
He thinks I’m fine
My God takes me dashing cross the party line

[Verse 3]
He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour
My God treats me special
Gives me lots of things
I had some of his boyfriends offer diamond rings

[Verse 4]
He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour
He's my personal angel
He's my cherry pie
Said to call him "Dick Chasey"
He's my private eye
When I get in my gown
He comes to me in the night

[Intro: Lana Del Rey]
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
Bill takes me down to the beach
In the coat that he got from his father
He whispers to me that sometimes
He thinks he sees things over the water
Like, maybe UFOs or something flying in the air
Well, I don't know about those, Bill
But I don’t care

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober but you’re getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got the night
We still got tonight

[Verse 2: Barrie-James O'Neill]
Bill takes me down to the beach
In East Hampton and walks on the watеr
Says "They don't know it yet
But I'm the sеcond coming of The Father"
And he keeps on fishing
Trying to turn one into twenty
Still in the ocean and the wine for the summer time

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Barrie-James O'Neill]
Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober but you're getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can’t take it
But at least we’ve got tonight
We still got tonight, still got tonight
We still got tonight

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey]
Come to me, tell me I'm wrong
Come to me, ooh-ooh
Come to me, tell me I’m wrong
Come to me, save me now
Tell me I'm wrong (Tell me I'm wrong)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I’m sober but you're still getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got the night

[Verse 1]
Sun stare, don't care with my head in my hands
Thinking of a simpler time
Like Sun Ra, feel small
But I had it under control every time

[Chorus]
When I was a waitress wearing a white dress
Look how I do this, look how I got this
I was a waitress working the night shift
You were my man, felt like I got this
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
Down in Orlando, I was only nineteen
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I only mention it 'cause it was such a scene
And I felt seen
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

[Verse 2]
Summer, sizzling
Listening to jazz out on the lawn
Listеning to White Stripes when thеy were white-hot
Listening to rock all day long

[Chorus]
When I was a waitress wearing a tight dress handling the heat
I wasn't famous, just listening to Kings of Leon to the beat
Like look at how I got this, look how I got this
Just singing the street
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I felt free 'cause I was only nineteen
Such a scene

[Bridge]
Summer, summer's almost gone
We were talking about life, we were sitting outside 'til dawn
But I would still go back
If I could do it all again, I thought
Because it made me feel, made me feel like a god
'Cause it made me feel, made me feel like a god
Somehow it made me feel, made me feel like a god

[Chorus]
When I was a waitress wearing a white dress
Look how I do this, look how I got this
When I was a waitress working the night shift
You were my man, felt like I got this
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
Down in Orlando, I was only nineteen
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I only mention it 'cause it was such a scene
And I felt seen
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

[Chorus]
When I was a waitress wearing a tight dress
Like, look how I do it, look how I got this
I was a waitress wearing a tight dress
Like, look how I do this, look how I got this

[Outro]
It made me feel, made me feel like a god
It kinda makes me feel, like maybe I was better off
'Cause it made me feel, made me feel like a god
It kinda makes me feel, like maybe I was better off

[Verse 1: Miles Kane]
Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my father either
He ain't been home for years
I know I'm no spirit-seeker
I can't sleep through the tears
I get lost in the ether

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey & Miles Kane]
I check in, I wreck it, I turn it around
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back

[Verse 2: Miles Kane]
Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my doctor either
He won't take any calls
He's no fucking spirit healer
He just can't stop to talk
But he's gone now for the weekend

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I check in, I wreck it, and I'll explain
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back

[Outro: Miles Kane & Lana Del Rey]
555
Please don't try to find me through my dealer (9275, 555)
He won't pick up his phone (Now you've got a busy tone)
All circuits are busy, goodbye
All circuits are busy, you're high
Please don't try my father either (All circuits are busy, goodbye)
He ain't been home for years (All circuits are busy, you're high)
(Laughs) Hello?
This is Rat Weed?
No... No!

Some static started in the pool hall
Hit a motherfuckers face with a cue ball
Then I met this girlie, she tried to gank me
I hit her on the face with a plank, G

You piss me off, I feel like going off
On the lam, not teasin with my Uzi, just sprayin

I'm trippin and drinkin, stinkin and geekin, when I'm trippin it don't matter what I stick my dick in

Me and my crew were out breakin windows
My bed, spread legs, and then in goes
My jimmy, my jammy, I did her on my knees
Then out from her pussy came a set of car keys

I'm a city slicker, I'm not no townie
Right now, I wish I had another hash brownie
Drinkin pints, buggin out on life
Goin off cuz tonight is the night
To go uptown 'round the 40 deuce
I be jerkin off with my head in the noose ya'll
Like Ricky always said you've got to toke and pass
Or Mookie's gonna kick your fuckin' ass
C to the H double E B A
And now you know just how I start my day

First I drink then I got drunk
I barfed and then I stunk
I'm short but I can dunk
And my dick is a tree trunk

Yo man you remember back in our high school days?
You remember that librarian lady?
What's that librarian got going on?

I felt so stupid when I dropped my card
But when she bent over my dick got hard
I told a little joke then she started to giggle
But little did she know that I was watchin titty jiggle

I'm a writer, a poet
A genius, I know it
I don't buy cheeba, well I grow it

I put on my galoshes and my new rain slicker
Went out and bought a light so the herb will grow quicker
I dried it in a toaster oven, hid it from your mother
I put it in a ziplock bag and sold it to your brother
You can't deny me, you always wanna try me
Yo, you're just gonna get yo ass kicked!

Homeboy throw in the towel, your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell

People always tryin to get next to me, had a beautiful experience on ecstacy
I smoked up a bag of elephant tranquelizer
Punched the face of a money hungry miser

Chewin on mushrooms and gettin high
People gather round to ask me why
Had a caine filled kool with my man Rush Rush
Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush

You was holdin my dick while I was pissin on your girl
I got so much cum I could drown the whole world

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

[Verse 1]
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
(1, 2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive, drive, drive
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Said I'd try but I never learn, yeah
Said I'm fine but I never was
I play it off like it don't hurt
But it never works, no
Said I'd try but I never learn, yeah
Said I'm fine but I never was
I play it off like it don't hurt
But it never works, no

[Verse 1]
Been here for a minute, I ain't gon' lie
Every other day, I been drunk and high
There's a whole lotta ways I can spend my time
But I spend it all with you on my mind
I know it's toxic but I don't care
I want to find help but I'm too scared
My whole life been in and out of Hell
That's why it's hard for me to let you in

[Chorus]
Said I'd try but I never learn, yeah
Said I'm fine but I never was
I play it off like it don't hurt
But it never works, no
Said I'd try but I never learn, yeah
Said I'm fine but I never was
I play it off like it don't hurt
But it never works, no

[Post-Chorus]
No, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't
No, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't, no (Uh)
It never works, no, it never works, no, no

[Verse 2]
And I see it
Pieces, don't believe it
I'm so lost, I keep playin'
Also, I was hurt deeply
For no reason, in the deep end
Also, for no DJ
Also, I'm in the deep end
Stuck here for no reason
Deeply, oh

[Chorus]
Said I'd try but I never learn, yeah
Said I'm fine but I never was
I play it off like it don't hurt
But it never works, no
Said I'd try but I never learn, yeah
Said I'm fine but I never was
I play it off like it don't hurt
But it never works, no

[Post-Chorus]
No, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't
No, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't, no (Uh)
It never works, no, it never works, no, no

[Part 3: 911]

[Verse 1]
Turnin' up emotional faders
Keep repeating self-hating phrases
I have heard enough of these voices
Almost like I have no choice
This is biological stasis
My mood's shifting to manic places
Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships
Watch life, here I go again

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry ever again (Ooh)
I can't see me cry
Can't see me cry, this is the end (Ooh)

[Chorus]
My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggеst enemy is me, pop a 911
My biggеst enemy is me ever since day one
Pop a 911, then pop another one

[Part 4: Rain On Me]

[Intro: Lady Gaga]
Whats up MTV?
Let me change real quick!

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
It's coming down on me
Water like misery
It's coming down on me
I'm ready, rain on me

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]

Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on

Rain on me, baby
Rain on me

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande & Lady Gaga]
Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
Oh, but at least we try (We try)
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & Lady Gaga]
I can feel it on my skin, it's comin' down on me
Teardrops on my face, water like misery
Let it wash away my sins, it's coming down on me
Let it wash away, yeah

[Chorus: Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Both]
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me (rain, rain)
Rain on me (rain, rain)
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive, baby
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain, rain, on, on me

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande & Lady Gaga]
Rain on me
Rain on me
Oh yeah, yeah
Said rain on me

Rain, rain on me

[Part 4: Stupid Love]

[Verse 1]
You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me, hee, yee

[Refrain]
I freak out, I freak out, I freak out, look at me
I get down, I get down, I get down, look at me
Freak out, I freak out, look at me now
'Cause all I ever wanted was love, love (Ooh)

[Spoken]
I want your love
I want it all night, every day
But I want you to love yourself
Tonight, and every night
Celebrate yourself
Love who you are
Be kind, mask up
Be brave! And braver all the time
One, two, make it stupid

[Chorus]
I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
(Uh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Now, it's time to free me from the shame
I gotta find that peace, is it too late or
Could this love protect me from the pain?
I would battle for you even if we break in two

[Refrain]
I freak out, freak out, freak out, I freak out (Look at me)
I get down, get down, I get down, I get down (Look at me)
(Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out)
Look at me now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all I ever wanted was love, love
All I ever wanted was love
Hey yeah, hey yeah

[Chorus]

(Uh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah! Oh, I
I, I want (woo!)
We got a stupid love, love, love, love
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Countin' up the minutes that I wasted
I could use a little motivation
Somethin' that's gon' get me out of bed
So I don't blow my brains out, I go and live instead (Blaow)

[Chorus]
I don't need you to call my phone
Tell me that I have somewhere to go (Hmm)
Oh no, I'd rather just be alone (Hmm), oh, woah

[Verse 1]
Well, this world (World, world, yeah)
This world is crazy
I don't lift a finger 'less a motherfucker pay me
I remember always comin' up short
Like a 5'4" motherfucker on the court
And now these people wonder, "Who that?"
I miss the nuts and bolts, I got a loose cap but scrеw that
This forward, never move back
I'm layin' nеw tracks like brand new weave
Watch me go to work, oh yes, I'm rollin' up sleeves (Shit)
Swear that my intentions are correct
I would mention my perspective is intelligent
So yes, I have a bit of trouble bein' benevolent (Mmm)
I let the chip fall off my shoulder, I'm so—It's so irrelevant (Yeah)
My past is my past, I move past that
Don't hold onto shit, I ain't a motherfuckin' pack rat
Coach, put me in the game (Game)
Swear I need a switch-up, every day is like the same, I'm...

[Pre-Chorus]
Countin' up the minutes that I wasted (That I wasted)
I could use a little motivation (Some motivation)
Somethin' that's gon' get me out of bed
So I don't blow my brains out, I go and live instead (Blaow)

[Chorus]
I don't need you to call my phone
Tell me that I have somewhere to go (Hmm)
Oh no, I'd rather just be alone (Hmm), oh, woah

[Verse 2]
I'm keepin' track of all this time, but it's slippin' away
I get you loose, spillin' juice with every minute I made
Some bad decisions, but whoops
I went from sittin' on stoops, watchin' the days go
To sittin' at the head of the motherfuckin' table (Yeah)
It either make me stronger or it's fatal
In that case, put some diamonds on my halo
So I can shine, fly high, I climb
Recently been feelin' like my mind ain't mine
I don't know why sometimes I let my head get the best of me (Uh)
Wear this crazy life (Um) like an accessory
Freshest on the motherfuckin' planet
But this planet too complex for me to ever understand it, so (So)
I belong, Han Solo
Glass walls, throwin' stones like Quasimodo
And that's all folks know, that I'm goin' loco
Can't blame it on the coco no more
I need my mojo, 'til then, I'm...

[Pre-Chorus]
Countin' up the minutes that I wasted (That I wasted)
I could use a little motivation (Some motivation)
Somethin' that's gon' get me out of bed
So I don't blow my brains out, I go and live instead (Blaow)

[Chorus]
I don't need you to call my phone (Hmm)
Tell me that I have somewhere to go
Oh no, I'd rather just be alone, oh, woah, woah (Hmm)

[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah

Few young G's and OG's, you know

That choppa, though

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I let it ring (Brr), you know that I mean (Yeah)
I don't drink green (Uh-uh), I need my cream (Let's go)
I just wanna cum on her (What?), her face and her spleen (Ugh-ugh)
I just wanna let that bitch (What?), let that bitch ring (Huh-huh)

[Refrain: T.I.]
When shit get wrong, it can't go right
Now I've been known to get shit blown
Up out of proportion, bomb on site
Be careful with your body, put that on ice
I'm not gon' tweet, I'm not gon' type
Whatever you say, okay, alright
You pick your fate, you pay your price
Just know I do not play, alright, alright

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Lil' buddy acting hard (What?)
I'll send him to God (I'll send him to God)
My dawgs like Dodge (Ayy)
They pull up and charge (Pull up and ayy)
I'm ridin' in the ten speed (Skrrt)
It's hard to pull out the 'rage (Yeah)
It's dark, I'm fuckin' your daughters (Yeah)
Thеy twins, I'm Mr. Rogers

[Verse 2: T.I.]
'96 Impala with a hundred thousand dollars in the trunk
Thеy talk shit, we follow them punks
They cross that line, then bodies gettin' dumped
Fast forward twenty-five years, and I grew up
Nigga talk shit, don't do shit to him
Press that line and your string get pulled
Got a problem, bring it to him
Just don't be so immature

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I let it ring (Brr), you know that I mean (Yeah)
I don't drink green (Uh-uh), I need my cream (Let's go)

You pick your fate, you pay your price
Just know I do not play, alright, alright

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Shoot you on sight, don't blame it on Sprite
Don't blame it on ice, don't blame it on drank
I took a lil' X, I fuck on my ex
I did a lil' wrong, I'm makin' it right
Where did he go? He ran out back
He must've ran track, I splat his back
I got war wounds under my tats
I got a few bloods, they all say, "Slatt"
I got a few crips, they all on Old Nat
I bust on her lips, but not her back
That's not my bitch, that's not my nat
I'm just her pimp, I'm not her dad
The cops pulled me over, they smelled my thrax
It's not my gat, but them my racks
And them my Louis and them my slacks
And this my car and that's my bitch

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Ain't none of my concern, keep me outta that shit
Nigga all on my dick, tryna follow my bitch
If I catch him in Vegas, I'ma catch a new case
Fifty niggas with you, I'ma be in your face
Nigga thinkin' shit a game, bet his ass get stabbed
Nineteen in the clip, let his ass get half
Best case scenario, get your ass kicked, man
Worst case, end up in a plastic bag
With no order, there is chaos, never let 'em handle, nigga
Motherfuckin' player, I do it like an Atlanta nigga
You do that shit for IG and the fuckin' camera
You won't be happy 'til someone teach you some fuckin' manners

[Refrain: T.I.]
When shit get wrong, it can't go right
Now I've been known to get shit blown
Up out of proportion, bomb on site

[Outro: T.I.]
You know what the fuck going on with us, man

[Verse 1]
All I, all I ever wanted
Was a dollar and a chance
Find, find what I'm made of
Alright
Coming, coming from the bottom
Better learn how to dance
Find, find what you're made of
Alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel like my love is wasting
Every day, yeah
Get so damn tired of chasing
Every day, yeah
And now it's you I'm missing
Every day, yeah
Every day, yeah
Every day

[Chorus]
So can we talk for a minute?
Stop for a minute?
All I wanna do is you
Oh, can we touch for a second?
Be us for a second?
Don't matter what I give it to
My love looks better on you

[Post-Chorus]
My love looks better on you
Promise you, baby
Promise you, baby
Hold up

Run, run through the street now
Alright

And now it's you I'm missing
Every day, yeah
Every day, yeah
Every day

[Chorus]
So can we talk for a minute?
Stop for a minute?
All I wanna do is you
Oh, can we touch for a second?
Be us for a second?
Don't matter what I give it to
My love looks better on you

[Post-Chorus]
Promise you, baby

[Bridge]
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever wanted

[Intro: Ant Clemons]
Wait a minute, uh

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
You came to me without warning
And I was unprepared
Losing all my intuition, tryna act like I don’t care
I’m so lost in all this madness
So I'm throwing up a flare
But you know, baby, I’m a problem
Tryna act like I'm not scared

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Caught me in ways that I can't explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused
Thought I could handle this tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got slipped away into you
(You-ooh)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Ant Clemons]
Act of God, don’t know how it started
No bad flaws at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh

[Post-Chorus: Ant Clemons]
I’m lifted, my God
And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car (Car)
Got me lifted (Lifted)
Act of God (On God)
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fire (Ooh)

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
Could this be a revelation?
Tell me, is this what I need?
‘Cause all this divine intervention
I’m starting to believe
Is this all an accident, or is this by design?
I know I didn’t ask for it
But now I need it to be mine (Need it to be)

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Caught me in ways that I can’t explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused (Confused)
Thought I could handle the tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got slipped away into you
(You-ooh)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Ant Clemons]
Act of God, don’t know how it started
No bad flaws at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh

[Bridge: Dua Lipa]
I’m scared of the fall
Scared of losing it all, losing my way
It’s my way or nothing
But you give me something I just can’t explain
But then I got lost, lost in you, babe
Got lost in your ways and nothing can save me
Nothing can save me

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Ant Clemons]
Act of God, don’t know how it started
No bad flaws at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh

[Post-Chorus: Ant Clemons]
I’m lifted, my God
And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car (Car)
Got me lifted (Lifted)
Act of God (On God)
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fire (Ooh)

[Hook: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
Why'd you have to leave soon?
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to leave me
When I needed you the most?
Cause I don't know really how to tell you
Without feeling much worse
I know you're in a better place
But it's always gonna hurt

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How could we not talk about family, when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Hook: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Harmonize: Charlie Puth]
WHOOOoooooo...!

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place

[Verse 3: Charlie Puth]
How do I breathe without you? I'm feeling so cold
I'll be right here for you 'till the day you're home

[Hook: Charlie Puth & Wiz Khalifa]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (Yeah, We've come a long way)
From where we began (You know what we've started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (We'll tell you)
When I see you again

[Harmonize: Charlie Puth & Wiz Khalifa]
OOOOOOOOOoooooohhhh!!!
OOOOOOOOOoooooohhhh!!!
WHOOOOOooooo...! (Yeah)

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How could we not talk about family, when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

[Hook: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Outro 1: Wiz Khalifa & Charlie Ruth]
How could we not talk about family, when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
We all change, we all grown (OOOOOOOOOoooooohhhh!!!)
A new ring, Uhh! (OOOOOOOOOoooooohhhh!!!)
Remember me when I'm gone (WHOOOOOooooo...!)
When I see you agaaa-ain (OOOOOOOOOoooooohhhh!!!)
Uh! Yeah! Again, Yeah! (OOOOOOOOOoooooohhhh!!!)
Yeah, Yeah, Uh! When I see you again (WHOOOOOooooo...!)
Yeah, yeah! See you again! (OOOOOOOOOoooooohhhh!!!)
Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Ah-ah (OOOOOOOOOoooooohhhh!!!)
Uh-huh, yeah! When I see you again (WHOOOOOooooo...!)

[Outro 2: Wiz Khalifa]

What’s the use in crying? honey i’ve been fooled by love, this way before

There’s no more early mornings, waking up alone
And though it feels like dying, honey i’ve been fooled by love, this way before

[Chorus]
Why am I still crying? it’s no use left in crying
But I’m still out here, crying. i’ve been fooled, by love before

[Verse 3]
There’s no more conversation, no knocking at her door
And though it feels like dying, baby i’ve been fooled by love, this way before

What’s the use in crying? honey i’ve been fooled by love, this way before

But I’m still out here, crying. when i’ve been fooled by love before

Don't matter the time of day, they come out and play
'Bout your paper, you a boss, girl thats safe to say
I don't gotta teach you much, you was made that way
Rollin' kush in my lap, thats your favorite place
Smoke the joint, you don't want a Backwood now
Say you not good at rollin', imma show you how
You ain't never takin' half, want the whole amount
Used to gеt emotional, but you control it now
Only keep eyes on mе, I feel like thats appropriate

Can't fuck with a square bitch, she a boss one
See them piercings when she take her top off
Sixty-one rag top, got her ridin' shot gun
Got a couple girlfriends, told her tell 'em to come
If they want to, we could all play
Chill in my hot tub, if you want to, you can stay
Came one time, that's just a taste (Haha, haha)
If you want more, you gotta wait

Big kush in my joints (Haha, haha), so she know what's up
Stay on mine, on my game, never fold up
Just broke on a new bitch, she a cold one
Nigga that ain't yours, you get what you saw (Haha, haha)
You ain't a real nigga, you a fuckin' troll
I got a grip on the game, no remote control
No room in my pockets 'cause both of 'em swole
Peel two bitches, both of 'em chose (Haha, haha)
Money make the world go 'round, how it's 'posed to go
Can't turn into your girl, if she supposed to hoe
Bitch knew she's with a boss, soon as she close the door (Haha, haha)

With diamonds rings and such
Nigga make the wrong move, then he will get touched
Got you leavin' out the crib, lookin' all dressed up
Bring it all back, but you don't stop, you can't get enough
Hundred dollar joints, name on our cup
Royal flush, new owners of the club
Only fifties and hunnids, no we don't do dubs
Not even on our whips
Come out on a Saturday and I can show you scrubs
Takin' shots, when she was supposed to be with cuz
From the gate, I knew just what it was

Straight shots, we don't want no chaser (No chaser)

You with me forever, no this ain't no phase
Hop in my rag top Chevy

Don't hesitate with my paper
She bring it through every occasion
Don't gotta tell the girl shit
Go out and get it, they do it by naturе
If she see one outside
Thеn she gon' bring me a new money maker
Lotta dips
But none like my bottom bitch
Do what she got to just to get it
And she proud of it
It's time to ride she gon' be right there beside me
Lame nigga ain't convinced
Lost his bitch, ain't seen her since

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Hangin' out that whip when I come through (I come through, oh, oh)
Ridin' down that strip (Ridin' down the strip, oh, oh)

Gotta drive (Gotta drive), so I get too lit (Too lit)
Real player shit

[Verse 2: Young Deji]
Too player, no keys, we gotta push to start

Star, lost connection with the bitch that I met at the bar
Fuck it, miss one next ten choose who gon' set the bar
I can stay anywhere I wanna stay (Ooh woah)
You can say, anything you wanna say (Ooh woah)
Make sure where you at, it's just not in my way (Way)
If you work this hard then you can come and play (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

As if it wasn't already easy enough (Easy enough)
There you have it (There you have it)
Young legend (Young legend)
And still legend (And still legend)
I came a long way from that block with Sledgren
Down the streets with my big brother Chevy Woods
When a lotta niggas wouldn't even come to the hood (Come to the hood)
Stayed solid when others fold (Stayed solid when others fold)
That means we still got the same principles, morals and same code
Even though we all got kids and we a little bit older
I know 

[?] smilin' like a mug when he look down to see us
Lookin' at how we hustle heavy, and repped our Taylor Gang
'Til we made it out of our circumstances
Now there ain't no lookin' back, not even if we wanted to
Only movin' forward
Constant pressure bein' applied with the understandin' that this a legacy we leavin' behind
Lotta bumps on the road but shit, I ain't perfect
If you love me, you love me for who I am
Not who you want me to be
No one said the journey was gon' be easy
But they did say it'll be worth it
So I'ma enjoy every minute of it
With the people I consider very important, huh
That's VIP, oh yeah
So instead of countin' wins, we countin' blessings
Trustin' in God to show me the correct path instead of stressin'
Fool, only L I'm takin' is a lesson
Big Pimpin'

Do you mind if I play somethin' for you?

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh, I'm on top, my block is off
Soon as you walk up to me, I'ma make her count it
She wouldn't know what to do without me (Oh)
We in love, we get to the paper
And if another one choose you don't trip
Thats how I know you a down ass bitch (Okay)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
You ain't gotta stop, go hard, don't quit
Chillin' at the crib, when you out, you that bitch
Used to be skinny, now you gettin' thick
Used to want a boyfriend, now you want dick
You a bad lil bitch
Tryna rack up, tryna get rich
Tryna get money for a new Birkin
Tryna secure the trip for your girlfriend
Tryna lock down the D like a permit
Other girls try to hit, you determined
When the bitches come around, you make 'еm nervous
Make them othеr niggas pay for your service
Me?

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm on top, my block is off
Soon as you walk up to me, I'ma make her count it (Uh huh)
She wouldn't know what to do without me (I see who you with)
We in love, we get to the paper (I see who you wanna be with)
And if another one choose you don't trip (Oh)
Thats how I know you a down ass bitch (Uh)

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
I'ma show her what these racks do
Gettin' top in my homeboy's bathroom
She got all that ass on her when she pass through
Good brain, she the smartest in the classroom
She gon' bust it for a nigga, I'ma throw them ones
I'ma need a replay, baby, not just once
Told her, we just getting started, and the nights still young
We gon' need more shots 'til we both get drunk
Look, I'm a fool with it
You paid the doctor for it, what you gon' do with it?
Its brand new to me, I don't care who hit it
No kids, sorry, I can't let loose in it
You be cuffin' on a bitch, I let her choose, nigga

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm on top, my block is off
Soon as you walk up to me, I'ma make her count it
She wouldn't know what to do without me (Oh)
We in love, we get to the paper (Oh)
And if another one choose, you don't trip (Oh)
Thats how I know you a down ass bitch

[Verse 3: Narissa]
He thought he was rich 'til I made him richer
He thought he was really winnin' 'til he met a winner
My nigga in the summer ain't my nigga in the winter
Spend that cash on a nigga if you really fuckin' with it
Its just me and mine we countin' this money all day
We so in line, don't matter what nobody say
And I'll flip a brick quick instead of talkin' shit
With the shit, slap a bitch if she too up in my mix
On my nigga, all up on his dick, bitch, get a grip
I heard you thirsty for the tea, bitch, I know you wanna sip
Want a sip

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm on top, my block is off (Oh)
Soon as you walk up to me, I'ma make her count it
She wouldn't know what to do without me (Oh)
We in love, we get to the paper
And if another one choose, you don't trip (Oh)
Thats how I know you a down ass bitch

[Verse 1]
Why are you so low?
Girl, you gotta shed that load
That will bring you down
Every single place you go
You've got to love yourself
Go ahead, touch yourself
Take that time alone
Before your heart's with someone else
I've locked that same front door (For so long)
Damn, that feels so good
Why'd I keep it locked before?
Who is this old Bruce, what makes you so wise?
Something special in you
Everyone will see in time

[Chorus]
Got to keep your head up
Got to keep your head up
Got to keep your head up
Got to keep your head up

[Verse 2]
The world's a dungeon now
Thought you had the higher ground
Thought that I did too and then I saw myself in you
So we're both alike, it doesn't work that way
Something's calling me
Something's calling

[Chorus]
Got to keep your head up (Oh, oh)
Got to keep your head up
(You know, you know, you know, you know)
Got to keep your head up (I'll keep it up)
Got to keep your head up

[Bridge]
Feels so good
But it takes so long
To unlock one's self
Maybe try this song

[Chorus]
(Got to keep your head up)
Got to keep your head up
Got to keep your head up
Got to keep your head up
(Got to keep your head up)
Got to keep your head up
(Oh, got to keep your head up)
Got to keep your head up
(Got to keep your head up)
Got to keep your head up
(Got to keep your head)
Got to keep your head up
Got to keep your head (Got to keep your head up)
Got to keep your head up

Keep your head, got to keep your head up

Sweet as broken dates (Yah, yah)
Only For Dolphins
Uh, Queen shit
Millennium thugs
(Yeah, yeah)
(It's the sweetest love)

[Verse 1]
When they landed here, your boy was stranded here (uh, yeah)
Kind of crazy, started all this shit with just a strand of hair (that's it)
Me and my wife all night swing from the chandeliers
Fucking acrobatic artistry, bitch pardon me
You could feel this like some H inside your artery (uh)
Give love to the departed, always know they'll be a part of me (yeah)
On expensive rugs I spill chardonnay (uh-huh)
My initial script cursive on the headrest of the beige Targa seat
Better maintain low tones when you talking to me (fuck off)
Fuck around and get your sea bass smothered
I'll choke you the fuck out like I'm a Diaz brother (go to sleep)
Then I'll jump back in the sports car, bumpin' Heavy D
Bitch I'm very me
Look it's Bronson smoking drugs under the cherry tree
It's him, baby

[Chorus]
The sweetest love
It's the sweetest love I've ever known
(I love-love-love-love-love you)
The sweetest love, the sweetest love

[Verse 2]
Twenty Kawasakis looking like wild horses on stampede
I look like a character that was drawn by Stan Lee
Strength like Žydrūnas Savickas, speed of a crackhead
Took five minutes to get from here to Baghdad (from Queens)
All around the world I'm known by different names
Never the real one (never), 'cause motherfucker shit done changed
Spin a revolver when it's high noon and lift that brain
Baby just fix the plate up so I can whip this plane (whip this shit)
I need to focus, dear (yeah), but there's all this hash, need some smoke in here
If we get attacked in the woods, I'll have to choke the bear
It's all a bunch of smoke and mirrors
Just give me a moment baby, don't get near me
(Don't fuckin' touch me, please)

[Chorus]
The sweetest love
It's the sweetest love I've ever known
(I love-love-love-love-love you)
I love you, I love you
I miss you, I kiss you, I need you

[Intro: 2-D & Leee John]
I see myself going through the streets
Think I must be dreaming
The lost chord
I want you toute ma vie (The lost chord)

[Verse 1: 2-D, Leee John & Both]
(Take me into the garden)
I see rain's coming down
At this time of year, I'm always in need of
Of silent waves (Silent waves)
The pulse on your face

[Chorus: Leee John, 2-D & Both]
The lost chord
The lost chord
The lost chord
I go harder, harder (Take me into the garden)
The lost chord (The lost chord)
The lost chord
The lost chord
I go harder, harder

[Verse 2: Leee John & 2-D]
Music on my mind
Break those chains, baby
I just wanna find myself, (Oh) (Take me into the gardеn)
I'm trying to find (Oh)

[Chorus: Leee John, 2-D & Both]
The lost chord
The lost chord
The lost chord
I go hardеr, harder (Take me into the garden)
The lost chord
The lost chord
The lost chord
I go harder, harder (Take me into the garden)

[Bridge: 2-D, Leee John & Both]
Pump me up heavy (Pump me heavy)
Move me somewhere I can see the sunlight
Take me into the garden
The silent waves (Silent waves)
The pulse on your face (Harder)

[Chorus: Leee John, 2-D & Both]
The lost chord (Allow me)
The lost chord
The lost chord
I go harder, harder (Take me into the garden)
The lost chord (The lost chord)
The lost chord
The lost chord
I go harder, harder (Take me into the garden)
The lost chord

[Outro: Leee John]
Tryna find my way every single day
Tryna find my way
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
Break those chains that bind me, I wanna be free (I wanna be free)
Break those chains, baby
Break those chains that bind me, I wanna be free (Wanna be free)

[Verse 1: 2-D]
Chalk tablet towers, like drawing shadows
Chemical distractions, you are not with me
I departed in the spring, to a distant star
But I could not get back, I had gone too far (O-o-o-oh)

[Chorus: 2-D & St. Vincent]
I wanna get drunk
I wanna get stoned
I wanna give up
I wanna go ho-o-o-ome

[Verse 2: 2-D & St. Vincent]
Watching rockets take off from a parting sea
How will I ever touch you if you are not with me? (O-o-o-oh, out here)
There's only silence (Out here), no form of contact (Out here)
I am dreaming, looking into the darkness (O-o-o-oh)

[Bridge: 2-D & St. Vincent]
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh) (O-o-o-oh)

[Verse 3: 2-D & St. Vincent]
I won't be back 'til the end of summer, will you still be therе?
I won't give up on you, darling, just tell me that you carе
I don't need no trophies, no cell with a view
There's nothing I wouldn't give one minute with you, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Outro]
(You, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
(You, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
(You, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Verse 1: 2-D]
You've more or less forgotten me this summer
And I can’t hide my disappointment
I was on my way in the Phantom V
The one you gave away

[Verse 2: 6LACK & 2-D]
I tried to tell you that I love you but I'm choked up
You forgot and that makes me feel like no one (Summer lines)
Were you ever really there? Did you ever really care?
Wait, I got so many examples of all of the
Good times we had, long summer nights (Summer lines)
Held you long time, put your name in my rhyme
Refresh your memory of where you wanna be
The phantom's on the way, she’s coming down the street

[Chorus: Elton John]
I tried to get to Atlanta
On a peach blossom highway
I tried to put these pauses out of mind
In a sky made of diamonds
Where the world fell silent
I'll be waiting for you on the other side

[Break: 2-D]
Summer lines (Everyday, everyday)
Summer lines (Ride where the summer goes)
Summer lines
Every night
Summer lines

[Chorus: Elton John & 2-D]
I tried to say I love you
But you didn't listen (Summer lines)
I tried to give you everything you might need (Summer lines)
In a sky made of diamonds
Where the world is flawless
I'll be waiting for you on the other side

[Break: 2-D]
Of summer lines (Summer lines)
Holding me for a long time (Summer lines)
Seems to be I'm in a dream
Behind these summer lines

[Outro: Elton John, 6LACK & 2-D]
The phantom is coming
You forgot and that makes me feel like no one
She's crossing over the line
Wait, I got so many examples of all of the good times we had
Seems to me, I'm in a dream (Long summer nights, held you long time)
(Put your name in my rhyme, refresh your memory)
Behind these summer lines (Of where you wanna be, the phantom's on the way)
(She’s comin’ down the street)
Summer lines

[Intro: 2-D]
(Mike WiLL Made-It)
When was I supposed to
Bow down with you? (Yeah)
What can I be prayin' for?
There's nothing in this world
(Can we, can we just do that last piano part a little bit?)
(Eardrummers)
(That's it, yeah, great, is there a lighter?)
Bow down with you
What can I be prayin' for?
There's nothing in this world

[Refrain: 2-D]
When was I supposed to (Get up, get up)
Bow down with you? (Bow down now, bow)
What can I be prayin' for? (Prayin' for, prayin' for)
There's no one in this world like you

[Chorus: 2-D]
We are dead butterflies (Butterflies, butterflies)
Laid out on a sprung floor
Waiting for the low tide
To pick us up and fly (Fly, fly)
We are dеad butterflies

[Verse 1: Roxani Arias]
I'm all in, let mе know what you're thinkin'
Catch feels, wind down while figure this out, right now
Deja que fluya pa' no perder el control
No queda de otra vamo' a tar en lo mismo
Estoy dispuesta a darte todo el cariño (Todo el cariño)

[Verse 2: Kano]
Two-steppin' while I move reckless
New settings, booze and nudes pending
Loose evidence and news trending, effortlessly truth bending
Who's treacherous? Searching for feelings of a new friendship
There's but a few endings, everyone's a winner 'til you lose bredrin
Hold-tight when we used to hold tight
Levitate to Most High and fuck up the whole skyline
Bright lights, I hope that feeling can replenish
Regretful, 'cause if I let you left me then I'll be rush rouletting
With a whole full clip in - pow, cashmere drippage now
And memories, lift me up, but still a man's tears dripping down
Onto these photographs of what we used to be
But over time, that puddle turns into a sea
When I observed you cry a stream
I was just surfing on your grief
The hurt I can't delete, just come to terms with who is me
But who are we? These mirrors don't reflect perfection
Just put on your crep selection, come on two-step to heaven with me

[Chorus: 2-D]
We are dead butterflies (Butterflies, butterflies)
Laid out on a sprung floor
Waiting for the low tide
To pick us up and fly (Fly, fly)

[Bridge: 2-D]
'Cause if it's not me then
Who's it gonna be, baby?
If it's not us (Not us, not us)
There's nothing in this world for me

[Chorus: 2-D]
We are dead butterflies
Dancing on a sprung floor now
Waiting for the low tide
To pick us up and fly (Fly, fly)

[Refrain: 2-D]
When was I supposed to (Get up, get up)
Bow down with you? (Bow down now, bow)
What can I be prayin' for? (Prayin' for, prayin' for)
There's no one in this world like you (Like you, like you)

[Outro: 2-D]
We are dead butterflies (Butterflies, butterflies)

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
I've been cooped up for a minute
I've been inside working on me
Hyperbolic chamber I sit
I'm gon' dance my way out of this
Winter lasted for ages
Trouble don't last always
Brand new life, turn the page
Be alright, be okay

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Grinding, loving, singing, hugging, living, get it, stack it
Run it, dancing, flying, people, wake up
Come on, keep on, dreaming, don't stop
Loving, trying, growing, don't stop
They gon' try to slow you, don't stop
Never, ever, know I, don't stop
London, Paris, L.A., don't stop

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
Atlanta, Jamaica, Rio, don't stop
New York, Lagos, Sydney, don't stop
You tried to kill me, created a monster
You tried to end me, but fate said "No, no"
Know why they envy, I got it, it's in me
Been so long since I had new faith
Been so long since I changed my ways
Been so long since I been okay
I met a lady on the side of the road
And her eyes were a story that had never been told
About a life that was lived on hope
And the truth of the inner light that we all hold
She said "Baby, I can hear my train coming
I'll leave with something before I go
Listen child, don't you ever waste time tryna dim nobody shine
Better water your own"

[Verse 3: 2-D]
Will we wake up tomorrow?
I feel like we are closer together
Sing for colossal changes
And how we treat each other when we're living in a city of elevations
Is it man or woman feeling some balance today?

[Bridge: 2-D]
Hope
Hope the radiant light is shining on you (Shining on you)
Hope
Hope the radiant light is shining on you

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Grinding, loving, singing, hugging, living, get it, stack it
Run it, dancing, flying, people, wake up
Come on, keep on, dreaming, don't stop
Loving, trying, growing, don't stop
They gon' try to slow you, don't stop
Never, ever, know I, don't stop
London, Paris, L.A., don't stop

[Verse 4: Doctur Dot]
Been a long time since I been outside
Don't let it catch up with me
I contact just with me
Tapped in, wrapped up
Bring it in, let me in
Let me all over in between
Leave a toothbrush in your dreams
I ain't worried 'bout the next thing
I'll be with you to the extreme
Ice bounce off the glow of the moonlight
I hope we're still close when the sunrise
I paint the picture clear for ya
I can't hold this in much longer
Searching for this feeling my whole life

[Bridge: 2-D]
Hope
Hope the radiant light is shining on you (Shining on you)
Hope
Hope the radiant light is shining on you

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro: Joan as Police Woman]
It's starting to pour
Why don't we get out in it and dance on the pavement? (Yeah)
Abandon your wars
The sky and thunder and lightning and rain are innocent
It's tipping down, I can't see
But I'm not really caring 'cause I'm dancing on the pavement
Oh, say, can you see?
The sky and thunder and lightning and heaven's open for us

[Chorus: 2-D]
Shut in, don't know, no, no, to be shut in
Don't know, not meant to be shut in
Don't know, camera, sicken, now come, you're alive, oh
It's taking me out (Simplicity)

[Verse: 2-D]
Night time and I go smooth some off
(Little bit of news)
Negative, now it's red and I
Chime in strong
(Little bit of news)
Are you ever really lost?
You cutting cardboard
Watchers waiting, we had names
We had suspects, but a boxset caught your eye
And I was forgotten, I was forgotten
I am the architect of this delusion
The burgeoning load, one billion
These are amazing times
The past is a place where rockets take off
What now, a burnished plaque

[Chorus: 2-D]
Shut in, don't know, no, not to be shut in
Don't know, not meant to be shut in
Don't know, camera, sicken, now come, you're a loss

[Outro: 2-D & Joan as Police Woman]
Simplicity
Wood pigeon, always you
(Save her, save her, save, ooh)
Ingloriously
(Save, save, saving me, oh)
I always hear you, mmm
(Me, oh)
Simplicity
(Save, save, ooh, oh)
Simplicity
(Ooh)
Simplicity
(The sky it could make it rain instead)
Simplicity

Severed head
Severed head
Severed head
Severed head

[Verse 1: GoldLink & 2-D]
I've been losing everything, yeah
I can't keep a fucking thing, yeah
Do the money, do the fame
It seems like that controls this thing
Guess my head just left the building
Like out the window, missed the ceiling
I cannot explain this feeling
I never learned to speak a zillion
Now I'm stuck, my body left me bleedin' (Severed head)
Roll the train, it's passing fast, it's speeding outside
My body gone, don't need the soul, ey
Just take another breathe or so, ey
Found on my torso
I mean my neck go, but where did my heart go?
I mean my leg go, but where did my mind go?
I guess I only gotta go where the body goes
Geronimo (Stay a little longer)

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Paradise has mountains that take a lifetime
To climb in dreams, I fly above them
I'm haunted by what I saw last night
On angelic highways, waiting in the darkness
I'm on a speeding train (Severed head)
I stick my head out of the carriage window (Severed head)
My cheeks inflate, my eyes become watery (Severed head)
Whoosh, my head is severed (Severed head)
Will you stay a little longer?

[Verse 3: Ruban Nielson & 2-D]
Condensation makes pathways down a window pane (Severed head)
I don't really wanna watch you drive away
What do you say?
Maybe you could stay for another day
Oh, baby, wait
What exactly did the doctor say?
I've been grinding teeth awake in bed
And my aching head, how could love suddenly be dead?
We could swallow bread, our hunger is not easily fed
I've been waiting for sleep to come
I've been breathing through these aching lungs
I keep waking up, this is worse than ever breaking up
If your time is up, how much more before mine is up?

[Outro: GoldLink & 2-D]
Yeah, uh, the roundabout (Severed head)
The vibe is nice, we all will die
Yeah, I mean the roundabout (Severed head)
Our life is nice, we all gon' die, right?
Oh, the roundabout (Severed head)
The vibe is nice, we all will die, yeah
I mean the whole roundabout (Severed head)
My life is nice, we all gon' die, yeah
Severed head
Severed head

On God, I be tryin' baby
At least you know the truth, I ain't lyin' baby

Then I get anothеr text from my ex
On God, it's like clockwork

You take me back and then I lie to you again
I slipped into the DM of your best friend
Oh God, I didn't mean it
Truth is I only messed up because you seen it
When I say I love you, girl, I swear I really do
I did some things to you, I knew it wasn't cool
On God, can you forgive me?
I mean, look past of all my 

[?] and forgive me

I can't get it right, I try and I try
But I end up right back where I started
Don't take my advice

I told you a million lies, sorry a million times
Never wanted you to cry, baby
Got way too good at makin' you hurt
'Cause in love I was the worst, baby

[Chorus]

I mean really go to town on me (Town)
I mean really do a number on me (Suck that dick, bitch)
Supplyin' the leak, a few fiends died at my feet (Woo)
Got dealt a bad hand, off a half gram (Ow)
Feast or famine, give you a half xan
And throw you in the Grand Canyon (You fuckin' dead, haha)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
Yeah, uh
Uh
Meyhem doin' good, that's a rumor that I heard
Wearin' diamonds, eatin' blue fin tuna
They wanna test me like I'm Bradley Beal
None of your motherfuckas real, my nigga pass the steel
Mass Appeal, mass production
Mass destruction, crime, corruption
Wine consumption
On a private island wildin'
The sun threw shade 'cause it's jealous of my medallion
Pitchin' and then compilin'
Late nights like Jimmy Fallon
Louis silk covered with dice, picture me stylin'
My life story is an open shirt outfit
We gettin' money, kid, you niggas ain't 'bout shit

[Instrumental Outro]

Crash my shit, send myself straight through the window (Uh)
The lead actor in my life story, Delroy Lindo (Uh)

Couple noodles lose from the chicken noodle soup, uh
Hangin' out the Porsche with a cape on (Uh)

Disintegrate your facial (Ho)
Motherfuckers owe me some Rolexes (I need 'em)
Motherfuckers owe me some planes (Let me get that)
For letting these suckers live in my lane (Uh uh)
Someone owes me a dinner table (Uh huh)
Just make sure it fits twenty hash pipes,

You know the vibes, family (Yeah)
I do a tumble out the Hummer and throw a knife right through your eye cavity
I'm recognized as a stand-up guy by five families (Rambo)
That means I'll take it to the gravel
My alibi for the police is I was naked in Seattle (I was)
Million-dollar calls while I'm shittin'
I close the deal, that's what I call pimpin' (Pimp)
Shoes on my feet, that's called Pippen
Pardon me, ha

'Til I see angels (Ah), I see the world from all angles
And from a thin thread, my soul dangles
Just like a mango (Ooh), alpha bravo (Uh)
Lookin' like your boy just won the lotto
But then drowned every dollar in a bottle (Every single one of them)
And put a bunch of junk (Uh), in his arm and his nose (Uh)
And between his toes (His toes)
'Cause feelin' good's the only thing he knows (Ah, the pain)
Shit (Yeah man, you know we feel that)

Do I deserve it or not? Now that's a different topic (Hell yeah, you do)
I think I do though (Uh-uh), All these times I seen the planet Pluto (Uh-uh)
And when I get back I got no jet lag (You know it), I'm wired different (True)
The slightest thought of me inspires vision (It's true)
And puts a smile on the face of a man that knows he 'bout to die in prison (Uh)
I'm high and twisted (Uh), some would say divine and mystic (Uh)
'Cause I can eat a bag of mushrooms and still drive the stick shift (Ooh)
Like Hélio Castroneves (Uh), seein' psychedelic colors, I'm a dead head
Man, why the rose on fire in my palm? Like a saint for a made guy (Ooh)
Blood drops fallin' from my eyes, right on the gray five
I made lives so now it's time for me to lay a vibe
You feel me?

[Outro]
Uh, I made lives so now it's time for me to lay a vibe, lay a vibe (I feel good, I feel good)
Lay a vibe, uh, lay a vibe, uh

Here I am sunk in the Jeep
Windows up, you can't see the boy
'Cause these cowards think it's huntin' season (Uh)
I just pressed a button (Uh)
And the stuff from the trunk come to the front (Ah)
Before I throw this pack of dynamite I light the blunt up (Uh)
Trippin' balls, as I drive the Grand Cherokee Laredo through the mall (Shit)

[Verse]
Stuck in the maze, switch my face up like Nicolas Cage's
Switch up the plates before them cowards catch a gaze
I'm in the shower with my Latin maid
That ass is hot, you could crack an egg and cook it
She told me, shake my dick, I shook it
She wasn't even lookin'
She was locked in watchin' Vampire in Brooklyn
Eddie Murphy with the long hair
Well, I prefer Trading Places
Shit, I might have landed a role in the new Matrix
Cop the blue spaceship
Just stay the fuck from 'round my essence if you got two faces
I'm fired up, like an old-school basehead, from Mill Basin
86' shit, I can still taste it
I lost my house on the Raiders, and those fuckin' Lakers
They tackled Bo at the 30 and did me dirty
Elbow injury for Magic, ankle injury for Worthy
I'm in that black 8-50 twirlin'
With the all brown shearlin' on
Earl the Pearl jersey, my mind got murder on it
Dudes be emotional bitches
I float in the six and if I want, I could put like twenty ki's of coke on my wrist
You know the kid, one hand hang off the cliff
Like I'm Sly Stallone
I'd rather die alone than live around you motherfuckin' cowards

[Outro]
It's true, it's true, it's true
It's true, it's true, it's true
It's true, it's true, it's true

Blood inside my eyes (Uh), I can't let it touch my son's head (No)
This shit drippin' on the BoJack's with no napkins (Uh)
Life is one take, no actin'
Already travelled back and forth to different galaxies, no cappin' (God damn)
You starin' at the Captain (Uh), a young Eric Clapton (Uh)
The all white B7 Alpina see me lamped in (Uh)
Money green sweatsuit made by champion a champion (Champion)
Fuck the blunts, double parked outside the Pantheon
Feelin' like I'm Maximus (Uh)
This type of shit'll make the feedback flip
Make the plane fly backwards (Ooh), make the college coach buy my pops a tractor then I practice (Blue Chips)
We set him up through the computer, he a catfish (Haha)
He thought it was Maria (Uh-uh)
But it was a motherfucker that looked like Judge Mathis (Ah-ah)
Pull the machete out the mattress (Oh, oh)
Caught him slippin', he an actress

While mami make the mofongo, I play the bongo
And race four wheelers through the jungle (Man, oh, man)
It's like I'm everybody's favorite uncle (Man, for real)
They always ask for money (Uh, for real)
They know we stay in trouble (Uh)
But still they love me off the humble (Ah)
Shit, same here, bitch I love you (Ah)

Things in my life I can't discuss, why? (Ooh)
'Cause people can't be trusted (Uh, woo)
I circle blocks like an estrange husband with the OJ gloves in (Ah, woo)
You better lay low cousin (Yeah, woo)
Man where the clams at? Nobody ordered ham here (Uh, nobody)
Grabbed his arm (Uh), pulled his hand, he'll stand clear (Ah)
Start the saw, just like you breakin' down a deer, you hear? (Ah, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom)
Man I swear (Ah), you fuckin' with the wrong one (True)
And it's gonna catch up to you in the long run (Guess you run)
Shit's bizarre (It is), I play the MAC 11 like guitar (Uh, uh)

When I was youthful (Damn, why?)
Man, I don't even know how to pray, dog (Fuck)
This big, long shit get sprayed off, uh
Ruined my life bettin' my money on them gray dogs (Fuck it)
If I die today I'm still gon' live forever (Forever)
I might just pop up when it's long leather jacket weather (Undertaker)
When the caddy drive a little slower (Woo)
When that haze hit my lung (Swoo)
And my eyes get a little lower (Swoo)
They had the camcorders goin' at the cookout (Uh)
If police approach (Uh-uh), you can hear the whistles from the lookouts (Yeah)
Shit man, I just put two fuckin' books out (Two of 'em, two of 'em)
Bestsellin' author, motherfucker, I'm good now (I'm good now), shit

[Verse 3]
Thousand horses in the Shelby (Vroom, vroom)
Havin' lunch in the Catacombs
Doggy, doggy, smell me? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Basic bitch, she got the bag with all them LV's
I like my bags filled up with money straight from Tel Aviv (Bling)
Or diamonds (Bling)
And there's nothin' on consignment (Bling, bling, bling)
I said it's all about the product and not the salesman (Swing, swing)
New York to Paris, three hours because of tailwind
I'm so wave it's like I sailed in (Sailed)
I tell that tale about the great white whale that's on the trail for his paper (ayayayayay)
Buy a brand new outfit for a motherfuckin' hater

How the hell you gonna tell that man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Brady, where's your gun at? *Gunshots*

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & 

[?]]
Now kill yourself
Why'd you say that?
'Cause that's the American way plus it was fun
Man, you a damn jack-
-ass I know everyone wanna make me the scapegoat
Like your the greatest of all time
Fuck you
Asshole
Let's stop the bickering
That's the last time you see me ignorant
So you can kill the thrills of thinking we're not different
Yeah, yeah, you're embarrassed aren't you?
Couldn't control your arsenal
Maybe the next time I'm persuading you, jump in the car pool
So what's your answer?
Man you must have 

[?] your cracker
Oh no, another white joke, I'm laughing, how original?
You're asking for me to be on the shit that you on
Yeah, we can start with this cat named G Malone *Static*

[Interlude]
"Meet G Malone, a west coast recording artist that's destined for stardom, but acknowledging the false hopes that lie within the music industry, he ponders the thought of going back to drug distribution. Feeling unsure of this decision (DJ rock star

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & 

[?]]
Hey G, remember me?
It's yo' conscience
You know, the voice in yo head that never had fed your nonsense?
I know your getting famous and rather lifestyle is changing
But tell the truth
The music biz isn't what it seems, ain't it?
Don't listen to em G
Keep putting Watts on the map
Fuck that
You been gettin' money way before rap
I say you go back hustlin
