eavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Darkness flies, all is light;
Shepherds hear the angels sing
"Alleluia! hail the King!
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ the Saviour is born."

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia;
Christ the Savior is born!
Christ the Savior is born!
Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth

Silent night, holy night
Wondrous star, led thy light;
With the angels let us sing
Alleluia to our King;
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
Girls
They come and they go
They kiss
Come and they go
Like breeze
Brushing my cheek
Like pain
Like the tears on my face

Girls
They come and they go
Like spirits
They vanish at dawn
My heart
Suspended in time
Like you
Vanish like tears in the rain

Girls
They take their loves away
Like spirits
Living so far away
Girls
Pretending to break down and cry
Girls
Whispering wind
What are they giving away

We used to be so happy
Remember, remember
So happy
I never knew
How lonely
How lonely
How lonely I could feel

Girls
They come and they go
They kiss
They come and they go
Like spirits
Brushing my cheek
Like pain
Like the tears on my face

Girls
They take their loves away
Like spirits
Living so far away
Girls
Pretending to break down and cry
Girls
Whispering wind
What are they giving away
We used to be so happy
Remember, remember
So happy
I never knew
How lonely
How lonely
How lonely I could feel
Girls

[Verse 1]
You are my best friend, but then you died
When I was 23 and you were 25
You are my best friend, but then you died
And how will I survive, survive, survive, survive?
Oh, how will I survive, survive, survive, survive?

[Chorus]
And every day I waited for you
And every day on the top of your car
Every day I waited for you
And every day on the hood of your car
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah hah-ah-ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah hah-ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I had a dream of you, you were drifting away
You were sad and the ocean dripped away
And I know you're gonna be okay
'Cause I can see it in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
And I know I'm gonna survive, survive, survive, survive

[Chorus]
And every day I waited for you
And every day on the top of your car
Every day I waited for you
And every day on the hood of your car
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah hah-ah-ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah hah-ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
And every day I waited for you
And every day on the top of your car
Every day I waited for you
And every day on the hood of your car
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah

Mama don't you beg your daddy for no diamond ring
Mama don't you beg your daddy for no diamond ring
'Cause mama you already got the best of everything

I see you riding 'round, baby, riding in a brand new car
I see you riding 'round, baby, riding in a brand new car
I know you couldn't buy it sitting on your caviar
Now your bracelets, your furs and that Paris label
They're laying right there, laying on the table
They'll come, hop, skip, and jumping as long as you're able
Go get me some money baby, and lay it on the table

Get up, get up, get up, get up, woman
Get up off your big, fat rusty dusty, don't you hear me woman
Get up, get up, get up, get up, woman
Get up off your big, fat rusty dusty
Get up mama, before it gets too rusty

Now you've got the very best, the best of everything
And baby, honey, you know how to do everything
You even got that champagne taste
But I'm so afraid baby, oh, you'll let me go to waste
Get up, get up, get up, get up, woman
Get up off your big, fat rusty dusty, don't you hear me
Get up, get up, get up, mama
Get up off your big, fat rusty dusty
Get up mama, before it gets too rusty

Two drummers they were seated in a grand hotel one day
While dining they were chatting in a sort of joking way
There came a pretty waitress to bring a tray of food
They spoke to her familiarly in a manner sort of rude

At first she did not notice nor make the least reply
When somethin' that was said to her brought teardrops to her eyes
She turned on her tormentors, her cheeks were flamin' red
Approaching as a picture these are the words she said

My Mother was a lady and yours, I would allow
You may have a sister who needs protection now
I've come to this great city to find my brother dear
You would not dare insult me, sir, if brother Jack were here

The two sat there in silence, their heads hung low in shame
Forgive us, miss, we meant no harm, pray tell us what is your name
She told him and he cried aloud I know your brother too
We've been friends for many, many years and he ofttimes speaks of you

Come go with me when I go back and if you'll only wed
I'll take you to him as my bride, I've loved you since you said
My Mother was a lady and yours, I would allow
You may have a sister who needs protection now
I've come to this great city to find my brother dear
You would not dare insult me, sir, if brother Jack were here
Can't you just see yourself in a gingham gown
Little pink ribbons tied in your hair
Sitting there by my side when we ride through town
Folks'll turn around, oh how they'll tell
Can't you just see yourself on a porch with me
Watching a show that stars give for free
One little word can do it, so say the word
And we'll have dozens of chicks, a house in the sticks
Where people are glad to be known as hicks
Can't you just see yourself in love with me?

Can't you just see yourself on a porch with me
Watching a show that stars give for free
One little word can do it, so say the word
And we'll have dozens of chicks, a house in the sticks
Where people are glad to be known as hicks
Can't you just see yourself in love with me?

[Verse 1]
Right around the corner there is an angel, yeah
And all I hope and pray, I'll make her my girl
So, if I have wings of gold, I'd fly to you, my love
Yes, I would
And on my way to you I'll catch a star from above

[Pre-Chorus]
Straight away I'll fly to cloud number nine
See if my baby was feeling fine
When I get there, this is what I'd say

[Chorus]
Hello there, angel, are you feeling fine today?
I happen to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd fly by your way, to say
Angel love, my darling angel, can you come out to play?
Come on angel, please, I love you

[Verse 2]
Now right around the corner there is an angel
If Phyllis only knew, oh how she ran into you
Yes, she would!

[Verse 3]
The beauty of your love shines trough and trough
And all, all without you
I know my world will come to an end
But I feel you float beside me
With each day, a new dawn begins

[Chorus]
Hello there, angel, are you feeling fine today?
I happen to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd fly by your way, to say
Angel love, my darling angel, can you come out to play?
Come on angel, please
Oh. walkin' with your halo on
Hello angel, yes darling, I want to take you home
After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red

And the wind whispers, "Mary"

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere, a queen is weeping
Somewhere, a king has no wife

And the wind, it cries, "Mary"

The traffic lights, they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that lived is dead

And the wind screams, "Mary"
Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past?
And with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers, "No, this will be the last"

And the wind cries, "Mary"
Come in this house
Stop all of that yakety yak
Come in this house woman
Stop all of your yakety yak
A stop your yakin' woman
You're nothing but an alley cat

You talk all day
You talk about this and that
You talk all day woman
You're talkin' 'bout this and that

Well its been 5 years
Can't hold back my tears
Cause I'm just so happy I'm marrying an angel today oooo
As I take your hand
I pledge to be your man
I vow to love to hold to cherish
And never disrespect the love we share
I'll be honest I can not lie
There'll be real good days
There'll be some bad times
I'll be standing right be side you my sweet baby
With the love of mine
And you take this ring
And i place it on your sweet and lovely hand
We will show our kids
They will tell their kids
What mom and daddy did
On the day I married my angel
I love you my angel

I've had everything that money can buy
Oh, but still I'm so unhappy darling, that I could cry
Because I've never had peace of mind, darling, in my life time

When you're in trouble and all down and out
Then you'll find out, darling, what it's all about
Then you'll realize that peace of mind, darling, is hard to find

I've been everywhere, seen everything but I only have myself to blame
For not realizing while I was riding high that happiness is something money can't buy
Oh, the things I haven't done, darling, are very few
Yes, I've had trouble baby, and good luck too
Oh, but I've never had peace of mind, darling, in my life time
How could I illustrate my love 4 U?
What would U do if U were in my shoes?
Would U climb the highest mountain?
Would U sail across the sea?
If I were a million miles away, would U visit me?

How could I illustrate how much I really care?
How could U do if U were here, my dear, and I was there?
Would U eat a poison apple?
Would U be burned at the stake?
If I were a million miles away, would U visit me?

CHORUS:
I love U a million miles, I love U
I love U a million miles, I love U

If U love me, would U eat a poison apple?
How much would U take?
And would U be burned at the stake?
Where's the dawn?
Darkness is death
Don't die, live 4ever
Say U love him
How could I demonstrate the way U make me feel?
If I walked through fire, would U say my love was real?
U got me crazy, I'd do most anything
If U got in trouble, I'd sell my diamond ring
That's how much I love U, baby, a million miles

CHORUS {x2}

(Somebody, somebody clap your hands) {x4}
Somebody, somebody

A million miles
A million miles

[Intro]
I am in misery
Yeah

[Verse 1]
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be, and I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

[Verse 2]
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be, and I'll set you free

[Chorus]
I am in misery
And there ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, yeah

[Bridge]
You say your faith is shaken, and you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to roam

[Refrain]
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah

[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

[Outro]
Oh, come on
Girl, you really got me bad
And I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see from me if her hair is hanging long
For that's the way I remember her best

I'm wondering if she remembers me at all
So many times I've thought and prayed
In the darkness of my night
And the brightness of my days

So if you're traveling in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime
Didn't you?
People'd call, say: "Beware, doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all
Kiddin' you

You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging
For your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Oh, you've gone to the finest school, alright, miss lonely
But you know you only used to get
Juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get
Used to it
You say you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say: "Do you want to
Make a deal?"

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did
Tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your
Kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything
He could steal?
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To hang on your home
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinking thinking that they
Got it made
Exchanging all their precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it, baby

You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets
To conceal

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Let's take it nice and easy
It's gonna be so easy
For us to fall in love

Hey baby, what's your hurry?
Relax and don't you worry
We're gonna fall in love

We're on the road to romance, that's safe to say
But let's make all the stops along the way

The problem now of course is
To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime
'Cause nice and easy does it every time

We're on the road to romance, that's safe to say
But let's make all the stops along the way

The problem now of course is
To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime
'Cause nice and easy does it
Nice 'n' easy does it
Nice 'n' easy does it every time
Like the man says, 'one more time'

Nice 'n' easy does it
Nice 'n' easy does it
Nice 'n' easy does it every time
Ah..... Ah....
We may be big or small or black or white , eternally
And black and white is you and me in a special light
We may be young or old or in between ,but this much I know
Together we can learn to grow
In a world that's ever turning it's back on you
If you give it all away 
Make it mine ,ine , ine , ine , mine
You are desire , everything you need
I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I
Base my whole existence on
And when I get to you my
Desire is glowing in your light

These are the golden years we get to live
We lead the way , tomorrow we can start today
In a special light
Love could be good or bad or in between
But this much I learn
Baby , you and I can learn
In a world that's rearranging it's reality
If you give it all away
Make it mine , ine , ine , ine , mine
You are desire , everything you need
I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I
Base my whole existence on
And when I get to you my
Desire is glowing in your light
Ah...
And it's nice to light a fire
When it's cold outside
If you give it all away
Make it mine , ine , ine , ine , mine
You are desire , everything you need
I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I
Base my whole existence on
And when I get to you my
Desire is glowing in your light
Jojo was a man who thought he was a woman, but he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona for some California grass
Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged
Get back Jojo, go home, get back, get back Joe
Sweet Loretta Molin thought she was a woman, but she was another man
All the other girls around here said she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can
Oh, get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged
Get back Loretta, go home, get back to where you where you once belonged
Get back, your monny's waiting for you
Wearing her high heeled shoes and her low neck sweater, get back home Loretta
Please believe me, I will never be untrue
And don't believe the jealous lies they told to you
Oh no, don't go, don't make this poor boy cry
I'll be true, I beg of you, don't say goodbye

Now don't you know I love you more than I can say
And it would mean my life if you should run away
Oh no, don't go, don't make this poor boy cry
I'll be true, I beg of you, don't say goodbye

You just won't listen to my pleas
You want me beggin' on my knees

So sit right down and listen while I beg, you see
I'll never be untrue, so please believe in me
Oh no, don't go, don't make this poor boy cry
I'll be true, I beg of you, don't say goodbye
I'll be true, I beg of you, don't say goodbye
I took a walk around the yard
Dug the flowers til it got too hard
I smoked my first pack of cigarettes today
And I watched the children play

And then I went down, down to Lucy's old Cafe
Put a half a case away
I took a sleeping pill and tried to watch TV
But you know baby the leading lady looked too much like you for the likes of me

And I woke up crying in my sleep
I was talking to your pillow
And I reached out to touch your hand
And knocked the phone off the nightstand
And the operator said, "May I help you please?"
No thanks baby there's nothing you can really do for me
I just had a bad dream, that's all that's wrong with me
I just had a bad dream

Went out to loosen up the car
Some how I wound up at the rainbow bar
I had a scotch and soda on the run
But I didn't get too far
And then I ran down, down some friends I used to know
Dragged them out to see the show
I drew myself a bath and I tried to read your book
But you know baby this time it just didn't seem quite worth the time it took

And I woke up crying in my sleep
I was talking to your pillow
And I reached out to touch your hand
And knocked the phone off the nightstand
And the operator said, "May I help you please?"
No thanks baby there's nothing you can really do for me
I just had a bad dream, that's all that's wrong with me
I just had a bad dream, that's all that's wrong with me

Crying in my sleep
Crying in my sleep (I woke up crying)
Crying in my sleep (Crying trying to find her)
Crying in my sleep (I woke up crying)
Crying in my sleep (Crying trying to find her)
Crying in my sleep
- Stop! Let me go! You don't got no Jodeci?
- All you bitches want is Jodeci, what the fuck?
- What's a Radiohead.. anyway
- Whatever..
Good mornin' baby
Baby, welcome back to town
Oh, oh, oh, oh, good mornin', good mornin', baby
Baby, welcome back to town
Yeah, you doin' so much travelin' woman
Oh, I'd never know when you're gonna be around
Yeah, you are fine and mellow
Baby, but you stubborn as a mule
You love me like an angel, baby
But you treat me like a fool
Two faced woman
Don't you hand me no double cross
Well, because anytime I'm ready, woman
Well, I can tell you, I can tell you, â€½Baby, get lost"
You cheatin' on the outside
You're doin' ev'rything you chose
You better come back on the inside, woman
'Cause you got too much to lose
I don't want no trouble with you, baby
I wanna tell you I've got to be the boss
Yeah, because anytime I'm ready, baby
Ooh, I can tell you, I can tell you, "Baby, get lost"
Yes, I'll try to stop your cheatin' woman
But I just don't have the time

'Till they're standing in line
I wanna tell you, baby
Yeah, you know I've got to be the boss, all right
Well, because anytime I'm ready, baby
I can tell you, "Baby, get lost"
What will you say when the day comes, when it's no fun
When it's all done, when it's no fun
What will you say when the time comes, there's a dry run
When it's undone and there's no one

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you do when you wake up, fatten you up
Fasten you up, fatten you up
No memories to get cloudy, to get cloudy
When you can't see what you can't see
It's all the same when it's morning and you're boring
Still ignoring everything
No memories to remind you of the old you
Nothing for it, just keep it up, keep it up
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you say when the day comes, when it's no fun
When it's all done, when it's undone
What will you say when the time comes, there's a dry run
When it's undone and it's undone

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you do when you wake up, fatten you up
Fasten you up, fatten you up
No memories to get cloudy, to get cloudy
When you can't see what you can't see
It's all the same when it's morning and you're boring
Still ignoring everything
No memories to remind you of the old you
Nothing for it, just keep it up, keep it up
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much

With no memory, with no memory
With no memory to keep you up at night
With no memory, with no memory
With no memory to keep you up at night
I gave you a diamond ring
You won't wear
It's a nine thousand dollar thing
You don't care
I set up a wedding date
You couldn't make it
You said all the love we made
You were just faking

But girl, you know
What hurts me the most
Is I gave all my love to you
All you ever give me
All you ever give me
All you ever give me is the blues
Is the blues

I gave you my Cadillac keys
You don't drive
I hired you a limousine
You won't ride
Bought you the house on the hill
You hate the view
Even wrote you into my will
Gave you something to look forward to
But girl, you know
What hurts me the most
Is I gave all my love to you
All you ever give me
All you ever give me
All you ever give me is the blues
Nothing but the blues

I've tried and tried
But I'm mystified
I've done all that I can do
I've given you my best
You put me to the test
All you ever give me
All you ever give me
All you ever give me is the blues
Nothing but the blues

But girl, you know
What hurts me the most
Is I gave all my love to you
All you ever give me
All you ever give me
All you ever gave me was the blues
All you ever gave me
All you ever gave me
All you ever gave me
All you ever gave me was the blues
Nothing but the blues
Was the last time I saw you, the last time?
Or can I hope to hold you once more?
What about me, could have made you doubt me?
Want to live without me?
Loving me no more?

From the first time I saw you, I loved you
And to me, darling, you were romance
Was the last time I saw you, the last time?
Or will you give love one more chance?

From the first time I saw you, I loved you
And to me, darling, you were romance
Was the last time I saw you, the last time?
Or will you give love one more chance?
Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two
'Cause springtime is here and it's here without you

As sure as the bluebirds that fly up above
Springtime is sad without someone to love
Yes springtime is sad and it troubles my mind
In a world full of women, not one girl is mine

Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two
'Cause springtime is here and it's here without you

They say that it's best to forget what we had
Then it is to remember and always be said
But still I keep wondering each now and then
If ever I'll see you and kiss you again

Green grow the lilacs all sparkling with dew
Green grow the lilacs when winter is thru
Each time I see lilacs my heart breaks in two
'Cause springtime is here and it's here without you
You know what I want, want
I know what you want, want
Tell me what I want, want
I'll tell you what you want, want
You know what I want, want
I know what you want, want
Tell me what I want, want
I'll tell you what you want, want
So many ladies in the room
All that I can see is you
This dime piece is in this place
But you came through and took the case
'Cause I know what I like
And I know what I want
And I know how to get it
Let me in your world
Yes I know what I like
And I know what I want
And I know how to get it
Let me prove it to you one on one
Can I take you home girl
Get you all alone girl
And do you like I want to
Kiss you like I want to
Can I take you home girl
Get you all alone girl
And do you like I want to
Kiss you like I want to
And love you like I want to
I'm staring at you eye to eye
I'm nothin' like these other guys
Let me drop this on your mind
I'm not here to waste your time
'Cause I know what I like
And I know what I want
And I know how to get it
Let me in your world
Yes I know what I like
And I know what I want
And I know how to get it
Let me prove it to you one on one
Can I take you home girl
Get you all alone girl
And do you like I want to
Kiss you like I want to
Can I take you home girl
Get you all alone girl
And do you like I want to
Kiss you like I want to
And love you like I want to
I don't wanna leave
Unless you leavin' with me babe
Now I believe in fate
It's like heaven sent you girl
I don't wanna leave
Unless you leavin' with me babe
Now I believe in fate
It's like heaven sent you girl
You know what I want, want
I know what you want want
Tell me what I want want
I'll tell you what you want want
You know what I want, want
I know what you want, want
Tell me what I want, want
I'll tell you what you want, want
Can I take you home girl
Get you all alone girl
Do you like I want to
Kiss you like I want to
Can I take you home girl
Get you all alone girl
And do you like I want to
Kiss you like I want to
And love you like I want to
Oh, come on babe
Let's go somewhere

[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

[Verse 2]
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 3]
Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh, oh)
Waiting for tonight (Tonight, tonight)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight (Tonight, tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh)
Waiting for tonight

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
This is the final moment, can't let them lock me down
I'm ready and I know it, I gotta make it count
This time may never come again
And I'ma fight, I'm going for the win
There ain't no way I'm stopping, already paid my dues
Failure is not an option, I got too much too lose
Running out of energy, I come hot in the coldest way

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go
Just give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go
Watch me turn it on
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go
Just give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go
Watch me turn it on

[Verse 2: Veronica Gardner]
No matter what you tell me, I will never give up
There's no excuse for failing, so don't hold your breath for love
I will never let you come and steal my joy
Just give up stop trying, I'm no concern of yours
If I'm just a pilot, won't you come fly with me
You're wasting so much time with this negativity
Let me give it to you in the coldest way
There's no need to hate, I will never change

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go
Just give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go
Watch me turn it on
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go
Just give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go
Watch me turn it on

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go
Just give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go
Watch me turn it on
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give me that, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go
Just give it a go go, give it a go go, give it a go go
Watch me turn it on
Don't forget me ida , come back to me again
Don't forget me ida , don't forget my eyes
They way they beg you ida , beneath the starlit skies
Sweet as apple cider , softer than a tear
You took away the green grass and left me waiting here

The morning rains, come home again , the hunter from the hills
Ev'rybody needs you home again
I guess they always will
Through the storm you wander
Through each covered glen
Please don't forget me ida , come back to me again

Don't forget me ida , don't forget my eyes
They way they beg you ida , beneath the starlit skies
Sweet as apple cider , softer than a tear
You took away the green grass and left me waiting here

The morning rains, come home again, the hunter from the hills
Ev'rybody needs you home again
I guess they always will
Through the storm you wander
Through each covered glen
Please don't forget me ida, come back to me again
Every step I make
And every breath I take
I took 'cause I can't wait
To be closer to you

Baby you're so sweet
You give me cavities
I get a stomach ache
If I can't be with you

At night I fall asleep
And I dont wanna wake up

'cause you are in my dreams
A heavenly creation

In the body that
I only wanna share with you

Hey

[Chorus:]
Everything I do is just for you
Countin every second til we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'cause everything I do is just for you

Baby we will never finish
To be continued
Separation can't change
The love I feel for you
I'm gonna definitely be affectionate
Snuggle up tonight lets get real intimate
Only you can satisfy my appetite
'cause when it comes to love
You get me get so excited
I wanna taste your lips
My body melts in bliss every time

[Chorus:]
Everything I do is just for you
Countin every second til we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'cause everything I do is just for you

[Chorus:]
Everything I do is just for you
Countin every second til we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'cause everything I do is just for you

You are my
(you are my)
Universe

(universe)
Everything I want and
Everything I need and
Everything worth waiting for
For
For better or for worse
Constant craving
Your love enslaves me
Oh

[Chorus:]
Everything I do is just for you
Countin every second til we rendezvous
And I can't wait
To give my love to you
'cause everything I do is just for you
Give it to me baby
I wanna give it to you
Give it to me baby
I can't wait
Everything I do is just for you
Everything I do is just for you
Everything I do is just for you

Everything I do is just for you
I can't wait to give you my love
Everything I do is just for you
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey, Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain
Hey, Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Da da da da da da da da da

Hey, Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you,hey Jude you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Da da da da da da da da da

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better...

[Verse 1]
They say ev'rything can be replaced
Yet ev'ry distance is not near
So I remember ev'ry face
Of ev'ry man who put me here

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

[Verse 2]
They say ev'ry man needs protection
They say ev'ry man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

[Bridge]
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
The ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

Through the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman cryin' to her mama
'cause she turned that I was gone
I still run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
Summer sun might burn me 'till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

I still run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gently on my mind
I had a '56 T-Bird
Then I was king of the highway
Trying to make it look fast and easy
And dreamin' of doin' it my way
Let's put the top down baby
Feel the wind in our hair

We were too young to know better
And too cool to care

All I wanted was you by my side
Baby you're only along for the ride
Only along for the ride

Rock and roll on the radio
Let's turn it up and get down

Convertible dreams running wild in the streets
In the all time American town
When you played the thrill queen, baby
I heard the jazz of joy
You were every girl in the world
But I wasn't every boy
All I wanted was you by my side
Baby, you're only along for the ride
All I wanted was you by my side
Baby, you're only along for the ride
Only along for the ride

Memory pink and charcoal grey
Are the clours I painted this song
You were 19 and perfect, baby
But no one stays perfect too long

All I wanted was you by my side
Baby you're only along for the ride
Only along for the ride

[Verse 1]
Softly they fall, where do they go?
(Purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(Gentle snowflakes)
Fall from the sky, before your eyes
(It's so thrilling)
Blankets of white, brighten the night
(Such a feeling)

[Bridge]
They seem to say that our love is here to stay
We'll be cozy and warm until summer flowers bloom

[Verse 2]
Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
(Chestnuts roasting)
Over the heat, gee, ain't life sweet?
(Tootsies toasting)
Drifting on air, without a care
(Purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(Love the snowflakes)

[Refrain]
As sure as snowflakes fall from the gloom
I will always remember this night here with you
Hey, snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes
Snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes

[Verse 3]
Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
(Chestnuts roasting)
Over the heat, gee, ain't life sweet?
(Tootsies toasting)
Drifting on air, without a care
(Purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(Purple snowflakes)

[Refrain]
As sure as snowflakes fall from the gloom
I will always remember this night here with you

[Outro]
And I say snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes
(Snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes)
I'll always remember the snowflakes
(Snowflakes) And you, baby
(Pretty purple snowflakes) And you
Snowflakes are falling (Snowflakes)
Falling, falling (Pretty purple snowflakes)
I've got you in my arms
Snowflakes
Oh what will you give me
Say the sad bells of Rhymney
Is there hope for the future
Cry the brown bells of Merthyr
Who made the mine owner
Say the black bells of Rhondda
And who robbed the miner
Cry the grim bells of Blaina

They will plunder willy-nilly
Cry the bells of Caerphilly
They have fangs, they have teeth
Say the loud bells of Neath
Even God is uneasy
Say the moist bells of Swansea
And what will you give me
Say the sad bells of Rhymney

Put the vandals in court
Say the bells of Newport
All would be well if, if, if, if, if, if
Cry the green bells of Cardiff
Why so worried, sisters, why
Sang the silver bells of Wye
And what will you give me
Say the sad bells of Rhymney
This is a man's world, this is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing without a woman or a girl

You know man made a car to take us over the road
Man made the train to carry heavy loads
Man made electric lights to take us out of the dark
Man made a boat for the water just like Noah made the ark

Think about a little baby girl and a little baby boy
Man makes then happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything in the world he can
Man makes money to buy some other man

[Intro]
Come on, come on, come on
And oh yeah, it's alright
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey

[Verse 1]
I got a song I sing, can't nobody sing but me
(Nobody but me)
Ah, I got a song I sing, can't nobody sing but me
(Nobody but me)
A-no-no-no-no (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nobody but me, yeah (Nobody but me)

[Verse 2]
Don't you know I got a twist I do, can't nobody do but me
(Nobody but me)
Yeah, I got a shout I do, can't nobody do but me
(Nobody but me)
No-no-no-no-no-oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nobody but me, yeah (Nobody but me)
Yeah, oh

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Yeah, I wanna tell you nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
And oh (Nobody)
Yeah (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
No, no-no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no
No, no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no, no-no, no-no-no
Nobody can do the (twist) like I do
Nobody can do the (shout) like I do
Nobody can mash (some potatoes) like I do
Nobody can do the (sock hop) like I do
Ah yeah (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
Ah, yeah (Nobody)
Yeah, yeah (Nobody)
Yeah, nobody (Nobody)
Nobody  (Nobody)
Yeah, yeah (Nobody)

[Verse 1]
Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Verse 2]
Well, you can knock me down
Step in my face
Slander my name
All over the place
Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Rock

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Outro]
Well it's
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, yeah
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes baby
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Looking for yesterday, most any day I spent with you
One yesterday when I still had a laugh or two
One dance to our favorite tune then to our favorite lane
Who cares if there is no moon or we're drenched with rain

Looking for yesterday, before you wrapped the sun in clouds
One yesterday before I hid away in crowds
My heart lives in misery, always a stone in it's shoe
Looking for yesterday and you

[Verse 1]
Sit by my side, come as close as the air
Share in a memory of gray
And wander in my words
Dream about the pictures that I play
Of changes

[Verse 2]
Green leaves of summer turn to red in the fall
To brown and to yellow they fade
And then they have to die
Trapped within the circle time parade
Of changes

[Verse 3]
Scenes of my young years were warm in my mind
Visions of shadows that shine
'Til one day I returned
And found that they were victims of the vines
Of changes

[Verse 4]
The world's spinning madly, it drifts in the dark
Swings through a hollow of haze
A race around the stars
A journey through the universe ablaze
With changes

[Verse 5]
Moments of magic will glow in the night
Fears of the forest are all gone
But when the morning breaks
They're swept away by golden drops of dawn
Of changes

[Verse 6]
Passions will part to a strange melody
As fires will sometimes burn cold
Like petals in the wind
We're puppets to the silver strings of souls
Of changes

[Verse 7]
Your tears will be trembling, now we're somewhere else
One last cup of wine we will pour
And I'll kiss you one more time
And leave you on the rolling river shores
Of changes
Oh, my love
My darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
Godspeed your love to me

Lonely mountain gaze
At the stars, at the stars
Waiting for the dawn
Of the day
All alone I gaze
At the stars, at the stars
Dreaming of my love
Far away

Oh, my love
My darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
Godspeed your love to me
It happens every spring, the world is young again
Where children on an up-sa-daisy swing
A carousel with horses freshly painted
The oompapa that says let's get acquainted
What is that cheer I heard, a fellow stealing third
Your neighbor's boy became a home-run king
Your dad rolls up his sleeves to clean the attic
Your sixteen year old sister goes dramatic
It happens, yes it happens every spring
The tears that go with sulphur and molasses
The outstretched necks when the ice cream wagon passes
A rippling stream sounds like a rippling heart
As Mother Nature proudly spreads her new green carpet
Be patient, lonely one, your love will come along
Your autumn heart will find the songs that sing
Then raindrops will be dancing to the tune of it
The carefree gay and April, May and June of it
And remember it never rains but what it pours
And maybe raindrops will be whispering, whispering, it's yours
Be patient, lonely one, your love will come along
It happens, it always happens every spring
Living in a world that dies within
You are they who try and touch the wind
You could be the blessed one that
Makes me love you
And doing what you've never done before
Taking every wave that hits the shore
You could be a silver star that shines
On my blue island
See you on a blue island
Take you to a blue island

You can see the rain
You can feel the pain
That no part of me is going through
Everybody say, we can find a way
Do you know the place you're going to
You're going to a blue island

This is what the lonely heart must know
This is what it takes to make it grow
You could be a child alone
But you may save the world
Maybe it's the words that mean goodbye
There but for the grace of God go I
I can see an open door that leads to my blue island
Gonna be a blue island
See you on a blue island
Take you to a blue island
Blue island
Blue island
Blue island
Mason died on Monday, we bricked him in the wall
All his children grew and grew, they ain't never grown so tall before
They may never grow so tall again

We dug him up on Tuesday, he hardly aged a day
Taught us all we ever knew, we ain't never known so much before
We may never know so much again

The wall collapsed on Wednesday, we chalked it up to fate
Mason's children ran and flew, they ain't never run so fast before
Swore they'd never show their face again

Mason was a mighty man, a mighty man was he
Always said when I'm dead I'm gone, don't you weep for me

Thursday came then Friday, with buyers tall and bright
Mason's children cooked the stew and cleaned up when the feast was through

Take me to the repo-man to pay back what is owed
If he's in some other land write it off as stole
In a while I'll find the time to make the sunshine mine
In a smile I saw a single eagle in the sky
Wheeling, soaring, gliding by

On a hill there lived a man with many shining things
Shiny pool, a shiny car and shiny diamond rings
Wining, dining, shining king

And the eagle flies in clear blue skies
Breathing in the clear blue air
Back here on the ground another dealer coughs and dies
And fifty more come rolling off
The Ford production line

Then a man appearing like a mirage on the sand
In his hand a moving picture of the crumbling land
Screaming, dealing, movie man

Here we go, hold your nose and see if something blows
Close your eyes, count to ten and see the sunrise rise
Climbing, high into the sky
By the ornamental lake, a diamond lies
Upon the finger of the king
On high the eagle spies the glitter of a gun
And wheeling in a climbing turn he flies into the sun
Oh, well, I'm sittin' here, la, la
Waiting for my ya ya
Uh huh, uh huh
Er, sittin' here, la, la
Waiting for my ya ya
Uh huh, uh huh
It may sound funny
But I don't believe she's comin'
Uh huh, uh huh

Baby, honey, don't leave me worried
Uh huh, uh huh
Er, baby, honey, er, don't leave me worried
Uh huh, uh huh
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
Uh huh, uh huh
"I'll see you later baby"
That's what you said when you were walking down the street
"I'll see you later honey"
My Papa said you'd never be there for me
And I don't know where to go
And I don't know who to run to
And I don't know where to go
And I don't know who to love

And you're the one that makes me happy
And you're the one that makes me sad
And you're the one that makes me happy
And you're the one that makes me sad

Do-do-do do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do do-do-do-do-do

I've heard some stories about you
But there's nothing that wouldn't make me forgive you
'Cause when you're away, I'm so sad
If you'll be here I'll be so glad
'Cause you're the one that makes me happy
And you're the one that makes me sad
And you're the one that makes me happy
And you're the one that makes me sad
And you're the one that makes me happy
And you're the one that makes me sad
And you're the one that makes me happy
And you're the one that makes me sad
You're makin' me sad
You're makin' me sad
You're makin' me sad
You're makin' me sad
INTRO:
In the hustle of the day, we're all inclined to miss
Little things that mean so much
A word, a smile, and a kiss
When a woman loves a man, he's a hero in her eyes
And a hero he can always be if he'll just realize

She may be weary, women do get weary
Wearing the same shabby dress
And when she's weary, try a little tenderness

She may be waiting, just anticipating
Things she may never possess
While she's without them, try a little tenderness

It's not just sentimental, she has her grief and her care
But a word that's soft and gentle makes it easier to bear

You won't regret it, women don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
And it's all so easy, try a little tenderness

[Intro: John Legend]
Lalalalalalalalalalalaaa, ooooh

[Verse 1: John Legend]
From the very first time back when I met you at school
I looked in your eyes, saw something special in you
We aspire that we will be American dream
Escape this reality, come start a new one with me

[Pre-Chorus: John Legend]
We could be neighborhood royalty
Or much more than that you'll see, we're makin' history
We'll go to the mass, fly to heaven and back
The highest heights (...), yes, as we can do all of that, baby

[Chorus: John Legend]
La la la la la la la la la la la
We could be king & queen someday
La la la la la la la la la la la
We'll never throw our dreams away

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
We'll make this picture complete, start a new family
A boy that looks just like you, a girl that looks just like me
And each day that they grow, we'll teach them all that we know
Help me show them the way
We'll show them we're not afraid to be free

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
The only thing that should be
The fliest fantasies, the highest they can dream
Grab hold to my hand, say that you'll be my man
Someday you'll be my king and baby I'm your queen to be

[Chorus: John Legend & Mary J. Blige]
La la la la la la la la la la la
We could be king & queen someday, someday
La la la la la la la la la la la
We'll never throw our dreams away

[Bridge: John Legend + Mary J. Blige]
Cities may crumble, the world is in trouble
But we'll be in love and we'll rise above it
Each of our people, pray for a leader
I know we will be someday, someday, oh
Someday, someday, someday, oh, someday

[Chorus: John Legend & Mary J. Blige]
La la la la la la la la la la la
We'll never throw our dreams away
La la la la la la la la la la la
We could be king & queen someday
La la la la la la la la la la la
We could be king & queen someday, someday
La la la la la la la la la la la
We'll never throw our dreams away
Well, well, well, well
Seems like it was only yesterday
When my mama told me don't fall in love
With the first guy that comes your way

He was handsome and nice
But, I took her advice and passed him by
Years have passed and don't look like
Love's gonna give me a second try

Boy, the look on your face tells me you understand
Could it be your love life's like mine
Needs a helping hand well, well
You need love like I do
(Don't you?)

Boy, I can tell by the way
You look when I'm looking at you
I know it ain't fit and proper
For a girl to talk this way
But, I can't cope with this loneliness
Not one more doggone day
Everyday has been an uphill climb
Keeping my hopes a-float

Judging from your silence boy
You must be in the same boat
Ain't it true now?
You need love like I do
(Don't you?)

Boy, I can tell by the way you look
When I'm looking at you
Well, well, well, you need love like I do
(Don't you?)
It started out like a song, we started quiet and slow with no surprise
Then one morning I woke to realize we have a good thing going
It's not that nothing went wrong, some angry moment of course, but just a few
And only moments no more because we knew we had a good thing going
And if I wanted too much, was that such a mistake?
Half the time you never wanted enough, Ok tuff, I don't make that a crime
And while it's going along, you take for granted some love will wear away
We took for granted a lot, and still I say, it could have kept on growing
Instead of just kept on, we had a good thing going, going, gone

And if I wanted too much, was that such a mistake?
Half the time you never wanted enough, Ok tuff, I don't make that a crime
And while it's going along, you take for granted some love will wear away
We took for granted a lot, and still I say, it could have kept on going
Instead of just kept on, we had a good thing going, going, gone
Keeping my eyes on the road, I see you
Keeping my hands on the wheel, I hold you
99 Miles From L.A., I kiss you, I miss you, please be there

Passing the white sandy beach, we're sailing
Turning the radio on, we're dancing
99 Miles From L.A., I want you, I need you, please be there

The windshield is covered with rain, I'm cryin'
Pressing my foot on the gas, I'm flyin'
Counting the telephone poles, I phone you
Reading the signs on the road, I write you
99 Miles From L.A., we're laughing, we're loving, please be there

Counting the telephone poles, I phone you
Reading the signs on the road, I write you
99 Miles From L.A., we're laughing, we're loving, please be there

[Verse 1]
If you're down and confused
And you don't remember who you're talking to
Concentration slips away
Because your baby is so far away

[Chorus]
Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with

[Verse 2]
Don't be angry, don't be sad
Don't sit crying talking 'bout the good times you've had
Well, there's a girl sitting right next to you
And she's just waiting for something to do

[Chorus]
Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with

[Bridge]
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo

[Chorus]
Oh, love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
Why don't you love

[Verse 3]
Turn your heartaches right into joy, now
She's a girl, yeah, and you're a boy
I want you to get it together and make it nice
Well, you ain't gonna need anymore advice

[Chorus]
Hey, there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
Sometimes you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You gotta love (Love the one you're with)
You gotta love (Love the one you're with)
Oh, love (Love the one you're with)
You gotta love (Love the one you're with)
Whoa yeah (Love Lhe one you're with)
You gotta love, love the one you're with
(Love the one you're with)
You gotta love (Love the one you're with)
Well

[Outro]
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Seven years of hard luck comin' down on me
From a motor boat, yes, up in Nashville, Tennessee
I worked in every joint you can name, yes, every honky tonk
They all come to see Yankee slicker saying, baby, you're what I want

Want you to sign the contract
Want you to sign the date
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA

Oh, nine thousand dollars just to sow to the wind
Come to smile at the Yankee slicker with a big old southern grin
They're gonna take me out to California, gonna make me a super star
Just pay me all my money, mister, maybe you won't get a star

Want you to sign the contract
Want you to sign the date
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA

[Guitar solo]
Slickers steal my money since I was seventeen
If it ain't no pencil pusher then it got to be a honky tonk queen
But I signed my contract, baby, and I want you people to know
That every penny that I make, I gotta see where my money goes

Want you to sign the contract
Want you to sign the date
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA
All hope was gone
Hard to hang on
Hard to be strong
Was blind, could not see
Nothing but walls in front of me
And inside no peace

And the mountains seemed impossible to climb
Until you stood on the front line
You led the way
Out of the darkness
We didn't go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that, that takes a soldier's heart

Oceans so deep
Uphill, so steep
But still we believe
And when the road was too far to travel
Heroes, you cared, you came and carried us there
And the mountains seemed impossible to climb
Until you stood on the front line
You led the way
Out of the darkness
We didn't go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that takes a soldier's heart

And so our flag was still there
All because you decided to care
Our burden to bear

You stood on the front line
You led the way
Right out of the darkness
Didn't go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that takes

You stood on the front line
You led the way
Right out of the darkness, hey
You could have let us go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that takes a soldier's heart
Whoa, that takes a soldier's heart, hey
It takes a soldier's heart
Fragile rare occasion
Out of chaos a creation
Binding into one form
Lucid drunkeness
Aiming truth and openess
Baby you are a joy
I want you free when you grow boy
Revive the old idea that we carry

Binding into one form
Lucid drunkeness
Aiming truth and openess
Baby you are a joy
Nothingless
Truth and openess
Nothingless
But truth and openess

Revive the old idea that we carry

[Intro]
Yo!
What's sup?
Hey!
My name is Usher
You can trust there ain't
No punks in this house
And if U really wanna know what my name is!
Just Call Me A Mack
Word
Right!
Just call me the mack
Anytime baby
Cause I ain't confused!

[Verse 1]
I may be kinda young
But I got a whole lot of man in me
So I'm afraid
That I can't complain (Huh, ha!)
I don't mind
If you wanna come by my crib
And chill
But just be sure
That you call me first
Because the last girl that tried
To just be droppin' on by (Oh, no)
Learned how to play a player
And do you know why
Because the mack

[Hook]
Just Call Me A Mack
Cause I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Or I'll get back with you
It's a well known fact
That I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Just Call Me A Mack!

[Verse 2]
Now, baby I ain't dumb
And all those silly
Games that U play
I see right through
So let me kick it to yah (To yah!)
I don't have a lot of girls
But I gotta know
I'll get the respect that I give
That's just the way I live
Because the last girl
I had was moving
Things too fast (Slow down)
She tried to pull a fooler
And do U know
What had happened

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3/Rap]
The mack is right here
And yes I care as much
Just giving a little love
It's spreading everywhere
You see it's
Here
Here
And here
Catch a feeling
I'm having a little trouble
I know my girl will always
Hit it
Pit it
Like an orange
Cause it looks
Like numbness
My lovin' and
Hugin'
And bitterness
My peeps keep
Pumpin'
Humpin'
On stage
I'm engaged
And yes
The truth is it
You see an
Ugly woman
You better change

[Verse 4]
Oh, yes
Like Ushers' my name
I can't go changing
My ways (Oh, no)
As long as I'm chillin'
Then baby
You can call me the mack

[Hook until the song ends]
Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you
Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
Darling when you're near
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you
Speaks:
My window looks out over the park
And every year I move another story up
So now I'm almost close enough
To the roof of the sky to touch it
I could even move the clouds aside
But no clouds come, if they did, I'd welcome them
'Cause I have very few visitors here any more
There must be a highway somewhere, roads I've missed
Something more than sky out beyond the window

[Verse 1]
Now that all these walls are down
Wonder what I'll tell you

[Chorus]
You can do what you want as long
As the curtain is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die

[Verse 2]
Count the number of things you are
See how long it takes you

[Chorus]
You can do what you want as long
As the curtain is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die, oh!

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You can do what you want as long
As the curtain is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth, one day will die, oh
Oh

[Chorus: DJ Sense]
High-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer (We just gettin' started)
High-top, high-top to a convertible like I'm a transform— (Chris Breezy)

Magazine star, datin' nothin' but the models
Money pilin' up, you would think I won the lotto
Cash rule everythin' around me, that's my motto
All black Rolex, you ain't never seen, no
Countin' big chips, you can call me a casino

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Hey, you, shawty, what it do?
Whip so sick, you can call it bird flu
Got the top back, hair blowin' in the air
I'm about to kill it this year

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
'Cause I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transform—
I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer
I went from a, like I'm a transformer, like I'm a trans— (Ayy)
Yeah

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Point black, I'm the best in general
You know I ball and I ain't talkin' 'bout genitals
I'm a shark, you can't catch me with no fishin' pole
In the dark, you can see me 'cause my whistle glow
(High-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer)
Get your stripes, lil' mama, make my whistle blow
(High-top, high-top to a convertible like I'm a transform—)
Don't need no mistletoe, but you can kiss it though
(I went from a high-top to a convertible like I'm a transformer)
But, baby, drop it low and make it shake for me
(Like I'm a transformer, like I'm a trans—)
Call me Federal Reserve 'cause I make money
And then I waste money, my chain so sunny
I got them carrots so I share it with them snow bunnies
Yo' money is only 'bout yay high
I got that ching ching money like Shanghai
Yeah, I'm a fool with it, know what to do with it
Who you know got a private jet with the windows tinted?
Overseas cash, get overseas ass
Got it on lock like I'm dreadin' with some beeswax

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Hey, you, shawty, what it do? (Yeah)
Whip so sick, you can call it bird flu (Yeah)
Got the top back, hair blowin' in the air

Hey, lil' mama, bring that thing over there
Put my CD on and let it bang in ya ear
You know I'm the best, watch me do my step

[Outro]
Gangsta Grillz

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
Growth in my right mind
Counting all the blessings
I've had in my lifetime
I'm so fortunate to have someone like God
Heavenly Father
When I was having so many problems
No one but Him could help me solve them
He stepped in and He made everything okay
And for this I'm so grateful

[Chorus]
I'm grateful (Oh, oh)
So thankful (I'm thankful)
To be in the land of the living (I'm grateful)
I'm grateful (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm so thankful (To be in the land of the living)
To be in the land of the living

[Verse 2]
I don't mind sharing my testimony
To anyone who hear it, 'cause I'm led by the spirit
And it's possible that something I might say
Could help along the way, yeah
Been through the storm but
Here I'm still standing
On solid ground I keep on landing
That's why I have so much faith in God
For His love I'm grateful

[Chorus]
I'm grateful (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
So thankful (I'm thankful to be in the land of the living)
To be in the land of the living (I'm grateful)
I'm grateful (So)
I'm so thankful (To be in the land of the living)
To be in the land of the living (I am)
I'm grateful (Grateful)
So thankful (So thankful)
To be in the land of the living
(Doesn't have to be this way)
I'm grateful (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm so thankful (Oh)
To be in the land of the living

[Bridge]
Oh yeah (Yes), I'm grateful (I'm grateful)
Yes (Yes), I'm thankful (I'm thankful)
He spared me (That I was spared me)
He gave me (That I was given)
Another chance (Another chance)
I am

[Chorus]
I'm grateful (Oh yeah)
So thankful (So thankful)
To be in the land of the living
(You don't have to bless me like You do)
I'm grateful (You don't have to love me like You do)
I'm so thankful (Keep on doing what You do)
To be in the land of the living
('Cause You could've used somebody else, Lord)
I'm grateful (Could've used somebody else, Lord)
So thankful (I'm so grateful)
To be in the land of the living
(Keep on doing what You do)
I'm grateful (I am)
I'm so thankful (So thankful)
To be in the land of the living
(I'm grateful) I'm grateful
Yes sir

Well, the bigger the city, well, the brighter the lights
The bigger the dog, well, the harder the bite
I don't know where you been last night
But I think Mama, you ain't doin' right

Say I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little 'bout it
I know a little 'bout love
And Baby I can guess the rest

Well, now I don't read that daily news
'Cause it ain't hard to figure where people gets the blues
They can't dig what they can't use
If they stick to themself they'd be much less abused

Say I know a little
Lord, I do know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little 'bout it
I know a little 'bout love
And Baby I can guess the rest
Play me a little
Whoa, yeah
Yeah

Well, now you want me to be your only man
Said listen up Mama, teach you all I can
Do right Baby by your man
Don't worry Mama, teach you all I can

Say I know a little
Lord, I know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little 'bout it
I know a little 'bout love
And Baby I can guess the rest

Well, I know a little 'bout love
Baby I want your best
I woke up this morning, my baby was gone
Woke up this morning, my baby was gone
I've feel so bad, I'm all alone

I ain't got nobody, stayn' home with me
I ain't got nobody, stayn' home with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery

Well baby, I'm all alone
Yes baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin', since my baby's been gone
All right

Oh baby, I'm all alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery

Oh baby, come on stay with me
Oh baby, come on stay with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery
Oh baby, I'm all alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin', since my baby's been gone
Give me a t for texas, give me a t for tennessee
Give me a t for texas, give me a t for tennessee
Give me a t for thelma, woman made a fool out of me

If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
I've had more pretty women than a passenger train could haul

I'm gonna buy myself a shotgun, one with a long shiny barrel
I'm gonna buy myself a shotgun, one with a long shiny barrel
I'm gonna shoot me a rounder oh that stole away my gal

I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
Than to be in atlanta, georgia, treat me like a dirty dog
(I don't have to go for that)

If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
If you don't want me baby, mama you sure don't got to stall
'cause I've had more pretty women than a passenger train could haul
And that ain't all
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
I'd rather drink your muddy water, sleep down in a hollow log
Than to be in atlanta, georgia, treated like a dirty dog

Oh give me a t for texas, give me a t for tennessee
Give me a t for thelma, woman made a fool out of me
Give me a t for texas, give me that t for tennessee
Give me a t for thelma, woman made a fool out of me
One more time

Give me a t for thelma, oh that woman made a fool...
I said said oh, that woman made a fool
Out of me, yeah
Oh, I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald hue
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue

Oh I'll dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming, my idols were clay
All portion of love had all flown away

Oh he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell

Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
That was blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower

When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
'Til I get to the bottom, and I see you again!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Well, do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on, tell me the answer!
Well, you may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer
Now, Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Yeah
Woo!
Oh, will you, won't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer!

Look out!
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Ooh!

Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Well, do you, don't you want me to make you?

Coming down fast
Oh, yeah, Helter Skelter

[Intro: André 3000]
Whoo, turn me up, don't turn me down
Cut me up, don't let me down, find, find a way

[Chorus: André 3000]
Find a way to get out, without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick
Find a way to get in, to fit in
You get on, you get out, without a doubt
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick

[Interlude: André 3000]
Climbing out this hole (Climbing out this hole)
With a frown on my face
(In the place to be) In the place to be
And not to be at the same time

[Pre-Chorus: André 3000]
G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down
O-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't play 'round
If it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us

[Chorus: André 3000]
Find a way to get out, without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick
Find a way to get in, to fit in
You get on, you get out, without a doubt
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick

[Bridge: Big Boi & Patti LaBelle]
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?

[Verse: Big Boi]
Hot tub, bad to the bony, I'm Tony
As my Grandmama Edna Mae Kearse, she showed me
How to be the smooth operator, dominator
In the state of Georgia, hip hop standard destroyer
Leave a muthafucka open like a foyer
He from the dirty, now here come the paranoia
A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique
Sweat me, wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Find my purpose on the surface of this Earth, this
Planet's standards trust and the purpose
Campaign in vain for the same lame fame
You've obtained, you ought to be detained
By the hip hop sheriff, locked up, no possibility
Of getting out because the shit you make is killing me
And my ears, and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear, we disappear
Then reappear again in a fresh new light
I hope it's peaceful and cloudy
'Cause if it's not, we gotta fight like

[Pre-Chorus: André 3000]
G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down
O-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't play 'round
If it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us

[Chorus: André 3000]
Find a way to get out, without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick
Find a way to get in, to fit in
You get on, you get out without a doubt
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick

[Bridge: Big Boi & Patti LaBelle]
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?

[Intro]
Love is fragile
Hearts are easily broken
Jason Derulo, woah, woah
(J-J-J-J-J.R.)

[Verse 1]
You don't really wanna let this stuff go
But you're too stubborn to pick up the phone
I'm no better, can't admit when I'm wrong
So round and round we go
I should be happy but I'm feeling so so (so so)
There's something missing and I bet you it's you (it's you)
I know it, you know it
We were made for each other, so

[Pre-Chorus]
My shattered heart is on the ground
I've got to see your face right now
Just tell me where
And you'll find me waiting there, yeah

[Chorus]
Can we forget the past?
I miss you, I mean it
And if love is made of glass
Can we pick up the pieces? (Hey)
Pick up, pick up, up, the pieces (hey)
Pick up, pick up, up, the pieces (hey)
And if love is made of glass (hey)
Can we pick up the pieces?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I wear a smile to hide the hurt
'Cause no one loves you better than your first
People say that time heals all
So why is it getting worse?
I just don't wanna face this battle alone (alone)
A broken heart can only beat for so long (so long)
I know it, you know it
We were made for each other so

[Pre-Chorus]
My shattered heart is on the ground
I've got to see your face right now
Just tell me where
And you'll find me waiting there, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Can we forget the past?
I miss you, I mean it
And if love is made of glass
Can we pick up the pieces? (Hey)
Pick up, pick up, up, the pieces (hey)
Pick up, pick up, up, the pieces (hey)
And if love is made of glass (hey)
Can we pick up the pieces?

[Bridge]
Cutting through my soul and it's razor sharp (sharp)
Now I'm scattered here in a million parts (parts)
How am I supposed to fix a broken heart
Alone, alone, alone?
Cu-cu-cutting through my soul and it's razor sharp (sharp)
Now I'm scattered here in a million parts (parts)
How am I supposed to fix a broken heart
Alone, alone, alone?

[Chorus]
Can we forget the past?
I miss you, I mean it
And if love is made of glass
Can we pick up the pieces?
Pick up, pick up, up, the pieces (hey) (the pieces)
Pick up, pick up, up, the pieces (hey) (the pieces)
And if love is made of glass (hey) (yeah)
Can we pick up the pieces?  (Oh woah)
The pieces
Oh, baby
The pieces
Can we pick up the pieces?
Joe DiMaggio's done it again
Joe DiMaggio's done it again
Clackin' that bat, gone with the wind
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

Some folks thought Big Joe was done
Some just figured Joe was gone
Steps to the platter with a great big grin
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

I'm gonna tell you just the way I feel
Man can't run without his heel
Watch that raggy pill split the wind
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

All three fielders jumped their best
Trying to climb that high board fence
They all growed whiskers on their chins
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

Up along the clouds where the eagles roam
Joe cracked that ball to whine and moan
His buddies all laugh as they trot on in
Joe DiMaggio's done it again
Grandma's home by the radio
On the television watching Joe
She jerks the beard off of Grandpa's chin
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

The puppy dog barked at the pussycat
How does it look from where you sat?
Looks like a cyclone slidin' in
Joe DiMaggio's done it again
Verse 1:
Shattered, but I'm not broken
Wounded, but time will heal
Heavy the load, the cross I bear
Lonely the road I trod, I dare
Shaken, but here I stand
Weary, Still I press on
Long are the nights, the tears I cry
Dark are the days, no sun in the sky

Chorus:
Yet still I rise
Never to give up
Never to give in against all odds
Yet still I rise
High above the clouds
At times I feel low
Yet still I rise
Sometimes I'm troubled, but not in despair
Struggling, I make my way through
Trials, they come to make me strong
I must endure, I must hold on
Chorus
Above all my problems
Above all my eyes can see
Knowing God is able to strengthen me
To strengthen me
Yet still I rise
Never to give up
Oh, Never to give in against all odds
Yet still I rise
High above the clouds
At times I feel low
Yet still I
I need to know which way to go
Yet still I
At times I feel low
Yet still I
Oh Oh Oh I rise
Yet still I rise
Oh yes I do, yeah yeah
Hide your heart from sight, lock your dreams at night
It could happen to you
Don't count stars or you might stumble
Someone drops a sigh and down you tumble
Girl you just don't know
Last night was incredible. Listen. Check it out

Last night, I felt the skies open up and rain down heaven
Last night, I felt the sun, the moon and the stars come together
Last night, I heard an angel speak to me he said us forever
And while we were making love, I saw visions of a tropical river

Last night I
Touched a dream
When you were here with me
Last night I
Touched a dream
Girl you fulfill my fantasy
Touched a dream
Said we rewrote the book of love making history
Touched a dream
Last night you brought my dreams to reality

Now last night, I could have sworn I saw an eagle spread his wings
Last night, I heard a massive choir lift their voice and sing
Last night, I saw the world living in peace and harmony
While we were making love, I felt my soul being set free
Last night I
Touched a dream
You were here with me
Last night I
Touched a dream
And you fulfill my fantasy
Touched a dream
I said we rewrote the book of love making history
Touched a dream
Ooh yeah, girl you brought my dreams to reality

After the rain comes the rainbow
The sun will shine after the storm
Oh yes it will and Mother Nature guarantees
Jumped the mountain and touched the sky
Over the sea baby we can fly
When we made love I see the flowers the trees the birds the bees

Last night I touched a dream girl
Touched a dream
You right here with me
Touched a dream
Ohhh ohh oooh a dream
Touched a dream
You fulfill my fantasy oh baby yes you did
Touched a dream
And baby we rewrote the book of love making history yeah yeah
Touched a dream
Girl, you brought my dreams to a reality yeah hey
Last night when you were lying next to me
Touched a dream
You fulfill my fantasy
Touched a dream
Yeah
And baby we rewrote the book of love making history
Touched a dream
Forever I have a dream
A vision of you right there with me
I know you're my love making queen
Touched a dream
And I am your love making king
Let no man or woman come between
What God has given you and me
Touched a dream
The laws of reciprocity
And give those amorocity (bootlegged form the word amorist)
Provided us with food to eat
Touched a dream
Fills our vacancies but together the perfect chemistry
Forever anniversaries
Touched a dream
You're the root to my tree, I'm a branch you're a leaf
The apple carrying my seed
Touched a dream
Fall, winter, summer, spring
That's why I ain't gon' let the devil steal my joy from me cause I done
Touched a dream
Touched a dream
Touched a dream
The night is like a lovely tune, beware my foolish heart!
How white the ever distant moon, take care, my foolish heart!
There's a line between love and fascination
That's so hard to see on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss
Her lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart!
But should our eager lips combine, then let that fire start
For this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart!

[Instrumental]

Her lips are much too close to mine, beware my foolish heart!
But should our eager lips combine, then let that fire start
For this time it isn't fascination, or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love this time, it's love, my foolish heart!
This time, it's love, my foolish heart!
Writer(s): B. Lane/ E.Y. Harburg

I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see;
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon;
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance;
Make this romance;
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night;
Blazing their light;
Can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide;
On a magic carpet ride;
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes
Just when I think, I'm;
Free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love
The stars will remember the night we said goodbye
The stars will remember, so will I
A rose as a token, a kiss that brought a sigh
The stars will remember, so will I
And now the stars and I, we share the lonely lane
But in my solitude, it seems I hear you call my name
The world may forget you as time goes passing by
But stars will remember, so will I

And now the stars and I, we share the lonely lane
But in my solitude, it seems I hear you call my name
The world may forget you as time goes passing by
But stars will remember, so will I

[Verse 1]
D.J. Doc you know he's down with us
D-Square, he's down with us
Keyboard Money Mike, is down with us
I.C.U., you know he's down with us
D-Nice and McBoo, they're down with us
Ms. Melodie, she's down with us
Just-Ice and DMX, they're down with us
My manager Moe, he's down with us
Castle-D boy, he's down with us
D.J. Red Alert, he's down with us
Robocop boy, he's down with us
Makin' funky music is a must
I'm number one

People still takin' rappin' for a joke
A passing hope or a phase with a rope
Sometimes I choke and try to believe
When I get challenged by a million MCs
I try to tell them, "We're all in this together!"
My album was raw because no-one would ever
Think like I think and do what I do
I stole the show, and then I leave without a clue
What do you think makes up a KRS?
Concisive teaching, or very clear speaking?
Ridiculous bass, aggravating treble
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
Not by financial aid, but a raid of hits
Causing me to take long trips
I'm the original teacher of this type of style
Rockin' off-beat with a smile
Or smirk or chuckle, yes some are not up to
BDP Posse so I love to
Step in the jam and slam
I'm not Superman, because anybody can
Or should be able to rock off turntables
Grab the mic, plug it in and begin
But here's where the problem starts, no heart
Because of that a lot of groups fell apart
Rap is still an art, and no-one's from the Old School
'cause Rap is still a brand-new tool
I say no-one's from the Old School 'cause Rap on a whole
Isn't even twenty years old
Fifty years down the line, you can start this
'cause we'll be the Old School artists
And even in that time, I'll say a rhyme
A brand-new style, ruthless and wild
Runnin' around spendin' money, havin' fun
'cause even then, I'm still number one

[Verse 2]
Blastmaster KRS-One of course
Comes to express with style the lost
Ways of rhyming, old and new, past and present
Knock, knock, who is it?
A brand-new style, hup, time to change
People talk about me when they see me on stage
Live in action, guaranteed raw
I hang with the rich and I work for the poor
Now tomorrow you can say you saw
KRS-One stompin' once more
I play by ear, I love to steer
The Alfa Romeo from here to there
I grab the beer, but not in the ride
'cause I'm not stupid, I don't drink and drive
I'm not a beginner, amateur or local
My album is sellin' because of my vocals
You know what you need to learn?
Old School artists don't always burn
You're just another rapper who's had his turn
Now it's my turn, and I am concerned
About idiots posing as kings
What are we here to rule?
I thought we were supposed to sing
And if we oughta sing, then let us begin to teach
Many of you are educated, open your mouth and speak
KRS-One is something like a total renegade
Except I don't steal, I rhyme to get paid
Airplanes flyin', overseas people dyin'
Politicians lyin', I'm tryin'
Not to escape, but hit the problem head-on
By bringin' out the truth in a song
So BDP, short for Boogie Down Productions
Made a little noise 'cause the crew was sayin' somethin'
People have the nerve to take me for a gangster
An ignorant one, something closer to a prankster
Doin' petty crimes, goin' straight to penitentiary
But in a scale of crime that's really elementary
This beat is now compelling me to explain in silence
Why my last jam was so violent
It's simple: BDP will teach reality
No beatin' around the bush, straight up, just like The P Is Free
So now you know, a poet's job is never done
But I'm never overworked, 'cause I'm still number one
Cool Moe Dee, he's down with us
Eric B. and Rakim, they're down with us
Stetsasonic, they're down with us
Dana Dane, he's down with us
Sleeping Bag Records, they're down with us
My lawyer Jay, he's down with us
Jive/RCA is down with us
Makin' funky music is a must
I'm number one
Sunday and it's rainin' in Alaska
Seven days I haven't seen the sun
Flyin' bush, flyin' low along the shoreline
Doin' ev'rithing I can to make it home

I can't wait to see the Wrangell Mountains
I can't wait to do what I will do
Honey, did I never say how time goes by so slowly
When I can't wait to get back home to you

Three years from the war and settled down now
I did my time and served my country well
In the freedom I defended I fly beneath the North Star
And I just don't know a better way to feel

I can't wait to see the Wrangell Mountains
I can't wait to do what I will do
Honey, did I never say how time goes by so slowly
When I can't wait to get back home to you

It's a quiet life out here among the mountains
In a cabin that was built with these two hands
Carthy lies asleep beside the glacier
It's colder now, winter's in the air
If you think they're wild It's just because they can't be broken
It's a strong and gentle people livin' there

I can't wait to see the Wrangell Mountains
I can't wait to do what I will do
Honey, did I never say how time goes by so slowly
When I can't wait to get back home to you
(Acoustic Guitars)

I miss the ocean
I miss the time we made love under the stars

I miss the summer rain
I miss those big ole' fancy cars

I miss the blue sky
I miss the pouring rain too

Most of all baby, I miss you

I miss you, oh I miss you, oh I miss you

(Acoustic Guitars)
Question and answer:
What does a rapper do when he starts out hardcore, but can't sell enough records to remain in the record business?

Answer: He goes pop...

This answer is not set up to diss anybody who starts out pop, but for the rappers who started out hardcore, and now are making weak-ass dance music, cause they couldn't stay down with the hardcore

I just got a question for you:
How does it feel to wake up every morning, and look in the mirror and realize, that you're a fuckin ho?
Come they told me
Pa rum pum pum pum
Our new born King to see
Pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa rum pum pum pum

To lay before our King
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
So to honor Him

Pa rum pum pum pum
When we come
Little Baby
Pa rum pum pum pum
Pa rum pum pum pum
I have no gift to bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
That's fit to give our King
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Shall I play for you!

Pa rum pum pum
On my drum

Mary nodded
Pa rum pum pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time
Pa rum pum pum pum
I played my drum for Him
Pa rum pum pum

I played my best for Him
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Then He smiled at me

Pa rum pum pum pum
Me and my drum
Rusty green summer's almost gone, I see winds clouding up the sun
And I can't find my way, everything's grey
Rusty green eyes on my mind, memories someplace out of time
All the things we would do ,I still love you

It's a sad song to sing, painted rusty green
A brief fading picture of spring

[Intro]
Shut up
I don't ever wanna hear you say that again
Baby, I'm not going nowhere
Look at me, you understand me?

[Verse 1]
Now, what gave you the silly idea, that I'm about to leave?
Girl, who you be listening to, they must be crazy
Look back and see our past and all the s*** that we've been through
I'll be damned if I'm gon' let this bull crap take me away from you
'Cause I've vowed to give my all and girl I'm a man of my word
And on that word I'll stand tall, being without you sound's absurd
(So dry your weeping eyes) 'cause I'll be here by your side
No need to doubt this guy, I'm in this for the long ride

[Chorus]
I will never leave, no
You don't have to worry, girl I'll be right there for you
I will never leave, no
Baby, can't you see that I was born to be with you
I will never leave, no
God put us together, nothing can't take that away
I will ne-ne-ne-never leave, no
Now until forever, be with you the rest of my days

[Verse 2]
You never have to question the love I have for you
Girl, I will put my life on bended knees for you
Ask all my friends they'll tell you, you're all I talk about
Even when I go to sleep you're the only one I dream about
See I'm your picture, girl, and baby you are my frame
That's why I know our love will stay the same
(So dry your weeping eyes), weeping eyes girl I'm by your side
Just trust me I'm that guy, I'm in it for the long ride, yeah

[Chorus]
I will never leave, no
You don't have to worry, girl I'll be right there for you
I will never leave, no
Baby, can't you see that I was born to be with you
I will never leave, no
God put us together, nothing can't take that away
I will ne-ne-ne-never leave, no
Now until forever, be with you the rest of my days

[Bridge]
Since the day that doctor took me out of the womb
And spanked me
Girl, I was born to be with you and the rest is history (oh yeah)
Generations and now I'm all grown up
And you carry my seed (hey!)
Now we are flesh and blood, with you I am in love, yeah
(For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life)
We've been blessed with a love that's rare
That's why I'm not going nowhere

[Chorus]
I will never leave, no
You don't have to worry, girl I'll be right there for you
I will never leave, no
Baby, can't you see that I was born to be with you
I will never leave, no
God put us together, nothing can't take that away
I will ne-ne-ne-never leave, no
Now until forever be with you the rest of my days
I will never leave, no
You don't have to worry, girl I'll be right there for you
I will never leave, no
Well, I wish I was in London
Or some other seaport town
I'd put my foot on a steamboat
I'd sail the ocean 'round

While sailing 'round the ocean
While sailing 'round the sea
I'd think of handsome Molly
Wherever she might be

Don't you remember, Molly
You gave me your right hand?
You said whenever you'd marry
I would be the man

But you broke your promise
Go with whom you please
My poor heart is aching
You are at your ease

I went to church last Sunday
Molly came ridin' by
I could tell her mind was changin'
By the rovin' of her eye
I go down to the river
Though everyone's asleep
I think of handsome Molly
An' I begin to weep

So I wish I was in London
Or some other seaport town
I'd put my foot on a steamboat
I'd sail the ocean 'round

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes do what you wanna
Baby, how can I wait much longer
Make it hard to believe it happened to me
Morning comes too late tomorrow
All you lose is the dream you borrow
All you got is a soul that's born to be free

And cries to the wind, waiting for you
My dream will find you someday
I stand beside my vision of you
And have you loving me

[Chorus]
I still love you
(Ahhh...)
I still love you
(Ahhh...)

[Verse 2]
Though you're my imagination
You be there when we find salvation
Only then will there be no reason to hide
Stormy night, out in the heaven
I believe in the true forever
There's a bright new star when somebody dies
I cry to the wind, waiting for you
Sweet love returning someday
The day you learn love happened to you
You will be here with me

[Chorus] (Robin Gibb ad-libs)
I still love you (I still love you, I still love you)
(Ahhh...) (Ah girl)
I still love you (I love you, I love you)
(Ahh...)

[Release]
I'll be waiting for you
Sweet love returning someday
The day you learn love happened to you
You will be here with me

[Outro]
I still love you (I still you, I still you)
(Ahhh...) (Ohh...)
I still love you (I still you, I still you)
(Ahhh..) (Oh girl)
I still love you (I still need you girl)
(Ahhh...) (Oh girl)
I still love you (Love you, love you, love you)
(Ahhh...)
I still love you
(Ahhh...)

[Verse 1]
Back in 1958
We drove an old V8
And when it'd gone a hundred thou'
We got out and pushed it a mile

[Chorus]
We didn't know who we were
We didn't know what we did
We were just on the road

[Verse 2]
Headin' down from Canada on a gravel road a mile from Montana
Then my daddy read a sign and took us in the wrong direction
I asked my daddy where are we goin', he said we'll just follow our nose
So I looked out the window and dreamed I was a cowboy

[Chorus]
We didn't know who we were
We didn't know what we did
We were just on the road

[Verse 3]
I met a girl in a truck café
Fell in love almost right away
Then the Mercury was ready to go
And I had to leave her

[Bridge]
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-sh-doo
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-sh-doo-sh-doo
"Go home," said the man in the moon, "go home"
"Go home," said the man in the moon, "go home"
"Because it's gettin' sorta late
And I'll soon turn out my light
Go home," said the man in the moon, "go home"

[Chorus]
We didn't know who we were
We didn't know what we did
We were just on the road
We didn't know who we were
We didn't know what we did
We were just a ridin' on
We were just a ridin' on the road

[Verse 1]
I find it hard
To drive your stupid car
I find it hard
'Cause I never get that far

[Chorus]
And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gear
I cannot see the road

[Verse 2]
You got concrete eyes
But I cannot see your face
And I failed in life
'Cause you crushed me with your hands

[Chorus]
And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gear
I cannot see the road, road
Uh uh oh ahhhhhhh radio killa
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love

You said you changed, but still nothing
You're still the same, I'm just a part time lover

And I'm the blame, should've went away
But yet I stayed, with a part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out on the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

I left the state, changed everything
No more 818, for the part time lover

What goes around, comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone

Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)

Watch me walk it out
Walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up out the house
Walk it out watch me walk it out
Walk it out walk this right up out the house
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
What did I do wrong, baby
I tried to keep you satisfied
Whenever you needed me
I was right there by your side
Now tell me
What's the reason, baby
What's the reason
You're leaving me

I ain't got nobody else
Baby, it's always been you
'Cause there ain't nobody
Ain't nobody else
Can make me feel the way you do
I love you, I love you
I love you so, baby
You know I just can't
I just can't let you go
Do you hear what I hear?
Do you see what I see?
Colin, I want you to use your imagination
You wake up one morning and you ask yourself

Why am I so exciting?
What makes me dramatic?
You're trying to say something about yourself
The dazzling crime of wisdom

You fall for reality
You're bruised and bewildered
Then you learn to fall in love with yourself
That's motivation

You raise yourself high
Presenting your soul
You step from the shadows
You hear the command
An image to dream
You tremble permission
Tomorrow's rewards bloody skies of today
You'll step out of time
Into life's every dream
A life of such powerful meaning
Now you has class
Now you has splash
Now you has mass motivation

Here's an image I can recommend
Here's a product you will die for
Here's a nightmare that will never end
Get you fired up burning go oh oh

You know you got something
You know you got style
We don't take much just a little bit
That's motivation

Welcome to the world of your dreams, Colin
Where you can be what you want
Commit horrible sins
And get away with it

Lust
Gluttony
Pride
Anger
Sloth
Avarice
And jealousy
You know you got something
You know you got the style
We don't take much, but a little bit
That's motivation

No more false illusion
Goodbye to confusion
Stand out from the madding crowd
Motivation is symphony

Symphony in style (that's motivation)
It's brilliant, original (that's motivation)
Stimulating, encouragement (that's motivation)
As precious from home (that's motivation)
So what (motivation)
Say what (motivation)
New (motivation)
So (motivation)

Now you has class motivation
Now you has mass motivation

[Chorus]
Oooh
Oooh, isn't she pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, pretty
Oooh, isn't she a doll (She's a doll, now)

Uh huh, she's so fine. (So fine)
Gee, I wish she was mine

[Chorus]
Oooh, isn't she pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, pretty
Oooh, isn't she a doll (Hey, she's a natural doll, now)

[Verse 1]
She's the kind of girl all of my life, now
I wanted it, to be my wife
Because
She's got it, without a doubt
She really knocks me out
I can't do without her love

[Chorus]
Oooh
Oooh, isn't she pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, pretty
Oooh, isn't she a doll? (Hey, she's a natural doll, now)

[Bridge]
"Oh do you know, you know you're a pretty little thing?"
"I really want to be your man."
"No, no, no, do you know why?"
"Why?"
"You ain't got just what it takes."

[Chorus]
Oooh
Oooh, isn't she pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, pretty
Oooh, isn't she a doll (Hey, she's a natural doll, now)

[Verse 2]
Everytime she comes near me
My words just-a disappear
Here she comes now
Jus' the walk
Listen to her sweet, sweet talk
I can't do without her love

[Chorus]
Oooh
Oooh, isn't she pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, ah pretty, pretty
Oooh, isn't she a doll (She's a doll, now)

[Outro]
She so fine, so fine, so fine
I, I wish she were mine, all mine
She so fine, so fine, so fine
I, I wish she were mine, all mine
She so fine, so fine, so fine
I, I wish she were mine, all mine
I can't wait till you're gone away
'Cause then I can move on
I can't wait till you're gone away
'Cause then I can move on
Then I can say I'm finally over you
I'm, I'm finally over you
I'm, I'm finally over
I can't wait till you're gone away
'Cause then I can move on

Can't Wait Til You Are Gone (x2)

(Verse 1:)
You say that you are no longer in love with me
And Uh
You Can't Be
The One For Me
Told Me This Love Of Ours

And Its Caused Us To Grow
Apart And So

I can't wait till you're gone away
'Cause then I can move on
I can't wait till you're gone awau
'Cause then I can move on
Then I can say I'm finally over you
I'm, I'm finally over you
I'm, I'm finally over
I can't wait till you're gone away
'Cause then I can move on
Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendour
Hear only my heart
Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender
Like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For the moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
I know when to go out
I know when to stay in
Get things done
I catch the paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye
But I try, I try
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lyin' in the rain
But I never wave bye bye
But I try, I try
Never gonna fall for
Modern love, walks beside me
Modern love, walks on by
Modern love, gets me to
The church on time
Church on time, terrifies me
Church on time, makes me party
Church on time, puts my trust
In God and man
God and man, no confessions
God and man, no religion
God and man, don't believe
In modern love
It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye
But I try, I try
Never gonna fall for
Modern love, walks beside me
Modern love, walks on by
Modern love, gets me to
The church on time
Church on time, terrifies me
Church on time, makes me party
Church on time, puts my trust
In God and man
God and man, no confessions
God and man, no religion
God and man, don't believe
In modern love
Modern love, walks beside me
Modern love, walks on by
Modern love, gets me to
The church on time
Church on time, terrifies me
Church on time, makes me party
Church on time, puts my trust
In God and man
God and man, no confessions
God and man, no religion
God and man, I don't believe
In modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, modern love, modern love
Modern love, walks beside me
(Modern love)
Modern love, walks on by
(Modern love)
Modern love, walks beside me
(Modern love)
Modern love, walks on by
(Modern love)
Never gonna fall for modern love
(Modern love)
You ask if I remembered, when we first met
Girl, tell me how could I ever forget
There, you were standing there. Aw, with ruby lips and the golden hair
Your beauty seem to hypnotize me. I had that feeling I was no longer free
But when I ask you for a dance. (For a dance)
You wouldn't even give me a chance. (Me a chance)
And it hurt me through and through. That was the first time I got over you
You had my heart dingling, Like a puppet on a string. To you I meant nothing, darling. But to me it meant everything
Girl, you know since then through the years. (Through the years)
I've shed so many tears. (So many tears)
And all because of you, I couldn't cry if I wanted to
I don't know why I still love you
'Cause you don't even want me around
Year after year it's the same o' thing
You build me up, to let me down
So go on and hurt me. (Hurt me)
Aw, like you did
This time it'll be different
Mmm, my tears you'll see no more
'Cause I've cried so through the years. (Through the years)
Until I run out of tears. (Run out of tears)
And all because of you, I couldn't cry if I wanted to
I'll never shed another tear
I couldn't cry no more, darling
Seems as though the pain
Have gone the tears from my eyes
Never cry, never
Never no more
I'll never shed another tear
Oh, don't go and talk about my father
God is my friend, Jesus is my friend
He made this world for us to live in and gave us everything
And all He asks of us is we give each other love, oh ya
Don't go and talk about my father
'Cause God is my friend, Jesus is my friend
He loves us whether or not we know it
Just loves us, oh ya
And He'll forgive all our sins
Forgive all our sins
And all He asks of us, is we give each other love
Oh ya
Love your mother, she bore you
Love your father, he works for you
Love your sister, she's good to you
Love your brother, your brother
Don't go and talk about my father, He's good to us
God is my friend, Jesus is my friend
For when we call in Him for mercy, Mercy Father
He'll be merciful, my friend, oh, yes He will
All he asks of us, I know, is we give each other love, oh ya
Oh girl, why won’t you talk to me on the phone?
Every time I call you disguise your voice
And tell me you’re not at home
And girl, this cold shoulder you’re giving me
I don’t understand
Could it be that you’ve already got yourself a man?
If not

Running away (Running away) sure ain’t gonna help you
(I’m gonna get ya) I’m gonna get'cha
Better believe I'm gonna get ya
Running away sure ain’t gonna help you
(I’m gonna get ya), I’m gonna get ya
I'm gonna get'cha

Could it be, could it be you’re afraid of me
If so, I can't recall giving you a reason to be
You could see how much I love you
I've overexposed myself
You have filled my heart with so much love
'Til there's room for nobody else
Running away sure ain’t gonna help you
(I’m gonna get ya) I’m gonna get'cha
Better believe I'm gonna get ya
(I said running away) Running away sure ain’t gonna help you
(I’m gonna get ya), I’m gonna get ya
You better believe I'm gonna get'cha

Don't ignore what I tell ya
Heed every word I say
There's not a power in this world
That'll move me away from you
So you might as well give up
And tell me you'll be mine
'Cause I'm determined to get ya
It's just a matter of time

Running away sure ain’t gonna help you
(I’m gonna get ya) I’m gonna get'cha
You better believe what I tell ya, I said
Running away sure ain’t gonna help you
(I’m gonna get ya), I’m gonna get ya
Better believe I'm gonna get'cha
(I said) Running away sure ain’t gonna help you
(I’m gonna get ya) I’m gonna get'cha
(Believe me) Girl, I'm gonna get ya
Running away sure ain’t gonna help you
(I’m gonna get ya), I’m gonna get ya
Girl, I'm gonna get'cha

Softly, I will leave you softly
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly, long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years, I can't bear the tears to fall
So, softly as I leave you there

(Softly, long before you kiss me)
(Long before your arms can beg me stay)
(For one more hour) or one more day
After all the years, I can't bear the tears to fall
So, softly as I leave you there
As I leave I you there
As I leave I you there
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times, come again no more
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more

While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times, come again no more
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more

There's pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
Oh, hard times, come again no more
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more
I asked my baby to come down
And help me go my bail
But the woman left me stranded
People Oh in the county jail
That’s why that’s why that’s
Why my guitar sings the Blues
I’m gonna tell everybody the news
She makes my guitar sing the Blues...

I saw a fella come to her door
And she answered it with a smile
It almost blew my mind people
When she pulled down the blind
Oh that’s why that’s why you
Hear my guitar singin’ the Blues
I really paid my dues people
Oh the girl makes my guitar sing the Blues...

You know I was hopin’ my baby would
Come back and sing a different tune
But when I had a chance to ask her
People she said No no time soon
That’s why that’s why that’s why you
Hear my guitar singin’ the Blues
Sometimes I may sound a little confused
She makes my guitar sing the Blues...
You know I thought I’d call my baby
Because I missed her so much since she been gone
Just when I thought she’d say yeah!
They disconnected my telephone
Oh That’s why that’s why that’s
Why you hear my guitar singin’ the Blues
Gonna tell everybody the news
She makes my guitar sing the Blues...
I caught a ride on the Dreamland Express last night
I was sailing on an ocean of blue
And right there by my side, much to my surprise, was you

I said, come on over baby, let me look in your eyes
Let me see the very heart of you
And I couldn't believe it, or conceive that my dream would come true

Cause you said, hey there sweet daddy, everything is alright
You know for miles theres not a telephone line
Theres not a soul to disturb us
Just come and be mine

You said, let me be the end of your rainbow
Let me be the stars up above
Let me be the one that you dream of baby
Let me be the one that you love, oh, oh
Let me be the one that you love

But now its four in the mornin, I can't sleep
I can't get you out of my mind
I keep tossin and turnin, Im yearnin for the sun to shine
Id like to send you a ticket on the Dreamland Express
And take you far away with me
Ive got a vision of heaven, you livin there with me

Let me be the end of your rainbow
Let me be the stars up above
Let me be the one that you dream of baby
Let me be the one that you love, oh, oh
Let me be the one that you love

Llet me be the end of your rainbow
Let me be the stars up above
Let me be the one that you dream of baby
Let me be the one that you love, oh oh
Let me be the one that you love
I feel at home in the country
And it makes me feel like I'm happy
And my hands touch the sky
And I feel more alive than I've ever known
Oh yeah

But you understand what I'm feeling
And it makes me feel like we're learning
And you've nothing to hide
'cause you've shown it inside
And it says so much , it does

But that's not me
I'm not that man
I live for my world
And I do all I can , come what may
With the night on our side we can dance to the light of the morning
With a sweet country song just to help things along , oh baby
We'll run hot and run cold till the night grows old
And we're back in the dawn again
You're the light of my life , I rely on
And you're brighter than stars that I cry on
And you're closer to me than I think you should be
But I can't let go

But that's not me
I'm not that man
I live for my world
And I do all I can , come what may
With the night on our side we can dance to the light of the morning
With a sweet country song just to help things along , oh baby
We'll run hot and run cold till the night grows old
And we're back in the dawn again

Whisper of the wind's my only friend
With the night on our side we can dance to the light of the morning
With a sweet country song just to help things along , oh baby

With the night on our side we can dance to the light of the morning
With a sweet country song just to help things along , oh baby
With the night on our side we can dance to the light of the morning
With a sweet country song just to help things along , oh baby

With the night on our side we can dance to the light of the morning
With a sweet country song just to help things along , oh baby
With the night on our side we can dance to the light of the morning
With a sweet country song just to help things along , oh baby

[Verse 1]
I sense there's something in the wind
That seems like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend

[Chorus]
And does he notice
My feelings for him?
And will he see
How much he means to me?
I think it's not to be

[Verse 2]
What will become of my dear friend?
Where will his actions lead us then?
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may, it doesn't last

[Chorus]
And will we ever
End up together?
No, I think not
It's never to become
For I am not the one

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus]
And will we ever
End up together?
No, I think not
It's never to become
For I am not the one
In the beginning I never thought it would be poop
When we were chilling, smiling in the photo booth
But we got closer, soon you were eating off my spoon
You're coming over, then we would talk all afternoon
Tonight will just get drunk, disturb the peace
Bind your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
We're going all the way
Tonight take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the 4th of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes and I know
We ain't friends anymore if we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sure
So tonight kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side
This could be perfect but we won't know unless we try
I know you're nervous so just sit back and let me drive
Tonight will just get drunk, disturb the peace
Bind your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
We're going all the way
Tonight take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the 4th of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes and I know
We ain't friends anymore if we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sure
So tonight kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side
Kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side
Tonight will just get drunk, disturb the peace
Let your love crush into me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
We're going all the way
Tonight take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the 4th of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes and I know
We ain't friends anymore if we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sure
So tonight kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side
Take me to the other side
Take me to the other side
Kiss me like it's do or die
Take me to the other side

[?] to play a song by another band but... this song is called Wish and the band is cold Nine Inch Nails]

This is the first day of my last days
I built it up, now I take it apart, climbed up real high, now fall down real far
No need for me to stay, the last thing left, I just threw it away
I put my faith in God and my trust in you, now there's nothing more fucked up I could do

Wish there was something real, wish there was something true
Wish there was something real in this world full of you

I'm the one without a soul, I'm the one with this big fucking hole
No new tale to tell, twenty-six years, on my way to Hell
Gotta listen to your big time, hard line, bad luck, fist fuck
Don't think you're having all the fun, you know me, I hate everyone

Wish there was something real, wish there was something true
Wish there was something real in this world full of you

I want to but I can't turn back
But I want to
I keep on tryin' to get ahead, I'm doin' the best I can
But every time I try to pull up
They pull me right back down again
You got me down now and I hope you're satisfied
Oh, it's so hard to try to keep my head up
Yes, when you're puttin' pressure on me
From every side, every side

Even Uncle Sam say
I owe a lot of money way back from nineteen fifty six
Now, how could I owe him anything
When that whole year I was sick
They won't let me make my money
Won't even let me buy my clothes
Oh, it's so hard to get something to eat
Yes, and now they want to throw me outdoors
Throw me outdoors

Yes, everybody's laughin' at me
I can see the joy in their eyes
They're glad because I'm down now
Just look at the Devils in disguise
And I have no-one to turn to
No-one to lend me a helpin' hand
Oh, I'm tellin' you, shakes has really got me now
Yes, I'm a lonely, lonely man
Saturdays, holidays, easy afternoon
Lazy days, summer days, nothing much to do
Rainy days are better days, for hanging out inside
Rainy days and city ways make me want to hide
Someplace cool and green and shady

Find yourself a piece of grassy ground
Lay down, close your eyes
Find yourself and maybe lose yourself
While your free spirit flies
(musical interlude)

August skies, lullabys, promises to keep
Dandelions and twisting vines, Clover at your feet
Memories of Aspen leaves, trembling on the wind
Honeybees and fantasies
Where to start again
Someplace cool and green and shady

Cool and green and shady
Cool and green and shady
Cool and green and shady
Cool and green and shady

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)

[Drop: R3hab]

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Please tell me
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)

[Drop: R3hab]
I need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms that's gonna hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, ya know I'm at an end
'Cause I need your love so bad

I need some lips, baby, to feel next to mine
I want someone, baby, to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low and it's time to go
Oh, I need, I need your love so bad

So, give it up, and bring it home to me
Or write it on a paper, baby, so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me and stop drivin' me mad
'Cause I, I need your love so bad

Yes, I need a soft voice, baby, to talk to me at night
And don't you worry, baby, we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, bring it home to me
I need your love so bad, oh
I need your love, baby, so bad
So tremble if you must
For the dust is still breathing
And the trees are just the leaves
On a big breathing globe
And there's life in the rocks
And the seashells are listening
To the sound of the sea
As it slips on it's way

[Verse 1]
Back in 1957
We had to dance a foot apart
And they hawk-eyed us from the sidelines
Holding their rulers without a heart

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And so with just a touch of our fingers
Ah, it could make our circuitry explode
All we ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

[Chorus]
(Come in, come in, come in) Come in
Come in from the cold (come in)
We were so young
Oh come in (Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

[Verse 2]
We really thought we had a purpose
We were so anxious to achieve
We had hope, the world held promise
For a slave to liberty

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Freely I slaved away for something better
And I was bought and sold
And all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

[Chorus]
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
We were so sure
Oh come in (Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

[Verse 3]
I feel your legs under the table
Leaning into mine
I feel renewed, I feel disabled
By these bonfires in my spine

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I don't know who the arsonist was
Which incendiary soul
But all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

[Chorus]
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
You were too warm
Oh come in (Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

[Verse 4]
I am not some stone commission
Like a statue in a park
I am flesh and blood and vision
I am howling in the dark

[Pre-Chorus 4]
Long blue shadows of the jackals
Are falling on a pay phone by the road
Oh, all they ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

[Chorus]
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
I was so low
Oh come in (Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

[Verse 5]
Is this just vulgar electricity?
Is this the edifying fire? (It was so pure)
Does your smile's covert complicity
Debase as it admires? (Just a flu with a temperature)

[Pre-Chorus 5]
Are you just checking out your mojo
Or am I just fighting off growing old? (Just a high fever)
All I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

[Chorus]
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
It was so pure
Please come in (Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

[Verse 6]
I know we never will be perfect
Never entirely clear (When the moon shines)
We get hurt and we just panic
And we strike out out of fear (You were only being kind)

[Pre-Chorus 6]
I fear the sentence of this solitude
Two hundred years on hold (For my loving crime)
Oh and all we ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

[Chorus]
(Come in, come in, come in) Come in
Come in from the cold (come in)
When the moon shines
Oh come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold

[Verse 7]
When I thought life had some meaning
When I thought I'd had some choice
I was running blind and I made some value judgments
In a self-important voice

[Pre-Chorus 7]
I was outta line, but then absurdity
Came over me and I longed to lose control (Into no mind)
Oh all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

[Chorus]
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
You were so kind
Please come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
Oh come in come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
Oh come in come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)
Please come in
(Come in, come in, come in)
Come in from the cold (come in)

[Intro: Vybz Kartel]
Prison life never, never, never nice
Prison life anuh nothing like paradise
Prison life, man will take your life
And when you rest in peace, another man a f- your wife
Prison life never, never, never nice
Prison life anuh nothing like paradise
Prison life, man will take your life
You know it's Kartel, the Jamaican
Akon!

[Verse 1: Akon & Vybz Kartel]
I'm steady tryin' to find the motive
Why I do what I do? (Why?!)
Freedom ain't getting no closer
No matter how far I go
My car is stolen, no registration
Cops patrolin' and now they done stop me
And I get locked up

[Hook: Akon & Vybz Kartel]
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
They won't let me out, (Hey! Let me out!)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
No, they won't let me out (Let me out)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
No, they won't let me out (Hey!)

[Verse 2: Vybz Kartel]
When Shotta go a jail
Me no empty no shit pail
Grill fly, me no peep through rail
Me have weed for sale
Mi lawyer a big Queen's Counsel, so me never worry 'bout bail
When Shotta go a jail
Ward a send in fi him mail
High grade, inhale and exhale
Me no nyam prison food, a steam fish and lobster tail
Hennessy bore mi head like nail
Dem can't beat me! Like wha' dem do Arthur Wale
Me have a judge woman a Meadowvale...and one a Greendale
The bwoy weh lock me up, when him see me him haffi hail
Blinga anuh gyal like Suzie Q weh deh pon Reggae Trail...
Fi crush like bread when it stale
When you go a prison, you go college bigger than UWI and Oxford, Harvard and Yale

[Verse 3: Akon]
Heading uptown to re-up
Back with a couple keys
Corner block's on fire
Undercovers dressed as fiends
Making so much money
Product's moving fast
Put away the stash
And as I sold the last bag
Fucked around and got locked up

[Hook: Akon & Vybz Kartel]
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
They won't let me out, (Hey! Let me out!)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
No, they won't let me out (Let me out)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
They won't let me out (Let me out)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
No, they won't let me out (Hey!)

[Verse 3: Vybz Kartel]
Jail anuh daycare center, no Petcom no Creech
You can't wear brief, anuh beach
If you soap drop, that go, no care how you preach
Watch weh you walk barefeet
Bwoy, you hold your straight, beaten fi who don't -
Thugs and gays no locate
Jawbone mi dislocate!
Knife cut burn your skin like Neoprosone and Neo-Vate
Bwoy cyan take mi visits
Tell me him a Shotta, mi say, "Is it?"
Him have murder charge, me go quiz it
Find say the charge him deh pon was smaller than a midget
Knife stab, double digit
Madden fridge it
Prisoner support sure
Central Greater Portmore
One day you must walk through the door
Gyallis galore!
Zebra a raper, so lowe him, but please free up Jah Cure!
Please?

[Verse 4: Akon]
‘Cause visitation no longer comes by
Seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty
My cellmates getting food without me
Can't wait to get out
And move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me
And wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up

[Hook: Akon & Vybz Kartel]
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
They won't let me out, (Hey! Let me out!)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
No, they won't let me out (Let me out)
My nigga, I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
They won't let me out (Let me out)
I'm locked up...
They won't let me out (Let me out nuh)
No, they won't let me out (Hey!)
I'm locked up...

[Outro: Vybz Kartel]
Prison life never, never, never nice
Prison life anuh nothing like paradise
Prison life, man will take your life
And when you rest in peace, another man a f- your wife
Prison life never, never, never nice...

[Verse 1]
Yesterday I tried to write a novel but I didn't know where to begin
So I laid down in the grass tryin' to feel the world turn
Boy loses girl in a rain storm, nuclear World War III
All that's left is pain and sorrow, as far as he's concerned

[Chorus]
He says please send all your moonbeam levels to me
Please send all your moonbeam levels to me
Please send all your moonbeam levels to me
I'm lookin' for a better place to die

[Verse 2]
Maybe he's lookin' for a different world
Maybe he's lookin' for a brand new high
Maybe he would like a nice condo overlookin' the rings of Saturn
Maybe he wants affection instead of a plastic life
Maybe he doesn't know what he wants at all

[Chorus]
He says please send all your moonbeam levels to me
Please send all your moonbeam levels to me
Please send all your moonbeam levels to me
I'm lookin' for a better place to die

[Bridge]
A newborn child knows nothing of destruction
Nothing of love and hate
What happens in between is a mystery
Because we don't give a damn about his fate

[Verse 3]
He said he'll never keep diaries to learn from his mistakes
Instead he'll just repeat all the good things that he's done
Fight for perfect love until it's perfect love he makes
When he's happy then his battle will be won
It's never too late

[Chorus]
He says please send all your moonbeam levels to me
Please send all your moonbeam levels to me
Please send all your moonbeam levels to me
I'm lookin' for a better place to die

He says please send all your moonbeam levels to me
Please send all your moonbeam levels to me
Please send all your moonbeam levels to me
I'm lookin' for a better place to die

[Outro]
He don't, he don't, he don't really wanna die
He don't wanna, he don't wanna, he don't wanna die
He don't wanna, he don't wanna, he don't wanna die
He don't really wanna die

[Verse 1]
You're a very special part of my life
You're the one that I adore
You are my cherie amour
You're the one (You're the one)
I've been looking for (That I've been praying for, yes I have)

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna love you
(I wanna love you baby)
Better or worse
(Love you for better or worse)
I wanna honor you
(I wanna honor baby)
Because you come first
(Honor because you come first)
And I will cherish you like no other man can do

[Chorus]
This is my promise to you
(This is my promise to you)
All day long, baby
(This is my promise to you)

[Verse 2]
There will never be another you
You would make my heart complete
(Make your little heart complete)
And I'll supply your every need (Oo)
I wanna know will you marry me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh
I wanna care for you (I wanna care you, baby)
In sickness and health (Whether in sickness or health)
And I promise, baby (I promise you, baby)
There will be no one else (Love you and nobody else)

And to thine ownself I'll be true (This is my promise to you)

[Chorus]
This is my promise to you
(This is my promise to you)
This is my promise, baby
(This is my promise to you)
Don't cha want my promise, baby?
(This is my promise to you)
This is my promise, baby
(This is my promise to you)
To you, only you, baby

[Outro]
Would you please make my heart complete?
Oh! Hey! Yeah!

For better or worse
(Love you for better or worse)
I wanna honor you
(I wanna honor you, baby)
Because you come first
(Honor because you come first)
And I will cherish you like no other man can do
Oh, I...
(I wanna care for you, baby)
Sickness and health
(Whether in sickness or health)
I promise, baby
(I promise you, baby)
I'm gonna love you
(Love you and nobody else)
I'll even die for you
And to thine ownself I'll be true, hey, hey
(Yes, I'm gonna love you)
For the rest of my life, baby, you know that
(I'm gonna honor you)
But let me tell you why
(Because you come first)
And I will cherish you
Like no no no no no other man can do
And you know what? (Yes)
I wanna care for you
(I'm wanna care for you)
In sickness

I promise, baby

There will be nobody else

Girl, you know I'm on my own
But I'm still all alone
Let me be the one you need forever and ever, let it be me
(Yes, I wanna love you, baby) Ooh
(Love you for better or worse)
I'm gonna honor you
(I wanna honor you, baby)
All because you come first

I don't give a damn what your friends might say
'Cause all they ever done was get in the way
Let me be the one you need forever and ever, let it be me
(I wanna care you, baby)
(whether in sickness or health)
And I promise
(I promise you, baby)
They'll be nobody else
(Love you and nobody else)
Girl, when all the chips are down
You know I'll always be around
'Til death do us part you'll be in my heart for ever and ever
(Yes, I'm gonna love you)
For the rest of my life, baby
You know that
(I'm gonna honor you)
Why because
(Because you come first)
And I will cherish you
Like no other man can do
This is my promise to you, yeah
Oh, my promise, my promise, baby

I just looked to see the sun outside
It's shining so bright
A sun the clouds can't hide
Do you remember the time that you hear me say

I like to play games that two can play
Ah ha ha ha haaa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh

No more

The juke box daddies been blowin' my mind

I'm fat as a cow oh how'd I ever get this way

I like to play games that two can play
Ah ha ha ha haaa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh
No more

In the morning people are so happy
And that's the time when I'm a mister bussinessman
Later on I really get to goin' yeah
I get my motor runnin'
I get my legs to movin'

It's just no good unless two can play
Ah ha haaaa

I was layin' on my back
Relaxin' in the night
I played my radio
It was out of sight
Joe South was singing
"Games People Play"

And I like to play games that two can play
Ah ha ha ha haaa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh

Yeah-e-eah
Ah ha ha ha haaa
How do I tell her that I'm goin away
When I know that she'll be begging me to stay
And how do I tell her, that the time has come to part
When she's.. she's gonna take it so hard

I don't wanna break her heart
I don't wanna see her cry no
Cause I promised her forever
That I'd be by her side so

How do I tell her, How do I tell her tell her tell her
Goodbye... (oh yeah)

(8x fade..... )
Next time you see me things won't be the same
Next time you see me things won't be the same
If it hurts you my darling, you only got yourself to blame

Well, it's true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Well, it's true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Like the good book says, you gotta reap what you sow

Well, you lied, cheated -- woh-oh! for so long
Well, you lied, cheated -- woh-oh! for so long
You were wrong to do it woman, and another queen is on your throne

Next time you see me things won't be the same
Next time you see me things won't be the same
If it hurts you my darling, you only got yourself to blame

Well, it's true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Well, it's true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Like the good book says, you gotta reap what you sow
You will know later
When we will no longer
Be found in
So small a corner

Because some repression was a form of corner
The walls, they're starting to move
Release the tightly fitted joints
Thus altering the ways

Need to examine
Uncritical times
Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors
Of silent desperation never speaking to a soul

The poison air he's breathing has a dirty smell of dying
Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clicking of the turnstyle and the rattle of his chain

Oh she said, Casey it's been so long since I've seen you
Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile
See she said, I put on new stockings just to please you
Lord she said, Casey can you only stay a while

Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for anything thay can to keep from going home

Standing in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passin' by
And he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
Oh she said, I suppose you seldom think about me
Now she said, now that you've a family of your own
Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body
Lord she said, Casey it's a shame to be alone

Oh she said, Casey it's been so long since I've seen you
Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile
See she said, I put on new stockings just to please you
Lord she said, Casey can you only stay a while
Lord she said, Casey it's a shame to be alone
(Ronnie VanZant -- Allen Collins -- Gary Rossington)

I don't care who you are baby
Don't care about all the friends that you know
And why you chose me
Lord, sweet mama don't want to know
Can't tie me down baby
Don't bring me down
Chains can't hold me, I gotta go

I don't want your money baby
Don't care for your fancy clothes
And how you people live together
I say Lord in Heaven only knows
Can't tie me down people
Don't bring me down
Oh the man can't stop me, I gotta go
Gonna hit that road
Buy me some coke

You can take all your charm baby
Yea sweet daddy knows where it goes
Yes it does
You can tell your big sister thanks alot for the hole
Can't tie me down baby
Don't bring me down
Chains can't hold me, I gotta go
Gonna hit that road
I gotta go, don't hold me baby

[Verse 1]
Can't you see?
All of the things that I'm trying to say
Are inside of me
I never thought I'd be feeling this way
But I think you've known all the time
Your love is stranger than mine

[Verse 2]
Seeing you
I can't believe in a love that won't leave
I don't want you to
Be anyone that you don't wanna be
But I think you've known all the time
Your love is stranger than mine

[Bridge 1]
If you are the one
To make it, to break it
If you are the one
Won't you stay with me?

[Verse 3]
One more time
Getting a feeling afraid that I might be
Out of line
Telling myself there's a chance that you
Could be someone I've known all the time
Your love is stranger than mine

[Bridge 2]
If you are the one
To make it, to break it
If you are the one
Won't you stay with me?

[Outro with saxophone solo and ad-libs]
(Your love is stranger)
(Than mine)
(Your love is stranger)
(Than mine)
(Your love is stranger)
(Than mine)
The music she moves to, is music that makes me a dancer
I brought her my wildest of dreams, and she came up with the answer
I leave behind a part of myself, whenever I leave her
But oh, when I'm back in her arms
She smiles and then - I am home again

'Cause L.A. is my lady
She's always there for me
L.A. is my lady
She knows how to care for me
No lady's sweeter - you know it the moment you meet her

I've been in love more times, than I care to remember
And love's kept me cool in July and warm in December
It may not have lasted, but each time I thought it was heaven
You name it, I've been there and back
Lookin' for someone who - I'd be faithful to

L.A. is my lady
She's always there for me
L.A. is my lady
She knows how to care for me
She's good to me - yeah she's good to me
And that's why
L.A. is my lady - L.A. is my lady
And you're lookin' at a man who - doesn't ever plan to
Kiss his lady bye-bye
The night is bitter
The stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder
Suddenly you're a lot older
And all because of a gal who got away
No more her eager call
The writing is on the wall
All those dreams you dreamed
They have all gone astray
The gal who won you
She's run off and undone you
That great beginning
Has seen the final inning
I don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game
No more, no more that all time thrill
Because you have been put though the mill
And never a new love will ever be the same
Good riddance, goodbye
Every trick of hers you are on to
But fools will be fools and where's she gone?
Where has she gone?
The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and it's tougher
With hope ya burn up
Tomorrow maybe she'll turn up
There ain't no let up
Live long night, night and day
Ever since, since this world began
There ain't nothin' sadder than
A long lost loser
Lookin' for his gal who got away
Please come back
Won't ya come back?
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm
No one ever tells you what's like to love and lose
How it feels to waken and have breakfast with the blues
How to go on living, how to face another day
No one ever tells you the way
No one ever tells you how it feels to walk alone
Listening for those footsteps through the echo of your own
Suddenly it hits you all those dreams not worth a dime
Cause no one ever tells you in time
Long before the icy winds of winter
Autumn tells the swallows, time to fly
Why did she pretend till the bitter end
Till it broke my heart to say goodbye
And no one ever tells you that it's just another fling
No one ever warns you when your heart begins to sing
Someone tells you later all is fair in love and war
But no one ever tells you before
(instrumental)
No one ever tells you that it's just another fling
No one ever warns you when your heart begins to sing
Someone tells you later all is fair in love and war
But no one ever tells you before
It never comes easy, no one ever tells you before

Moment to come
So I can thank you for
All the tender love you've given to me

'Cause all of the tender love you've given me
Just can't hide that I'm feeling free
'Cause all of the tender love you've given me
Yeah
All the tender love you've given to me

[Verse 1]
Feels like I've been waiting so long for tonight
'Cause I just can't get you out of my mind
Can you feel my heart's beating so fast?
Now you're here, know there's no turning back

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I think I'm falling
Can't hold on no more
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
Just gotta let go
And as my grip unwinds
I feel your hand in mine
No, I've never felt, never felt like this before

[Chorus]
Come on babe, don't give up on us (don't give up on us)
Choose me and I'll show you love (and I'll show you love)
Let me show you love
Let me show you love (let me show you)

[Verse 2]
If you call, I'll be there at your side
If you're lost, I'll be there shining my light
'Cause every touch lifts me up to the stars
'Cause nothing could ever keep us apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I think I'm falling
Can't hold on no more
Enough is enough
Enough is enough
Just gotta let go
And as my grip unwinds
I feel your hand in mine
No, I've never felt, never felt like this before

[Chorus]
Come on babe, don't give up on us (don't give up on us)
Choose me and I'll show you love (and I'll show you love)
Let me show you love
Let me show you love (let me show you)
Let me show you love
"Ask For It"

[Nivea:]
La la la la la la la la la la ooh

[T-Pain:]
It's been two months and twenty days the last time I laid my eyes on you
(And I'm sick and tired)of not being around you
(And I'm sick and tired)of not seeing your face
And baby I kknow that it's killin you too
I can hear it in your voice when I'm talkin to you
(On the phone late at night) My conclusion is
(Being alone ain't right) I'm so confused babe
Cuase some nights I cry thinkin about you babe, can't do without you babe
Please believe me
ThatI got this thang covered, you ain't never gotta worry bout nothing
So baby please tell me

[Chorus:]
If there's anything you want
Anything you need
There ain't nothing in this world you cannot have
All you gotta do is ask for it
All you gotta do is ask for it 

[x2]

[Nivea:]
Many nights I cried thinkin about you boy
I been dreamin about you boy
Now we're separated boy
It's one thing to say but you gotta show you love me
Cause it's fifteen minutes after three and I'm still waiting to see
I-I-I I'm so tired of it boy

It's so long and I'm so gone and I know you niss me
I'll be out the door,ain't coming back no more
No I don't wanna speak to you... you, you, you
I did anything for you babe,everything for you babe
Used to say that I had you sprung
Used to treat me like number one
I guess I'll give you another chance
You better not pull that shit again

[Chorus:]
If there's anything you want
Anything you need
There ain't nothing in this world you cannot have
All you gotta do is ask for it
All you gotta do is ask for it 

[x4]

[music playing]
If only she'd looked my way
Just stopped to say a word of greeting
This let's-pretend would end there and then
The very moment when my heart stopped beating

If only she'd turned to smile
That little while, however fleeting
Would always seem a dream to dream today
If only she'd looked my way

If only she'd turned to smile
That little while, however fleeting
Would always seem a dream to dream today
If only she'd looked my way

[Verse 1]
Got to be there (got to be there)
Got to be there in the morning
When she says hello to the world
Got to be there (got to be there)
Got to be there, bring her good times
And show her that she's my girl
Oh, what a feeling there will be
The moment I know she loves me
Because when I look in her eyes, I realize
I need her sharing her world beside me

[Verse 2]
So I got to be there (got to be there)
Got to be there in the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she's my girl
When she says, "Hello world!" (got to be there)
I need her sharing the world beside me

[Verse 3]
That's why I've got to be there (got to be there)
Got to be there where love begins
And that's everywhere she goes
I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me, she's home, yeah

[Outro]
(Got to be there) Got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) Got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) Oh baby baby, got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) Got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) Oh got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) Got to be there, got to be there
I held her hand on a cobblestone corner
I kissed her lips by the river bridge
I said goodbye... night train rolling
On a lonesome day, by the lonesome river edge

But that's not the one I was thinking of..

[Verse 1]
You babes talk about your Madison shoes
We've got a thing we call the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues, baby
Rock away your blues

[Verse 2]
Now I knew a gal, her name is Lindsey-loo
She told me she loved me but I know it ain't true
Put on your Madison shoes
Put on your Madison blues shoes
I've got the Madison blues
Now put on your Madison blues shoes

[Verse 3]
You cats talk about your Madison shoes
We're doing a thing we call the Madison blues

You babes are talking about your Madison shoes

If you leave me, baby
I don't know what I´ll do
I guess I would die, sweetheart
If I don't get a kiss from you
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die
Oh, if you want me, baby
You've gotta come to me
Mm, I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Ooh, some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die
Well, if you want me, baby
Mm, you've gotta come to me
I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me

Mm, you've gotta come to me
I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me
Well, if you leave me, baby
I don't know what I´ll do
I guess I would die, sweetheart
If I don't get a kiss from you
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Mm, some god damned insurance on me, baby
If you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die

[Chorus: x2]
Yeah, (I got the shoes wit' the matchin' fit check)
Yeah, (I got them jewels lookin' phat around my neck)
Yeah, (Take a picture) click, click
(Take a picture) click, click
(Check me out!) Yeah, I know what I'm doin'

[Rick Ross]
Started wit' a nick then I seen a hundred bricks
Started on a corner, now a nigga 106
Heroin ain't quiet, nah, you can't quiet mine
I got the whole dirty south in line buyin' mine
You know I gotta shine; you just 'bezzle yours
I fifty-carat mine; I'm fuckin' several whores
When you hear the (brrrr), you know I got the sack
'Cause when I hit the (brrrr), he always got the packs
M-I-Yayo, I'm gettin' cake, ho
If you don't love Cash Money, you can stay broke
Fifty on the chain, twenty for the piece
A grand for the bitch, the whip is not a lease
You know I'm stuntin' hard Phantom in the front yard
Put Ross on the front just to front hard
Cash Money money comin' on freight liners
Cash Money got me buyin' these great diamonds

[Chorus: x2]

[Birdman]
We got the swine wit' the suede on top
The money keep a-comin', nigga; peep the drop tops
The white keep cookin', and the beige raw rock
And we flip the whole bird mama cookin' out the pots
Keep the tool in my hand 'cause we get it 'round the clock
Untangle few knots, but we still flood the blocks
Them niggas poppin' shit, but they know we stay cocked
And if they ever play wit' me, I'm gettin' another till dropped
Two-fifty on the grill, spent the same on the watch
Them hoes see us winnin' so you know they gon' flock
I bought another island wit' them foreign head lights
I scored a hundred birds, and they flew the same night
Them laws keep a-watchin' so we shinin' so bright
Got the tags on the windows and them brand new bikes
Big Money Heavyweight, nigga, that's my life
Neighborhood superstars got the candy on the whips and the bike, nigga

[Chorus: x2]

[Lil Wayne]
Started wit' some hubbers, twelve years old
Man, I swear to God I was twelve years old
My mama didn't know, and Stunna ain't know 'bout it
Till the day I got shot, they found some money in my pocket
Yeah, I know a nigga named Big Rufus that'll break ya off
Them niggas runnin' up the terminal, we takin' off
They say that money turn a model bitch into a dog
And I got a couple Eva Pigfords in my backyard
Nigga, I mack hard; bitch, I'm a bad boy
Fuck a security guard, I turn 'em into track stars
You know my name, baby, that's Weezy fuckin' baby
And if that nigga hatin' on ya, then fuck him, baby
I tell 'em, fuck 'em, girl
Eighteen inch windows in my crib; you'll see the whole world
Bitch, what you tryin' a do?
I haven't spent a check yet off Tha Carter Two
I am that fuckin' dude, now who the fuck are you?

[Chorus: x2]
Did you ever think that you would be rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were these times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

I used to think about how I was gonna make it
Struggling day to day trying to get this paper
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way
And now I'm lying lavish and all I do is think and say

Did you ever think that you would be rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were these times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers
Now I've been around the world and seen so many Things
Partied in every club nothing but VIP
I never take for granted these luxuries I have
Just try my best to answer all of those questions that I ask

Did you ever think that you would be rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid

Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were these times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

I used to play the game and like the same ole same
Dreamin' 'bout city lights it was my only life
And now this world I chose as if I did not own
Now I can't go nowhere without you all wanting to know
Did you ever think that you would be rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were these times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

I used to dream about this life
Now I'm sitting on first class flights VIP

Did you ever think that you would be rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn

Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's longing to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring
Where my heart can go a-journeying?
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy
Serenading the moon

Oh Skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?
And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy
Serenading the moon

Oh Skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh Skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery

Oh, so many strange things
They happen to me all day long
Oh, so many strange things
They happen to me all day long
Yes, it seems like everything I do
Everything I do is wrong

I had a good reputation
The greatest man in town
But I'm having so much troubles
Till they 'bout to drag me down
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery
I got up on my feet
I had lots of friends
But bad luck had hit me
Now I'm down again
I wonder why
Why do everything have to happen to me
Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome
My heart is filled with misery
Bite chunks out of me
You're a shark and I'm swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
And all your friends come sniffing

Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go, my love, it's very late
‘Til morning comes, let's tessellate

Go alone my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones alone my lover
And keep us on my heart

Three guns and one goes off
One's empty, one's not quick enough
One bird, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins

Chunks of you will sink down to the seals
Blubber rich in mourning, they'll nosh you up
Yes, they'll nosh the love away, but it's fair to say
You will still haunt me
Triangles are my favorite shapes
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go, my love, it's very late
‘Til morning comes, let's tessellate
She was morning and I was night time
I one day woke up to find her lying beside my bed
I softly said ”Come take me“
For I’ve been lonely, in need of someone
As though I’d done someone wrong somewhere
But I don’t know where, I don’t’ know where
Come lately

You are the sun I am the moon
You are the words I am the tune play me

Songs she sang to me
Songs she brought to me
Words that rang in me
Rhymes that sprang from me, warmed the night
And what was right became me

You are the sun I am the moon
You are the words I am the tune play me

And so it was that I came to travel
Upon a road that was thorned and narrow
Another place, another grace would save me

[Verse 1]
Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone true to love
Don't go to strangers
Lover, come to me

[Verse 2]
Play with fire, get your fingers burned
But when there's no place left for you to turn
Don't go to strangers
Lover, come to me

[Bridge]
You give the call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart, I know
I've been around, I'm an old hand
I'll understand if you have to go

[Verse 3]
So make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers
Lover, come to me

[Outro]
Don't go to strangers
Lover, come to me
I'm sorry dear, so sorry dear, I'm sorry I made you cry
Won't you forget, won't you forgive, don't let us say goodbye
One little word, one little smile, one little kiss won't you try
It breaks my heart to hear you sigh, I'm sorry I made you cry
One little word, one little smile, one little kiss won't you try
It breaks my heart to hear you sigh, I'm sorry I made you cry

[Spoken Jamie:]
Yo you sleep
Naw I just um, I think I want some more
Yea I know we just got through
But its just so good, I just caint help it tho’
Its something about your body
Naw it ain't all I think about
Well to be honest, oh

[Verse:]
Im startin' to believe
Something's wrong wit me
Cause everyday, every night, every hour, every minute
I'm thinkin' 'bout it
I can be at my job, in my car, up in church
And when I try to pray it off, it won't work
It seems that I caint get enough of

[Chorus:]
(Sex) All the time
(Sex) On my mind
(Sex) Everywhere I go
(Sex) I'm tryna let you know
(Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love
S-E-X ohhheee

(Sex) All night long
(Sex) It's the perfect song
(Sex) Stronger than any drug even love
S-E-X oh

[Verse:]
Its getting to the point where I (where I)
I watch it on TV when I buy DVDs
Thirty-nine ninety-nine for the new releases (39.99 for the new releases)
I ain't proud of it, cause it's getting in the way of love for me
And I caint help it, caint shack it
(You know what) Sometimes I hear it calling me

[Chorus 1X]

[Hook:]
Some call it bad, some call it good
Some do it bourgeois, some do it hood
I do it hood (can I say that one more time) girl I do it hood ohh

Some like it slow, some like it fast
It don't mater the tempo long as it lasts
I make it last (can I say that one more time) girl I make it last ohh

[Chorus until end]
Hindsight, don't make it right
She give me trouble enough
And she's a ball of light
I'm in the tunnel of love
With the American dream
And I was born too soon
A little good luck, never stuck
She got me climbing the walls
Got me hard as a rock
Within a city of sin, she got a city block
And she was barkin' at the moon

She likes to show
So many sides to her
And I'd be the one to know

When am I gonna go to your dimension
When am I gonna go to where you are
When am I gonna go to your dimension
Dimensions of each other keep us goin' strong
Black knight, take a bite
She can double it up
And she's a way of life
And whether dead or alive
She got a fix on me
And I was dancin' in the fire
White steam, never seen
In every muscle and bone
She was a love machine
And she could wrestle me down
And get a taste of me
In her web of desire

She changed my world
How can the body know
It's touchin' me or her

When am I gonna go to your dimension
When am I gonna go to where you are
When am I gonna go to your dimension
Dimensions of each other keep us goin' strong
Honey babe, I'm tired of you
You don't treat me like you used to do
You know you know I love you anyhow
Honey babe it's all over now

Well all the stars ??
Will give me ten dollars, will give me nine
You don't do me like you used to do
Honey babe, it's all over you

[Intro: Ronald Isley]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Listen, listen

[Verse: Ronald Isley]
I was born to sing this music yeah
My brother was born to play his guitar, yeah
The sweet melody sent straight down from heaven
And oh, now you know, now you know who we are
Lord, go out and find your star
Whatever it is, listen
Try and find, find your star, find your star
Find out who you are

[Ernie Isley guitar solo]
See the sun rise
Open up your eyes
Today is the very first day
Watch the morning come
Now the night is gone
Yesterday is so very far away

Trouble, you get out of my sight
You know I can't look at you when the sun is so bright
You know everything's coming together now
Can't you see

And I live my life in celebration
That I've got a life to live
And I sing my song in revelation
That I've got a song that I can give to you
And you know I do

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
I was blind, but now I can see
You know, I'm just learning how it feels to be free
You know I never really knew just what it could be before

And I live my life in celebration
That I've got a life to live
And I sing my song in revelation
That I've got a song that I can give to you
And you know I do and you know it's true

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
The air below the crucible
Perfect as it couldn't say no
The air below the crucible
Perfect as it couldn't say no

Met by a cold body of lead
A presence unlimited
Met by a cold body of lead
A presence unlimited

The air below the crucible
Perfect as it couldn't say no
The air below the crucible
Perfect as it couldn't say no
The air below the crucible
Perfect as it couldn't say no
The air below the crucible
Perfect as it couldn't say no
The air below the crucible
Perfect as it couldn't say no
The air below the crucible
Perfect as it couldn't say no
He will take it to the water
He will swim and swim on further
The ocean is deep and salted
There reign a world of the mermaid

The imagined profuse
Leaving a man confused
The story was short-lived
Not before long after

He will take it to the water
He will swim and swim on further
The ocean is deep and salted
There reign a world of the mermaid
He will take it to the water
He will swim and swim on further
The ocean is deep and salted...

[Verse 1]
You, baby, were like the sky
You held me up to let me fly
That's just like you to tell me I've nothing to fear

[Chorus]
But I am a broken house
I'm holding on a broken bough
Now it's easy for me to see

[Verse 2]
It couldn't be that easy
It had to be much harder
That's just like you to tell me I've nothing to fear

[Chorus]
But I could have been falling free
Falling all these years
Now it's easy for me to see

[Bridge]
Full of air
Sun on my face, wind in my hair
Falling down
Flying as slow as I can
I'm not trying to reach the land
Just falling somewhere

[Outro]
It couldn't be that easy
It had to be much harder
Meanwhile, boy, I love you
It was the time of the preacher
When the story began
Of the choice of a lady
And the love of a man
And how he loved her so dearly
He went out of his mind
When she left him for someone
She'd left behind
He cried like a baby
He screamed like a panther
In the middle of the night
And he saddled his pony
And he went for a ride
It was the time of the preacher
In the year of '01
Now the preaching is over
And the lesson's begun
But he could not forgive her
Though he tried and he tried, and he tried
And the halls of his memory
Still echo her lies
He cried like a baby
He screamed like a panther
In the middle of the night
And he saddled his pony
And he went for a ride
It was the time of the preacher
In the year of '01
Now the lesson is over
And the killing's begun
It was the time of the preacher
In the year of '01
When you think it's all over
It's only begun
I heard the laughter at the depot
But my tears fell like the rain
When I saw them place that long white casket
In the baggage coach of the evening train

The baby's eyes are red from weeping
It's little heart is filled with pain
And Daddy cried they're taking Mama
Away from us on the evening train

As I turned to walk away from the depot
It seemed I heard her call my name
Take care of baby and tell him darling
That I'm going home on the evening train

I pray that God will give me courage
To carry on til we meet again
It's hard to know she's gone forever
They're carrying her home on the evening train
Here comes Johnny yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And the flesh machine
He's gonna do another strip tease
Hey man where'd you get that lotion?
I been hurting since I bought that gimmick
About something called love
Yeah something called love
Well that's like hypnotizing chickens
Well I'm just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before

'Cause of a lust for life
'Cause of a lust for life

I'm worth million in prizes
With my torture film
Drive a G.T.O
Wear a uniform
All on a government loan
I'm worth a million in prizes
Yeah I'm through with sleeping on the side-walk
No more beating my brains
No more beating my brains
With the liquor and drugs
With the liquor and drugs
We'll I'm just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cause of a lust for life

Oh a lust for life

Well I'm just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before

'Cause of a lust for life
'Cause of a lust for life

Well here comes Johnny yen again
With the liquor and drugs
And the flesh machine
I know he's gonna do another strip tease
Hey man where'd you get that lotion?
Your skin starts itching once you buy the gimmick
About something called love
Oh love love love
Well that's like hypnotizing chickens
Well I'm just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cause of a lust for life
'Cause of a lust for life
Got a lust for life

Oh Lust for life
I got a lust for life
Yeah lust for life
I got a lust for life
Lust for life

Lust for life
Lust for life
Nobody's fault but mine if I don't read my soul gets lost
Nobody's fault but mine
Had a Bible in my hand, had a Bible in my arm

My mother she taught me how to read
If I don't read my soul gets lost
Nobody's fault but mine, nobody's fault but mine
When I first met you, said you would be mine
Found out later you was tellin' me a lie
And now I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

Now if there's one thing that I just can't stand
Can't stand to see you with another man
Because I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

I did all for you, did all I could
All I did darlin', it didn't do me no good
And now I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

Now I'm goin' on, goin' on my way
I know you don't love me now darlin'
But you will some old day
Because I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more
I know a sexy little girl
She's never in the low class world
This woman is all the way vogue
High Fashion is where her money goes
She dines at Le Dome up on the strip
Cheap liquor never touches her lips
Her brandy's imported every week
No problem, 7,000 easy

High Fashion is where her money goes
High Fashion - This girl is all the way vogue
She's never in the low class world
High Fashion - Stuck up little rich girl

High Fashion
High Fashion, yeah

I met her dancin' at Le Dome
I offered dinner at my home
She said no, all of her friends laughed
Funny how the laughin' stopped when I flashed all the cash I had
(I'm talkin') $1900 is 2 much cash 2 hold
One of my boys had 2 carry half, now honey U know that's bold
Wait a minute
She had the nerve 2 ask what kinda car I had
"Honey, I'm ridin' in back of a Rolls Royce limo custom-painted plaid!"
High Fashion is where my money goes
High Fashion - Honey, I'm all the way vogue
I'm never in the low class world
High Fashion - And I just love little rich girls

(High Fashion) High Fashion (High Fashion)

Hot Station - I took the child 2 my crib
Donation - Do U take or do U give?
She took one look at the swimmin' pool
I said "I'll donate" - We were 2 swimmin' fools

High Fashion is where our money goes
High Fashion - All the way vogue
We're never in the low class world
High Fashion - Don't be a little stuck up rich girl

All the way vogue {x2}
I'm all the way vogue
Yeah, yeah
(High Fashion) {repeats in BG}
Dinner at Le Dome
Little girl
Money man

Money man {x2}
High Fashion {x4}
Ohhhhh
(High Fashion) {x2}

[Chorus - Bret]
A kiss is not a contract
But it's very nice
Mmm, it's very nice

[Verse 1 - Bret]
Just because you've been
Exploring my mouth
Doesn't mean you get to take
An expedition further south, no

[Chorus - Bret (Jemaine)]
A kiss is not a contract
But it's very nice
(It's very, very nice)

[Verse 2 - Jemaine]
Just because we've been
Playing tonsil hockey
Doesn't mean you get to score the goal
That's in my jockeys

[Verse 3 - Bret]
Just because I'm in a two-man novelty band
Doesn't mean it's all about poontang
I can't go around loving everyone
I just wouldn't get anything done

[Verse 4 - Jemaine]
You can take me out to dinner
That might be quite nice
You could buy me a burrito
And some beans and rice
But that won't get you into pant's paradise
They call it a fly because it takes you up to heaven
Oh-whoa

[Chorus - Bret and Jemaine]
A kiss is not a contract
But it's very nice
It's very, very nice

[Outro - Bret]
I'm only one man, baby, pretty baby
We're only two men, ladies
Oh babies, oh, pretty babies

[intro]
1, 2, 3...

[Verse]
He gives speeches but they put him back in bed where he wrote his satire
He gives speeches, always reaches out a lot, led him to discover
Silken hair, more silken hair fell on his face and no wind was blowin'
Stepped across the golden fields, and saw that she was soon trailing after
She was nice and didn't fight, he fell into her friendly persuasion
Late that night while by a streetlight, little hands shadowed on the ceiling

[Outro]
Brian: Should I overdub it?
This is gonna be so great, i'm not kidding
For you, there'll be no more crying
For you, the sun will be shining
And I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright
I know it's right

To you I'll give the world
To you I'll never be cold
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright
I know it's right

And the songbirds are singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before

And I wish you all the love in the world
But most of all, I wish it from myself

And the songbirds keep singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before
Like never before
Like never before

[Intro]
Girl, before you walk away
Here's one thing I've got to say
I'll be no good without you, baby
No good without you, baby

[Verse 1]
Well, I've got money, and I've got fame
But if you leave me, it don't mean a thing
That's why I'm begging, baby, please don't go
That's why I'm trying, love, to let you know
That's why I'm trying, baby, to make you see
Just how much, how much you mean to me

[Chorus]
I'll be no good without you, baby
No good without you, baby

[Verse 2]
Your love, it made me ten feet tall
Your leaving leaves me nothing at all
What did I do, baby, to make you wanna go?
What did I say, baby, to hurt you so?
What's come between us? Can it be
Somebody has stole your love from me?
Oh, oh, oh baby
Baby, please, please don't leave me
If you leave me, baby, I'll be in misery

[Chorus]
No good without you, baby
I'll be no good without you, baby

[Verse 3]
Well, take my money, and take my fame
'Cause if you leave me they don't mean a thing
Oh, I'll keep on begging, baby, please don't go
And I'll love you harder than I did before
'Cause I'll be crying when you close the door
'Cause I know, I know when you go

[Chorus]
I'll be no good without you, baby
Baby, don't leave me
I'll be no good without you, baby
Oh, don't leave me, baby, baby
Oh, I'll be no good without you, baby
Just Go

(Boz Scaggs)

Take what you need
Just leave me a key and go
I'm all out of answers
Except where I don't know

This hanging around
Is dragging us down you know
Everything changes
I guess we let it go

Take care of yourself
You'll learn to live again
Wary but wiser in the end
Perhaps.... oh well

Just go
I'm all out of answers
But yes... the answers no
Ooooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

Ooooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

Here comes old chaos
Now there's a friend
And he'll have us laughing in the end
But crying now

Just Go
Everything changes
Oh yes well there you go... there you go
Long about sundown, I've gotta be on my way
Sad long about sundown, I've gotta be on my way
Goin' back to my woman and this time I'm gonna stay
Yes, I've been gone for a long time
Wonder if I'm welcome home
Wonder if I'm welcome home
Been gone for a long time
So many things can happen
When a man leaves his baby all alone
Yes, it took a long time, baby
When I knock on the door
To realise what a fool I've been
Well, I said it took a long, long time, baby
To realise what a fool I've been
I wonder will she let me in
Come here baby
Just lay your body right here baby
And let me tell you all
All the things, I wanna do to you baby
Aww, girl relax
Cause I'm about to prove to you
That every bit of me wants to be lying here with you
All I wanna I do

I just wanna share my love
I just wanna share my love
I just wanna share my love
Share my love, share my love with you

I just wanna share my love
I just wanna share my love
All of my, share my love, I just want, share my love with you

Let go baby
And let this feeling get in you
Why don't you just come a little closer girl
Let me show you what my love can do
Ooh, take that off
Oh girl and let the fun begin
If you just, just throw that out to love tonight
I promise you'll never hurt again, oh, no
I just wanna share my love
I just wanna share my love
For the rest of my life, baby
I wanna share my love
I just wanna share my love
Share my love with you

Now that we're in this room
Let's do what we were born to do
Populate, let's get together
Populate, make the world better

I just wanna share my love, with you baby
I just wanna share my love, so that wanna do
I wanna share my love, share my love, share my love with you
I just wanna share my love
For the rest of my life
I just wanna share my love
Girl come over here and get this love
I wanna share my love
It's all for you
Share my love, share my love with you

I just wanna share my love
I just wanna share my love
Forever baby
I wanna share my love, share my love, share my love with you

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You say you're not gonna fight
'Cause no one will fight for you
'Cause you think there's not enough love
And no one to give it to

And you say that faith is a lie
And fear is your only truth
And you're sure that everyone else
Is feeling the way you do

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You say you've hurt for so long
That pain isn't something new
But, don't think the things that they've done
Predict what you're going to do

The truth is that trust is a gift
It's something we all can lose
So hold on, it's not where it goes
It's where it can lead you to

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Hold on, it's not where it goes
It's where it can lead you to
Hold on, it's not where it goes
It's where it can lead you to

Hold on, it's not where it goes
It's where it can lead you to
Hold on, it's not where it goes
It's where it can lead you to
I wish I could have been there on the highway
When the people came from miles around to see
The children of the flowers come together

I wish I could have been there in the sunshine
With the sound of lovely laughter in the air
And the music makers first began to play
To hear them play

And I wish I could have been there in the rain
When the clouds were full of castles in the sky
And I wish I could have heard the people sing
As the rhytmn and the words came floating by

I wish I could have been there in the starlight
When the country side was trying once again
And the music and the makers the poets and the singers
And the children of the flowers have all gone

[Skit]
Damn, all these motherfuckers are here
Can you believe this shit?
All these motherfuckers claiming to be R. Kelly
But they don't know who he is I'm R. Kelly (that's for damn sure)
Look at the motherfucker over there he didn't even got all teeth
What the fuck is he trying to be
I am R. Kelly
(Yeah, right)
But they don't know who the real R. Kelly is
Okay, now would the real R. Kelly please stand up?
Now that's what I'm talking about now
Come on man
Nigga, you ain't no R. Kelly

[Verse 1]
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it
Baby, stay with me
Love game intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, I'll get him hot
Show him what I've got
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, I'll get him hot
Show him what I've got

[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She’s got me like nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She’s got me like nobody

[Post-Chorus]
Po-po-po-poker face, po-po-poker face
Po-po-po-poker face, po-po-poker face

[Verse 2]
I wanna roll with him
A hard pair, we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I'll get him hot
Show him what I got
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I'll get him hot
Show him what I've got, yeah

[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She’s got me like nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She’s got me like nobody

[Bridge]
I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
’Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying
I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand ’cause I am marvelous

[Outro]
I'm marvelous, I'm marvelous, I'm marvelous, so marvelous
He can't read my, he can't read my poker face
Moses come ridin' up on a quasar
His spurs were jingling, the door was ajar
His buckle was silver, his manner was bold
And I asked him to come in out of the cold

His brain was boiling, his reason was spent
He said: If nothing is borrowed, then nothing was lent
I asked him for mercy, he gave me a gun
Said: Now 'n' again these things just got to be done

Abraham and Isaac
Sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work
If you had any sense
Y'know the one thing we need
Is a left-hand monkey wrench

Gideon come in with his eyes on the floor
Says: Y'ain't got a hinge, you can't close the door
Moses stood up a full six-foot-ten
Says: You can't close the door when the wall's caved in
I asked him for water, he poured me some wine
We finished the bottle, then broke into mine
You get what you come for, you're ready to go
It's one in ten thousand just come for the show
Abraham and Isaac
Digging on a well
Mama come quick
With the water witch spell
Cool clear water
Where you can't never tell

Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench
(Chorus:)
This is the life o' the party
We gonna do it right

So Ur havin' a party?
Goody 4 U
All the beautiful people gonna b there?
Yeah, that's cool
U know Ur gonna have a good time cause U got the news
That the life o' the party is gonna party with U

We're doing our own thing
Until the sun'll come up
Sweet Candy gonna b there
Yeah, it's gonna b rough
She ain't got no off switch
And neither do eye
When U read it in the paper 2morrow
U gonna hang Ur head and cry

(Chorus)
We gonna have us a party
All r welcome 2
We ain't down with nobody
That don't party like we do
Once we get it started
We got 2 go all night
This is the life of the party
We gonna do it right
Why party in your own yard
When U can party in mine?
All the beautiful people gonna b there
Puttin' the "I" in fine
Throw the records out my window
CD's out the door
Might as well give it 2 the milkman
We don't want it no more

Everybody can smell this funk y'all
Down in Altanta GA
Everybody, even Dre and Em, know it's OK
Hey, we don't need any trippin' y'all on this special day
We just callin' 2 let U know
U better not come if U can't stay

(Chorus)
What's it gonna take 2 get Ur booty soakin' wet?
U and me closer baby, that's a bet

Eye'm the life of the party
As long as eye got your body
Shakin like a leaf on a tree
Cutie come dance with me
U and me, we got mad chemistry
Don't it make U wanna holler?
Come with the life of the party, y'all
We're still makin dollars
25 Years 2 life
The judge sentenced me 2
Now here we are together
This would've been worth waiting forever
I always it'd feel this way

And please forgive my shaking
Can't you tell my heart is breaking?
Can't make myself say what I planned to say

Baby
Please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love

I built all my goals around you
That some day my love would surround you
You'll never know what we've been through

For so long I thought about it
And now I just can't live without it
This beautiful image I have of you
Baby
Please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love

Please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love

I love you
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

I need your love

I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason
You're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
And I feel so hopeless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

I need your love

Now I'm dreaming, will I ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong
And I feel so hopeless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love

All the years
All the times
You have never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears
All the lies
All the waste
I've been trying to make a change
And now my eyes are open

I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free
Music By: Lightnin' Hopkins

Mama got the rub board, sister got the tub
They're going round doing the rub-de-rub
Ain't it crazy, ain't it crazy
Ain't it crazy one day, to keep on rubbin' that thing

Two old maids, they was layin' in a bed
One turned over and this is what she said
Ain't it crazy, ain't it crazy
Ain't it crazy one day, to keep on rubbin' that thing

Yeah mama killed a chicken, thought it was a duck
Put him on the table with his feet sticking up
(Alternative: ... with his feet turned up)
Ain't it crazy, ain't it crazy
Ain't it crazy one day, to keep on rubbin' that thing

There was two old maids, layin' in the sand
Each one wonderin' if the other was a man
(Alternative: Each one wishing that the other was a man)
Ain't it crazy, ain't it crazy
Ain't it crazy one day, to keep on rubbin' at that thing
Notes:

This was played by the Dead a dozen times in 1970 and 1971, and before that in 1964 by Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions before the Dead proper were formed.It seems clear that the Dead knew this song as "The Rub". In July 1964, for example, Weir introduces it by saying that Mr Pigpen McKernan is going to sing a Lightnin' Hopkins song - The Rub. But Lightnin' Hopkins recordings have it under the title "Ain't It Crazy", "Mighty Crazy" or "The Crazy Song."

I gotta a girl who's always late
Anytime we have a date
But I love her
Yes I love her

I'm gonna walk up to her gate
And see if I can get it straight
'Cause I want her
I'm gonna ask her
Is you is, or is you ain't, my baby
The way you're acting lately makes me doubt
You is still my baby, baby
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

A woman is a creature
That has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one you find
She's gone and made a change

Is you is, or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true
Keep on walking
I'm talkin' about your street
Don't let nothin' or nobody
Throw you off your beat

Do like you do in New York
Go another round
Do like you do in New York City
Don't look down

Watch your brother
Give the man a hand
Come to know that
And you'll come to understand

You've got to
Do like you do in New York
Go another round
Do like you do in New York City
Don't look down
(Do like you do)
(Do like you do)

Do like you do in New York City

Do like you do in New York
Go another round
Do like you do in New York City
Don't look down

Do what you do
When you do what it is in the big town
Do what it is whatever it is
Do what you gotta do
To take care of biz in the big town

[Intro]
Entrea
Ay, tantas cosas que quiero
Decirte yo quiero
Hacer por ti
But first we must dance

[Verse 1]
Private cotillion style
One lady's fantasy
Trip to Milan tonight
Exclusive shopping spree
Mansions await, your scent
That smells just like treasure
Dining with me in suites
That overlooks the shore

[Chorus]
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
(Dancin' with a rich man)
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
(Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance)
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
(Dancin' with a rich man)
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss

[Verse 2]
Kissing the feet of you
While listening to Bontemps
And your angelic grace
Wearing Victoria
Passionate love with you
Hearing you, "Oh, oui oui"
Some antique jewelry from
Kenshire's gallery

[Chorus]
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
(Dancin' with a rich man)
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
(Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance)
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
(Dancin' with a rich man)
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
And when you elevate
Like visions of grandeur
Mademoiselle and me
Behind the villa doors
Sunsets on yellow sand
That's where we rendezvous
Chapels of Valentine
Is just to name a few

[Chorus]
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
(Dancin' with a rich man)
As we move, then we touch, then we dip
(Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance)
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
(Dancin' with a rich man)
As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
The way you make me feel like I belong;
The way you make me right when I am wrong;
The way you sacrifice just for me;
Just how lucky can a poor man be?

That is why
(That's why I love you so.)
That is why
(That's why I love you so.)
Don't you know, baby?
(That's why I love you so.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want the world to know

The way you rub my back when I'm in pain;
The way you soothe me so I won't complain;
And then you kiss me with your ruby red lips;
It thrills me so, I turn a back-over flip

That is why
(That's why I love you so.)
That is why
(That's why I love you so.)
Don't you know, baby?
(That's why I love you so.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want the world to know
If Shakespeare thought that Juliet
Really loved Romeo from the time they met
Uh he would blow his top if he could see
Just how you've been loving me

The way you rub my back when I'm in pain;
The way you soothe me so I won't complain;
And then you kiss me with your ruby red lips;
It thrills me so, I turn a back-over flip

That is why
(That's why I love you so.)
That is why
(That's why I love you so.)
Don't you know, baby?
(That's why I love you so.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want the world to know
Writer(s): Gershwin/Gershwin

They're writing songs of love - but not for me
A lucky star's above - but not for me
With love to lead the way
I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play - can guarantee

I was a fool to fall - and get this way
Ah ho alas and awe - so lackaday
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of her kiss
I guess she's not - she's not for me

Old man sunshine - listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it - and I'll start a riot

Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me she will care
I'm certain - it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Polly-Anna's
Who tell you fate supplies a mate - it's all bananas

It all began so well - but what an end
This is the time - a fellow needs a friend
When every happy plot
Ends with a marriage knot
And there's no knot, no (k)not for me

[Part 1]
The falling leaves
Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold
I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold
Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon I'll hear
Old winter's song
But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
Start to fall
How many days I'm gon' wait
How long I'm gon' wait before you say we gon' date
When you gon' take debate
'cause if you don't take it I bet another girl will
Drop that lame nigga
Come and get with somethin' real, I'll
Pressure points get touched when I walk by
And I ain't interested in what that nigga talkin bout
So let's not talk bout him
Wassup with us
And wassup with you getting on that Nappy Boy bus, trust
Me won't a damn thing go wrong
I'm too right and tonight we listenin' to slow songs
Them other hoes gone
I did away with 'em
Call that nigga
Tell him you don't think you gon' stay with 'em
Just tell him what it is
Tell him you found a new nigga with a bunch of 

[? ]
And a black card
And I side girl
Now give me the phone 

[ring ring] (hello)
Yea, boy that's my girl

[Chorus:]
I know that you want me
And you know I want you too
So baby stop trippin
And let's get missin'
You say you with your homegirl
Baby you can bring her too
It don't make a difference
You f***in with a pimpin
(Ay, that's what it is baby)

[Verse 1: Nathan]
Dear God, it's me again
I am so far from where I could have been
Dear God, I would be incomplete
But you came and touched my life in time of need
So I'm thanking you for all you've done
And for sacrificing your only son

[Chorus]
That's why I'm writing this letter
To let you know that I love you
Thank you for all that I am and for being a friend
Lord my love for you never ends

[Verse 2: Shawn]
Dear God It's Shawn this time
I'm so grateful for the way you change my life
I'd give all I had
I'd just throw it all away for a chance
To walk with you through Heaven's gates
That's why I'm thanking you for your love and your grace
I don't deserve these blessings, no no, that you give to me

[Chorus]
That's why I'm writing this letter
To let you know that I love you
Thank you for all that I am and for being a friend
Lord my love for you'll never end

[Interlude: Mike]
Dear God, as a humble man I come to you
Like a child, needing your knowledge
Your love and your guidance
Thank you for trusting me with my own life's decisions God
But I'm just a man
And I don't deserve this incredible life that you've given me
I love you Lord, I love you

[Bridge: Wanya]
Dear God, it's me Wanya
I'm so sorry, so sorry for living for me
But I promise from this day on I'm living for you
Cause without you my life means nothing

[Chorus]
That's why I'm writing this letter
To let you know that I love you
Thank you for all that I am and for being a friend
Lord my love for you never ends
That's why I'm writing this letter
To let you know that I love you
Thank you for all that I am and for being a friend
Lord my love for you never ends
We kiss in a shadow, we hide from the moon
Our meetings are few and over too soon
We speak in a whisper, afraid to be heard
When people are near, we speak not a word

Alone in our secret, together we sigh
For one smiling day to be free
To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky
Behold and believe what you see
Behold how my lover loves me

Alone in our secret, together we sigh
For one smiling day to be free
To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky
Behold and believe what you see
Behold how my lover loves me
Seven years of hard luck, comin' down on me
From the Florida border, yes up to Nashville, Tennessee
I worked in every joint you can name, mister every honkytonk
Along come Mr Yankee Slicker, sayin' maybe you're what I want

Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for M C A

9000 dollars, that's all we could win
But we smiled at the Yankee Slicker with a big old southern grin
They're gonna take me out to California, gonna make me a superstar
Just pay me all of my money and mister maybe you won't get a scar

Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for M C A

Suckers took my money, since I was seventeen
If it ain't no pencil pusher, it got to be a honkytonk queen
But I'll sign my contract baby, I wan't you people to know
That every penny that I make, I'm gonna see where my money goes
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for M C A
Well I was a red man
I was proud, I was strong
You were the white man
And you stole away my home

Now I am a wooden Indian
Painted dreams inside my head
Times THE WAY you bring me down
Make ME wish THAT I was dead

Na na na na nana.....

Ay, I was a red man
In my passing made no sound
You were the white man
And you drove me in the ground

Now I am a wooden Indian
Standing silent in the rain
Swear BY my grandfather's father
We're GONNA rise again
Na na na

Ay, I was a red man
I was proud, I was strong
You were the white man
And you stole away my home

Now I am a wooden Indian
Standing silent in the rain
Swear BY my grandfather's father
We're gonna rise again
We set the same scene
Circumstances different than they
Might have been
People in two places can be
Pulled into a scheme
Never what you're fighting for

Life alone
Lose a lover's arms
Never makes it easy when you try too hard
I wish you would define what you feel
Hard on or letting go

I'm the Omega Man
Stand tall and understand
Everybody needs a plan
Mine is a better way
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
I'm an over-eager man
Find me a better way
Find me a better way
We share the same pain
Underneath the covers I will set you free
I will prove to you my love is
Older than the sky
Stronger than the night is long

Lord of hearts
Leader of us all
Let it be together if we rise or fall
Or is it just my imagination
Or the light of a precious stone
(You'll never be alone)

I'm the Omega Man
I travel over land
Everybody needs a plan
Find me a better way
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
I'm an over-eager man
Find me a better way
Find me a better way

Here at the scene of the crime
Laid in your arms I will die
I know it's more than infatuation
That's keeping this man alive
I'm the Omega Man
Stand tall and understand
Everybody needs a plan
Mine is a better way
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
I'm an over-eager man
Find me a better way
Find me a better way
I'm the Omega Man
I travel over land
Everybody needs a plan
Find me a better way
There'll be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
I'm an over-eager man
Find me a better way
Find me a better way
Six silver strings, baby
Are all tied to me
I'm not the man, darling
That I'm supposed to be

I can't see you when I want you, baby
I have to see you when I can

Six silver strings
That are holding me
Six silver strings
Just will not set me free

I still can't see you when I want you, baby
See you when I want you, darling
I have to see you when I can

I'm calling on you, baby
Have a little mercy on me
Baby, please have a little pity on me
Hold your string
And I'll do anything for you, baby
Six silver strings
Make me your perfect man

I still can't see you when I want you, baby
See you when I want you, darling
I have to see you when I can

Hold your string
And I'll do anything for you, baby
Six silver strings
Make me your perfect man

And I still can't see you when I want you, baby
See you when I want you, darling
I have to see you when I can

(Six silver strings)
Baby, that's all I have
(Six silver strings)
Baby, are holding me
(Six silver strings)

Boyz II Men
The chef prepares a special menu
For your delight oh my
Tonight you fly so high up
In the vanilla sky

Your life is fine
It's sweet and sour
Unbearable or great
You gotta love every hour
You must appreciate

This is your time
This is your day
You've got it all
Don't blow it away

Melted tin beads cast your fortune
In a glass of wine
Snail or fish
Balloon or dolphin
See your silver shine
This is your time
This is your day
You've got it all
Don't blow it away
The Earth is our mother just turning around
With her trees in the forest and roots underground
Our father above us who's sigh is the wind
Paint us a rainbow without any end

As the river runs freely the mountain does rise
Let me touch with my fingers and see with my eyes
In the hearts of the children of pure love still grows
Like a bright star in heaven that lights our way home
Like the flower that shattered the stone

Sparrows find freedom beholding the sun
In the infinite beauty we're all joined in one
I reach out before me and look to the sky
Then I hear someone whisper it's something pass by

As the river runs freely the mountain does rise
Let me touch with my fingers and see with my eyes
In the hearts of the children of pure love still grows
Like a bright star in heaven that lights our way home
Like the flower that shattered the stone
Oh yeah!

Got a pocket full of memories and my song
Got to keep on movin' and rollin' on
When I'm playin' for keeps, I always win
Don't know where I'm going, but I know where I've been
Yeah!

Looking back when I was a boy
A hand-me-down bike was my toy
A barefoot brother who gave me hell
I learned from the best who taught me well

I hear that highway callin'

Oh, feel the breeze
I've been around playin' and gamblin' but Lord I'm free
Saddle up baby, ride up close to me
An open highway's all I'll ever need
Last of a dyin' breed
Last of a dyin' breed
One horse towns and one night stands
Just like my daddy, I'm a travelin' man
I'm not the kind to settle down
The roar of the engine, I love that sound

I hear that highway callin'!

Oh, feel the breeze
I've been around playin' and gamblin' but Lord I'm free
Saddle up baby, ride up close to me
An open highway's all I'll ever need
Last of a dyin' breed

Last of a dyin' breed

Oh, feel the breeze
I've been around playin' and gamblin' but Lord I'm free
Yeah saddle up baby, ride up close to me
An open highway's all I'll ever need
Yeah a wide open highway's all I'll ever need
Last of a dyin' breed
Last of a dyin' breed
Oh yeah
Last of a dyin' breed
Like moonlight looks on a country side, like a rose that's silvered with dew
Like sunlight looks on a meadow, love looks so well on you
Like children look on a carousel, all the joys they feel shining through
Like picnics look on a Sunday, love looks so well on you
It's bright as the starlight in your eyes, with stardust in your hair
And oh, that expression on your face, is one you should always wear
Everyday you grow even lovelier, yes, you do, my darling, you do
I love you every day of your life, cause love looks so well on you
No one looked as I walked by
Just an invitation would have been just fine
Said, "No" to him again and again
First he took my heart then he ran

No, no one knows how I feel
Or what I mean unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
You know first he took my hand, he said, "Take me"

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
Well, it's alright, it's alright
To be standin' in a line
Standin' in a line
To be standin' in a line
I would

Do not turn away my friend, well, like a willow, well, I can bend
No man, say call my name, no man came
Well, so I walked on down the line away from you
Well, maybe my attention was more than I could do
Well, one man said he would not fall
But he asked me for too much, he said, "Well, take it all"

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
Well, it's alright, it's alright
To be standin' in a line
Standin' in a line
To be standin' in a line
I will

Well, so I walked on down the line away from you
Well, maybe my attention was more than I could do
Well, one man said he would not fall
But he asked me for too much, he said, "Take me"

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
Well, it's alright, it's alright
To be standin' in a line
Standin' in a line
To be standing in a line
I will
Well, I feel I need a little sympathy
Well, I feel I need a little sympathy
Well, I feel I need a little sympathy, baby

Well, you could be standin' in a line
Stand back
Well, you could be standin' in a line
Stand back
Well, you could be standin' in a line
Stand back

Why don't you take me home?
He says, "Why don't you just take me home?"
Stand back
Why don't you take me home?

Well, you could be standin' in a line
Stand back
Well, you could be standin' in a line
Stand back

Well, you could be standin' in a line
Stand back
Well, you could be standin' in a line
Stand back
Standin' in a

[Intro]
We got all night, baby
Yeah, I'ma take my time with you
Now, listen
You know how daddy like it
I'm here to see you, momma
Just let me do me, all right?

[Verse 1]
Maybe it's the pressure of knowing that I'm watching you perform
Or maybe you're not used to someone who knows exactly what you want
I know the fire's burning, but baby, there's no need to be alarmed
And you can be the rain that's falling, girl, and I'll be the thunderstorm
You got no need to be nervous
Because you are safe in my hands
I'm sure you'll be needing my service
Baby your wish will be my command

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'ma touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body
If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry
This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is
If you let me lay you down

[Chorus]
I promise you ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
Girl, not until you let me lay you down in here

[Verse 2]
When you're cold, I wanna be the one that keeps you warm
I'll make your body come to me, pull you back when you try to run, baby
Baby, I'll go deeper, open up if you're ready for me to feed you
Yeah, tell me who you are (let me taste it, can I take it?)
It's going down right here

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'ma touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body
If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry
This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is
If you let me lay you down

[Chorus]
I promise you ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
Girl, not until you let me lay you down in here

[Bridge]
All that I want
Is to squeeze you, touch you, kiss you, baby
And I'll provide you with that
Special kind of loving
You ain't gon' want nothing but me
You ain't going nowhere
I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down

[Chorus]
I promise you ain't going nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going
No, you won't be sorry
You ain't going nowhere
Girl, not until you let me lay you down in here
Well i go get broke down, before i bust down
Gotta get in without a broken heart well
Get a hoe down before a low down
Before my guilt is acid hot
Well every single morning
I can't take it no more
Well if you with a heartache
Go down baby
She don't care about that us apart
Well she gonna have 'em, but she won't invite me
But i can't come in with a broken heart
I hold down, can't come down
Is comin' in without a broken heart
Well you cheated, showed her down
But i don't come around
O when she'll take ya tear us apart
Donna, pretty as U can be (So pretty)
Oh pretty Donna, when will U ever see (When will U ever see?)
That U belong 2 another man?
And I believe he'll try 2 keep U anyway he can
Donna, I guess it's not meant 2 be

Donna, pretty as U can be
Donna, when will U ever see (When will U ever see? 

[x2])
That U belong 2 another man?
And I think he will try 2 keep U anyway he can
Donna, I guess it's not meant 2 ..
Donna, I guess it's not meant 2 ..
Donna, I guess it's not meant 2 be

Donna

Last time

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Little child , I have found
If I stood up and looked around
I'd see a brand new face staring right back at me
I believe, I am sure
That I'm taller then I was before
Building a brand new bridge into sincerity
But it's the times like this, we must learn to grow

[Chorus: Robin Gibb]
Throw a penny for my children, they are going down
When the light shines down much brighter, many souls are found
And can't believe what they're saying in the overground
Throw a penny for my children going down

[Bridge: Robin Gibb]
Listen to the wise man as he breathes
He's really loving me (loving me)
He must be loving me (loving me)
At night I turn my face into the wind
And I whisper secretly, what means the most to me
And bring him close

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
Make it bad, make it good
Make it easy to be understood
I see a velvet day breaking across the sky
I believe, I am sure
I am taller then I was before
Building a brand new bridge
I know I'm gonna try
But it's the times like this, we must find out why

[Chorus: Robin Gibb]
Throw a penny for my children they are going down
When the light shines down much brighter, many souls are found
And I can't believe what they're saying in the overground
Throw a penny for my children going down

[Coda - Fade: Barry Gibb]
Throw a penny for my children, for my children going down
Throw a penny for my children, for my children going down
Throw a penny for my children, for my children going down
Throw a penny for my children, for my children going down
"Lover, lover" of the aquatic slime
"Lover, lover", love, love the plastic mile
Who wants to be into fact
Come and play into the hatch
How much wind? No idea
How long have "we sung the hymn"?
Holding tight, the laughter
"Criminal" inner fever
Hold on tight...
Some... to sleepiness
Who wants to be into fact
"Commitment", kick through the hatch
How much wind? No idea
How long have we "sung the hymn"
Holding tight, the laughter
"Criminal" inner fever
Hold on tight...
Some...to sleepiness
And when I woke up
At the dawn
Had to close my eyes
In my window
Holding tight, the laughter
"Criminal" inner fever
Hold on tight...
Some end up to sleepiness
And when I woke up
At the dawn
Had to close my eyes
In my window
Living passive and in my own trap
Should we say go?
Should we say stay?
Do we stand tall?
Or do we fade away?
Do we keep on?
Or Do we fall down?
I won't say goodbye
I won't say that now

(I'll keep loving you forever
Because I swore I would
You know my word is good) 

[x2]

Love you
(Forever and ever love you) 

[x8]

Should we say go?

Should we say stay?
Do we stand tall?
Or do we fade away?
Do we keep on?
Or Do we fall down?
I won't say goodbye
I won't say that now
(I'll keep loving you forever
Because I swore I would
You know my word is good) 

[x3]

Love
Full moon and empty arms
The moon is there for us to share
But where are you?
A night like this could weave a memory
And every kiss could start a dream for two

Full moon and empty arms
Tonight I'll use the magic moon to wish upon
And next full moon
If my one wish comes true
My empty arms will be filled with you

[Verse 1:]
Too many storms have passed your way
And you're all washed out cause it rained on your parade
Seems nobody cares about you anyway
Now you're living your life like a castaway
Searched for strength inside was it all in vain
Cause the deeper you dig you find more and more pain
Don't let your tomorrow be like yesterday
Cause I spoke to God, I called out your name
And on your behalf, I just asked if He would be there for you
I want you to

[Chorus:]
Be blessed, don't live life in distress
Just let go, let God
He'll work it out for you
I pray that your soul will be blessed
Forever in his rest
'Cause you deserve his best no less

[Verse 2:]
Enter a place where you never have to cry
Never have to live a lie, never have to wonder why
Never want for nothing you're always satisfied
In the peace that his arms will provide
He will erase any guilt or shame, any bad habits you've got
You won't wanna do em again, Yes we all can change, I can testify
See I spoke to God, I called out your name
And on your behalf, I just asked, If he would be there for you
I want you to

[Chorus:]
Be blessed, don't live life in distress
Just let go, let God
He'll work it out for you
I pray that your soul will be blessed
Forever in his rest
'Cause you deserve his best no less

[Bridge:]
My prayer for you today, Is that you trust and always obey
On his name keep calling
He'll keep you from falling
He'll supply the answers
Yes He will, if you stand in faith
And trust Him to make a way out of no way

[Chorus:]
Be blessed, don't live life in distress
Just let go, let God
He'll work it out for you
I pray that your soul will be blessed
Forever in his rest
'Cause you deserve his best no less

Be blessed from the bottom of your feet
To the crown of your head
Your life be blessed
Your family be blessed
Your finances be blessed
Everything about you
Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a place not far away
She's a little pilot in my mind
Singing songs of love to pass the time

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
I never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyone

A man can never dream these kind of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyone
In the morning, when the moon is at its rest
You will see me at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows play on sunlight
Pools of water iced from cold nights
In the morning
'Tis the morning of my life

In the daytime I will meet you as before
You will find me waiting by the ocean floor
Building castles in the shifting sands
In a world that no one understands
In the morning
'Tis the morning of my life
'Tis the morning of my life

In the morning of my life
The minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day

In the evening I will fly you to the moon
To the top right hand corner of
The ceiling in my room
Where we'll stay until the sun shines
Another day to swing on clothes lines
May I be yawning
'Tis the morning of my life
'Tis the morning of my life
In the morning
In the morning
In the morning

[Verse 1]
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there

[Chorus]
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there

[Chorus]
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

[Outro]
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Once upon a time in the land of fever, there lived a scarlet pussy
This kitty cat of fine descent, was cherished by her mother
Who wouldn't let another, pet her, unless he was qualified

Every first of the month this pretty feline got the hots
And that's when the neighborhood (D-d-dogs)
They'd line up around the block
Meow

When my little scarlet feline roars
The locals come around (Come Around)
When they see the scarlet light
They know it's time to come chase her down (Chase her down)

Lo and behold the fantastical way
In which their bodies groove
My scarlet pussy's furry magic alters any mood

Scarlet Pussy (It's cool)
Scarlet Pussy
Pussycat, pussycat
Wherefore art thou, puppy?
She can make you crazy if you're too close to her heat
She can make you sad when you're happy as can be
She can make you shoot your ego all over her sheets
All is hers in love and war, my little scarlet pussy

Every dog would try his lines
To get pussy's attention ((...))
All they want is so exposed
In ways too gross to mention (Eew!)

Green virgin teenager
A filthy rich yuppie
Pussycat pussycat
Wherefore art thou puppy?
Scarlet Pussy

She can make you crazy if U're too close to her heat
She can make you sad when U're happy as can be
She can make you shoot your ego all over your sheets
All is hers in love and war, my little scarlet pussy

Meow
Now what's going on?
Oh, no, man, look out!
Somebody come get this meow-meow of my leg!
MEOW!
Scarlet Pussy

Pussycat pussycat
Wherefore art thou, puppy?
Meow

She can make you crazy if U're too close to her heat
She can make you sad when U're happy as can be
She can make you shoot your ego all over her sheets
All is hers in love and war, my little scarlet pussy

All is hers in love and war, my little scarlet pussy

She can make you happy, she can make U sad
She can make you crazy (Crazy)
She can make you shiver from your head down to your feet
She can make you shoot your ego all over her sheets (Oh!)

She can make you crazy if U're too close to her heat
She can make you sad when U're happy as can be
She can make you shoot your ego all over her sheets
All is hers in love and war, my little scarlet pussy
Uh uh oh ahhhhhhh radio killa
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love

You said you changed, but still nothing
You're still the same, I'm just a part time lover

And I'm the blame, should've went away
But yet I stayed, with a part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out on the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

I left the state, changed everything
No more 818, for the part time lover

What goes around, comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone

Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)

Watch me walk it out
Walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up out the house
Walk it out watch me walk it out
Walk it out walk this right up out the house
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
(Cool man. What? Can we do 'Blue Moon Of Kentucky?'

What?)

Well blue moon
(No?

Yeah, it's got the chords that was opening

Here right!)

Well blue moon

(Just a short version.)

Blue moon, blue moon
Keep on shining bright
Blue moon, keep on shining bright
My baby back tonight
Blue moon, keep on shining bright
I said blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well blue moon of Kentucky
Just keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

Well, it was on one moonlight night
With the stars shining bright
Wish blown high
Love said goodbye

Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

(Ha ha ha!)
Finding her there in my doorway, I bid her
Come in and sit down here beside my bare wall
Alright then for a while and even a smile
'Neath her dark eyes did slip 'cross a cheek to her lip

But try to be brief for I'm here on relief
I've but moments to stay and my time I must watch
Alright then for a moment just tell me your name
And let me look into your young proud eyes

My eyes are but your sins
My glory your wine
My visions, your footsteps
Dear boy and I fled
All across this barren land
Elder voices tell
Stories of a desert ghost
The legend of a man
Swallowed by the sand

High upon the red dunes
A prophet in the wind...
A vision like a mirage
Rises from a man
Swallowed by the sand

Fading...
Into the shadows
Of the legend
You became

Fading...
Into the mystery
And the romance
Of your fame
(Conversation between 'Scary' Gary Davis and Neil Young)

Gary: "So the Kingdom of Heaven is a new kingdom and in order to get familiar with the king you have to live the life. So when you get in tune with the words of the kingdom, the you get to understan what the words are."
Neil: "So you're sdaying that all of a sudden it could just happen to me?"
Gary: "Well... Relativity Invitation."
Neil: "Relative to the invitation?"
Gary: "Relativity Invitation."
Neil: "Relativity Invitation."
Gary: "What strikes you when I say that?"
Neil: "Relativity Invitation... I dunno it just sounds like poor words to me."
Gary: "well, if you get dominoes and you stand em up all, one after the other and you push one, they'll all fall down in like a relative way
Neil: "Yeah?"
Gary: "So humans all in contact with one and another, thoughts come and go..."
Neil: "Yeah?"
Gary: "So... all things are related, see one though spoken by another person may inspire a thought in another person, so relativity invitation."
Neil: "Yeah I can dig that, but what does that have to do with Jesus?"
Gary: "Well Jesus is life, the way and the truth, it's like..."
Neil: "Is he the only life?"
Gary: "For me he is."
The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing
But I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember a worst December
Just you watch those icicles fall
What do I care if those icicles fall
I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat, off with my glove
Who needs an overcoat I'm burning with love

My heart's on fire and the fire gets higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm
Yes, I want to write a letter
But I don't know just where to begin
Yes, I want to write a letter, people
But I don't know just where to begin
Well, I tell you, it's a sin, people
The way I've been treated by my so called friends

Yes, if I got a dollar
They want to borrow half a buck
Whoa, and if I want to gamble
They wanna jinx me and give me bad luck
So, I tell you it's a sin, people
The way I've been treated by my so called friends

Yes, they say friends
They're the greatest thing in the world
Yes, they say close, close friends
They're the greatest thing in the world
But I think that's all wrong people
Because my best friend have taken my girl
Hey, kids, just gather around
For Biz’s beat of the day, I’m-a teach you some sounds

Okay, here’s Biz’s beat of the day

[Beatboxing]

Okay, kids, one more time

[Beatboxing]

Now, practice this at home, and I’ll see y’all next time

Bye-bye!
Little surfer, little one
Made my heart come all undone
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl

I have watched you on the shore
Standing by the ocean's roar
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, surfer girl

We could ride the surf together
While our love would grow
In my Woody I would take you everywhere I go

So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true
Do you love me, do you, surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl

Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Sometimes in our lives, we all have pain, we all have sorrow
But if we are wise, we know that there's always tomorrow
Lean on me, when you're not strong and I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on, for it won't be long 'til I'm gonna need somebody
To lean on
Please swallow your pride, if have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill those needs that you won't let show

You just call on me brother when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me when you're not strong, and I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on, for it won't be long 'til I'm gonna' need
Somebody to lean on

You just call on me brother if you need a friend
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on
If there is a load you have to bear that you can't carry
I'm right up the road, I'll share your load if you just call me

Call me (if you need a friend)
Call me
Just like a young boy
Running down the road
I'm singing out
The same old song
Can't go back
The way I started from
The road goes on and on
Won't you help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Take my way on home
Help me make my way on home
After Berlin
Lights are shining
In the German sky
Cosmic walls
Between the moon and I
Don't know where I started from
So won't you take me, take me
Take me, take me
Take me, take me
Take me, take me
Just the way I am
Ah, take me, just the way I am
After Berlin
All day cruising
Down the corridor
Seeing things
I never seen before
Tomorrow morning in old Berlin
Where they lock you out
Or lock you in
Won't you save me, save me
Save me, save me
Save me, save me
Save me, save me
From the final day
Save me from the final day
After Berlin
Just like a young boy
Running down the road
I'm singing out
The same old song
I can't go back
The way I used to go
The road goes on and on
Won't you help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Find my way back home
Won't you help me
Make my way on home
After Berlin
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Verse1:
So many sleepless days and sleepless nights
I spend alone
Wondering if I'll make it
Make it on my own
Without someone to hold me
With that holding power
If not for a lifetime at least for an hour
But this machine that clicks inside my head
All so cold
I'm hanging by a string
Never let it go

Chorus:
How my heartbreaks
How the tears roll
It's you I'm thinking of
But don't let the sun come down on our love
Love ooh

Verse2:
Sometimes I think I'm falling
And no one is concerned
I'm headed down that pathway
The point of no return
Now if I had your love
Your sweetness always
Always to guide me safely through
I'm absolutely lost
When I'm without you

Chorus:
How my heartbreaks
How the tears roll
It's you I'm thinking of
But don't let the sun come down on our love
Love ooh

Bridge:
So many sleepless days and sleepless nights
You know I spend alone
Alone
Girl I'm left with no one
No one to call my own
But this machine that clicks inside my head
All ooh so cold out here
I'm hanging by a string
Never letting go
How my worlds turned around
Almost to the ground
It's you I'm thinking of
But don't let the sun come down on our love
Oooh

[Verse 1]
It's not that easy bein' green
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves
When I think it could be nicer bein' red or yellow or gold
Or something much more colourful like that

[Verse 2]
It's not easy bein' green
It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things
And people tend to pass you over 'cause you're
Not standin' out like flashy sparkles on the water
Or stars in the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
But green is the colour of spring
And green can be cool and friendly-like

[Chorus]
And green can be big like an ocean
Or important like a mountain
Or tall like a tree
When green is all there is to be
It could make you wonder why
But why wonder, why wonder?
I am green and it'll do fine
It's beautiful
And I think it's what I want to be

[Chorus]
And green can be big like an ocean
Or important like a mountain
Or tall like a tree
When green is all there is to be
It could make you wonder why
But why wonder, why wonder?
I am green and it'll do fine
It's beautiful
And I think it's what I want to be
Everybody here? Yeah

Girl you got me falling in love
Turn around, whoa

[Verse 1]
Hey, look, no crying, though she has one foot out the door
I should be crying, it ought to hurt a little more
I should resent her
Try to prevent her
Whatever for?

[Verse 2]
Hey, look, I knew it
She's not the type to hang around
Some day she was bound to go
With that fact in mind, my tears were never apropos

[Verse 3]
Hey, look, no sorrow, I have been luckier than most
And if tomorrow I still feel haunted by her ghost
I will remember how I loved her and how it was
Who needs crying? With those memories in tow
Me, I'm flying, I got memories to show

[Outro]
Hey, look, no crying
Just "Goodbye", I'm letting go
I went down to the local bar
To buy my daddy a big cigar
When I got home he was dead
Somebody shot him in the head

Oh dear daddy
You're not gonna see me grieve
'Cause you brought out the worst in me

(Spoken:)
Yep! It's all true
It's true. It makes me cry

When the funeral was through
I had myself a barbecue
Daddy's bones they sure taste good
I couldn't have stopped; if only I could

[or: I'd have killed him myself; if only I could]

Oh dear daddy
You're not gonna see me sad
'Cause everything you did was bad

[Verse 1: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
Yes, it pains me to say you're gone
But I guess it's for the best done
Everything I did was wrong
Now there's tears in all my songs
But I love you and you know it's true (it's true)
Even though I couldn't keep my cool
And it's killing me to face each day (each day)
Dear God, help me, I pray

[Chorus: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
(Trippin') I be trippin'
(Trippin') thinking of you
(Trippin') can't stop trippin'
(Thinking of you, thinking of me)

[Verse 2: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
Haven't heard from you in so long (so long)
Wonder how she is getting on
Is he treating you better than me?
Yes, I'm happy, but I feel empty
'Cause you know that I love you bad (so bad)
All the things he got, I had
But what makes me feel so sad (so sad)
You had the child we always planned

[Chorus: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
(Trippin') I be trippin'
(Trippin') thinking of you
(Trippin') can't stop trippin'
(Thinking of you, thinking of me)
(Trippin') I be trippin'
(Trippin') when I'm thinking of you
(Trippin') always trippin'
(Thinking of you, thinking of me)

[Bridge: singers]
I'll be trippin', I'll be trippin', I'll be trippin'
I'll be trippin', I'll be trippin', I'll be trippin'

[Chorus: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
(Trippin') I'm just crying on my own
(Trippin') Mark is sitting all alone
(Trippin') yes I'm crying, baby
Mark is trippin', lady, oh, oh
(Thinking of you, thinking of me)
(Trippin') I'm just crying on my own
(Trippin') Mark is sitting all alone
(Trippin') yes I'm crying, baby
Mark is dying, lady
(Thinking of you, thinking of me)
Listen, break it down... ha ha

[Outro: Mark Morrison & (singers)]
(Trippin') ohhhhhhhh
(Trippin') ooh ohhhhhhhhh
(Trippin') ooh ohhhhhhhhh
(Thinking of you, thinking of me)
Ooh ohhhhhhhhh
Yeah, yeah... c'mon
(Trippin') ohhhhhhhh
(Trippin') ooh ohhhhhhhhh
(Trippin') ooh ohhhhhhhhh
(Thinking of you, thinking of me)
Ooh ohhhhhhhhh
(Trippin') it's all because of, because of you
(Trippin') I'm feeling sad and blue
(Trippin') 'cause you went away
'Cause you went away, 'cause you went away
(Thinking of you, thinking of me) listen

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

[Verse 1]
I am a dog outside your door
I have been there since a quarter to four
U are a cat looking intense
I bite your leg in self-defense

[Refrain]
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh!

[Verse 2]
Get out my tree grinnin' at me
Licking your tail like it's cream
Strokin' your whiskers, causing a scene
That's not the way to me (the way to me)

[Refrain]
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh!

[Chorus]
And the doggies say to the kitty:
"La, la, la, he, he, hee
I want you, you want me
Oh, how sexy it will be
If we ever get together in my tree"

[Refrain]
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh!

[Verse 3]
Hey little pussy, you sure look sweet
Knockin' me off of my four feet
Sure do wish dogs could climb (I wish, I wish)
Then we could have a funky good time

[Refrain]
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Say it again! Oh, oh, oh, oh!

[Verse 4]
Why you wink at me? I don't really see
Nasty little cat up, up in a tree
Is it really worth the one night of fun?
You've got nine lives, I've only got one!

[Refrain]
Say it! Oh, oh, oh, oh!

[Chorus]
And the doggies say to the kitty:
"La, la, la, he, he, hee
I want you, you want me
Oh, how sexy it will be
If we ever get together in my tree"

[Outro]
I'm picking up your scent
You...
You must be wet

[Verse 1]
People say my mind's all filled with things that you can't see me now
Why are you on my mind all day long? I can't think straight no more
Everyone is sayin' I'm mad because you're the only girl that I've ever had
I love you but you don't wanna know me but I think you're great and I wanna see

[Chorus]
I wanna see you
Smiling to my face
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
You and me are through I know but you're on my mind all day long
Guessin' me and you are going crazy because I can't see you

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
All I've said inside right now, I can't think to think and I can't go by
Everyone is saying to me, "Forget that girl, don't misery"
I've just one more thing to say before my mind's all set and I wanna stay
I'm of things and you don't know what you're doing to my mind, you're on inside

I want a love I can see
That's the only kind that means a thing to me
Don't want a love you have to tell me about
That kind of a loving I can sure do without
(I can sure do without)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want a love I can feel
That only kind of a loving I think is real
Don't wanna be quoted by something I heard now
Cause baby actions speak louder than words
(ah, louder than words)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh huh

Don't you know I want a love

Don't tell me that you

It was a paradise for lizards when young Brigham saw it first
He said "I've seen some nasty deserts, lord, but this one here's the worst"
Then the lord called down to Brigham, said "I got a great idea --
I want a mighty city and I think I want it here"
Salt Lake City that town of righteousness and fame
Salt Lake City don't sound like much but hell, what's in a name
Nobody ever sings about it But lord I be goin' there just the same
Salt Lake City where it's so easy keepin' straight
Salt Lake City just really makes Des Moines look second-rate
Ain't makin' no big deal about it
But I hear the Mormon girls are really great
Salt Lake City hey dig that Tabernacle choir
Salt Lake City yea they be bound to take you higher
There just ain't no two ways about it
Yes lord, they really light fire
Well, Brigham kicked a prairie dog and muttered in his beard
Said "you've put me through some changes, lord, but this one's really weird
The lord just laughed at Brigham, said "you'd better get to work --
The next time I check in here, I want paradise on earth
Salt Lake City where Brigham made the desert bloom
Salt Lake City put a color TV in every room
And they got them crazy Mormon chicks
Yes I'll be goin' there real soon
Salt Lake City hey feel that magic in the air ...
It isn't by chance I happen to be
A boulevardier, the toast of Paris
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke
I walk in a room, a party or ball
"Come sit over here" somebody will call
"A drink for M'sieur, a drink for us all!
But how many times I stop and recall

Ah, the apple trees
Blossoms in the breeze
That we walked among
Lying in the hay
Games we used to play
While the rounds were sung
Only yesterday, when the world was young

Wherever I go they mention my name
And that in itself, is some sort of fame
"Come by for a drink, we're having a game,"
Wherever I go I'm glad that I came
The talk is quite gay, the company fine
There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine
And beautiful girls and some of them mine
But often my eyes see a diff'rent shine
Ah, the apple trees
Sunlit memories
Where the hammock swung
On our backs we'd lie
Looking at the sky
Till the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young

Ah, the apple trees
Blossoms in the breeze
That we walked among
Lying in the hay
Games we used to play
While the rounds were sung
Only yesterday, when the world was young

While sitting around, we often recall
The laugh of the year, the night of them all
The blonde who was so attractive that year
Some opening night that made us all cheer
Remember that time we all got so tight
And Jacques and Antoine got into a fight
The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light
I laugh with the rest, it's all very bright
He was born in the Bitterroot Valley in the early morning rain
Wild geese over the water headin north and home again
Bringin a warm wind from the south, bringin the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing

Oh Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
He never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way

His mother's brother took him in to family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand

Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
On the eve of his 21st birthday, he set out on his own
He was 30 years and runnin' when he found his way back home
Ridin' a storm across the mountains and an aching in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start

Now he never told a story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer, some say, he was a John
There was somethin' in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
And there was somethin' in the country that he said he couldn't leave

Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

Now some say, he was crazy and they're glad that he is gone
But some of us miss him and well try to carry on
Giving a voice to the forest, giving a voice to the dawn
Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on

Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Chorus
I'm afraid of Scarlet because
I'm fallin' in love
And I am not ready to die
Scarlet fever is killing me

She's a sophisticated lady
It's that easy to explain
Her name is Scarlet
But I'm not sure about who we are yet

And I find it very hard to fight
I mean this woman seems to do every single thing so right
International woman, she has seen a time or two
Knock knock, who is it? Oh Scarlet how nice of you to visit

She's an interesting character in a movie about me
Me and Scarlet and Scarlet fever, which one should I call it

And things that I have not said she hears
Then she just does something to me and then disappears
Chorus x2
I'm afraid of Scarlet because
I'm fallin' in love
And I am not ready to die
Scarlet fever is killing me

Such a special love
Feels like fire every time I touch her
It's Scarlet fever, and I'm not ashamed to say that I need her
It's the sweetest sickness that I have ever known
I think I love her, I just hope that I don't cry because of her

And I noticed that every time she came
It's amazing how she never ever looks the same
And I know you know, I know you do
Because you are just too good to be true

Chorus x2
I'm afraid of Scarlet because
I'm fallin' in love
And I am not ready to die
Scarlet fever is killing me

Refrain x2
I said I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna go
All I really know is that I just don't know
It's fever, oh lord, it's Scarlet fever
Hey, everybody, let's have some fun
You only live but once
And when you're dead you're done, so
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll

Don't sit there mumblin', talkin' trash
If you wanna have a ball
You gotta go out and spend some cash, and
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll

Hey Mr. Landlord, lock up all the doors
When the police comes around
Just tell 'em that the joint is closed
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll
Hey tell everybody
Mr. King's in town
I got a dollar and a quarter
Just rarin' to clown
But don't let nobody play me cheap
I got fifty cents more that I'm gonna keep, so

Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll

No matter whether rainy weather
Birds of a feather gotta stick together
So get yourself under control
Go out and get together and let the good times roll

[Verse 1]
I went so numb on Christmas day
I couldn't feel my hands or feet
I shouldn't have come, she made me pay
For gleaming with Donald down her street

[Chorus 1]
She put blame on him and shame on me
She made it all seem so tawdry and cheap
Oh, let's be nice, Mama, open up your gifts
You know, happiness is the best facelift

[Verse 2]
I mean, after all, she introduced us
Oh, but she regrets that now
Shacked up downtown, making love without a license
Same old sacred cow

[Chorus 2]
She said, "did you come home to disgrace us?"
I said, "why is this joy not allowed?"
For God's sakes, I'm middle-aged, Mama, and time moves swift
And you know happiness is the best facelift

[Verse 3]
Oh, love takes so much courage
Love takes so much shit
He said "you've seen too many movies, Joni"
She said "snap out of it"

[Chorus 3]
Oh, the cold winds blew at our room with a view
All helpful and hopeful and candlelit
We kissed the angels and the moon eclipsed
You know happiness is the best facelift

[Verse 4]
We pushed the bed up to the window
To see the Christmas lights
On the east bank across the steaming river
Between the bridges lit up Paris-like

[Chorus 4]
This river has run through both our lives
Between these banks of our continuing delights
Bless us, don't let us lose the drift
You know happiness is the best facelift
At the stroke of midnight
On that great big holiday
We're going to have a ball, and that ain't all
I'm gonna chase my blues away

I'll be bringin' in a brand new year
Bringin' in a brand new year
So listen dear, won't you meet me here
While I'm bringin' in a brand new year

Gonna be a great big parade
I got my resolution made
Gonna ride above the stars
We might even take a trip to mars

I'll be bringin' in a brand new year
Bringin' in a brand new year
So listen dear, won't you meet me here
While I'm bringin' in a brand new year

Oh sailin' down on a rainbow
I'll flirt with lady moon
If she sighs or winks her eye
I won't be back 'til June
I'll be bringin' in a brand new year
Bringin' in a brand new year
So listen dear, won't you meet me here
While I'm bringin' in a brand new year
There goes that song again, we use to call our serenade
We fell in love when we heard it played
Over and over and over, over again
I still remember when
I sang the words and they made you mine
I'd steal a kiss and repeat each line

Over and over and over, over and then
We drifted apart, you walked off with my heart
It's funny how one listens, just starts me reminiscing
I'd soon forget that yen, I told myself
When you said, "so long", but I was wrong
There goes that song again

[Verse 1]
When Charlie speaks of Lester, you know someone great has gone
The sweetest swinging music man had a Porkie Pig hat on
A bright star in a dark age
When the bandstands had a thousand ways
Of refusing a black man admission
Black musician in those days they put him in an
Underdog position, cellars and chitlins

[Verse 2]
When Lester took him a wife, arm and arm went black and white
And some saw red and drove them from their hotel bed
Love is never easy, it's short of the hope we have for happiness
Bright and sweet, love is never easy street
Now we are black and white
Embracing out in the lunatic New York night
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town
Or be hung in a tree, that's unlikely

[Verse 3]
Tonight these crowds are happy and loud
Children are up dancing in the streets
In the sticky middle of the night
Summer serenade of taxi horns and fun arcades
Where right or wrong under neon
Every feeling goes on for you and me
The sidewalk is a history book and a circus
Dangerous clowns balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions
They have been handed day by day, generations on down

[Verse 4]
We came up from the subway on the music midnight makes
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone in taxi horns and brakes
Now Charlie's down in Mexico with the healers
So the sidewalk leads us with music to two little dancers
Dancing outside a black bar, there's a sign up on the awning
It says "Pork Pie Hat Bar" and there's black babies dancing tonight

[Verse 1]
There's a young girl lost
On the edge of town
Don't see no future, it's blind
Don't give up
When you're upside down
You just keep it inside...

[Verse 2]
You know we all cry...
When we're alone
Someone like you
And the promise that we won't be

[Chorus]
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
Never you and I
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
We can never stop
Giving up the ghost

[Verse 3]
Don't be a hero
In the name of love
Don't leave me waiting in line
No ties that bind
No ball and chain
The ghost is waiting outside

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm searching so high
I'm searching low
Someone like you
And the promise that we won't be

[Chorus]
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
Never you and I
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
We can never stop
Giving up the ghost

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You know we all cry
When we are alone
Someone like you
We know, oh
I'm searching so high
I'm searching low
Someone like you
We know oh, oh, oh
Wahh

[Keyboard Solo]

[Outro]
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
Never you and I
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
Never you and I
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
With you, baby I'm satisfied, making my love to you
'cause you got me hypnotized
And you came to me alone girl
I was a heart that's made of stone girl
And you broke it down in pieces
And you took me for your own girl
I lie beneath your ecstasy
You can pour it all over me
I won't break the chains of loving you
We got ev'rything, anybody needs
And it's here with me, with you
Baby I'm satisfied, makin' my love to you
(makin' my love, makin' my love)
'cause you got me hypnotized
Before you took me by the hand girl
I was a statue in the sand girl
I was broken down for reasons
You could never understand girl
I was living on desire
But that was just the way we were
Till you make a world of love in you
We got everything, anybody needs
And it's here with me, with you
Baby I'm satisfied, making my love to you
'cause you got me hypnotized
Anytime you wander, get yourself back to me girl
Any cloud you're under, you got to get yourself free girl
Ahh, ahh, baby with you
Baby I'm satisfied, making' my love to you
'cause you got me hypnotized, oh baby, with you
Baby I'm satisfied, making' my love to you
'cause you got me hypnotized, oh baby, with you
See the sunlight through the pine
Taste the warm of winter wine
Dream of softly falling snow
Winter's gold
Aspenglow

As the winter days unfold
Hearts grow warmer with the cold
Peace of mind is all you know
Winter's gold
Aspenglow

Aspen is a life to live
See how much there is to give
See how strongly you believe
See how much you may receive

Smiling faces all around
Laughter is the only sound
Memories that can't grow old
Winter's gold
Aspenglow
Aspen is a life to live
See how much there is to give
See how strongly you believe
See how much you may receive

See the sunlight through the pine
Taste the warm of winter wine
Dream of softly falling snow
Winter's gold
Aspenglow
Winter's gold
Aspenglow
That old master painter from the faraway hills painted the violets and the daffodills
He put the purple in the twilight haze, then did a rainbow for the rainy days
Dreamed up the murals on the blue summer skies, painted the devil in my darlin's eyes
Captured the dreamer with a thousand thrills
The old master painter from the faraway hills
Then came his masterpiece and when he was through
He smiled down from heaven and he gave me you
What a beautiful job on that wonderful day
That old master painter from the hills far away
(repeat) Dreamed up etc
If you wanna know what time it is, you don't have to ask
If you wanna know what something is, you don't have to ask
If you wanna know whats real or not, you don't have to ask
If you wanna know what time is now, you don't have to ask
You don't have to ask, you already know

If you wanna leave just close your eyes, you don't have to ask
If you wanna go and lose your mind, you don't have to ask
If it's peace that you're looking for
You got the key to every door, you already know

If there's a way out you'll find out and free all and be all beyond
You never wonder what sky you been under that made you forget all this time

If you're looking for it, you don't have to ask
You can see it plain as day, you don't have to ask
If you try to find us true, just take a look at you, you don't have to ask
Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
And everybody tells me
That I'm not the same

I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to
I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to
'Cause since I met you baby
All I need you is you

Since I met you baby
I'm a happy man
Since I met you baby
I'm a happy man
I'm gonna try to please you
In every way I can
Since I met you baby
I'm a happy man
Since I met you baby
I'm a happy man
For since I met you baby
All I need is you
All I need is you
I went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
Down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
I said I'm beggin' for mercy won't you take me
If you please

I went down to the crossroads
Tried to beg a ride
I went down to the crossroads
Tried to beg a ride
Nobody seemed to know me
Everybody passed me by
Take a ride

Going down toward Rosedale
Took Loretta by my side
Going down to Rosedale
Took Loretta by my side
Can still buy a house there
On the riverside
One more time
You can run, you can run
Tell all my friends I'll be by
You can run, you can run
Tell my friends I'll be by
And I'll be stayin' in the crossroads
I believe I'm sinkin' down
Sometimes you win, sometimes
Sometimes the blues get a hold of you
Oh, yes when you thought you had made it, Ahh, Yeah
All around the block, people talk a lot
But I'm gonna give it give all I've got
Oh, you know I -- I just won't go wasted!

Talkin' about that sweet season on my mind
It sure does appeal to me
I know we can get there easily
Just like a sailboat
Sailin on' sailin' on sailin on the sea
Ahh Yeah, Mercy now!

Some times you win, sometimes you lose
And most of the time you choose between the truth
Oh wonderin, wonderin' if you had made it -- Ahh, Yeah!

But I'll some kids, and make my plans
And I'll watch the seasons run away
And I will realize somewhere
In the open country
I'm talkin' bout that
Sweet season on my mind

It sure does appeal to me
I know we can get there easily
Just like a sailboat sailin on' sailin' on
Sailin' on the sea, now, Yeah, Alright

Talkin' bout that sweet season
Talkin' bout that sweet, sweet season, now (Sweet, Sweet Season)
Talkin' bout that sweet, Ahh sweet, Ahh sweet season (Sweet, Sweet Season)
Talkin' bout that sweet, Ahh sweet season, now (Sweet, Sweet Season)

Strummin' my pain with his fingers
Singin' my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song telling my whole life
With his words killing me softly with his song
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
And listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes
Strummin' my pain with his fingers
Singin' my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song telling my whole life
With his words killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on
Strummin' my pain with his fingers
(One time, one time)
Singin' my life with his words
(Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song telling my whole life
With his words killing me softly with his song
I said whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, la, la, la, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohla, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Strummin' my pain with his fingers
(Yes he was)
Singin' my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song telling my whole life
With his words killing me softly with his song

[Verse 1]
First you say that you want me
Make me quiver with desire
Acting like, you needed me, had my body on fire
But every minute was a night of show
Nothing really matters anymore
Am I dreaming? Is this a mirage?
I never played this game before, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me you'd love me forever
I guess I just wasn't clever
Enough to realize the look in you eyes
That you're wearing a disguise

[Chorus]
With your false faces
I just can't get with that (False Faces)
Strange places
Why you wanna take me there> (False Faces)

[Verse 2]
I tried so hard to get close to you
To tell you what's on my mind
I reach out my hand for you
But you were gone every time
I never played this game before
It's like a schizophrenic magic show, yeah
Am I dreaming? Is this a mirage?
I never played this game before, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me you'd love me forever
I guess I just wasn't clever
Enough to realize the look in you eyes
That you're wearing a disguise
Acting like a chameleon, changing right before my eyes
You say one thing but mean another
Tell me what you're trying to hide under your

[Chorus]
False faces
I just can't get with that (False Faces)
Strange places
Why you wanna take me there? (False Faces)
(False faces)
I just can't get with that (False Faces)
Strange places
I don't want to go there no more (False faces)
False faces (I'm talkin' 'bout) (False faces)
I just can't get with that (False Faces)
Strange places
Why you wanna take me there? (False Faces)

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me you'd love me forever
I guess I just wasn't clever
Enough to realize the look in you eyes
That you're wearing a disguise
Acting like a chameleon, changing right before my eyes
You say one thing but mean another
Tell me what you're trying to hide under your

[Outro]
False faces
I just can't get with that (False Faces)
Strange places
Why you wanna take me there? (False Faces)
(False faces)
I just can't get with that (False Faces)
Strange places
Why you wanna take me there? (False Faces)
See here's the thing

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're actin' like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me?
Hmm, that sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burgulary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
I'm quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

[Verse]
Now here's another bar, I'm coming for the slow gunners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your mom and 'em
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to "Did He Really Just Say That Shit?"
Yep
I'll take a mile if you let me
6-5, 200 plus and so sexy
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been tryin' to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

[Verse]
Good god girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidote's under my tongue
Whoa

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no
We have to take our clothes off
(So sexy)
We have to party all night
It's alright
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no no no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie rock chicks, and hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Damn
In a quaint caravan there's a lady they call the Gypsy
She can look at the future and drive away all your fears
Everything will come right if you only believe the Gypsy
She could tell at a glance that my heart was so full of tears

She looked at my hand and told me
My lover was always true
And yet in my heart I knew dear
Somebody else was kissing you

But I'll go there again 'cause I want to believe the Gypsy
That my lover is true and will come back to me someday

She looked at my hand and told me
My lover was always true
And yet in my heart I knew dear
Somebody else was kissing you

But I'll go there again 'cause I want to believe the Gypsy
That my lover is true and will come back to me someday

[Verse 1]
There is strength deep inside me that I never knew I had
There's a fire within burnin' bright
There is a love inside of me that I never thought I'd feel
Until the day you came into my life, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was you that were there when no one else was
And you showed me a love unknown, ooh

[Chorus]
You kept the fire burnin'
You kept hope alive
And when my soul was fallin'
You helped me to survive
And you led the way
Encouraged me to take that leap of faith

[Verse 2]
There's a dream that I dream, I never knew it would come true
There's a place I never thought that I would be (ooh)
There is a chance (There's a chance) that I took
(That I took) that I never thought I'd take
Until you came and helped me to believe, oh, oh...

[Pre-Chorus]
You were there when no one else was
And you showed me a love unknown

[Chorus]
You kept the fire burnin'
And you kept hope alive
And when my soul was fallin'
You helped me to survive
And you led the way
Encouraged me to take that leap of faith
(Of faith, of faith, of faith, of faith, ooh)
Leap of faith
Oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

[Bridge]
You showed me just how
(How to believe in me) in me, oh...
You moved that tree and saw that forest there for me

[Chorus]
You kept the fire burnin' (You kept it burnin')
You kept hope alive (You kept hope alive)
And when my soul was fallin' (My soul was fallin')
You helped me to survive (Yeah, you helped me to survive)
You led the way
Encouraged me to take the leap of faith, yeah
You kept the fire burnin' (Woo)
You kept hope alive (You kept the hope alive, yeah)
And when my soul was fallin' (My soul was fallin')
You helped me to survive (But you helped me to survive)
You led the way
Encouraging me to take...

The fire (everybody), hope (all my life)
My soul (someone's callin') with you (I'll survive)
You led (the away), encouraged me (to take)
That leap of faith and make it over
Now I owe my thanks to you, ho, oh

You kept the fire burnin' (woo, hey)
You kept hope alive (You kept hope alive)
When my soul was fallin' (When my soul was fallin')
You helped me to survive (ooh...you helped me to survive)
Oh yes, you did
Pushing me to take that leap of faith

You kept the fire burnin'
You kept hope alive
And when my soul was fallin'
You helped me to survive
Oh...
Cane standing in the fields getting old and red
Lot of misery in Georgetown, three men lying dead
And Joshua, head of the government, say strike for better pay
Cane cutters are striking, Joshua gone away
Joshua gone Barbados, just like he don't know
People on this Island, they got nowhere to go

(??) in the city, you can hear how the women bawl
Joshua gone Barbados, he don't care at all

Sonny Child the overseer, I swear he's an ignorant man
Walking through the canefield, pistol in his hand
(??)
(??) strike be all in vain
Joshua gone Barbados, just like he don't know
People on the St. Vincent, they got no place to go
Goin' down the road feelin' bad
Goin' down the road feelin' bad
Goin' down the road feelin' bad
I don't want to be treated this away

Goin' where the climate suits my clothes
Goin' where the climate suits my clothes
Goin' where the climate suits my clothes
I don't want to be treated this away

Goin' down the road feelin' bad
Goin' down the road feelin' bad
Goin' down the road feelin' bad
I don't want to be treated this away

Goin' where the water tastes like wine
Goin' where the water tastes like wine
Goin' where the water tastes like wine
I don't want to be treated this away

Goin' down the road feelin' bad
Goin' down the road feelin' bad
Goin' down the road feelin' bad
I don't want to be treated this away
Goin' where the chilly winds don't blow
Goin' where the chilly winds don't blow
Goin' where those chilly winds don't blow
I don't want to be treated this away
As I was walkin' 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air
From the other direction, she was calling my eye
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try, might as well try

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
I knew without askin' she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls

In the heat of the evening when the dealing got rough
Was too pat to open and too cool to bluff
I picked up my matches, was closing the door
Had one of those flashes I'd been there before, been there before

Well, I ain't often right but I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way it does in this song
Once in a while you can get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

There ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
I had to learn the hard way, to let her pass by, let her pass by

[Instrumental break]

Wind in the willow's playin' "Tea for Two"
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing in the heart of gold band, heart of gold band

[Instrumental break with background harmonizing]
Grrrrrrrr...

Yoooooooo
Y'all don't know what I've been goin through
Y'all don't know what I'm about to do, to you
Cause you're lookin without seein
Yoooooooo
Y'all don't know how hard I'm gonna fight
Y'all don't know if I am wrong or right
Or what I might do tonight
Cause you're lookin without seein
Yoooooooo (hell naw!)
Y'all don't know if I'ma change this time (I'ma change!)
Y'all don't know about the frame of mind (the frame of mind!)
That I just might BE IN!
You're lookin without seein (seein)

Might as well be blind
As I, walk along and stumble
Trains rumble in my head
As I breathe along and grumble
I think about you instead
And a piece of the pecan pie
And you, that's all I want
Just a piece of pecan pie
And all I want is you
Sometimes I get so hungry
I think about pie all day
Just a little whipped cream
And honey, I'm on my way
And a piece of the pecan pie
And you, that's all I want
Just a piece of pecan pie
And all I want is you
Now don't you call me Key Lime
You're the apple of my eye
And don't you know I'll be fine
Whenever you're by my side
And a piece of the pecan pie
And you, that's all I want
Just a piece of pecan pie
And all I want is you
This is just a little samba
Built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow
But the root is still that note
This new one is just the consequence
Of the one we've just been through
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you

There's so many people who can talk and talk and talk
And just say nothing oh nearly nothing
I have used up all the scale I know
That in the end it's come to nothing
Oh nearly nothing

So I come back to that first note
As I must come back to you
I will pour into that one note
All the love I have for you
Anyone who wants the whole show
Ré Mi Fa Sol La Si Do
He will find himself with no show
Better play the note you know

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody wants to know
Where you're goin' to, what you're runnin' from
What you're goin' through, where you're comin' from
What you're goin' through, where you're comin' from
Everybody, everybody wants to know
What you're gonna do, where you're goin' to
'Cause they wanna come, where I'm showin' you
Yes, they wanna come, where I'm showin' you

[Post-Chorus]
All that you can be is a spectacle
Following after every single miracle
Watch them marvel at all the joy you have
But they're too important to have all the joy you have
What a tragedy, you can laugh at me (You can laugh at me)
You can laugh at me (You can laugh at me)
But I'm in love
Yes, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Don't you wish you had real love?
Yes, I'm in love

[Verse 1]
Tryna fix myself for society
Tryna mix myself for society
But can you tell me, where is love in anxiety?
Can you tell me, where is love in anxiety?
What you say to me, I don't mind at all
What you say to me, I don't really care at all
'Cause I'm in love

[Refrain]
Don't you wish you had real love?
I know you do
Yes, I'm in love

[Verse 2]
Watch them speculate on the life you live
Watch them try to hate all the love you give
All the love you give

[Verse 3]
Everybody, everybody wants to know
Where you're goin' to, 'cause they wanna come
Or so they think until they find the cost of it
'Til they find out, find out what you lost for it
And I'd do it all again
'Cause I found love
'Cause I found love

[Refrain]
Don't you wish you had real love?
I know you do
Yes, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody wants to know
Where you're goin' to, what you're runnin' from
What you're goin' through, where you're comin' from
What you're goin' through, where you're comin' from
Everybody, everybody wants to know
What you're gonna do, where you're goin' to (Where you're goin' to)
'Cause they wanna come (Wanna come), where I'm showin' you (Showin' you)
Yes, they wanna come, where I'm showin' you (Showin' you)

[Post-Chorus]
All that you can be is a spectacle
Following after every single miracle (Miracle)
Watch them marvel at (Marvel at) all the joy you have (Joy you have)
But they're too important to have all the joy you have (To have all)
What a tragedy (Tragedy), you can laugh at me (You can laugh at me)
You can laugh at me (You can laugh at me)
But I'm in love
Yes, I'm in love

[Refrain]
Don't you wish you had real love?
I know you do
Yes, I'm in love

[Verse 4]
So what you say to me, I don't even mind at all (What you say to me)
What you say to me, I don't even care at all (What you say to me, I don't even care)
'Cause I'm in love

[Refrain]
Don't you wish you had real love?
I know you do
Don't you wish you had real love?
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh

[Bridge]
These broken thoughts are in my mind
Can't let 'em get down in there
Can't let 'em get down in there
These broken thoughts are in my mind
Can't let 'em get down in there
Can't let 'em get down in there
'Cause I need real love (Guard)
(Guarding)
I need real love (Guarding)

[Outro]
I'm guarding, guarding the gates, ayy
(The gates)
(Guard, guarding)
Oh, I'm guarding my gates
Slipped into the fountains of my emptiness
I let teardrops fall, I let them go
Stepped into the canyons of my loneliness
And I went about as far as I could go

Even as I searched for you, I knew
Even if I found you you'd be so cold
Even when I found you now baby I knew
That I'd gone about as far as I could go

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
I can still hear you saying
That if you don't love me now
You won't love me again

I don't mean to beg
But I don't know what else to say
If you meant what you said
You'd have been here yesterday
I won't watch you go
I won't even try
There you go down the road
But don't look to me to say goodbye
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
And if you don't love me now
You won't love me again
You won't love me again

Why don't you love me?
I'm down on my knees
Begging you to please...
Baby don't leave me
Baby don't leave me
Baby please
Baby please
Baby don't leave me
Baby don't leave me
Baby don't leave me
In A Far Away Land, a song written by Luo Bin Wang, is sung, by John, in 1994 Australia concert. The visual footage is availabele on the John Denver "VIDEOKE" available only in Japan. Audio is available on Calypso Collection of The John Denver Collection, 1997 release by LaserLight Digital

This song is a tradition Chinese folk song, written by Luo Bin Wang, who spent over the last 40+ years of his life studying the songs and lifestyles of the peoples in the Qing Hai area of China, an area that is similar to PrairieLands and GrassLands, where the Zhang people live a nomadic life, raising such livestock as goats and sheep

Luo Bin Wang is considered the King of Chinese Folk/Country songs. He wrote over 100 songs. He has helped to preserve and to promote a very special part of China's social culture, and is regarded highly in China. Luo Bin Wang died in the late 1980's, but his music still lives, today

There appear to be many more stanzas to this song, although John only sings one. In addition, the song seems to be well-known to the Chinese people, and, John's rendition appears to be somewhat humorous

Courtesy extended to Rick Li Bao, for helping me with John's singing of this song, and for the historical perspective. If we have not done this song its due justice, please email us with any helpful modifications. Thanks

There is a nice, pretty girl, in a far away land
When people pass by her tent, they always stop and take a double-glimpse
I wish I can be a young lamb, running towards you, until I am by your side
I wish her narrow quirt always whips me gently
I wish I can be a young lamb, running towards you, until I am by your side
I wish her narrow quirt always whips me gently
I wish I can be a young lamb, running towards you, until I am by your side
I wish her narrow quirt always whips me gently

在那遥远的地方
有位好姑娘
人们走过她的帐房
都要回头留恋地张望
她那粉红的笑脸
好像红太阳
她那活泼动人的眼睛
好像晚上明媚的月亮

我愿抛弃了财产
跟她去牧羊
每天看著那粉红的笑脸
和那美丽金边的衣裳

我愿做一只小羊
跟在她身旁
我愿她拿著细细的皮鞭
不断轻轻打在我身上
Had the landlord at my door
I heard him saying
Tomorrow no more
Pay me now or leave
But we didn't have anything to give...(ah can you feel me)

Searching for restoration...(and we need restoration)
Make the church my family
This is my story
This is my song
And I can sing it all night long...I tell you why because

The ghetto is a part of my religion...(the only thing my eyes can see)
The only thing my eyes can see...(and I tell you there ain't no man)
There ain't no man gonna stop the vision...(I'm a part of the ghetto)
The ghetto is a part of me

Children cry no more...(children cry no more)
Because heaven is upon you
Please put down your guns
And we shall overcome
Thought your load may be heavy
Know that the weight makes you strong
Take my life for example
While I sing my song
Mr. Kelly help me sing this song...

The ghetto is a part of my religion...(the only thing my eyes can see)
The only thing my eyes can see...(and I tell you there ain't no man)
There ain't no man gonna stop the vision...(I'm a part of the ghetto)
The ghetto is a part of me

The ghetto is a part of my religion...(the only thing my eyes can see)
The only thing my eyes can see...(and I tell you there ain't no man)
There ain't no man gonna stop the vision...(I'm a part of the ghetto)
The ghetto is a part of me

La la la la la lala la...
La la la la la lala la...
La la la la la lala la...
The ghetto is a part of me
The ghetto is a part of my religion
O Come All Ye Faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

[Verse 1]
Hard bodies, soft emotions, so fast, so smart
The world is at your feet, but what about your heart?
Fame and fortune can't hold you tight
In the late, late hours of the night

[Chorus]
How do you stop before it's too late?
You choose and you lose if you hesitate
How do you stop before it's too late?
You think love will wait, so you don't hold on and then it's gone
How do you stop?

[Verse 2]
You've had success, lots of fancy friends
You've tasted the good life, you thought it would never end
One day you're too young, then you're in your prime
Then you're looking back at the hands of time

[Chorus]
How do you stop before it's too late?
You choose and you lose if you hesitate
How do you stop before it's too late?
You think love will wait, so you don't hold on and then it's gone
How do you stop?

[Bridge]
How do you stop a runaway train?
How do you stop the driving rain?
How do you stop the ripening corn?
How do you stop a baby being born?

[Chorus]
How do you stop before it's too late?
You choose and you lose if you hesitate
How do you stop before it's too late?
How do you stop, you're lost if you hesitate

[Outro]
How do you stop love from slipping away?
How do you stop before it's too late?
I got a spine
So I can move around
It's so supple
It gets me really high
It stretches
Keeping me well, alive
I got a spine
So I can modulate
Also enables me to concentrate
A spinal column: a flexible tool
It is harmless but very powerful
I got a spine
So I can move around
I got a spine
Keeping me oh so subtle(?)

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I got a spine
So I can move around
It's so supple
It gets me really high
It stretches
Keeping me well, alive
I got a spine
So I can move around
I got a spine
Keeping me oh so subtle(?)
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1]
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?
Did you know
That your baby boy has come to make you new?
And this child that you've delivered
Will soon deliver you

[Verse 2]
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand?
Did you know
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God
Oh, Mary, did you know?
Mary, did you know?

[Bridge]
The blind will see
The deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the lamb

[Outro]
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy is Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know
That your baby boy would one day rule the nations?
Did you know
That your baby boy is Heaven's perfect lamb?
And this sleeping child you're holding
Is the great I am, ooh
When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown

And we could be together baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown

And we could be together baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer
Summer

When I met you in the summer

Summer
I almost closed the door
Cancelled on everything we opened up for
Tonight the shadows had their say
Their sad notions of the way things really are

Damn these blues, they'd turn my heart against you
Since I was fool enough to find romance
I'm trying to convince myself
This is just a dance

We move in measures through love's changing faces
Needy and nonchalant, greedy and gracious
Through petty dismissals and grand embraces
Like it was only a dance

We are survivors, some get broken, some get mended
Some can't surrender, they're too well defended
Some get lucky, some are blessed and some pretend
This is only a dance

We're dancing fools, you and me
Tonight it's a dance of insecurity
It's my solo while you're away
Shadows have the saddest thing to say
Love, we can't live without it
Why do we go out and get it just to turn around and doubt it?
Like we're scared to care, it's hard to talk about it
Aw, it's only a dance

Tonight the shadows had their say
There's a sucker born a day, I heard them say
Born to lose
Am I a sucker to love you?

You're such a sweet love, you're a proud man, you're a treasure
Time passes gracefully, living can be such a pleasure
You make it easy to take it in measures
Like it was only a dance

We're dancing fools, you and me
Tonight it's a dance of insecurity
It's my solo, blue way
And shadows have the saddest things to say

We are survivors, some get broken, some get mended
Some can't surrender, they're too well defended
Some get lucky, some are blessed and some pretend
It's only a dance
Yeeaah, Right 

[x5]

[Chorus:]
I dont know why (I dont know why)
She keeps on passin' me by
Maybe her eye is on just some other guy
And I'll forever be that fella on the side
She passes me by

[Verse:]
As I hopped off the train this shawty caught my eye
I asked her for her name she gave me no reply
She left me standing there with arrows in my heart
But yet and still I'm wanting her
And later on that week while driving in my car
I coulda sworn I saw that shawty walking down the road
I thought she passed at me while I was staring from afar
Or is just my young mind wishing

[Chorus:]
I dont know why (I dont know why)
She keeps on passin' me by
Maybe her eye is on just some other guy
And I'll forever be that fella on the side
She passes me by

[Hook:]
Come back come back come back come back
Come back
(Come back come back come back come back)
I said come back baby
(Come back come back come back come back) 

[x2]
I want you here by me (Come back come back come back come back) 

[x3]

[Verse:]
It gets so confusing this game
I met alot of girls but never felt this way
I get strange pleasure though from going through this pain
And like a ghost I'm haunting her
I often fantasize about walking hand in hand
But I don't know her name or if she's got a man
And the only thing that gives me hope to stay
Is maybe one day she'll notice me

[Chorus:]
I dont know why (I dont know why)
She keeps on passin' me by, (She keeps on passin' me by,)
Maybe her eye is on just some other guy
And I'll forever be that fella on the side, (but I dont wana be on the side)

(Come back come back come back come back)
Why won't you come back (Come back come back come back come back)
I know you want to (Come back come back come back come back)
(Come back come back come back come back)
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on

Look up, look up and seek your maker
Before Gabriel blows his horn

Weary totin' such a load
Trudgin' down the lonesome road

Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before, before you travel on

True love, true love, what have I done
That you should treat me so?
You caused me to walk and talk
Like I never did before

Weary totin' such a load
Trudgin' down that lonesome road

Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on

Look up, look up and seek your maker
Before Mr. Gabriel blows his horn

I'm weary of totin' such a heavy load
Trudgin' down that lonesome road

Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before, before you travel on

Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on

Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you decide to travel on
Look down, look down, look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
I don't want you
But I hate to lose you
You've got me in between
The devil and the deep blue sea

I forgive you
'Cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between
The devil and the deep blue sea

I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more

I should hate you
But I guess I love you
You've got me in between
The devil and the deep blue sea
Beats on repeat beating on me
From every car in the street
There's a constant repeat on repeat
Of your paranoid, heartbreaking beats

On repeat

It's a five song repeat beating on me
With your favourite band that helps you sleep
And here comes the new stylish creep
From every car in the street

On repeat
On repeat

Don't tell nobody what would you really want because
They can tell everybody else what you really want, then you're fucked
So act like it's for yourself or it's all yours and they go and
Tell everybody else that you're really great, we are just people

You're enfranchised and entranced
You're enfranchised and entrenched
But know that it's yours
Real life's a compromise
But your beats half-assed streak is beating on me
Well, my drunken week is helping me sleep

I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would line the streets and come to every show, no one wants that
I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would flee the schools and come to every show, drugged and unwashed
I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would line the streets, come to every show, unwashed and drugged and

Beats on repeat beating on me
On your radio, on your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio

Beats on repeat beating on me
Beats on repeat beating on me
Light the lamp and fire mellow
Cabin essence timely hello
Welcomes the time for a change

Lost and found, you still remain there
You'll find a meadow filled with grain there
I'll give you a home on the range

Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?

I want to watch you windblown facing
Waves of wheat for your embracing
Folks sing a song of the grange
Nestle in a kiss below there
The constellations ebb and flow there
And witness our home on the range

Who ran the iron horse?
(Truck driving man do what you can)
Who ran the iron horse?
(High-tail your load off the road)
Who ran the iron horse?
(Out of night-life, I'm a gas man)
Who ran the iron horse?
(I don't believe I gotta grief)
Who ran the iron horse?
(I'm out of luck)
Who ran the iron horse?
(With a buck and a booth)
Who ran the iron horse?
(Catchin' on to the truth)
Who ran the iron horse?
(In the vast past, the last gasp)
Who ran the iron horse?
(Land in the dust, trust that you must)
Who ran the iron horse?
(Catch as catch can)

Have you seen the grand coolie workin' on the railroad?
Have you seen the grand coolie workin' on the railroad?
Have you seen the grand coolie workin' on the railroad?
Over and over
The crow cries uncover the cornfield
Over and over
The thresher and hover the wheat field

Over and over
The crow cries uncover the cornfield
Over and over
The thresher and hover the wheat field

Over and over
The crow cries uncover the cornfield
Over and over
The thresher and hover the wheat field
Spiders are singing in the salty breeze
Spiders are filling out tax returns
Spinning out webs of deductions and melodies
On a private beach in Michigan
Why can't they wish their kisses good?
Why do they miss when their kisses should?
Fly like winging birds fighting for The Keys
On a private beach in Michigan
This recent rash of kidsmoke
All these telescopic poems
It's good to be alone
Why can't they say what they want?
Why can't they just say what they mean?
Come clean, listen and talk
Hello, private callers, IDs blocked
The sun will rise, we'll climb into cars
Future has a valley and a shortcut around
Who will wear the crown of drowning award?
Hold a private light on a Michigan shore
Fool me with a kiss of kidsmoke
From a microscopic home
It's good to be alone
I'll be in my bed
You can be the stone
That raises from the dead
Carries us all home
There's no blood on my hands
I just do as I am told
Remember the night
The night you said, "I love you"
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was
May
But soon the Maytime turned to December
You had forgotten, do you remember?

[Intro]

There are deuces, pull my arms
If you don't see me now, there'll be next time
The pack can get around
Go pack when I get home
Next time I see you

International bitches like my names

First they want to rock it this way
Then they want to rock me that way
I say, "Yeah"
I'm gonna be standin' here

You can't rock me
First they want to rock it this way
Then they want to rock me that way
I say "yeah"

[Outro]
If it's not the world
It's the people
And if it's not the people
Then maybe it's you
If it's not you
Then maybe it's me
But if it's not me
Then it's the Music
Many people you know
Might act like doubters
That's why we do this
That's why we do that
Vicki Leekx
Don't know what to do
Someone that I knew
Never strayed from home
When I'd leave her alone
Now I watch the people on the street
Fix myself a drink
Try not to think
Of the someone I knew
One Less Holiday
As time slips away
And all that's left is
One Less Holiday
Lovers depend on moonlight for a love affair
Babies depend on mothers for their tender care
Flowers depend on sunshine, and the morning dew
Each thing depends on something, and I depend on you

I can be happy, I can be sad
I can be good, I can be bad
It all depends on you
I can be lonely out in a crowd
I can be humble, I can be proud
It all depends on you

I can save money, or spend it
Go roght on living, or end it
You're to blama, baby, for what I do
I know that I can be beggar, I can be king
I can be almost any old thing
It all depends on you

Isn't it sweet to know, dear, you can help me on?
Wouldn't it hurt, to know, dear, all my hopes were gone?
Wouldn't it make you proud, dear, if I made a name?
But if I failed to win, dear, would you want all the blame?
Well, you asked me if I'll forget my baby
I guess I will, someday
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
You asked me if I'll get along
I guess I will, someway
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way

God gave me that girl to lean on
Then he put me on my own
Heaven, help me be a man and
Have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way

You asked me if I'll miss her kisses
I guess I will, everyday
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
You asked me if I'll find another
I don't know; I can't say
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way

God gave me that girl to lean on
Then he put me on my own
Heaven, help me be a man and
Have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
I done made up my mind baby
There just got to be a change
Whoah, I made up my mind
Baby, there's just got to be a change
Oh, I think you're cheatin' on me baby
Oh, because you been actin' too strange

When I leave home early in the mornin' you're smilin' baby
And your face is never sad
Oh, when I leave home early in the mornin' mama
Your face is never sad
Yes, but when I have the day off and stay at home
Oh, I do believe it makes you mad

Oh, I know you think you're smart baby
And you think you're puttin' something over on me
Oh, I know you think you're smart baby
And you think you're puttin' something over on me
Oh, but I done got wise to you baby
And I ain't the fool that I used to be
I do not talk, I am just a rapper

Motherfuck a nigga
Hell yeah I do it bigger
I got eight figures like I'm skatin' in the winter
Niggas thought that I was kiddin'
These raps are not my sketches
I'm a sick boy, nigga, when I cough I hope you catch it
My germs in your system, now you coughin' like asthmatic
All of my "I'm tired of it" turns into your "Wish I had it"
I don't need this money, but I spend it like I wanna
She said this dick is hers, I don't wanna take it from her

Your dick stay chilly, it's a cold, rough world
I get superhero pussy, she a PowerPuff Girl
Shit just got real like Pinocchio turds
Yo nigga is Geppetto, I don't want no instrumentals
Leave the vocals on my shit
Like the song givin' me head
And your bitch can't sleep cause she used to my bed
She could have any dick, you just mad she chose-d mine
Schoolin' all you niggas and my mouth will make it Columbine
I am just a rapper, man, I ain't got no clothing line
My clothing line has closed the line and let me shop at closing time
Yo boy got stacks like I'm standin' in a Borders line
Hidin' from you bitches cause real nigga's hard to find
Work this shit like overtime
Yeah, my clothes are so designed
Closet look like Bloomingdales, yo closet look like fashion jail
I break you out, I post for bail
This money make me Olsen twins, you call your bitch, you hearin' this
Uh uh uh
Yes it's necessary to be flier than canaries
Stay fresh to death like a mint cemetery
I do not talk, yeah my life a library
Eat her out and leave her cold, make that hole my Ben & Jerry's
Broke the mold on you bitches, man, I am so unique
You are not a rapper, if you were you'd hardly speak
I am Stone Mountain and I haven't reached my peak
Fuck her like I'm mad at her then I turn the other cheek

This shit is amazing, check me in my sweater, man
Comme des Garçons, bitch, nobody do it better, man
But I do it better, man
When it comes to pussy girls whisper in my ear "No one else can do this to me"
You's a cutie but you gotta know I'm married to my work
And these niggas ain't shit so I guess they must be urine
Gotta gift this bitch, like Christmas, bitch
I'mma act and rap, Will Smith this bitch
When rappers start rappin' over indie shit
Just remember I was first to hit this shit
The difference is I'm different, bitch
How the fuck can these niggas be dickless pricks?
Man, what the fuck you gon' do?
I don't need to talk to you
I am just a rapper too

I am just a rapper too
One love will never die as long as I live
One love will satisfy the stars that I give
One dream that only you inspire
Is the dream I pursue with all my desire
How sweet the way you play upon my heart strings
How strange when you're away, you give my heart wings
And now you're in my arms and I know why
You are and always be my one love

How sweet the way you play upon my heart strings
How strange when you're away, you give my heart wings
And now you're in my arms and I know why
You are and always be my one love

[Chorus]
Loving and kissing and holding you tight
Letting you know everything is all right
Do you love me?
Loving and kissing and holding you tight
Letting you know everything is all right
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

[Verse 1: Shawn]
We belong together
The love I feel is strong
And I wouldn't take the world for exchange
Of this feeling I have inside of me
And I can't lose this
Love that I have in my heart and baby
I know that you will never leave
This is my heart

[Chorus]
Loving and kissing and holding you tight
Letting you know everything is all right
Do you love me?
This is my heart
Loving and kissing and holding you tight
Letting you know everything is all right
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

[Verse 2: Wanya]
Our love keeps us together
Whenever we're apart
Our bond holds us close
We live in each other's hearts
And souls so I'll always feel whole
Somewhere I know I'll find someone
With some love to give
To one whose heart is fragile
But I'm willing to take a chance
This is my heart

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya]
Loving and kissing and holding you tight
Letting you know everything is all right
Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
This is my heart
Loving and kissing and holding you tight
Letting you know everything is all right
Do you love me?

[Bridge: Mike]
My arms are open wide
You can't imagine how I feel inside
Welcome this man, baby
Because I'm giving my heart to you

[Chorus]
Loving and kissing and holding you tight
Letting you know everything is all right
Do you love me?
This is my heart
Loving and kissing and holding you tight
Letting you know everything is all right
Do you love me?
Loving and kissing and holding you tight
Letting you know everything is all right
Do you love me?
14th of February, 1899
The British ship Veronica was lost without a sign
Baa baa black sheep you haven't any wool
Captain Richardson left himself a lonely wife in Hull

Cherub, I lost a ship in the Baltic sea
I'm on an iceberg running free
Sitting, filing this berg to the shape of a ship
Sailing my way back to your lips

One passing ship gave word that
You have moved out of your old flat
You love the Vicar more then words can say
Tell him to pray that I won't melt away
And I'll see your face again

Odessa, how strong am I?
Odessa, how time goes by

Treasure, you know the neighbors that live next door
They haven't got their dog anymore
Freezing, sailing around in the North Atlantic
Can't seem to leave the sea anymore
I just can't understand why you just moved to Finland
You love that Vicar more then words can say
Ask him to pray that I won't melt away
And I'll see your face again

Odessa, how strong am I?
Odessa, how time goes by

14th of February, 1899
The British ship Veronica was lost without a sign
Islands call out to me
Like the highlands that I always see
In my dreams of home
I am never alone when I am there

Islands like so many dreams
Are like canyons but off the main stream
And there's no one there
The dreamer is always alone

And the mighty blue ocean
Keeps rolling on every shore
Like the spirit that binds us together
We are so much more than islands

Islands belong to the sea
Like the dark sands of my memory
When the morning comes
They are stepping stones to the sun

And the mighty blue ocean
Keeps rolling on every shore
Like the spirit that binds us together
We are so much more than islands
Almost exactly a year ago
I came here for the very first time
Looking up at the Spanish window
From a trail on the edge of the timberline
I've been off on a journey to find myself
Maybe find my way back home
Been many an hour all by myself
In the darkest of nights
I was never ever alone

Back in the San Juan Mountains again
On a ride with some good old boys
Telling stories around a campfire
The sound of laughter is the loudest noise
There's something in a night in the wilderness
It's a magical thing to me
Like the sky is just a little bit brighter
And your life is everything that you'd like it to be

There'll be snow on the passes tomorrow
You can feel it in the chill of the wind
Let the rain wash away all my sorrow
Today is the day that my life starts all over again
I guess that it's just about over now
Everything's about to change
Everything's a brand new number, darlin'
Everything's a brand new game
And it's funny I could even call you that
After all the pain we've been through
Ah, but time is the master of healing
Love is the master of everything that we do

There'll be snow on the passes tomorrow
You can feel it in the chill of the wind
Let the rain wash away all my sorrow
Today is the day that my life starts all over again

[Verse 1]
Look what you've done to me
I'm losing my mind
You've got the best of me
And it feels so right
You've got a way with me
It's workin' me out
I can't help my emotions when you're dancin' close to me

[Chorus]
Sexual healing, come and rescue me (Come and rescue me)
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause the way that he moves got a girl wanna do something
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
There's only one of you
'Cause you're the real deal
I'm wearing the ring if you feel the way I feel
I'm trying hard to fight your sexual appeal
I can't help my emotions when you're dancin' close to me

[Chorus]
Sexual healing, come and rescue me (Come and rescue me)
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause the way that he moves got a girl wanna do something
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Sexual healing, come and rescue me
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause the way that he moves got a girl wanna do something
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
She was too good to me
How can I get along now?
So close she stood to me
Everything seems all wrong now
She would have brought me the sun
Making me smile, that was her fun

If I was mean to her
She'd never say go away now
I was a king to her
Who's gonna light my way now?
It's only natural I'm so blue
She was too good to be true

She was too good to me
How can I get along now?
So close she stood to me
Everything seems all wrong now
She would have brought me the sun
Making me smile, that was her fun
If I was mean to her
She'd never say go away now
I was a king to her
Who's gonna light my way now?
It's only natural I'm so blue
She was too good

She was too good to me
She was too good to be true
Some will tell you that you're wrong
Do it all the wrong way
Some will tell you that you're wrong
That you don't know the way

They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Don't let them bother you no
They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Oh no

It's no use sitting down
Don't walk round with a frown
Oh no keep looking
It's no use sitting around
With your head in your hands
Oh no keep looking

Say let my life alone
Some will tell you that you're wrong
Do it all the wrong way
Some will tell you that you're wrong
That you don't know the way

They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Don't let them bother you no
They enjoy cheapness
Don't show your weakness
Oh no

It's no use sitting down
Don't walk round with a frown
Oh no keep looking
It's no use sitting around
With your head in your hands
Oh no keep looking

Is it true, oh oh, are you coming through, or were you just leaving?
Where will I run to? Where would I hide?
If you ever leave me by my side

Goodbye

[Intro]
You should smokes with me

[Chorus]
The chronic's blowing
The chronic's blowing
The chronic's blowing
The chronic's blowing (It blows my mind)

[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]
Blowing chronic to me, it's like a tradition to me
I got the pi-doun, so sit down and listen to me
Don't go against me fool, go wit me
We could blow it all together like Bobby Brown and Whitney
Yeah, we got something in common
They could search a nigga, but they never finding my bomb and
I got the stash, spot, my cash got
Lot of motherfuckas pulling, police shots
I'm not The One nigga you could call me The Two
Bob Marley reincarnated, pupils dialated
Emancipated, concentrated, debated, rated many times
You suprised how I made it, huh?
You hate it, huh, but you know, I ain't even trippin
I'm spliting that Swisha up, plotting on the come up
I'm living my life, and never putting my gun up
Dranking my drink, and I'ma smoke that blunt

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
The greener the tree, the better the bud
The strength of the branch, will tell you how chronic it was
I'm - buzzing high, sliding, slippin
Gotcha listening to Snoop and now you feel like you crippin
It's all to the good, the dash is wood
You got some hoes in ya truck and now ya ready to fuck
But, they frontin and fakin, and time is waistin
She don't wanna give ya number now she hollin at Jason
Now don't get mad, just roll to the pad
And keep a G on the bitch and roll another dub bag
(My nigga) light that shit, hit that bitch
Then past it to ya homie like playa, pimp (blaze that bitch)
And when you get dizzone, crack the do'
And let me get a little snizzle
'Cause ain't no fun, if the homies can't get none
Puff, puff, pass my nigga, one lizza

[Chorus]

[Bridge x2]
Do you wanna smoke wit me (Do you wanna?)
Come and keep me company
Baby come and fuck with me
You should smokes with me

[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg]
It's the diabolical, chronical, mythological
Psychological, make a model hoe, fuck a G
Pre-medical, steady slow those, ready can get it
Teacher taught it to those with mind apparatus
My status has been the baddest ever since I intro'd
I'm that nigga that brought y'all the info
On the Chucks, French braids, and endo
Big Snoop Dogg with the fog on the window
Spell ya name in it, put ya face in it
And hang with the nigga with the gang bang spinach
Drag it, blunt wrap it, or zig-zag it
Don't really matter even if it's in the package
Put it to the side, so when ya boy hit the Eastside
I'm look for the firefied cheefa
Aiyyo Pharrell, gimme that VA discount
I'm tryna bounce wit the whole ounce (smoke me out)

[Chorus]

[Bridge x2]

[Hook]
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Do you think that you could fuck with we (Star Trak)
(Yeah Pharrell this that shit right here)
And BBC - nigga

[Chorus x2] + {*Snoop ad-libs*}

[Outro - Snoop Dogg]
Dranking our drank

Haha, Gangsta Gumpo
Neptunes, Star Trak

Billionaire Boys Club, DPG

She's already working on my brain

But I picked up something I just can't explain

I pick up
Good, good, good, good vibrations, yeah
Good, good, good, good vibrations, yeah
Good, good, good, good vibrations
(Oo-oo-ooh, oo-ooh, oo-oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
Good, good, good, good vibrations, yeah
I, I bet I know what she's like
And I can feel how right she'd be for me
It's weird how she comes in so strong
And I wonder what she's pickin' up for me

I hope it's
Good, good, good, good vibrations, yeah
Good, good, good, good vibrations, yeah

(Chris feat. Bono on All Star Tribute)

Bono: Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying

Chris: Brother, brother, brother
There's too many of you dying
You know you've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here to stay

Bono: Father, father
We don't need to escalate
And war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate

Chris: You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here to stay
Picket lines won't block our way

Bono: Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, and you can see
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong
But who are they to judge us
Together we can be strong
Chris: You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here to stay
Picket lines won't block our way
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
What's going on, What's going on
What's going on, What's going on
What's going on, What's going on
What's going on, What's going on
The light is fading
The cause invading
All the hopes that you were building
On tomorrow
Now you must go

So stretch your wings
As nature sings
Her farewell lullabye to soothe you
Through the changes
When you must go

The gift is knowing
Your strength in going
When the time has gone beyond
Your heart's desire
And you must go
I cried for you, I cried for you
I cried for two, I lied for you

Saved by the bell on your own carousel
Now who can tell, if you'll love that man as well
Now I'll walk down our great lane

I died for you, I died for two
I'll live for you, I'll give to you

Saved by the bell on your own carousel
Now who can tell, if you'll love that man as well

Now I'll walk down our great lane
Now I'll walk down our great lane
Now I'll walk down our great lane
Up on the Blue Ridge mountain, there I'll take my stand
Up on the Blue Ridge mountain, there I'll take my stand
A rifle on my shoulder, six-shooter in my hand
Lord, Lord, I've been all around this world

Lulu, my Lulu, come and open the door
Lulu, my Lulu, come and open the door
Before I have to walk on in with my old forty-four
Lord, I've been all around this world

Mama and papa, little sister makes three (note 1)
Mama and papa, little sister makes three
They're coming in the morning, that's the last you'll see of me
Lord, lord, I've been all around this world

Hang me, oh hang me, so I'll be dead and gone
Hang me, oh hang me, so I'll be dead and gone
I wouldn't mind your hanging boys, but you wait in jail so long (note 2)
Lord, I've been all around this world

Up on the Blue Ridge mountain, there I'll take my stand
Up on the Blue Ridge mountain, there I'll take my stand
A rifle on my shoulder, six-shooter in my hand
Lord, Lord, I've been all around this world
Played by Jerry with the Grateful Dead, and with many of his solo partners, including John Kahn, David Grisman and the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band

(1) Jerry sings this verse on the 1970 Bear's Choice version, but not on later versions

(2) "... but the waiting takes so long" in some versions
Who told you I cared?
Who told you my secret?
A secret I've held in the depth of my heart now for years

Who told you I cared?
Who saw us together?
We met in a dream, in a dream where your vision appeared

Though I know it isn't right
We keep meeting every night
And your kisses make me feel that my dreams are, oh, so real

Who told you I cared?
Who broke the enchantment?
I ask you to tell me who dared, who told you I care?

We're not here to get bored
We are here to disrupt
To disrupt, to disrupt, to disrupt, to disrupt
To have the time of our lives
If you're travelin' the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

If you go when snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

Please see if her hair hangs long
It rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hangin' long
For that's the way I remember her best

I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my of my day

So if you're travelin' the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

[Intro: Richard Street]
Ya-ya, ya-ya-ya, ya-ya

[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards]
When you're on the top
There's no place you can really go but down, down, down
People on the street congratulate you
They say they love the way you sound

[Pre-Chorus: Dennis Edwards, Eddie Kendricks, Richard Street, and (Melvin Franklin)]
Well, when you're on the low
No one wants to chit or chat or even know your name (Oh, yeah)
Your agent's never there
Your manager has ripped you off and gone somewhere
Standing on the top

[Chorus: The Temptations & Rick James]
Standing on the top ... top!
On the top getting down, yeah
Standing on the top (Yeah) ... top!
On the top getting down, Temptations sing!
Standing on the top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Standing on the top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks]
When you're on the top
Everyone you meet, they wanna be your long lost friend
They say how great you are, a superstar
But do you have any money to lend?
(Hey, man, can you loan me a few bucks?)

[Pre-Chorus: David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks and Melvin Franklin]
When you're on the low
Where do all the freaks and fancy people go? (I don't know) I don't know
People sit and stare
Asking crazy questions: "Do you braid your hair?"
(And "What's L-7 Square?")

[Chorus: The Temptations & Rick James]
Standing on the top ... top!
On the top getting down, yeah
Standing on the top ... top!
On the top getting down, ho!

[Break: Rick James]
Yeah, ooh!

[Chorus: The Temptations & Rick James]
Standing on the top ... top!
On the top getting down, yeah
Standing on the top ... top!
On the top getting down, down, down, down

Standing on the top (Sing!)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Well, well, well, well, well, well)
Standing on the top (Well)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

When spring comes around my love
When spring comes around
When winter is gone the hills are green
Song of the lark is clear and clean
I long for the lands I've never seen my love, my love

When summer comes around my love
When summer comes around
As soon as I feel that sudden breeze
I hoist my sail to the seven seas
And let the wind take me where it please my love, my love

When autumn comes around my love
When autumn comes around
As soon as the leaves begin to fall
I'll anchor in some port of call
I'll write a letter sending you all my love, my love

When winter comes around my love
When winter comes around
The world will be white with silent snow
The temperature down to ten below
And home to the warmth of you I go my love, my love
When spring comes again my love
When spring comes again
You and the lams will play again
And though I will want to stay again
You know I'll be on my way again my love, my love
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
I need to laugh and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as I touch the ground
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

With them dark boys on it low key
Blowing that oooh-eee...

Slash perico, chi chi get the yayo mang

This where we from
The bottom dawg
This where you come
When you need it, want it, don't got it, in the drought
Looking for a good price
Hit 95 south

We got it on deck
So show some respect
To the cocaine capital
Dade County bitch!

Let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride

[Verse 2]
Shhh...
Be quiet
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot
I'm cool, I'm quiet
A couple shots will put yo' ass on a diet
This is for them big boys
Doing them big things
In the big Chevy's
With them big rims
Making big noise
With them big speakers
And any time they cook yaye
It's some big beakers
Listen buddy
We off the chain
Now what they do, what it is, what it ain't
Listen buddy
We off the chain
I suggest you hand over them thangs
I got my game from Jose Antonio Armando Perez Torrez
Ese si era mi consorte
And I missed ya dad
But I know you watching me
With you in heaven
I know ain't stopping me
The game is mine now
I'm building clientele
I'm just tryna get paper like Seinfeld
Sign, seal, deliver: It's done
Ready or not, here I come
Dale!

[Chorus]
Shhh...
Be quiet
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot
Shhh...
Be quiet
Keep it cool, you don't wanna start a riot
Let's ride (let's ride)
Let's go (let's go)
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)
Let's ride, let's ride, let's go (let's go)
Let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride (hey, hey)
Now let the beat ride
Shhh...
My daddy told me always be strong son
Don't you ever cry
You find the pretty girls and then you love them
Then you say goodbye
I never dreamed that you would leave me
But now you're gone
I never dreamed that I would miss you
Woman won't you come back home

I never dreamed that you could hurt me
And leave me blue
I've had a thousand, maybe more
But never one like you
I never dreamed I could feel so empty
But now I'm down
I never dreamed that I would beg you
Woman I need you now

It seems to me I took your love for granted
It feels to me that this time I was wrong, so wrong
Oh Lord how I feel so lonely
I say woman won't you come back home
I tried to do what my daddy taught me
But I think he knew
Someday that I would find one woman like you
I never dreamed that it could feel so good, Lord
That two could be one
I never knew about sweet love
So woman won't you come back home
Oh baby won't you come back home
Come on, yeah, uh, yeah, come on, yeah

Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma

Shorty on my lap getting all into it
Knock back shots so we all getting stupid
And I don't dance, so the drinks must of loosened me up
Must of loosened me up

Wall working is what she doing
Make all the chicks feel so damn useless
Yet the DJ's spinning but the whole time she's screaming off
That this her a song

And I'll spend just about anything, I won't lie, to get you home
And don't be scared, just give it here girl I promise
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma

Now we're back stage with Patron-like fluid
Time to get it in and try to outspin with the music
Borderline out her skirt, so I'm ready to
First we start the touching, then we start the kissing

Girl I'ma give you what you're missing
Put it on repeat all night long, tell the DJ
That this her a song

And I'll spend just about anything, I won't lie, to get you home
And don't be scared, just give it here girl I promise

Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her

Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
(So many things I wanna do)
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma hit it like that, can't miss her
Girl I'ma
You told me that we always would go steady
You said your love for me would always be
You're not the same, dear, I'm not to blame, dear
Don't break your promise to me

You vowed that we'd always be together
And we'd keep our love for all the world to see
You're so strange now, please don't you change now
Don't break your promise to me

I remember when I met you
And you said 'twas me you'll always love
Now I'm willing, dear, to bet you
It's not me you're thinking of

Now you once said you could never love another
And there'd never be another one like me
Please don't bring back, don't bring my ring back
Don't break your promise to me

I remember when I met you
And you said 'twas me you'll always love
Now I'm willing, dear, to bet you
It's not me you're thinking of
You once said you could never love another
And there'd never be another one like me
Please don't bring back, don't bring my ring back
Don't break your promise, don't break your promise
Don't break your promise to me

[Intro: Christine McVie]
Tell me lies

[Verse 1]
If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
(Close my, close my, close my eyes)
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
(Tell me, tell me, tell me lies)

[Chorus]
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

[Verse 2]
Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand
There's a reason why
(Close your, close your, close your eyes)
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
(Tell me, tell me, tell me lies)

[Chorus]
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

[Bridge]
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lies
Tell me lies

[Chorus]
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

[Verse 3]
If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
(Close my, close my, close my eyes)
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
(Tell me, tell me, tell me lies)

[Chorus]
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no, you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no, you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no you can't disguise
(You can't disguise)

[Outro/Ad-lib: Stevie Nicks]
Tell me lies
Oh, sweet little lies
Tell me lies
Oh no, well, you can't disguise
Woah-oh
Mmm, tell me lies
Mmm, tell me lies
Mmm, little lies
Come on, children
You're acting like children
Every generation thinks
It's the end of the world
All you fat followers
Get fit fast
Every generation
Thinks it's the last
Thinks it's the end of the world
Yes, dream down a well
There's a lone heavy hell
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
It's a fear we transcend
If we're here at the end
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
You never know
Come on, kids
You're acting like children
Act your age
Put back the black metals and pearls
Oh, all you sword swallowers
Pull yourselves together
Every generation
Thinks it's the worst
Thinks it's the end of the world
It's a secret I can't tell
There's a wish down a well
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
It's a long heavy hell
Super size it by ten
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
You never know
I will never know
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
It's a secret I can't tell
There's a wish down a well
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
It's a fear to transcend
If we're here at the end
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
You never know
Oh, you never know
I been thinking sitting on a pole
I'm getting sick of doing what I'm told
Just me and the mirror and my brain
But that was when I got an idea
Came like a gun and shot in my ear
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?

Fifteen years I lay down on the ground
I couldn't feel any noise or hear any sound
Fifteen million years I spent down the line
But that was when I got an idea
Came like a gun and shot in my ear
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?
Get up and stand alone

That was when I got an idea
Came like a gun and shot in my ear
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?
Get up and stand alone

That's when I got an idea
That's when I got an idea
Writer(s): Frank Loesser

Once in love with Amy, always in love with Amy
Ever and ever fascinated by her, sets your heart afire to stay

Once you're kissed by Amy, tear up your list it's Amy
Ply her with bonbons, poetry, and flowers, moon a million hours away

You might be quite the fickle-hearted rover so carefree and bold
Who loves a girl and later thinks it over and just quits cold

But once in love with Amy, always in love with Amy
Ever and ever sweetly you'll romance her, trouble is the answer will be
That Amy'd rather stay in love with me

(instrumental), always in love with Amy
Ever and ever fascinated by her, sets your heart afire to stay

(instrumental), get rid of your list it's Amy
Ply her with bonbons, poetry, and flowers, moon a million hours away
You might be quite the fickle-hearted rover so carefree and bold
Who loves a girl and later thinks it over and just quits cold

But once in love with Amy, always in love with Amy
Ever and ever sweetly you'll romance her, trouble is the answer will be
That Amy'd rather stay in love with me
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?

Say, it might have been a fiddle
Or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now
I can feel it in my feet now
Listen here it comes again

There's a band out on the highway
They're high-stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

Come on children
Come on children
Come on clap your hands
Sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinning dizzy
Lord the band kept us so busy
We forgot about the time

They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favourite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music plays the band
Lord they're setting us on fire

Crazy rooster crowing midnight
Balls of lightning roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on

Keep on dancing through to daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No one's noticed but the band's all packed and gone
Was it ever here at all?
But they kept on dancing

Come on children
Come on children
Come on clap your hands
Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped
The world is fast becoming younger
The news is all they've ever known
They've seen the wars, the hurt, the hunger
How will they choose when they are grown

What do you tell forever's children
When it's their turn to hurt and heal
Whatever spins a grim tornedo
Can also turn a potters wheel

Take a little clay
Put it on a wheel
Get a little hint
How God must feel

Give a little turn
Listen to a spin
Make it into the shape
You want it in

Tell with your life the bloody story
Teach to they're dreams not burning steel
It's not in bombs where lies the glory
But in what's shattered on the field
The potter's wheel takes love and caring
Skill and patience fast and slow
The works it makes are easily broken
Once they survive the potter's throw

Take a little clay
Put it on a wheel
Get a little hint
How God must feel

Give a little turn
Listen to a spin
Make it into the shape
You want it in

Some day some children will be digging
In some long forgotten ground
And they'll find our civilisation
Or what's left of it to be found

They'll find the weapons of destruction
But buried deeper in the hole
They'll find a message and a promise
In the sand, the potter's bowl

Take a little clay
Put it on a wheel
Get a little hint
How God must feel
Give a little turn
Listen to a spin
Make it into the shape
You want it in

Earth and fire and wind conspire
With human hands, and love, and fire
Once upon most every morning
I woke up to her flying there
Hummingbird was making blows of
Blowing rings of purple in the air

All the while
I was trying to keep her there
Not man enough to need
But man enough to always care
Hummingbird
Hummingbird

That's all I heard
That's my hummingbird

Just because I said I didn't want her
Doesn't mean I want her to go
In fact, I quite depended on her
But that I didn't want her to know
Now that's she's gone I know
All the while
I was trying to keep her there, ya
Not man enough to need
But man enough to always care
Hummingbird
Hummingbird
That song i heard, I heard
That's my Hummingbird
Hummingbird
Hummingbird

Is it too late
Too late, hummingbird?
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to

If you want me to love you, maybe I will
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal
You need love now, just as bad as I do
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to

It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to

It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to

I'm not trying to run your life,I know you wanna do what's right
Give your love now, to whoever you choose
How can you love, with the stuff you use now
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to

It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
By Bob Dylan

Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring
The trucks and the trailers will be winding
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling

From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling

Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling

As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling
It's a-many a friend that follows the bend
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind
Following them fairgrounds a-calling

Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents
Get that canvas flag a-flying
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind
Following them fairgrounds a-calling

Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds
Just behind the posters that are hanging
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face
Following them fairgrounds a-calling

Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind
Hear that old music box a-banging
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling

It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town
Hit the old highway by the morning
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time
Following them fairgrounds a-calling

As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime
Drinking red wine as we're rolling
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn
From following them fairgrounds a-calling
And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em
And the money that we made will pay for the space
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling
From Hollywood and Vine
To the Sunset Strip
There's so much going on
You can lose your grip
From early in the morning
Until late at night
They'll do you so wrong
They'll do you so right

Back in L.A
Waiting for the sun to shine
Back in L.A
Living down a life of crime
Back in L.A
Working on another line
Back in L.A
To pick up the dime
You must do the time

From way up in the canyons
Where the hot winds howl
To the mean city streets
Where the night hawks prowl
I can feel the rhythm play
The whole night long
Guess I'll stay in L.A
And listen to this song

Back in L.A
Waiting for the sun to shine
Back in L.A
Living down a life of crime
Back in L.A
Working on another line
Back in L.A
To pick up the dime
You must do the time

You must do the time
I was a highway man along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive
I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still
I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around, I'll always be around
And around and around and around and around
I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again
And again and again and again and again
Thought I heard a blackbird singin'
Up on Bluebird Hill
Call me a whinin' boy if you will
Born where the sun don't shine
And I don't deny my name
Got no place to go, ain't that a shame?

Thought I heard that KC whistle
Moanin' sweet & low
Thought I heard that KC when she blow
Down where the sun don't shine
Underneath the Kokomo
Whinin' boy -- got no place else to go

So many roads I tell you
So many roads I know
So many roads --
So many roads --
Mountain high, river wide
So many roads to ride
So many roads
So many roads
Thought I heard a jug band playin'
"If you don't -- who else will?"
From over on the far side of the hill
All I know the sun don't shine
The rain refuse to fall
And you don't seem to hear me when I call

Wind inside & the wind outside
Tangled in the window blind
Tell me why you treat me so unkind
Down where the sun don't shine
Lonely and I call your name
No place left to go, ain't that a shame?

So many roads I tell you
New York to San Francisco
All I want is one
To take me home
From the high road to the low
So many roads I know
So many roads - So many roads

From the land of the midnight sun
Where ice blue roses grow
'long those roads of gold and silver snow
Howlin' wide or moanin low
So many roads I know
So many roads to ease my soul
(Let us break bread together on our knees.)
(Let us break bread together on our knees.)
(When I fall on my knees, with my face to the rising sun
(Oh oh Lord, have mercy on me.)
(Let us break bread together on our knees, on our knees.)
(Let us break bread together on our knees, on our knees.)
(When I fall on my knees, with my face to the rising sun,)
(Oh oh Lord, have mercy on me.)
Let us drink wine together on our knees

(When I fall on my knees, with my face to the rising sun,)
(Oh oh Lord, have mercy on me.)
(Let us pray God together on our knees,)
(On our knees, let us pray God together on our knees)
(On my knees, when I fall on my knees with my face to the rising sun

Oh oh Lord, have mercy on me
I make my living off the evening news
Just give me something, something I can use
People love it when you lose, they love dirty laundry

Well, I could've been an actor, but I wound up here
I just have to look good, I don't have to be clear
Come and whisper in my ear, give us dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em all around

We got the bubble-headed bleach-blonde who comes on at five
She can tell you about the plane crash with a gleam in her eye
It's interesting when people die, give us dirty laundry

Can we film the operation? Is the head dead yet?
You know the boys in the newsroom got a running bet
Get the widow on the set, we need dirty laundry
You don't really need to find out what's going on
You don't really want to know just how far it's gone
Just leave well enough alone, keep your dirty laundry

Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down
Kick 'em when they're stiff, kick 'em all around

(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)
(Kick 'em when they're stiff, kick 'em all around)

Dirty little secrets, dirty little lies
We got our dirty little fingers in everybody's pie
Love to cut you down to size, we love dirty laundry

We can do the innuendo, we can dance and sing
When it's said and done, we haven't told you a thing
We all know that crap is king, give us dirty laundry

(Kick 'em when they're up, kick 'em when they're down)...

It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year. But, ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passin' fancies, and in time may go...
But, Ooooh my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're - goin' a long, long way
In time The Rockies may crumble - Gibralter may tumble
They're only made of clay
But, our love is here to stay...

May just be passin' fancy's anytime they go...

Everythin' safe, got a walk-in safe
Treadmill rappers still runnin' in place
All these meals, I can share my plate
Flo Rida full, yeah, I already ate
Plenty to give or take, I'm 'bout business
Make no mistake, baby, serious this real estate
Froms a million inches away my position
I'm cuttin' cake, I'm the chef in the kitchen late
From my recipe bill, it's on the essence of haulin' weight
Don't worry 'bout a dolla, don dolla with the prada
Ain't no problem if you swalla, you a scarlet, you get holla grand
Pieces, I got 'em, I get 'em ballin' like sucka
Consider the show stoppa, I'm holdin' it down propa

[Verse 2]
My life is straight, I'm livin' good, I ain't hurtin' for nothin'
I'm not the richest in the world, but I'm workin with somethin'
The escalade all pearl, you control it with buttons
They keep the tabs on they curb when I come through stuntin'
That's Brisc, best to believe it seatin' on skates
I'm the Don, take it or leave it, throw it in ya face
Big B's makin' it rain, no need to hate
Got beef, loadin' them thangs, grip the whole case

[Chorus]
I got my money right and I'm livin' up some rubba bands
Hit the club heavy with, bet I spend a couple grand (Couple grand)
On pictures, shove the keys on the hand

Bitches thicka than Venus, I told Serena she can train
Got my money like a train is always on track
Got my money, more than fame, so that explain the all black

People wanna bill a case on me, fuck it, just bring it on

There was a time when I believed in you
Oh, and nothing wrong that you could ever do
But you've changed, and you know it's true
I'm losing the faith that I had in you

I was so in love, till I was blind
No, I could never believe that cheatin' was on your mind
Oh, you've changed, and you know it's true
I'm losing the faith that I had in you

Oh, I gave you my heart, gave you all my love
And I asked for nothing, nothing in return
I was so happy with you, baby, thinkin' you were mine
Oh, but how much, how much I paid to learn

Oh, how I suffered since finding out you, baby
You were all you cared about
Oh, you've changed and you know it's true
I'm losing the faith that I had in you

Oh, you've changed. Yes, you really changed
And I'm losing the faith that I had
Losing the faith that I had
Losing the faith that I had in you
Lonely walker humanoid
Listening to forgotten sounds
Tasting smells and colours
Hiking mounts crossing rivers
Humble biped you've come undone
You detached the mechanical
Freedom it inspires
Fusing with your desire

Primal hiker lonely walker
Rediscovering your own pace
Left here to go elsewhere
Abandon all impatience

Reposess the senses
Impression of freedom
Time doesn't know itself
Has mingle path and dream
Animal survivor
You belong to nature
Reposess the senses
Impression of freedom
Time doesn't know itself
Has mingle path and dream
Animal survivor
You belong to nature
Reposess the senses
Impression of freedom
Time doesn't know itself
Has mingle path and dream
Animal survivor
You belong to nature
Dreams of return to nature
Barred with satellite dishes
Wonderful K.A.Y.A

Down by the old mill stream
Where I first met you
K.E.W.B

You're listening to Murray the K

Down by the old mill stream
At the Beach Boy Show

Hi, this is Carl Wilson and we'll see you tonight at the Beach Boys concert
Imagine there's no Heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one
Hot thing!

Hot thing - barely 21
Hot thing - lookin' for big fun
Hot thing - what's your fantasy?
Hot thing - do you wanna play with me?

Hot thing - baby, you dance so good
Hot thing - baby, I knew you would
Hot thing - tell me what you see
Hot thing - when you smile, when you smile, when you smile
Are your smiles, are your smiles for me?

Hot thing - maybe you should give your folks a call
Hot thing - tell 'em you're goin' to the crystal ball
Hot thing - tell 'em you're comin' home late if you're comin' home at all
Hot thing - you can tell 'em you found a brand new baby doll

Hot thing - I can't... I can't wait to get you home
Hot thing - where we can be alone
Hot thing - I could read you poetry
And then we could...we could make a story of our own
(We could make a story of our own)
Hot thing!
Hot, hot, hot thing!
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing

Hot thing - barely 21
Hot thing - lookin' for big fun
Hot thing - what's your fantasy?
Hot thing - don't you wanna play with me?

Hot thing!
Hot thing!
Hot thing - I can't wait to get you home

Hot thing
If ever you got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you, and torn you apart
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?
And let it be like they said it would be
Me loving you girl, and you loving me
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?
Run to me whenever you're lonely (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then, you need someone older
So darling, you run to me
And when you're out in the cold
No one beside you, and no one to hold
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?
And when you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for, nothing to choose
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me
Run to me whenever you're lonely (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older
So darling, you run to me
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older
So darling, you run to me
Run to me whenever you're lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older
It's new, it's out of the ordinary
It's rather extrordinary
So yo bust this commentary
A literary, genius, and a superior beat creator
Have come together, and we made a
Musical composition which we think is a remedy
To cure all the dance floors that's empty
You wanna dance? We got what you want
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk
Get down brand new funk-hit it
It was kind of an accident, the way that it happened
One day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up
And all of a sudden, he brought in a cut And I dropped my microphone and said
"What the ? Hold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it"
He just smiled and said, "Yeah def ain't it?"
It was {funky} it made wanna {get, get down!} And we knew almost at once it was
The {brand new funk}
So we continued to listen to it
And we knew it was def when I started rappin to it
So I gave a hi-five to Jeff and without hesitation popped in my cassette
I took it home that night, and analyzed it
Rewound the tape over and over, and memorized it
That Friday, we went to the club And out and out cold tore it up
You shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin and spinnin
And clappin, while the beatboxin was groovin and screamin and yellin while on
The microphone I was flowin
Fresh rhymes I was showin, the people say, "Yo keep goin" So I continued to
Rock, while Jeff was on the beatbox Special assistance from my homeboy Ready
Rock
People barged just to get up front to get a bird's eye view of what we call the
Brand new funk
Ge-Ge-Get down-hit it
Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} *
Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the
Beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat with your hands }
Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Now get funky with the beat
Jeff starts spinning backwards * Now turn it all around
The most original, amazing, astounding, miraculous remarkable, startling
Sensational, stupendous music
That has ever been created is ours - but believe me it was complicated
But we have done it, so now we can breathe a long awaited sigh of relief
This isn't a publicity stunt It's the raw untouched, pure, hard brand new funk
{Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat}
{Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * {Rock the beat with your
Hands } {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock the beat} {Rock
The beat} {Rock the beat} * Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * {Rock the beat with
Your hands }
Now the cover of Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone
And the music on my radio
Ain't supposed to make me feel alone

What a drag to know
I'll have to learn to let it go

Show me something I can be
And play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me

And they're celebrating broken things
I don't want a world of broken things
You can tell that something isn't right
When all your heroes are in black and white

What a drag to say
At least I still have yesterday
Show me something I can be
And play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me

I'm not mad about it
But I'm not mad about it
I'm not mad about it
But I'm not that mad about it

Just show me something I can be
Play a song that we can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me
We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover
I have a feeling, it's a feeling I'm concealing - I don't know why
It's just a mental, incidental, sentimental - alibi
But I adore you, so strong for you
Why go on stalling, I am falling, love is calling - why be shy
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love
Our hearts are made of it, let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it
Let's close our eyes
And make our own paradise
Little we know of it, still we can try
To make a go of it
We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love
Now is the time for it, while we are young
Let's fall in love
Maybe it's because the kiss you gave me
Touched my heart and went right through
I can't tell you why
I only know that I fell helplessly in love with you

How I fell in love with you
I could say you're grand and therefore I care for you so
But there is a why and wherefore and I'd like to know

Maybe it's because the star I wished on
Made a certain wish come true
Or it just should be that you were meant for me
And maybe I was meant for you

Maybe it's because the song we danced to
Told a story old and new
I can't figure out just why it came about
I got to leave this woman
But I ain't got nowhere else to go
I got to leave this woman
I ain't got nowhere else to go
You see, she owns everything
Including the carpet on the floor

When I was givin' her my money
She treated me like I was B.B. King
Hey, when I was givin' her my money
She treated me like I was B.B. King
Now I ain't got no money left
Now she treats me
Like I'm not even a human bein'

I got to leave this woman
I can't take this kind of treatment no more
Got to leave this woman
I can't take this kind of treatment no more
I've got one big problem
I ain't got nowhere to go
Hey, all the pretty furniture she got
I even bought her a mink coat too
Yeah, all the furniture she got
I even bought her that mink coat too
Now that we've got a divorce
Tha's waht she put me through

I got to leave this woman
But I ain't got nowhere else to go
I got to leave this woman
Can't take this kind of treatment no more
She owns everything
Even the carpet on the floor
All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
Take my lips
I wanna lose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I get along without you
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not, why not take all of me

All of me
Come on get all of me
Can't you see
I'm just a mess without you
Take my lips
I wanna lose them
Get a piece of these arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I ever make it without you
You know you got the part
Used to be my heart
So why not, why not take all of me

[Verse 1: Mike]
Come here baby, let me talk to you
I've been watching you and you look so, so good tonight
Words just can't express the way that you're makin' me feel
I'm just captured by your love and your sensuality
Let me explain

[Verse 2: Nathan]
There you are, standing there
Make me wanna reach out and touch ya'
And run my fingers through your hair
I know you gotta go but I want you to stay
So we can get a little closer and do things my way

[Verse 3: Wanya]
Baby you're so beautiful, honey you're special too
You make me wanna do things that I never thought I'd do
Like put you up in my home and buy you fancy things
We can make lots and lots of babies
And I'll buy you a big diamond ring...Oooh

[Chorus]
Never
Never go, never go away from me
Baby stay with me
Oh, never
Never go, never go away from me
Please stay with me

[Verse 4: Shawn]
Breathe out so I can breathe you in
Wanna know every single detail, feel the movement of your skin
Baby if you were to ever leave me, my heart will sho'nuff die
So please be with me forever, and don't you ever say goodbye

[Chorus]
Never
Never go, never go away from me
Baby stay with me
Oh, never
Never go, never go away from me
Please stay with me

[Bridge: Shawn]
See you are (you are everything to me)
Can't you see baby
All of my friends think I'm crazy
Ooh, but they don't know, they don't know
A thing about you and me

[Chorus]
Never
Never go, never go away from me
Baby stay with me
Oh, never
Never go, never go away from me
Please stay with me
Down in Utah
The guys and I dig a city called Salt Lake
It's got the grooviest kids
That's why we never get tired of Salt Lake
And the way the kids talk so cool
Is an out of sight thing
And the number one radio station
Makes the town really swing yeah
Salt Lake City we'll be coming soon

There's a park near the city, yeah
All the kids dig the Lagoon now
It's full of all kinds of girls
And rides and we'll be flyin' there soon now
And girl for girl
They've got the cutest of the Western states
They got the sun in the summer
And winter time the skiing is great yeah
Salt Lake City we'll be coming soon

Salt Lake City we'll be coming soon
We'll be coming soon
We'll be coming soon
We'll be coming soon
I stood in there in the shadows
As they went strolling by
Now she ain't my girl no longer
There's no reason I should cry

But I knew there went my future
And I couldn't stop the tears
And the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears

I spent every dime I had on her
And when it was gone
She said, "Hun, it's sure been fun
But it's time you moved along"

So I stood there in the shadows
And I had my .44
I could hear her mocking laughter
But she won't laugh anymore

Now I'm down here in the gaol house
And I know what brought me here
It was the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears
Well, I guess, I should have left this town
And her far behind
For the way that she made fun of me
Keeps running through my mind

Well, the jury showed no mercy
And I never asked for none
'Cause I know I've got it coming
I'm not proud of what I've done

But down here in this darkness
More and more I seem to hear
The sound of laughter
Ringing in my ears

I hear the sound of laughter
Ringing in my ear
What's new?
How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit
Lovely as ever I must admit

What's new?
How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then
Gee but it's nice to see you again

What's new?
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand

I understand adieu
Pardon my asking, "What's new?"
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed I still love you so

What's new?
How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then
Gee but it's nice to see you again
What's new?
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand

I understand adieu
Pardon my asking, "What's new?"
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed I still love you so
Well, put your arms around me like a circle in the sun
Stay with me baby like my easy rider done
If you don't think I love you look what a fool I've been
If you don't think I'm sinking look what a hole I'm in
I'm stealin' pretty mama don't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back my good old used-to-be
Well, the woman I love she's about my size
She's a married woman, comes to see me sometimes
How old am I?, I'm old enough to know
The difference between infatuation
And a love that has a chance to grow

How old am I?, I'm not too old to hear
The sweet ring of truth and understanding
When the words "I love you" reach my ear

Don't mind these lines beneath my eyes, they're well-earned souvenirs
Of a thousand nights of laughter and occasional tears
And I hope you won't be jealous of the silver in my hair
It took many lover's quarrels to put it there

How old am I?, you kiss me and I'm young
Love's a road never traveled, life's a song I've never sung
If I make you happy today, I'm the perfect age
As for tomorrow turn the page
Everyday nothing seems to change
Everywhere I go I keep seeing the same old thing & I..
I can't take it no more
Oh, I would this town but I ain't got no where else to go
Wake up in the morning, oh, more bad news
& I.. Sometimes I feel like I was borne to lose & I..
It's driving me out of my mind
I'll catch the next train & I.. I'll move on down the line

Whoah I'll be ready now
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
Whoah I'll be ready now
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I know my time ain't long around here
& I can't live this life again

Walking down the streets you might run across a smilng face
But they'll stab you in the back as soon as you turn & walk away
& I.. Oh Lord it's bringing me down

If things don't change around here, ain't no use in me hanging 'round
Whoah I'll be ready now
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
Whoah I'll be ready now
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I know my time ain't long around here
& I can't live this life again
Till the end of time 'long as stars are in the blue
'long as there's a spring, a bird to sing, I'll go on loving you
Till the end of time. 'long as roses bloom in may
My love for you will go deeper with every passing day

Till the wells run dry and each mountain disappear
I'll be there for you to care for you through laughter and through tears
So take my hand in sweet surrender, and tenderly say that i'm
The one you'll love and live for, till the end of time
(Jamie Foxx)
Climb on up on my bed
On gone grab between your legs

(chorus)

[Spoken Intro]
Baby, is it all right if I break it down and give you something romantic?
I figured since it's raining, that this would be the perfect time for us to...

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the sounds of the
Love angels calling us?
Sweet violins and harps playing
Then suddenly there's this kiss of trust
Dapper than the morning dew
Tonight has chosen me and you
And girl I vow to make every one of your fantasies come true

[Pre-Chorus]
I can hear the, horns sounding, bells ringing
A full orchestra and a choir singing
The ocean's calm and the river's flowing
It feels so good, keep on going

[Chorus]
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love
(As we make love, yeah)
We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us
(Both of us, yeah)
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love
(We make love, yeah)
We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us

[Verse 2]
Can you see the flowers blooming
Slowly as the seasons change
The gift of joy is founded when I
Softly hear you call my name
Rose petals, and all these oils
Surrounded by a hundred candles
An eagle delivers a letter
That says the night will last forever
Dapper than the morning dew
Tonight has chosen me and you
And girl, I promise to make every one of your fantasies come true

[Pre-Chorus]
I can hear, horns sounding, bells ringing
A full orchestra and a choir singing
The ocean's calm and the river's flowing
Don't you stop, just keep on going

[Chorus]
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love
(We make love, yeah)
We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us
(On both of us, yeah)
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love (Oh yeah)
We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us

[Bridge]
Through all the trees, the smooth wind blows
Then suddenly a rainbow
And an ocean filled with white sailboats
And huge waterfalls that overflow
See, those in well are fairytales
I would luck with this romantic love
And imagine far away from here
In a land where the sky cries joyful tears

[Chorus]
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love
(As we make love, yeah)
We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us
(It feels so good, keep going)
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love
We won't stop, the rain keeps falling down, on both of us
Raindrops keep falling on our heads, as we make love
(As we make sweet love, yeah)

[Outro]
Baby, in other words—Will you marry me?
Well
Be-bop-a-lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula she's...
My baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll

Well
She's the one in the red blue jeans
She's the queen of all the team
She's the woman walkin' that I know
She's the woman that loves me so

Be-bop-a-lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula she's...
My baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll
Well
She's the woman who's got that beat
She's the woman with the flying feet
She's the woman walk around the store
She's the woman gives me more more more

Be-bop-a-lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula she's...

Be-bop-a-lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula she's my baby
Be-bop-a-lula don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-lula she's...
My baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll
The secret of life
Is enjoying the passage of time
Any fool can do it
There ain't nothin' to it
Nobody knows how we got to the top
Of the hill
Since we're on our way down
We might as well enjoy the ride

The secret of love
Is in opening up your heart
It's okay to feel afraid
But don't let that stand in your way
'Cause anyone knows
That love is the only road
Since we' re only here for awhile
Might as well show some style
Give us a smile

Isn't it a lovely ride
Slidin' down, I'll be glidin' down
Try not to try too hard
It's just a lovely ride
Now the thing about time is that time
Isn't really real
It's just your point of view
How does it feel for you
Einstein said he could never
Understand it all
Planets spinning through space
The smile upon your face
Welcome to the human race

Some kind of lovely ride
I'll be slidin' down
Try not to try too hard
It's just a lovely ride

Isn't it a lovely ride
See me slidin' down, glidin' down
Try not to try too hard
It's just a lovely ride

The secret of life
Is enjoying the passage of time
We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts, we traverse far
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star

Oh, star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

Born a babe on Bethlehem's plain
Gold we bring to crown him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign

Oh, star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to the perfect light

Frankincense to offer have I
Incense owns a deity nigh
Prayer and praising, all men raising
Worship God on high
Oh, star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to the perfect light
Empty rooms behind me, no more nights alone
A table and some chairs for two
Now the world will find me with someone of my own
The loneliness at last, is through
If everyone had someone just like you
Then everyone would feel the way I do

Imagine having someone always by your side
A bed for one can just be so cold
Someone you can talk to when your hands are tied
Someone there to have and hold
There's nothing more rewarding to produce (when you're in love and you hear)
(I love you)

(Somebody to love)
There's nothing more rewarding to produce (when you're in love and you hear)
(I love you)

There's nothing more rewarding to produce (when you're in love and you hear)
(I love you)
(feat. Common)

[Girl:] Do I look fat to you?

[Jamie:] Baby you know I love you

[Girl:] That's not what I asked you

[Common:] Uh, Uh, Uh

[Verse One:]
Girl I know your going crazy, let me help you understand
That you're about to have my baby, and we about to be a fam
Don't you know that when we got married, we'd be true through thick and thin?
Well I know you're lookin thick now, but I'm witcha to the end
U still got it...

[Chorus:]
U still got it gurl e'ry day, e'ry night you know you rock my world
(Don't you know that you still got it?)
And your emotions flowin' cause you know that your body's growin
(Don't you know that you still got it)
That new jersey's snug, well I ain't mad at that baby, it's just more to love
(U still got it)
Oh baby, your love's crazy, cause you havin my baby
(And there's so much more to love)

[Verse Two:]
See you walkin through the mall now, see them outfits that you like
Oh but you scared to try them on now, cause they just won't fit you right
And you stedy watchin Oprah, tryin to redefine your life
But as long as your my lady, I don't care about your size

[Bridge:]
Your hair, (your hair I know) I know your feet are swelling
No need to cry I dig them thighs, that's why I'm telling you
U still got it...

[Chorus:]
U still got it gurl e'ry day, e'ry night you know you rock my world
(Don't you know that you still got it?)
And your emotions flowin' cause you know that your body's growin
(Don't you know that you still got it)
Them new jeans is snug, well I ain't mad at that baby, it's just more to love
(U still got it)
Oh baby, your love's crazy, cause you havin my baby
(And there's so much more to love)

[Common:]
Take a look at my lady, and my day began to shine
Told her, "Baby being beautiful is a state of mind, and you are."
So, had to let your mind and your heart know, as you grow, the more, the more I see God glow
I know it's probably strange, seeing your body change
Can't fit your clothes, nose ain't the same
But love still remains, it won't vary with me
Look at you and smile, thinkin' Damn she carry a me!
A life we created, we can cherish forever
You growin, but it's sexy, the sex is even better
But through thick and thin, pickles and peanut butter, is a divine mother, queen and supreme lover
U still got it
I know that you still got it
Don't you know that you still got it?
U still got it

[Verse 1]
Here's an Ode, ah, to deodorant
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene
It keeps me through the day
Another ode, ah to deodorant
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene
It's the confidence I need

[Chorus]
It's medicine for the soul
It's medicine for the mind
It picks me up and makes me whole
It makes me feel alright

[Verse 2]
Here's an Ode, an ode to aerosol
It's my thing
Ah, it's my favourite hygiene, it's the confidence I need

[Chorus]
It's medicine for the soul
It's medicine for the mind
It picks me up and makes me whole
It makes me feel alright

[Outro]
It's okay, oh, would I ever let you down, no way
Oh, would I ever let you down, okay?
Oh, would I ever let you down, no way
Oh, would I ever let you down
I'll never let you, I'll never let you, I'll never let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way

[Intro]
This is not America (Sha la la la la)

[Verse 1]
Little piece of you
The little peace in me
Will die (This is not a miracle)
For this is not America

[Verse 2]
Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare
Too long (This is not America)
For this is not the miracle

[Pre-Chorus]
There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

[Chorus]
For this is not America
(Sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la)
This is not America, no
This is not (Sha la la la la)

[Verse 3]
Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals to the ground
(This could be the biggest sky)
So bloody red, tomorrow's clouds

[Verse 1]
A little piece of you
The little piece in me
Will die (This could be a miracle)
For this is not America

[Pre-Chorus]
There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

[Chorus]
For this is not America
(Sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la)
This is not America, no
This is not (Sha la la la)

[Outro]
This is not America, no
This is not
This is not America, no
This is not (Sha la la la)

And god, I've been blessed with just enough 2 get the job done
Check it just like ford (what? ) - "quality is job one"

2 much said on the airwaves cause 2 much scandal
See, things got funny when I made my money
Why brothers got jelly when pockets get fat?
Their pockets equal fly honeys
An equation that just don't figure
'cause tone is quick 2 bust a bubble on the butt of a gold digger
(so what u sayin'? )
U see, I worked 2 hard 4 this honey dip (honey dip)

Well I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know, as I said the story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cos I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again, and show you that I'm real

(You lied to me) all those times I said that I love you
(You lied to me) yes, I tried, yes, I tried
(You lied to me) even though you know I'd die for you
(You lied to me) yes, I cried, yes, I cried

1-(Return of the Mack) it is
(Return of the Mack) come on
(Return of the Mack) oh my God
(You know that I'll be back) here I am
(Return of the Mack) once again
(Return of the Mack) pump up the world
(Return of the Mack) watch my flow
(You know that I'll be back) here I go
So I'm back up in the game
Running things to keep my swing
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cos what you did, you know, was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done
So, baby, listen carefully
While I sing my come-back song

2-(You lied to me) 'cos she said she'd never turn on me
(You lied to me) but you did, but you do
(You lied to me) all these pains you said I'd never feel
(You lied to me) but I do, but I do, do, do

(Return of the Mack) here it is
(Return of the Mack) hold on
(Return of the Mack) don't you know
(You know that I'll be back) here I go

(You know that I'll be back) round and round

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name

[Verse 1]
Any other day, I would call, you would say (Say)
"Baby, how's your day?"
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh, ok" (Uh-huh, ok)
Could it be that you at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around, and be played
Baby why, why you gots to lie?
I'm all up in your game, boy, you better say my name, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Something's going down that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange)
If nobody's holding you back from me
('Cause I know how you usually do)
When you say everything to me times two
(Why can't you just tell the truth?)
If somebody's there then tell me who, oh

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name (Say my name)
If no one is around you, say "baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name (Say my name)
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby (Hey, yeah)
Why the sudden change? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say “baby, I love you” (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you ain't runnin' game (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say my name, say my name (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You actin' kinda shady (Hey, yeah) ain't callin' me baby (Alright)

[Interlude]

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't know what it's like to land and not race to your door
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I'm not sure that I really ever could
Hold on to your hotel key in your bedroom neighborhood
Me sleep-walking in Hollywood
I'm gonna steer clear
I'd burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Â€~Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I get lost on the boulevard at night
Without your voice to tell me â€~I love you, take a right'
The ten and the two is the loneliest sight
I'm gonna steer clear
I'd burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Â€~Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you
I'm gonna steer clear, oh yeah
I'd burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Â€~Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
See you there
I think I'm gonna stay, gonna stay in the gray
I think I'm gonna stay, gonna stay, gonna stay
And all the streetlights say nevermind, nevermind
And the canyon lines say nevermind
And sunset says we see this all the time, nevermind, never you mind
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch your life play out in pictures from afar
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar
Get up !
Don't again back on your feet !
To get up
Don't let nobody break you down !

Oh don't get the passion, control of your mind
Oh don't get frustration, announce of your time
And feel ebony, ...
Your hopes to the crown
And baby don't stop your cry !
And baby one more try !

[Chorus] (x4)
Oh if you want it, you got it !
You scour each feeling
You can dream it, believe it
It's got to be really
And feel ebony, ...
Your hopes to the crown
And baby don't stop your cry !
And baby one more try !

[Chorus] (x8)
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Ouhouh...

Get up !
Five hundred'll buy you a stack. Bet it on the red or the black and you'll lose, bet on the blues
You tell me you're a gambling man
Try to beat the house if you can and you lose, bet on the blues
If you're looking to get an inside slant
If you're looking for something so good you can't refuse, bet on the blues
Find a man who thinks he's over the hump
I'm here to tell you he's a kind of a chump you can use, bet on the blues, bet on the blues

Lucky old sun is shining today. Even money says you'll be paying some dues, bet on the blues
You say you found your lady fair
Eight to five she's wearing her traveling shoes, bet on the blues
Five hundred'll buy you a stack. Bet it on the red or the black and you'll lose, bet on the blues
You tell me you're a gambling man
Try to beat the house if you can and you lose, bet on the blues
If you're looking to get an inside slant
If you're looking for something so good you can't refuse, bet on the blues, bet on the blues, bet on the blues, bet on the blues, bet on the blues

Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Let's rock)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez, Pitbull & Both]
I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor (Hey)
And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor (Yeah)
Don't stop keep it moving, put your drinks up (Woo!)
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor (Hey)
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I am not wrong, we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York, Vegas to Africa (Dale)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
Dance the night away
Dance the night away
Dance, dance, dance...
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Let's rock)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Woo!)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Dance the night away (Woo)
Grab somebody, drink a little more
Dance the night away
Dance the night away
Dance, dance, dance... (Woo)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Let's rock)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Woo!)
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor

[Outro: Jennifer Lopez]
Let me introduce you to my party people in the club
So long sad times, go along bad times
We are rid of you at last
Howdy gay times, cloudy gray times
You are now a thing of the past

Happy days are here again
The skies above are clear again
So let's sing a song of cheer again
Happy days are here again

Altogether shout it now
There's no one who can doubt it now
So let's tell the world about it now
Happy days are here again

Your cares and troubles are gone
There'll be no more from now on
From now on

Happy days are here again
The skies above are clear again
So let's sing a song of cheer again
Happy times, happy nights
Happy days are here again
Want to tell you about my baby, you know she comes around
Just about five feet-four from her head to the ground
You know she comes around here just about midnight
She makes me feel so good, she makes me feel alright

And her name is G.L.O.R.I.A G.L.O.R.I.A
Gloria I want to to shout it all night
Gloria I want to to shout it all day

She comes around here just about midnight
She only come to make me feel good, she makes me feel alright
She comes walking down my street, she comes up to my house
Knockin' on my door, now she comes to my room

A she makes me feel alright
And her name is G.L.O.R.I.A. G.L.O.R.I.A
Gloria I want to to shout it all day
Harry, got up
Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning

He had a home
Love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess, it doesn't matter anymore

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Lying here in the darkness
I hear the sirens wail
Somebody, going to emergency
Somebody's going to jail
If you find somebody to love in this world
You better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get a little strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

In these days
When darkness falls early
And people rush home
To the ones they love
You better take a fool's advice
Take care of your own
'Cause one day they're here
Next day they're gone

Pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
Leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark
He said, "Baby, I've changed, please, come back"
What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
I know, the days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
I know there's somebody somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day, I have to believe, I believe, I believe

In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
Things can get pretty change
In a New York minute

Everything can change
In a New York minute
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute

Things can get pretty strange
In a New York minute
Everything can change
In a New York minute
In a New York minute, minute
You shouldn't have left me, baby
Baby, you shouldn't have gone away
Oh, you shouldn't have left me, baby
Baby, you shouldn't have gone away
Oh, you left the one that love you, woman
Cryin' every night and every day

Someone that you love more, baby
Made you break my heart in two
Someone that you love more, baby
Made you break my heart in two
I want you to remember, baby
The same thing could happen to you

When the pain's in your heart, woman
Make you feel like you could die
Oh, when the pain's, the pain's in your heart, baby
Make you feel like you could die
Oh, you'll know then that you shouldn't have left me, woman
Baby, and how it feels to say goodbye
Times ain't what they used to be
Times ain't what they used to be
Oh I tell you people, lord, you can take it from me

Oh I seen better days and I'm putting up with these
Oh I seen better days and I'm putting up with these
But there's too many people and they're all too hard to please

Cause I was born in the country, she thinks I'm easy to rule
Cause I was born in the country, she thinks I'm easy to rule
She tried to hitch me to her wagon, she wants to drive me like a mule

You know I bought the groceries and I paid the rent
You know I bought the groceries and I paid the rent
She tried to make me wash her clothes but I got good common sense

I said if you don't want me, why don't you tell me so?
I said if you don't want me, why don't you tell me so?
Cause it ain't like a man that ain't got nowhere to go

I believe I'm giving you sugar for sugar, let you get salt for salt
I believe I'm giving you sugar for sugar, let you get salt for salt
And if you can't get along with me, well it's your own fault
Now you want me to love you and you treat me mean
How do you want me to love you if you keep a-treating me mean?
You're my daily thought and my nightly dream

Sometimes I think that you too sweet to die
Sometimes I think that you too sweet to die
And another time I think you ought to be buried alive

[Intro]
Got to find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart
Got to find out what I'm meant to do
You're the one who broke my heart

[Verse 1]
When I met you, boy
You were as sweet as cherry pie
That smile in your eye
You were as wild as Friday night
I should have known
However hard you tried
Change would come and strangle it
It was bound to die

[Chorus]
You were sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night
Sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night

[Bridge]
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Gotta find out what I meant to you
Oh, boy
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Where were you just when I needed you?

[Verse 2]
You gave me your soul
For at least a day
Listen, boy, there was a time
When I wanted you to stay
You know the cost
It's you who's gonna pay
I'm stronger now; I loved you then
I ask you anyway

[Chorus]
You were sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night
Sweet as cherry pie
Wild as Friday night

[Bridge]
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Where were you just when I needed you, boy?
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Ooh, I needed you
Baa doo doo doo doo, doo doo, baa doo doo doo
Baa doo doo doo doo (You tease me), baa doo doo doo
Baa doo doo doo doo, doo doo (You broke my heart)
Baa doo doo doo
Baa doo doo doo doo (You broke my heart)
Baa doo doo doo
Hoo hoo, ooh hoo

You were the only one, you were the only one
You're a son of a gun
You were the only one, you were the only one
Oh boy, you broke my heart
Sweet as cherry pie
Sweet as cherry pie

Gotta find out what I meant to you
You're the one who broke my heart in two
Gotta find out what I meant to you
Oh, boy
Gotta find out what I meant to you
Where were you just when I needed you?
Gotta find out what I meant to you, boy

Doo doop doo doop

Doo doo doop doop doop
Doo doo doop doop doop

[Outro]
Where were you when I needed you?
You were the only one, you were the only one
Ooh, son of a gun
You were the only one
I'm feeling stronger now; I loved you then
So I ask you anyway
Gotta find out what I meant to you
(Sweet as cherry pie)
You broke my heart
(Sweet as cherry pie)
Gotta find out what I meant to you
You tease me
You were the only one, you were the only one
Wild as Friday night
Son of a gun
You were the only one, you were the only one
(Sweet as cherry pie)
She didn't bat an eye, as I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would cry, or sit around my room and grieve
But oh the girl she fooled me this time
Acting like I was the last thing on her mind
Now I'd like to start all over again
I just want to change my mind

As I took those steps, toward that open door
Knowing all the time, oh Lord I just didn't wanna go
She didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would make me wanna change my mind
And I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
Cause I would like to change my mind

(You know, I was confused, sitting here by myself thinking
Watching you walk to the door and walk away
What was I supposed to say "change your mind")

Oh I've played my game so many times before
But people let me tell y'all, that I never reached the door
Oh the wind it is high tonight
I keep lookin' for my baby but she's not in sight
And I would like to start all over again
Baby can I change my mind
Cause I would like to start all over again
Baby can I change my...my mind
Cause I would like to start all over again with you girl
The blue light flashes, Billy feels its motion
He says, "Should I go and set it free?"
Black-eyed Suzie picks up on the notion
She says, "Put it in the lonely tree"

He says, "Babe, babe
We best sharpen our imagination"
He says, "It seems like the rest
Don't comprehend the situation"

I don't hear you
All the words that come and go, don't say what I'm after
I don't hear you
Scream it through a microphone, whisper in a deadly tone
Don't hear you, uh hum, not you

Jane's a dancer in quiet desperation
She says, "What I give I give for free"
Her twin sister feels the same sensation
But says, "You must buy it all from me"
She says, "Oh I feel best
When the rest is all uncertain"
She says, "Thoughts in my breast
Just hang there like a burning curtain"

I don't hear you
You don't matter, you don't care, I don't call that living
I don't hear you
What you say don't reach inside, it is like you're gagged and tied
I don't hear you

He said, "Go with the flow
Though the currents can bring danger"
You didn't know
You were dancing with a desperate stranger"

I don't hear you
I've been dealing with deaf ears, I don't need no laughter
I don't hear you
It ain't hard to analyze, I know what you're really after
I can't hear you
Barbie, Barbie, queen of the Prom
Turned down dates with Eddie and Tom
Everyone loves her, she's lovely to see
But Barbie, my Barbie, she loves only me

Barbie, Barbie, still in her teens
Belle of the parties, a tom boy in jeans
She's everything that a girl wants to be
And Barbie, my Barbie, she loves only me

This is a year, we have prayed for
This is a moment sublime
All of our lives we have waited for
For this one perfect time

Barbie, Barbie, always I knew
Can come here for one moment with you
Everyone loves you and everyone knows
That Barbie, my Barbie, you love only me

You love only me
You love only me
You love only me
You'll be fine, cause you're mine
We can withstand the test of time
It's all or nothing, everything we do
Even when I can't be, can't be with you
It doesn't mean you're any farther away
Just means we're still prisoners
Not entirely free
There's a new age dawning
Slowly opening Heaven's door
Contrary to rumor, Heaven is keeping score

The New Power Generation have just taken control
Every kiss, every hug
Seems to act just like a drug
You're getting to be a habit with me

Let me stay in your arms
I'm addicted to your charms
You're getting to be a habit with me

I used to think your love was something that I could take or leave alone
But now I couldn't do without my supply
I need you for my own

Oh, I can't break away
I must have you everyday
As regularly as coffee or tea
You've got me in your clutches
And I can't break free
You're getting to be a habit with me

[Verse 1]
Please don't wake me up too late
Tomorrow comes, and I will not be late
Late today when it becomes tomorrow
I will leave and go away

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye

[Verse 2]
Songs that linger on my lips
Excite me now and linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door
I leave them for the one who waits behind

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye

[Scatting]

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye

[Verse 3]
Far away my lover sings
A lonely song and calls me to his side
Where the sound of lonely drums
Invites me on, I must be by his side

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye

[Outro]
Goodbye
Ah, ha, ha, ha
Bye, bye
Know I love you for myself
Yes, and you're gone to somebody else
And I'm worried yes, I'm worried all alone

I go to bed prayin' each night
I'm hopin' darlin', you'll treat me right
And I'm worried yes, as a man can be

All I can do is pray
Hope that maybe I'll find you someday
But until then, darlin' I'll pray all day long

I'll do everything I can
Tryin' to get you to understand
I don't want to see you round, darlin' with other men

Ah, you know I love you, love you for myself
Gone and left me for somebody else
All I can do is pray for you
O Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds
Your hands have made

I see the stars
I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout
The universe displayed

Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
Ooh, how great Thou art

Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

When Christ shall come
With shouts of acclamation
And take me home
What joy will fill my heart
Then I will bow
In humble adoration
And there proclaim
My God, how great Thou art

Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art

Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
Well, this is my last connection , I been slowing up the line
Ain't no satisfaction in this troubled head of mine
Gotta get back to the highway , gonna get back to where I know
'cause sooner or later there's gonna be a showdown 
Gotta go man, gotta go

Hell, I'm so so tired , so so tired
And I don't know where I'm gonna start
It's only heavy breathing in the dark

Ain't nobody's sweetheart, ain't nobody's fool
And if the sun don't set on my house babe
I'd be the last man to blow my cool
I feel my body shake
Well, there's so much left to say
Spend my life anticipatin'
Gonna find a way

Hey, I'm so so tired , so so tired
And I don't know where I'm gonna start
It's only heavy breathing in the dark
So so tired
So so tired
And I don't know where I'm gonna start
Only heavy breathing in the dark
Only heavy breathing in the dark
It's only heavy breathing in the dark

Well, I don't believe in ev'rything you say just to save my soul
You know there's got to be a way better than a big black hole
Gotta take me from my suicide
Now you know it's love I crave
You know we got to live like this from the cradle to the grave

So so so so tired
So so so so tired
I'm so so so so tired
So so so so tired
So so so so tired
I'm so so so so tired

[Verse 1]
You'd been dreaming away
But it's time to wake up
And find me gone
Oh, but don't get me wrong
And I'm drifting away
Tender years we thought would never end
Let's pray they'll come again

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, after all this time it took for us to grow
(After all this time)
There's no sign of love right now you know
(After all this time)

[Chorus]
So you walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)
You walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm used to planning my days
But it's time I stopped including you
Don't you be blue
'Cause although I'm walking away
There's just one wish in mind to meet again
And we will, my friend

[Pre-Chorus]
Said after all this time it took for us to grow
(After all this time)
There's no love between us, girl, you know
(After all this time)

[Chorus]
So you walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)
You walk your way (You walk your way)
And I'll walk mine (I'll walk mine)

[Pre-Chorus]
After all this time it took for us to grow
(After all this time)
There's no love between us, girl, you know
(After all this time)

[Chorus]
So you walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)
You walk your way (You walk your way)
And I'll walk mine (I'll walk mine)

[Outro]
And we'll meet again (You walk your way)
We will my friend (I'll walk mine)
And things will be much better then
Oh (I'll walk mine)
You walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)
You walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)
Oh, walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)
Walk (You walk your way)
Oh (I'll walk mine)

[Intro]
Hey hey, oh yeah, oh

And heard the TV sayin' something
About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm going
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you girl
And what you give me lets me know
That I'll be alright

[Pre-Hook]
'Cause if your love was all I had in this life

[Spoken Intro]
Yeah, I know, you know, what a calling is
I mean, we all have a calling in our life, I believe
You know I'm from the dirt, man
I come up in these streets
Went without eatin', you know what I'm sayin'?
Saw my mom go without eatin', and I got tired of that
I had to go out there in them streets and hustle, you know?
I mean, you know what I'm sayin'?
I mean, it's easy for y'all to say, you know (I surrender)
Surrender your life, you know what I'm sayin'? (I surrender)
Give your life to God and all that
Y'know, that's good and I believe in God (I surrender to you Lord)
But when you got bills at your front door all the time
You know what I'm sayin'?
Kids screamin' "Daddy, Momma, where the food at?" (I surrender)
Man, it makes it kinda hard to believe in (I surrender)
You know, and have faith in something that you can't see
(I surrender to your Lord)
Even though you wanna believe
Y'all just gonna have to just pray for me, you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause uh...

[Verse 1]
Constantly my mind and my heart is racing (yeah)
All by myself, trying to solve all these problems I'm facing
(oh yeah)
Looking to man trying to find hope (uh-huh)
But man will never know the depth of my struggles (oh)
I was depending on myself (on myself)
To give myself a hand (oh, but)
But when depending on myself (I...)
Fail time again (that's why)
And that's why I'm standing here alone (all alone)
With no one else
Lord, I realized that I can't fight these battles by myself

[Chorus]
I surrender
I surrender (oh I)
I surrender to you, Lord
I surrender
I surrender (oh I)
I surrender to you, Lord
I surrender (I surrender)
I surrender (Lord, to you)
I surrender to you Lord
Coming out with both hands up
I surrender

[Verse 2]
I tried everything I could to make it work (mmm-hmm)
But everything I seemed to try just made it worse (ohh)
And every road that I'd go down, there were no signs (signs)
Destination lonely with no peace of mind (yeah, ohh)
I was depending on myself (on myself)
To give myself a hand (but when)
But when depending on myself (I would feail time and time again)
Fail time again (that's why)
And that's why I'm standing here alone (standing all alone)
With no one else
Lord, I realized that I can't fight these battles by myself
I surrender

[Chorus]
I surrender

I surrender to you Lord (said I surrender)

Won't you guard the place around it
(There's nowhere for me to go)
Joy, I have tried to find (whoo)
(See, I've searched high and I've searched low)
Said you walked throughout the building
(So come and rescue me from this hell)
'Cause I can't do it by myself (I can't do it by myself)

[Verse 2]
Fine calypso woman
She cook me shrimp and rice
Fine calypso woman
She cook me shrimp and rice
Dis yankee hot dog
Don't treat me stomach very nice
Ah

[Bridge]
In Trinidad, one dollar buy
Papaya juice, banana pie
Six coconuts, one female goat
And plenty fish to fill de boat
One bushel bread, one barrel wine
And all de town, she come to dine
But here is bad, one dollar buy
Cup of coffee, ham on rye
Ah

[Verse 3]
Me throat she sick from necktie
Me feet she hurt from shoes
Me pocket full of empty
I got Calypso blues

[Bridge]
Dese yankee girls give me big scare
Is black de root, is blonde de hair?
Her eyelash false, her face is paint
And pads are where de girl she ain't
She jitterbugs when she should waltz
I even think her name is false
But calypso girl is good a lot
Is what you see, is what she got

[Verse 4]
Sittin' by de ocean
Me heart, she feel so sad
Sittin' by de ocean
Me heart, she feel so sad...
I don't got de money
To take me back to Trinidad
I don't got de money
To take me back to Trinidad

Ah
Oh, Holy Night
The stars
Are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear
Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin
And error pining
'Til He appeared
And the soul felt
It's worth a thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new
And glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine
Oh night
Oh, Holy night
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
Oh, Holy night
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
When Christ was born

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
Oh, Holy night

[Verse 1]
I was in a tunnel
And couldn't see the light
And whenever I'd look up
I couldn't see the sky
Sometimes when I'm standing
It seems like I done walked for miles
And my heart could be crying
Dead in the middle of a smile

[Pre-Chorus]
But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice saying

[Chorus]
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free, whoa

[Verse 2]
Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone
And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind
I've been racing for years
And still no finish line, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains (mountains)
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
And then a small voice saying

[Chorus]
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free

[Bridge]
Somehow my beginning stepped right in (right in)
Then faith became my friend (my friend)
And now I can depend
On the voices of the wind
When it's saying (saying)

[Chorus]
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Won't you come and set me free
Won't you set me free
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Won't you come and set me free

[Outro]
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Won't you come and set me free
(Just like, if that guy can see the light, shine it!)
Somewhere beyond the clouds
(If that guy can see the light, shine it!)
Take it down, down
(If that guy can see the light, shine it!)
The clouds moving, the sun shining
(If that guy can see the light, shine it!)
I made it home, the rainbow, the pot of gold
(The storm is over now)
I tell ya I could see the light
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven over me
(Heaven is over me)
Come and set me free...
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Come and set me free
Won't you come and set me free, yeah

[Verse 1]
Every step of the way, we walk the line
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape
All boxed in, nowhere to escape

[Verse 2]
City's just a jungle, more games to play
We're trapped in the heart of it, tryin' to get away
I was raised in the country, been working in the town
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down

[Verse 3]
Ain't got nothing for you, had nothing before
Don't even have anything for myself anymore
Sky's full of fire and the pain's pouring down
Ain't nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around

[Verse 4]
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
There's only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's kickin' in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was thinking about the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed

[Verse 6]
Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees
So many things that we never will undo
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too

[Verse 7]
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't
I need something strong to distract my mind
I'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind

[Verse 8]
Well I got here following the Southern Star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 9]
Well, my ship's been split to splinters, it's sinking fast
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
I've got nothing but affection for those who sailed with me

[Verse 10]
Everybody's moving, if they ain't already there
Everybody got to move somewhere
Stick with me baby, anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now

[Verse 11]
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine

[Verse 12]
The emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way
There's only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long
Well I hate to say the farmer
Was the last of a dying breed
Living off the land
And taking what he needs
Don't say much for the future
When a family can't survive
I'd hate to say the farmer
Was the last of his kind

In the struggle for parity
Not one man's voice can sound
Cause the foundation of the conglomerate
Is firmly in the ground
Yeah, they want to feed the world
But for power and for greed
Then they'll cut off the supply
Until they get what they need

Well I dreamed I saw a dust bowl
Where the farmers used to live
Earth was flying through the sky
It had nothing left to give
Tractors were burning
On the Whitehouse lawn
Just woke up one morning
And the farmers all were gone
I hate to say the farmer
Was the last of a dying breed
Living off the land
And taking what he needs
Don't say much for the future
When a family can't survive
I'd hate to say the farmer
Was the last of his kind

Don't say much for the future
When a family can't survive
I'd hate to say the farmer
Was the last of his kind
Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week
'Cause that's the night that my sweetie and I
Used to dance cheek to cheek
I don't mind Sunday night at all
'Cause that's the night friends come to call
And Monday to Friday go fast
And another week goes past

But Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week
I sing the song that I sang for the memories I usually seek
Until I hear you at the door
Until you're in my arms once more
Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week

Mmmm... Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week
I sing the song that I sang for the memories I usually seek
Until I hear you rap on the door
Until you're in my arms once more
Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week

Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week
I sing the song that I sang for the memories I usually seek
Until I hear you rap on the door
Until you're in my arms once more
Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week

Pulled out of Linden, Texas
Two days and nights ago
I've been livin' on pills and burgies
Till the whites of my eyes don't show

Southbound headlights are makin' me blind
I'm too damn tired to blink
My toes are numb and my brains gone dumb
And I can just barely think

Sweet Melinda, my wife
The lonesome moan of this eighteen wheeler
Cuts through me like a knife
'Cept for you, sweet Melinda, my wife
I been ridin' on empty
Most all of my life

Two more hours of daylight
It's startin' to rain again
A sign up ahead says "Welcome to Paradise
Population Ten"
Well me and this truck and that old white line
Stumblin' on and on
Like three old drinkin' buddies
Comin' home at dawn
You know we're fighting every day
It's as if somehow we've lost our way
When we'd first begun, yeah, we lived as one
Now as time goes on, we move our own way

It's just no use in going on
When all the feeling now has gone
You know we both have tried, yeah, we both have lied
Now as tears subside, we move our own ways, yeah

Separation's the only way
Separation starts today

You know we're fighting every day
It's as if somehow we've lost our way
When we'd first begun, yeah, we lived as one
Now as time goes on, we move our own ways
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, my skin is black
But that's no reason to hold me back
Why don't you think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it, think about it

I have wants and desires just like you
So move on aside 'cause I'm a comin' through
Oh, no matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now

Yes, your skin is white
Does that make you right?
Why don't you think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it, think about it

This is a message, a message to y'all
Together we stand, divided we fall
Black is a color, just like white
Tell me how can a color determine whether
You're wrong or right?
We all have our faults, yes we do
So look in your mirror (Look in your mirror)
What do you see? (What do you see?)
Two eyes (Two eyes), a nose (a nose)
And a mouth just like me
Oh, your eyes are open but you refuse to see
The laws of society were made for both you and me
Because of my color, I struggle to be free
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But in the end you're gonna see my friend
Oh, no matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
(We're rollin', rollin', rollin', we're rollin' on)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
(Oh, we're rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
(Can't stop me, can't stop me)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it!
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud! (I'm Black and I'm proud)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud! (I'm Black and I'm proud)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud! (I'm Black and I'm proud)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now

But then she said wouldn't you just like to know,how it all began?
Then i thought to myself, ..and said Quick,you got three minutes
Then it got real quiet i said somebody start talking
She said MY GOD rufus!

He looked at her and said Bitch please,you got ur nerve

And now here you are in our home,and you calling me wrong
And that much i agree,you caught me cheatinggg! but this is a new extreme!

He said you are my wife,sleeping behind my back
And now i come home and you got him in the closet,how extreme is that?!
And she said but she's a he!
And he said bitch you can't judge me
She said but this is crazy!
And I said stop arguing!
I did not sit here to hear you chew each other out it out,so get to to the point,or i swear im out!
...excuse me please,but i think i can explain whats going on in here
My name is chuck and i been knowing him for 5 hard year,him and i been creeping
Around there not staying around to standing living in hell,sleepin in and out of hotels..
I said brother spare the details!
Then rufus said chuck please! dont say nothing else!
Then she screams you son of a bitch
He says cathy go to hell!
I said i thought you said your name was mary,that what you said at the party
Man this is gettin scary imma shoot somebody!
Then rufus start yelling and screaming saying cathy this is all your fault!
She pulled up to him and you was creeping too,the only difference is you didn't get caught!
Chuck screamed out we're in love! cathy say Love my ass!
Rufus said there getting married then i shoot one in the air!
I said notta nother one of you sons of bitches say a word!
Cuz all this shit im goin thru is unheard!
I grabbed my cellular
I said this is so wrong
I call up my home
And a man picks up the phone phone phone phone.....
Now when I was a little boy
At the age of five
I had somethin' in my pocket
Keep a lot of folks alive

Now I'm a man
Made twenty-one
You know baby
We can have a lot of fun

I'm a man
I spell M-A-N, man

All you pretty women
Stand in line
I can make love to you baby
In an hour's time

I'm a man
I spell M-A-N, man
I goin' back down
To Kansas to
Bring back the second cousin
Little John the conqueroo

I'm a man
I spell M-A-N...man

The line I shoot
Will never miss
The way I make love to 'em
They can't resist

I'm a man
I spell M-A-N, man
(You!) Who are you?
You have no talent. You're a bad juggler
You can't walk the high wire. You can't tame a tiger
Then I'll be a clown like my grandfather. (Now Joey)
You'll see! I'll show you all!

That was cruel. You enjoy hurting people
I would enjoy...

I roll with kids with pierced faces and bad attitudes
You'll get stomped like a roach for acting rude
Show some gratitude
And we just might reserve the right to let you live
Think twice before you harass these crab ap kids
Bring drama, react, we know two-slap kids
The cap kids, puttin boogers on their wigs
And if it come to it, been known to decap kids
Blair-witch style, c a f wirtten in twigs
In the thick situations, easy times and complications
From very short times to long durations
We building nations, from g-town to denver, CO
From canad a, what, all the way to san francisco
So what you know about them hoodies with the def one tag on the side
We coasting by while these cats just lag on the side
If someone told you travis didn't love his kids, they lied
You got a hoodie? rock it with pride
(chorus)
We be the c to the r a b, a p p l e, family until the day we d i e
Continuously extendin ourselves for you to see, smell, hear, touch and taste
We be them c to the r a b, a p p l e, k i d's, reppin is lovely
As you can see, endlessly, spittin prophecies until the day we d i e

I roll with kids with nappy heads and backpacks that handle their business
The type of cats that whoop your ass at tony hawk with the quickness
Like benihana's, 360 judo madonnas
Ride the long ass rail for bonus points if they wanna
315 area code, lo and behold
And got that skill to make a dutchie burn slow when they roll
But this is bigger than geneva, i got fam in japan
And if you don't know, better ask Hiroko
Greet her with 'konichiwa', she'll tell you who's the best
Matter of fact, kokuwa, trav is def
This shit it permanent
You shouldn't even be concerned with it
Unless you rock a crab apple with a worm in it
You freshman to this game son, you just learnin it
And you can't touch the flame that we lace these burners with
Plus we hold these Pilot markers with the firmest grip
(the firmest grip, the firmest grip)

It be the c to the r a b, a p p l e, family until the day we d i e
Continuously extendin ourselves for you to see, smell, hear, touch and taste
We be them c to the r a b, a p p l e, k i d 's, reppin is lovely
As you can see, endlessly, spittin prophecies until the day we d i e
To the r a b, a p p l e, family until the day we d i e
Continuously extendin ourselves for you to see, smell, hear, touch and taste
We be them c to the r a b, a p p l e, k i d's, reppin is lovely
As you can see, endlessly, spittin prophecies until the day we d i
E

These kids is like a hop, skip, and a leap from making you sleep
Like snorlax i got their back with my rhyme broad axe
Rock a freaky jason mask that you can barely see me through
Spit a thousand volts out my cheeks like pikachu
Smell me, basically it ain't shit so you could tell me
My mind's made up
Had my back to the exact day crab apple came up
Now i'm worldwide like dot com, just look the name up
Www.epics, you know the rest
Double cross my crew i hope Jah blessed to say the less
But at least take that back, cuz you speak with incoherence
Comin at us like that, we'll make you breathe your sleaze appearance
My crew's top brand, you musta got your shit on clearance
(clearance)

C a f to the death

It be the c to the r a b, a p p l e, family until the day we d i e
Continuously extendin ourselves for you to see, smell, hear, touch and taste
We be them c to the r a b, a p p l e, k i d's, reppin is lovely
As you can see, endlessly, spittin prophecies, spittin prophecies
C to the r a b, a p p l e, family until the day we d i e
Continuously extendin ourselves for you to see, smell, hear, touch and taste
We be them c to the r a b, a p p l e, k i d 's, reppin is lovely
As you can see, endlessly, spittin prophecies until the day we d i e
In the history of
A life takes a heart
When the power of love comes together
There is nothing can tear us apart
And the touch of your hand I can feel
That what we got is stronger than steel
That's when you hear

My lover's prayer
It's my own silent message to you
Takes me there, my lover's prayer
And my soul is divided in two
With my love on the line
I send it all over the world
Out on the air
'Cause I can't let go
And my heart has a mind of it's own
It's my lover's prayer

It's the mystery of
A place blessed by us
And the moment of truth is forever
In the face of incredible odds
And the look in your eyes tells me why
Let our words burn a sign in the sky
My lover's prayer
It's as easy as talking to you
All my life, having you there
In my own private vision come true

You're heaven on earth
You're the fire and all that I'm worth
And I can be strong
You hold the key
Don't say it's over
Don't say it's over for me

My lover's prayer
It's as easy as talking to you
All my life, having you there
In my own private vision come true
In my search for your love
I send it all over the world
It's all I can bare
And the nights get long
But my heart holds on
It's no empty words

It's my own silent message to you
Takes me there, my lover's prayer
And my soul is divided in two
'Cause I can't let go
And my heart has a mind of it's own
It's my lover's prayer

[Verse 1]
I got to get myself together
(Oh, get it together)
I got to get myself together
(You must get it together)
'Cause if I don't do it soon (Soon)
Old age, old age is gonna catch me now

[Verse 2]
I gotta get myself together
(Oh, stop staying out late at night now, yeah)
I got to get myself together
(Deep down in your heart you know that ain't right)
'Cause if I don't do it soon
Old age, old age is gonna catch me now
(It's gonna catch you now, yeah)

[Bridge]
I gotta get myself together
Why don't you get it together?
Lord, Lord, please hear his plea
Find him a good woman
Send her straight home to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I gotta get, get myself together
(Oh, get it together get, it together)
I gotta get myself together
(Oh, I believe you know how to get it together)
'Cause if I don't do it soon
Old age, old age is gonna catch me now

[Outro]
(Get it together)
I gotta get myself together
(Get it together)
I gotta get myself together
(Old age is gonna catch you)
I gotta get myself together
(Get it together)
I gotta get myself together
(Get it together)
(sung by Jo Stafford in one of Frankie's broadcasts)

It's a wonderful world, I'm just walking on air
Talk of heaven on earth, I've got more than my share
Haven't got a care, happy all day thru
It's a wonderful world, loving wonderful you
Writer(s): ray gilbert-duran / antonio carlos jobim

Ah take a look and you'll see the way I have become and the way things became
Sadness and sorrow are here in the little things you touched with your hands
This loving home was a home so happy to protect you and keep you with care
The flowers in the window were smiling were glowing just knowing you were there

Listen my love nevermore don't ever go away
Cause we are you are your life and your dream and we want you to stay
Come in my love come to me don't let this heartless world
Bring another good bye
Embrace me in a simple way
Don't speak don't remember and darling don't cry

[Intro]
What now?

[Verse 1]
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
What now?

[Verse 2]
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I’m supposed to be in love but I’m numb again

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?

[Bridge]
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?

[Outro]
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
So what now?
Listen now boys
My grandmother said -
I'll tell you a story and
Then off to bed
There once was a time
We lived off the land
Harvest would come
And we all lent a hand

But winds blew our lives
And scattered our seeds
Changing the landscape
From flowers to weeds
See in the graveyard
The families gone
The grandest of tombstones
Carry them on...

When you sail from the Harbour
It's your last eyes of Ireland
We tended the fire
And faeries appeased
The flame never died
Until we had to leave
And when we were gone
The house tumbled down
And covered our footprints
We'd left on the ground

When you sail from the Harbour
It's your last eyes of Ireland

My eyes are now tired
And no longer see
But visions of Ireland
Linger in me

So carry your past
In the rooms of your heart
And you'll never he empty
Of love when you part

When you sail from the Harbour
It's your last eyes of Ireland
It's cold and it's getting cold - er
It's gray and white and winter all around
And oh, I must be getting old - er
And all this snow is try'n' to get me down
There's a fire in the corner slowly dying (away)
Sometimes I just don't feel like goin' on (anymore)
And yet I know it's more than worth the waiting
For another chance to see the summer sun
Come on shine on me
There's a fire in the corner slowly dying (away)
Sometimes I just don't feel like goin' on (anymore)
And yet I know it's more than worth the wasting (away)
For another chance to see the summer sun
Come on shine on me
It was winter in Manhattan, falling snow flakes filled the air
The streets were covered with a film of ice
But a little simple magic that I heard about somewhere
Changed the weather all around, just within a trice

I bought you violets for your furs
And it was spring for a while, remember?
I bought you violets for your furs
And there was April in that December

The snow drifted down on the flowers
And it melted where it lay
The snow looked like dew on the blossoms
As on a summer day

I bought you violets for your furs
And there was blue in the wintry sky
Then you pinned the violets to your furs
And gave a lift to the crowds passing by

You smiled at me so sweetly
Since then one thought occurs
That we fell in love completely
The day that I bought you violets for your furs
I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so
Though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain
I'll do my craing in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain

[Verse 1]
When you met me (Oh, oh)
Everything was rosy, ah, ah
If you let me (Oh, oh)
Everything must surely work out fine
When you go (Oh, oh)
Everything that's rosy turns to pieces
You know (Oh, oh)
Everything will go under, believe me

[Chorus]
Where will I run to?
Where would I hide?
If you ever leave me by my side (Do do, do do, do do, do do)
Where will I run to?
What would I do?
I really will, I really can, I really do
I really have a love for you

[Verse 2]
Now, if you get me (Oh, oh)
That could save a thousand conversations
Don't upset me (Oh, oh)
Everything is cosy here tonight
If I move (Oh, oh)
You'd be standing by, it would make a difference
Is it true? (Oh, oh)
Are you coming through, or were you just leaving?

[Chorus]
Where will I run to?
Where would I hide?
If you ever leave me by my side (Do do, do do, do do, do do)
Where will I run to?
Baby, where, where would I hide?
I really will, I really can, I really do
I really have a love for you
Yes, I do (Yes, I do)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when you met me (Oh, oh)
Everything was rosy
When you let me (Oh, oh)
Everything must surely work out fine (Oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, oh oh, oh oh
Would you ever leave me?

[Chorus]
Yeah, where will I run to?
Where would I hide?
If you ever leave me by my side (Do do, do do, do do, do do)
Where will I run to?
Baby, baby, what can I do?
I really will, I really can, I really do
I really have a love for you

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
That's right
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, I do
I really have a love for you, yeah
Have a love for you, yeah
Have a love for you, yeah
Once the mind is calm, Once the ego is quailed
Travel in the realm
Of which there is no sign
Hold your thoughts to the present, the present
Personally realize
The infinite of being
Inner peace brings about
Harmony with the times
Hold your thoughts to the present, the present

Become one with the dusty world
Hold your thoughts to the present
Pacify, realize the infinite
When I take you out tonight with me
Honey, here's the way it's gonna be
You will sit behind a team of snow-white horses in the slickest gig you'll ever see

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top

Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters
Nosy folks will peep through the shutters and their eyes will pop

Those wheels are yellow, the upholstery's brown, the dashboard's genuine leather
With nice bright curtains that can roll right down in case there's a change in the weather

Two bright side lights winking and blinkin
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinking
You can keep your rig if you're thinking that I care to swap
For that shiny little surrey with the fringe on the top

(Would you say the fringe was made of silk?) Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
(Has it really got a team of snow-white horses?)
One's like snow, the others more like milk (so you can tell `em apart)
All the world would fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top
When we hit that road hell for leather
Cats and dogs all dance in the heather
Birds and frogs will sing all together and the toads will hop

The wind will whistle as we rattle along, the cows will moo in the clover
The river will ripple out a whispered song, and whisper it over and over

Don't you wish you'd go on forever
Don't wish you'd go on forever
Don't you wish you'd go on forever and would never stop
In that shiny little surrey with fringe on the top?
Don't know why I wandered off last night
I was having a good time and feeling all right
Feeling right at home with you
Guess I hadn't had enough though of something
And I just go

Saw some of my old running boys over by the back door
Having a laugh thought I'd say hello been a while
Then one thing leads to another I guess
And anyway I just go

I didn't know till you left word for me
Your concern about where I'd disappeared to
And it never crossed my mind
That I'd worried you or been unkind in doing so

And I'm so so sorry I took off so fast
That you felt abandoned and left out like that
Please understand
You see I just don't pay much mind sometimes..
Sometimes I just go
I need you to know
How I long to do all that you want me to
I'd go anywhere at all any time you call
To comfort you

And I take every word of your advice
I'd make any kind of sacrifice to let you know
But there's this other voice calling me sometimes
And I just go

[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

[Pre-Chorus]
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

[Chorus]
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, woah
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, whoa
Shame on me

[Verse 2]
Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out

[Pre-Chorus]
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

[Chorus]
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, whoa

[Breakdown]
Shame on me (Shame on me)
To need release (To need release)
Uncontrollably (Uncontrollably, -lably, -lably, -lably...)

[Chorus]
I wanna go (I wanna go...) all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show (I wanna show...) all the dirt I got running through my mind
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, whoa
He was born in International Falls a long, long time ago
Moved to Tucumcan when the ironwork got show
He was cornbread and hard scrabble and scratching for every dime
'Till he threw it in and he kilt the road to walk that endless line

Now he's The Last Hobo
Riding the last boxcar
On the last freight train
Leaving here

Now he's The Last Hobo
Riding the last boxcar
On the last freight train
Away from here

He tried his hand at lots of jobs and he did 'em all with pride
From shoeing mules to driving trucks, he mastered what he tried
It must have been Ramona, she was all he cared about
When she ran away and left him you could see the fire go out

Now he's The Last Hobo
Riding the last boxcar
On the last freight train
Away from here
We hardly ever see him
Once or twice and he would stay a day or two
He'd ask about Ramona
Then he'd say that he was only passing through
Now he knows every railroad bull along the right of way
And every hobo jungle from New York to Santa Fe
He's looked for his Ramona on the far side of the hill
Now his sun is sinking lower and he's looking for her still

Now he's The Last Hobo
Riding the last boxcar
On the last freight train
Leaving from here

Now he's The Last Hobo
Riding the last boxcar
On the last freight train
Away from here
From "Shaft" Soundtrack

I was so wrapped up in all of the finer things
That I never took the time to show ya
What you meant to me
Money, cars and ice blinging off clothes
I thought that I was hot, until you turned cold
How could my success go and deceive me
If I could turn it all back
Then all of this would be a dream to me
(ooooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh)
Oh,oh
(ooooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh)
Baby, baby
If you saw me in Church on Sunday You could tell
That I've learned my lesson well

Chorus
Never said a prayer
(Oh oh, like this)
Never shead a tear
(Until it was you I missed)
Never fell in love
(Like a bottomless pit)
I was so so tough
Till you were up and outta here
My pride had me thinking that being with me
You were blessed
Funny how you could ask for so little
And receive less
All of the fussin' and fightin'
Cause I was always gone
And even though I gave you a lame excuse you still hung on
Oh I don't blame you for leaving me
If I could turn it all back
This would be a dream to me
(oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooooh)
Ho, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooooh)
Baby, baby, baby
If you could see me on Church on Sunday
You would say I learned my lesson well

Chorus

[Verse 1]
Everybody young and old
Learns how to rock 'n roll
Listen to something new
Everybody sure can do

[Chorus]
Footstompin', footstompin', footstompin', footstompin'
(footstompin', footstompin', footstompin')
Footstompin'
All of the time!

[Verse 2]
Even just the other day
Taught it to my sister, May
Red-haired Mr. Blue
Sure can do that stomping too

[Chorus]

(Hey, Cherry!)

[Bridge]
Wish I could shimmy like my sister Kate
Well she can shimmy like a jelly on a plate

All the girls are
I can't do it
I can do it yeah ha
Ooh

Everybody in the neighbourhood
Knows I can shimmy, shimmy good
I won't be an angel so I ought to be
East going west, I go the west!

Meet me at the dance hall
We're going to have a ball
Show cure
All you want
Forlorn
Reborn

[Chorus]
Ev'rything I want I got , and I got you girl
You really fool me , baby, to my little world
I love you like nobody else
I love you like nobody else
I love you like nobody else

Put yourself in my place
Do you love me too
Take a look at my face
The world I say is you
I love you and nobody else
I love you and nobody else
I love you and nobody else

Play you no games girl (play you no games girl)
I tell you no lies (I tell you no lies)
Oh take my loving hands girl (take my hands girl)
When you look in my eyes (look in my eyes)
I love you like nobody else
I love you like nobody else
I love you like nobody els
She says she likes my watch, but she wants Steve’s AP
And she stay up all hours watching QVC
She said she loves my songs, she bought my MP3
And so I put her number in my Bold BB

I got a black BM, she got a white TT
She wanna see what’s hiding in my CK briefs
I tell her wear suspenders and some PVC
And then I’ll film it all up on my JVC

Uh, scene one. Everybody get in your positions
Pay attention, and listen
We’re tryna get this in one take
So let's try and make that happen
Take one, action!

She pose for FHM, she like my Black LV
We spinnin’ LPR, up on my APC
I’m in my PRPS and my Nike SB’s
Ravin’ with SHM, London to NYC
I got my Visa and my Visa
A diva and her dealer
Bitch I’m up on the guest list
With the Swedish House Mafia

You can find me on a table
Full of vodka and tequila
Surrounded by some bunnies
And it ain't fucking Easter

I wake up in the morning
With a mild case of amnesia
With a girl that like a girl
Like Lindsey Lohan, Queen Latifah

If you niggas are pullin'
Then boy I must be FIFA
And that’s standard procedure from Miami 2 Ibiza
Ain't another woman that can take your spot my...

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular, tell me, would you?

Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you, say "I do"

Yeah, because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Oh, girl
My love
My love

Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote, what would you do?
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team, tell me, would you?

See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure, that baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for, just say "I do"

Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Oh, girl
My love
My love

[Rap by T.I.:]
Alright, it's time to get it JT
I don't know why she hesitates for a man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can

'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly
Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire

I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy

I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will

I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(Love) My love
(Love) My love
(Love) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

(Love) My love
(Love) My love
(Love) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Oh, girl
My love
My love
Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might
Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might
Well, and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right

You fix her breakfast in the morning
Stay at home every day
Even wash the dishes
If she has to go away
You send the children to school
Even mend their hose
Stay up all nights with the babies
Even wash their dirty clothes

Did you ever love a woman?
And you loved her with all your might
Yes, and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right
But when it's time to go to bed
The woman grabs you in her arms
She holds you real tight
She hugs you with all her charms
She calls you a lot of sweet names
Then she turns out the light
She sets your soul on fire
And you say, "Baby, everything is all right"

Did you ever love a woman?
And you loved her with all your might
Yes, and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right
Hang your head, hang your head, Tom Dooley hang your head and cry
Killed poor Laura Foster, you know you're bound to die
Bury her on the hillside, make the people see
Put the coat over, tromp her with your feet
Hang your head Tom Dooley, hang your head and cry
Killed poor Laura Foster, don't you know your bound to die
Bury her on the hillside with other people's lives
Hang your head Tom Dooley, hang your head and cry
Killed poor Laurea Foster, don't you know you're bound to die
First time I went courting, pretty brave of me
Just to sing from her old oak tree
Hang your mama with kindness blame it on this morning

[Verse 1]
Hideous, on the edge of a precipice
The cavity filled up with forgetfulness
Beyond, there's no retribution, only war
The society of oblivion after
Hideous, on the edge of a precipice
The cavity filled up with forgetfulness
Beyond, there's no retribution, only war
The society of oblivion after

The meaning of existence
Can't be supplied by religion or ideology
The meaning of existence
Can't be supplied by religion or ideology
The meaning of existence
Can't be supplied by religion or ideology
The meaning of existence
Can't be supplied by religion or ideology

[Verse 2]
Left to all our creativity, we must find
The real significance that wouldn't be mystified
Left to all our creativity, we must find
The real significance that wouldn't be mystified

[Chorus]
The meaning of existence
Can't be supplied by religion or ideology
The meaning of existence
Can't be supplied by religion or ideology
The meaning of existence

[Verse 2]
Left to all our creativity, we must find
The real significance that wouldn't be mystified
Left to all our creativity, we must find
The real significance that wouldn't be mystified

[Bridge]
The sense or nonsense that will
Emerge from the precipice
Is only the impact of a creative activity
The sense or nonsense that will
Emerge from the precipice
Is only the impact of a creative activity
Chorus:
Uhh Ahh
Uhh Ahh
Uhh Ahh
Uhh Ahh

The love I have right next to me
Is here and always will be
I'm caressing your body emotionally
As you can feel and will see

Oh tell me why can't we go all the way to the top
The fullest extreme
The sounds are here when you're with me
Express the way that you feel
And you say...

Chorus

In a passionate set we're moving close
Every bit of love that we share is the same
I can tell when I reach down deep inside
You show it when you call out my name
Squeezing you tight and holding you close
Is all I feel inside
Although I try to hold in my love
It's something that I just can't hide

Chorus (repeats twice)

Mike (Spoken)
The music is low
The lights are dim, there we lie
Passion overflows
With every look in your eyes
Infatuation, lust and a lot love
Sweet caresses and yes' to me as you rub
And clench my back
Ecstacy fills the air
As you kiss on my neck
And stroke the back of my hair
To hold you tonight
I feel this is my duty
To grasp, to hold, to rock that booty

Chorus (repeats and fades out)

[Verse 1]
The general offered no apologies
He said the soldiers erred in judgement
They should have hired a hooker
No apologies to the outraged Japanese
No sorry, little girl, the pigs just took her

[Chorus]
Tire skids and teeth marks
What happened to this place?
Lawyers and loan sharks
Are laying America to waste

[Verse 2]
Freddie said that Juan thinks I think he's the devil
What a lofty title for such a petty little tyrant
Bigger beasts abound and they kick this world around
At this crazy speed with violence and greed

[Chorus]
Tire skids and teeth marks
What happened to this place?
Lawyers and loan sharks
Are laying America to waste

[Verse 3]
So what makes a man a man in these tough times?
As drug lords buy up the banks and warlords radiate the oceans
Ecosystems fail, snakes and snails and puppy tails
Are wagging in the womb beneath the trampled moon

[Chorus]
Tires kids and teeth marks
What happened to this place?
Lawyers and loan sharks
Are laying America to waste

[Outro]
The general offered no apologies
Hello, baby, I'm so glad to be back
Got news for you, baby, that's a nat'ral fact
Since I am back, let's get into our act

I love you, baby, more than words can say
You know I've missed you while I was away
Now, come back, baby, now it's time to play

Now, flop, roll, while I sing
Do you know love will do anything?
You gotta shake your boogie, I'm gonna shake mine too
You sweet little angel, you've got a lot of lovin' to do

[Verse 1]
Gomen Nasai
I'm so sorry, Gomen Nasai
I am so sorry I made you cry
Won't you forgive me dear
Goman Nasai
Nights have been lonely, my days are blue
Because I made a fool of you
Won't you forgive me dear

[Bridge]
My butterfly heart has brought you pain
Won't you forgive, won't you forget
Let's be sweethearts again

[Verse 2]
Goman Nasai
Nights would be heaven, love fill my days
If you'd believe me when I say
I love you Gomen Nasai

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
My butterfly heart has brought you pain
Won't you forgive, won't you forget
Let's be sweethearts again

[Verse 3]
Goman Nasai
Nights would be heaven, love fill my days
If you'd believe me when I say
I love you, Gomen Nasai

[Outro]
I love you, Gomen Nasai
I love you, Gomen Nasai
If I had my druthers I'd go fishin'
Find myself a lake and a lazy day
If I had my druthers I'd quit wishin'
Get off the old caboose get on my way

Give me whole lots of laughter
Great big barrels of fun
Nightime full of romance
Daytime full of fun

If I had my druthers I'd go flyin' - oooh
Lookin' for the things I'd like to see - yeah
If I had my druthers I'd be tryin' tryin'
The only way to be what I can be

Give me somebody to love me
Make me feel like the only one
Something thst's worth doing Lord
I feel good when it's well done

If I had my druthers I'd go sailin' - yes I would
Catch me campin' out on the open sea
If I had my druthers I'd be singin'
Just how good this good life feels to me - feels so good
You just need somesome to talk to
Something you can share
You don't need no reason for livin' Lord
It's already there - yes it is - oooh oooh

It makes me giggle
I can't sit down

I'm goin' fishin'!!!
Yeah, you get off of my back, baby
Can't you tell you're choking me
Oh I ain't no pony, baby
Can't you tell you're choking me
Yeah, you just get off of my back, baby
Can't you see you're hurting me

Well, I don't mind helping you, baby
Every now, now and then
Yes, you ain't helped yourself, baby
Since God knows when
So you just get off of my back now, baby
Can't you see you're hurting me

Yes, I'm standing here telling you, baby
This is the end of the line
Yes, I'm tired of you riding me, baby
I declare I ain't lying
So you just get off of my back, baby
Can't you see you're hurting me
Well, you get off, get off, get off, baby
'Cause you're a heavy, heavy load
Yes, you can catch yourself
Another ride, baby
Somewhere further down the road
You just get off, get off, baby
Can't you see you're hurting me
Oh, but all I know, is all I know
It's the disco infiltrator for sure
But all I see, is all I see
But still you want it, oh
Stop, you can't believe, what you believe
Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh, stupid me, oh, stupid me
But still we want it, oh

Stop, we can't shake the waist
Oh, stop, you've got to shake the waist

Stop, what you've been told is what you're told
It's the disco infiltrator gone cold
Oh, stupid you, I bet' told the truth
But you don't want it, no
Stop, you make me frown your little town
You run the disco infiltrator on down
Oh, stupid you, oh, stupid me
And we deserve it, oh
Stop, you can shake the waist
Oh, stop, you've got to shake the waist

Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time

Oh, but all I know, is all I know
It's the disco infiltrator for sure
But all I see, is all I see
But still you want it, oh
Stop, you can't believe what you believe
Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh, stupid me, oh, stupid me
Oh, but still we want it, oh

Stop, you can't shake your waist
Oh, don't stop, you've got to shake your waist
Stop, you can't shake your waist
Oh, don't stop, you've got to shake your waist

Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Behind

[Intro]
Days, days, days
Days, days, days
Days, days

[Verse 1]
So who's that lady with her picture painted on my everything?
And what is she trying to say now?
I could probably spend my time thinking all about some better things
I've been floating for so long, think I'm ready to drown

[Bridge]
Said I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
Yeah I'm going down, down, down, down, down, down

[Hook]
I'm in way over my head these (days)
I'm in way over my head most (days)
I'm in way over my head most (days)
I'm in way over my head most (days)
I'm in way over my head most (days)
Most (days)
Most (days)
Most (days)

[Verse 2]
I'm sticking to deprive 'em of it all
Something beautiful to brace my fall
Gotta find a melody
Gotta guide some memories
And don't believe in what they say
A predator will find his prey
Close your eyes and run around
They comin' now to hunt you down
And can open up the blinds let the light in, please
I get kind of tired of fighting
We need make love, we need to make love

Days, days

[Outro]
This is confusion, confusion
This confusion, confusion
There's a confusion, confusion
There's a confusion, confusion
There's confusion
A kiss is not a contract
But it's very nice
Yes it's very nice
Just because you've been exploring my mouth
Doesn't mean you get to take an expedition to the south
A kiss is not a contract
But it's very nice
Yes it's very very nice
Just because we've been playing tonsil hockey
Doesn't mean you get to score the goal in my jockeys
Just because I'm in an acoustic folk band
It doesn't mean I only want poon-tang
I can't go around loving everyone
I just wouldn't get anything done
Oh because...
I'm only one man
Baby
We're only two men, Ladies
Baby, oh pretty babies
They are one of the same
Two inevitables
Two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables
Two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables
Two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables
Two inevitables
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables
Two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables
Two inevitables
We can't avoid dying
Bursting through our barriers
They are one of the same
They are one of the same
Two inevitables
Two inevitables
We can't avoid dying

[Verse 1]
Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue

[Verse 2]
I knew, you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new

[Verse 3]
Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wondering, what in the world did I do?

[Chorus]
Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying, I'm crazy for crying
I'm crazy for loving you

I'm crazy for crying, I'm crazy for trying
I'm crazy for loving you
Last night, I had a dream about you
In this dream, I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
The kind of feeling I've waited so long

Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam, the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little, little fun
We were dancing all night long

The time is right to put my arms around you
You're feeling right, you wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it, this dream was all gone

Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true

Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true
Why don't you play the game?
Why don't you play the game?

[Intro]
We don't need a label
What we got is sexy
If you like it, I love it
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You let me in (mmm, uh-huh)
You told me to come back again (uh-huh, ha)
You into me, I'm into you (mmm, uh-huh)
That's all that matters girl, it's beautiful (be-be-beautiful)

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so sweet like candy, you're so sweet like candy
What we got, what we got, so, so sweet like candy
With no label on it, with no label on it (hey, hey, hey)
What we got, what we got (hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Let's make it up as we go
Don't stop the party, it's just getting started, oh
Make it up as we go, I know you want it
I'm all up on it, oh
What we got is sexy, what we got is sexy
Lay me down, undress me, oh
Let's make it up as we go
Hey, make it up, make it up, girl
Make it up, make it up
Make it up, make it up, girl
Let's make it up as we go

[Verse 2]
Uh, yeah, your friends are mad (mmm, uh-huh)
Hating 'cause we've got no strings attached, oh (yeah, uh-huh)
I know you would agree life is hella good (mmm, uh-huh) (oh yeah)
But every masterpiece is, misunderstood, misunderstood

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so sweet like candy, you're so sweet like candy
What we got, what we got, so, so sweet like candy
With no label on it, with no label on it (hey, hey, hey)
What we got, what we got (hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Let's make it up as we go
Don't stop the party, yeah, it's just getting started, oh
Make it up as we go, I know you want it
I'm all up on it, oh, hey
What we got is sexy, what we got is sexy (c'mon)
Lay me down, undress me, oh
Let's make it up as we go
Hey, make it up, make it up, girl
Make it up, make it up (yeah)
Make it up, make it up, girl

[Bridge]
Is it as good for you (uh-huh), as it is for me? (Uh-huh)
I dig it, I dug it, for real
Is it as good for you (uh-huh), as it is for me? (Uh-huh)
'Cause I dig it, I dug it

[Chorus]
So we'll make it up as we go
Don't stop the party, haha, it's just getting started, oh
Make it up as we go, I know you want it (oh, baby, baby)
I'm all up on it, oh (oh, no)
What we got is sexy, what we got is sexy (oh, baby)
Lay me down, undress me, oh
Let's make it up as we go

[Outro]
Hahaha
You know I fucks with you
Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write

I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And darling then
I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart

I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And darling then
I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
You take, you take
Away, away

[Verse: Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night, today?
Something in here's not right, today
Why does it feel like night, today?
Paranoia's all I got left

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
You take, you take
Away, away

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
This is so fun
This whole project is, like, fun
Did that sound good?
That's right

[Verse 1]
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint
But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

[Verse 2]
Now, don't you try an' move me, you're just gonna lose
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you've been refused
Well, it's sugar for sugar and salt for salt
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

[Verse 3]
Well, that high tide's risin', mama, don't you let me down
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Yes, you're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow
Politician come to power take it slow
People need what you know
You're a leader so you have to play along
Show the hand right or wrong
When you're feelin' that you know the way to turn
Either way still get burned
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong
It's the pride that keeps you strong

Don't you think it's fascinating?
Don't you think it's fascinating?
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride
(when you finally break it all down it's the pride)
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride
(when you finally break it all down it's the pride)

What makes you want to do the best you can?
What makes you a better man?
What makes you try again before too long?
What keeps you standing strong?
What makes you say the things you want to say
To make it a better day?
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong
It's the pride that keeps you strong
Don't you think it's fascinating?
Don't you think it's fascinating?
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride
(when you finally break it all down it's the pride)
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride
(when you finally break it all down it s the pride)
Someday, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
Will find a way of forgiving
Somewhere...
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us
Somewhere
There's a time for us
Someday there'll time for us
Time together and time to spare
Time to learn, time to care
Someday, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
Will find there's a way of forgiving
Somewhere...
There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow...
Someday, somewhere...

[Verse 1]
What to wear
What to say
What to do on a sunny day
Who to phone
Who to fight
Who to dance with on Sunday night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Reaching the very edge, you know
Reaching the very edge
Going to the other side
Reaching the very edge

[Chorus]
You're still breathing but you don't know why
Life's a bitch and sometimes you die
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath but the pretty things are going to hell

[Verse 2]
I am a drug, I am a dragon
I am the best jazz you've ever seen
I am a dragon, I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets, I found gold
I find you out before you grow old
I found you out before you grow old
What is eternal?
What is damned?
What is clay and what is sand?
Who to dis?
Who to truss?
Who to listen to?
Who to suss?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm reaching the very edge, you know
I'm reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
I'm reaching the very edge

[Chorus]
You're still breathing but you don't know why
Life's a bitch and sometimes you die
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath but the pretty things are going to hell
Don't ever take yourself away
Don't ever take yourself
To a place where I can't find you
Don't ever take yourself away

I will never leave you
Will never deceive you
I'll be right there walkin' behind you

Dearest, I think you're the one
I can't imagine anybody doin'
More to me than you do

Dearest, if it's your heart that I won
There's no need for blame
And no reason to be ashamed
Of that place where we stand in the sun

Don't ever take yourself away
Don't ever take yourself
To a place where I can't find you
Don't ever take yourself away
I will never leave you
I will never deceive you
I'll be right there walkin' behind you

Dearest, let us not drift apart
It wouldn't be wise
It wouldn't be civilized
It wouldn't be smart

Time heals a broken heart
You've been hurt
You've been left in the dirt
But you still look brand new to me

Don't ever take yourself away
Don't ever take yourself
To a place where I can't find you
Don't ever take yourself away

I will never leave you
I will never deceive you
I'll be right there walkin' behind you

Dearest, you're the answer to my prayers
Words can't express
If my heart would confess
What you mean to me
Dearest, I can't help knowin' that you're the best
I don't have to feel you to know that you're real
You're more than a dream to me

Don't ever take yourself away
Don't ever take yourself
To a place where I can't find you
Don't ever take yourself away

I will never leave you
I will never deceive you
I'll be right there walking behind you

[Hook: Machel Montano]
It's alright, you walked up on back of me and it's so tight
No space to move up in here but the vibes nice
We don't really care what nobody say
We come to ride my jeep, we come to break away

[i]It's alright, I've been watching you, baby, all night
The way you move your body is so right
And I just want to say
Hey, hey, baby, what's your name?
Hey, hey, baby, what's your name?

[i]

[Bridge: Pitbull]
It's alright, it's okay
We gon' party all night and drink all day
It's alright, it's okay
We gon' party all night and drink all day

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Pit and Machel came to take over the world
If you don't believe me just watch us
God bless Haiti and just like Haitians
It takes more than earthquakes to stop us
What don't kill you make you stronger
And there's nothing that can feed this hunger
We gon' keep coming with the heat
Skippity do wop and flip the beat
Pit got this, watch this, you sound monotonous
Stop this, I already told you, not this
Hey Miss, you me, me you
You and I tonight, alright?

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2: Machel Montano]
Shake up your body now it's alright
Wind up your body 'cause it's okay
Jump up and down and do what you like
Work up yourself and go crazy
Drink what we want and do it all night
Party don't stop 'til the break of day
Pump up the music, turn up the lights
Swing it, don't stop until we say
Girl get fine and wind up your bomba
Boy, wind up like you don't care
Back in time, now rev up the bomba
Love, all the man, them balling

[Hook + Bridge]

[Outro: Pitbull]
Vamos pa' tra

Machel, I just want to say thank you dog
For always showing me love when I come through Trindad
On a hill, inside a house in covewell reach
Stands a man who's feeling very tired
Looking at a song he wrote some time ago
Could have made it big inside a Broadway show
Every day I go away and find ideas
Think, I'll climb on top of somewhere high
Couldn't I write a song about a man who's dead
Didn't really know if he was off his head

Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes
Too bad for Gilbert Green
We can tell the world that he was right

Sitting in his attic on a sunny day
Mending 50 goblets that are worn

Humming to himself a song of yesteryear
His hearing wasn't good but his eyes were clear

Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes
Too bad for Gilbert Green
We can tell the world that he was right
Now the house is burnt along with Gilbert Green
Sad to see his sisters stand and cry
And in the basement lies a song that wasn't seen
Tells the tale of laughing men and yellow beans

Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes
Too bad for Gilbert Green
Now we can tell the world that he was right
Every man should marry, every girl should wed
You will find no truer words ever have been said
Every man is sentimental, he's just a dreamer at heart
He needs someone soft and gentle to give his dream a start
I don't know how to tell you, don't know what to say
Something has come over me, since you came my way
Yes, I'm plain old-fashioned, old-fashioned as can be
Every man should marry, won't you marry me?
Don't know how to tell you, I don't know what to say
Something has come over me, since you came my way
Guess I'm plain old-fashioned, old-fashioned as can be
Every man should marry, won't you marry me?

There are children
Who are so unwell
They have to live their
Lives in hospitals
They're feeling lost-pital
Mospital

[Dave Dobbyn (Savage)]
Children getting sicker
Drinking too much bubble mixture
They all just wanna be bubbles

[Boh Runga]
There must be something we can do
To stop these kids from doing spews

Kids need us
To come together
We can make them better
We can get them some feta

Can raffle scooters, cars
And movie vouchers

[McKenzie]
John, stop blowing
All the money on couches

[Clement]
We need a million
And a hundred
Ten and twenty-one dollars

[Zowie]
We need to build a trap
So we can catch all the robbers

[Rikki Morris]
We'll take their money
We'll rob the robbers

[Nathan King]
So we can fill a house
Fill a house full of dollars

[Victoria Girling-Butcher]
We'll go to peoples and
Ask to borrow some money

[Flight of the Conchords]
They'll probably all just
Give us some money

[Runga]
We give them back less money
And cause a confusion

[Flight of the Conchords]
That's the solution
Yeah, that's the collusion

Gets it from the queen

The queen gets the money
From the bank
Who gets it from the
Prime minister

[Young Sid]
The craziest financial
System I've ever seen

[Savage]
The kids that are sick can't do hip-hops anymore
Their tummies, their tummies could be very sore
We've gotta dig for some oil and some crystals and gold
Collect teeth for the tooth fairy and put 'em in a bowl

[Bridge]
Flight of the Conchords and Savage: In a bowl!
Kids of 88: In a bowl!
Flight of the Conchords and Savage: In a bowl!
Cherie Mathieson: In a bowl!
Flight of the Conchords and Savage: In a bowl!

[Tyree]
Stop writing lyrics about yourself
Get your magic wallet up off the shelf
Oh no that wallet's not there anymore
I know late night come knock at my door

[PNC]
We sneak in the room where my parents snore
My dad leaves his jeans lying on the floor
In his back pocket there's a wallet we can score
Get about 50 dollars or maybe more

[Tyree]
Your dad catches you with wallet in hand
Say it's for the kids, he'll understand

[PNC]
Don't need to worry, don't need to hide
I just tell my dad to feel inside

[Hook]
All: Feel inside
And stuff like that
Open up the lids
Help-a-help-a-help-a the kids
Feel inside
Savage: Feel inside
All: Open up the lids
Help-a-help-a-help-a the kids
You hear me calling at the crack of dawn
Jump up brothers come and face the morn
Forget your aching from the day before
'Cause today we're goin' to do that and more

Lead man holler, yo oh ho
All men follow, down you go for a working dollar
Yes he holler yo oh ho, all men follow
Down we go for a working dollar

I want de men, the women and the children too
We got a long day out we got a lot to do
We got to cut up, stack up and load the cane
You better bring a shawl 'cause it look like rain

Lead man holler, yo oh ho
All men follow, down you go for a working dollar
Yes he holler yo oh ho, all men follow
Down we go for a working dollar

Well a working man I am tired and true
I won't ask you nothin' that I wouldn't do
Well you pay today is the same as last
Your work's the same, just a little fast
Lead man holler, yo oh ho
All men follow, down you go for a working dollar
Yes he holler yo oh ho, all men follow
Down we go for a working dollar

Well I'd like to tell you 'bout yesterday
You work quite well, I am proud to say
I want ev'ry man to try his will
And make yesterday look like he was standing still

Lead man holler, yo oh ho
All men follow, down you go for a working dollar
Yes he holler yo oh ho, all men follow
Down we go for a working dollar
I asked the wiseman one sunny day
Can you help me find my way
You're so much older and wiser too
Would you help me Mr. Wiseman
I'm feelin' blue
Oh I'm not satisfied

He said you're not doin too bad, not bad at all
You're just trying to walk son before you can crawl
You got stacks of money to sky up above
Now all you need is to find you a love

He sent me searchin' to find my love
He sent me searchin' to the Lord up above
He sent me searchin' just to find the mornin' dove
And she'll tell you where to find your love
Oh Mr. Wiseman I need to find my love

You can have anything in this God's world
But you won't be happy son 'til you find a girl
Now you can be happy boy if you try
Find a woman boy, you'll be satisfied
He sent me searchin' to find my love
He sent me searchin', I said Lord up above
He sent me searchin' just to find the mornin' dove
And she'll tell you where to find your love

He sent me searchin' to find my love
He sent me searchin', I said Lord up above
He sent me searchin' just to find the mornin' dove
And she'll tell you where to find your love

Oh Lord, he sent me searchin'
The flame of love we had has finally died
Can't take this emptiness it left inside
It's over now

And though I played the role I lost my soul
It's still within your heart
It's over now
It's over now
Shades of blue and purple haunt me

The noise outside my window carries on
Like distant bugles love is very gone
It's over now

It took a part of me, the heart of me
To watch it fade away
It's over now
It's over now
Shades of blue and purple haunt me

Heaven
Heaven is far away
Angels no longer play
I need to take this fear and force it down
And just pretend that you are not around
It's over now

I'll put a Frank Sinatra album on
And cry my blues away
It's over now
It's over now
Shades of blue and purple haunt me
(Why remind me) the way we used to talk and laugh
I don't need any photograph to think of you 

[think of you]
(Why remind me) the way we danced the whole night long
I don't need records of our song to sing it through
I don't need books of matches to remember our caf‚
What earthly good are matches to a flame of yesterday?
(Why remind me) I know our love has played its part
I'm only asking of my heart to stop reminding me of you

(I don't need any matches to remember our caf‚.)
(What earthly good are matches) to a flame of yesterday
(Why remind me I know our love has played its part,)
(I'm only asking of my heart) to stop reminding me of you
It just keeps reminding me of you
Take away any desire in me that hurts You
Take away anything that stands between You and me
I want to be what You created me to be
It's my desire that You find favor in me
Lord, take away anything that displeases You

Take away any evil thought within me
Take away anything that proves to break Your heart
I want to be in sweet communion with You
It's my desire to do everything You want me to do
Lord, take away anything that displeases You

Remove all doubt, all insecurity
Erase all hate, all iniquity
Discard all the fear found deep within me
Lord, take away anything that displeases You

Take away Lord
Take away
Take away any desire in me that hurts You
Take it away
When that ev'nin' sun goes down
Yeah, you'll find me hangin' around
Because the night life
It ain't no good life but it's my life

Yeah, yeah, yeah listen to the blues
Listen to what they're sayin'
Oh, please listen to the blues
Listen to the blues they're playin'

Ah, ah, all of the people just like you and me
They're all dreamin' about their old used to be
Because the night life
It ain't no good life but it's my life

They tell me life's an empty scene
An avenue of broken dreams
Because the night life
It ain't no good life but it's my life

[Verse 1]
Always on your own
Don't consider trying
Tried you on the phone
But you considered lying

[Hook]
Never had a doubt I'm losing

[Verse 2]
So I'm tidying my room
Trying to be careful
Drinking in the afternoon and lighting up whilst tearful

Hoping that you're still unhappy
I'll do everything I can
To make sure that you are never happy

[Verse 3]
Breaking out of this cocoon and clawing at the camera
Seeing you would be too soon
I'm stupid if I want more
Hoping that you die unhappy
I'll do anything I can
To make sure that you are never happy

[Hook]
Never had a doubt I'm losing

[Verse 4]
So unsure of every question in the dark
Trying hard not to go with anything you gave me
I'm so scared and down on friends
So please pretend there is no end
Trying not to be a victim in your game
I know your dirty ways
I know you feel the same
It kills me deep inside
I hope you cry when you see what you have inside

Never had a doubt I'm losing
I'll do anything I can
To make sure that you are never happy
You're breaking my heart, baby
There ain't a damn thing I can do
You got me wringing my hands
And crying, baby
While you're breaking my heart in two
You know I just can't believe
I can't believe, baby
That you're doing the things you do

I can't believe, baby
I can't believe you would do me wrong
Please have mercy on me, baby
I want you to come on back
Come on back where you belong
I want you so bad
I want you so bad, baby
You know I need my lady home
I went down to the station
I leaned up against the door
Yeah, I went down to the station
I leaned up against the door
I said good-bye to my sweet, ride on
I said now, she couldn't use me no more

It was a mean old fireman
And a cruel old engineer
He was a mean old fireman
And a cruel old engineer
Yes, takin' way my sweet woman
And left me standing here

Break:

I used to roll my baby
Till she - was forced to jump and shout
I used to roll my sweet baby
Till she was forced to jump and shout
Now that train pulls in boys
And I'll come walkin out
I heard the fireman blow the whistle
And the engineer ring the bell
I heard the fireman blow the whistle
And engineer ring the bell
I knew it was time boys
To - bid my baby farewell
Um

Jesse James and Frank James
Billy the Kid and all the rest
Supposed to be some bad cats
Out in the West

But when they dug me
And my gangster ways
They hung up their guns
And made into their graves

Cause I'm a gangster of love
Say, I'm a gangster of love
Oh, well now
When I walk down the street
All the girls that I meet
Say: "he's a gangster of love"

(Yeah!)

I robbed a local beauty contest
For their first place winner
They found her with me out in Hollywood
Eating a big steak dinner
They tried to get her to go back
To pick up her prize
She stood up and told them:
"You just don't realize, that he's a gangster of love"
And in the morning
Gangster of love
(Uuh yeah, now!)
When I walk in to a bar
Girls from... from near and far
Say: "he's a gangster of love"

(Alright!)

I jump on my white horse Cadillac
I ride across the border line
I rope 65 girls
I kiss them all the same time
I take 25 or 30
I put 'em all on a freight
A million dollar reward for me
In each and every state
Sheriff say "Is you Johnny "Guitar" Watson?"
In a very deep voice
And I say "yes sir brother sheriff, and that's your wife on the back of my horse"

Cause I'm a gangster of love
I'm a gangster of love

(Yeah!)
When I walk down the street
All the girls that I meet
Say: "he's a gangster of love"

[Intro: (Wyclef Jean (Lil Wayne))]
Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
She wined for the bill
Grind for the bill
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill

[Verse 1: (Wyclef Jean)]
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
High school she was
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard
All you wanna know is (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)

[Chorus: (Akon) ]
Cos I'mma tell you like wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill yall(dollar, dollar bill yall)
Singin' dollar dollar bill yall(dollar, dollar bill yall)
Cos I'mma tell you like wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill yall(dollar, dollar bill yall)
Singin' dollar dollar bill yall(dollar, dollar bill yall)

[Verse 2: (Akon)]
Pimpin' got harder cos, hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club shakin' for a dub
For triple times the money and spending it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow
You getting' pressure from cops
You don't know not to lay low
Because 25 to life is no joke
To all my real gorillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women getting' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

[Chorus: (Akon) ] (x2)
Cos I'mma tell you like wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill yall(dollar, dollar bill yall)
Singin' dollar dollar bill yall(dollar, dollar bill yall)
Cos I'mma tell you like wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill yall(dollar, dollar bill yall)
Singin' dollar dollar bill yall(dollar, dollar bill yall)

[Bridge: (Wyclef Jean)]
Money, money-money-money
Money, money-money-money
It drives the world crazy

[Verse 3: (Lil Wayne)]
(Weezy) She used to be (she used to be the sweetest girl)
She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Now she like sour ameretta
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks off the track right by school
She takes a loss cos she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him, (in the background Weezy- Where my money at?

[Chorus: (Akon) ] (x2)
Cos I'mma tell you like wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill yall(dollar, dollar bill yall)
Singin' dollar dollar bill yall(dollar, dollar bill yall)
Cos I'mma tell you like wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill yall(dollar, dollar bill yall)
Singin' dollar dollar bill yall(dollar, dollar bill yall)

[Outro: (Wyclef Jean)]
Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill (where my money at?)
She wined for the bill
Grind for the bill (where my money at?)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay the bill (where my money at?)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill
Well a-when the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in
Mm I want to be, I'm gonna be in that number
Ooo when the saints go marching in

Oh when the sun yeah begins to shine
When that old sun begins to shine
I tell you something I'm gonna be I'm gonna be in that number
When the sun begins to shine

Yeah when my lord calls me home again
Ah when my lord calls me home again
I'll tell you I'm gonna be in that number
Oh when my lord calls me home again

Oh when the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in
I tell you something I'm gonna be I'm gonna be in that number
When the saints go marching in

Well when the sun yeah begins to shine
When that sun begins to shine
I tell you something I'm gonna be I'm gonna be in that number
When that old sun begins to shine
Lazy one time
Mm mm, yeh, alright, mm, yeah
Ooo when the saints go marching in

Yeah when my lord calls me home again
Ah when my lord calls me home again
I'll tell you I'm gonna be in that number
Oh when the saints go marching in
Maybe you like to give a kiss so sweet
Only for one night you belong to me
Maybe you go away and drive a car
But the taste of wine is worse than none at all
In that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Well, if you feel like loving me and if you got the notion
I second that emotion
Maybe you think that love would tie you down
You ain't got the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love would make you a fool
So it makes you wise to break the rule
In that case I don't want no part
That would only break my heart
Well, if you feel like loving me and if you got that notion
I second that emotion
Well, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion

[Verse 1]
This old guitar taught me to sing a love song
Showed me how to laugh and how to cry
It introduced me to some friends of mine
And brightened up some days
It helped me make it through some lonely nights
Oh, what a friend to have on a cold lonely night

[Verse 2]
This old guitar gave me my lovely lady
It opened up her eyes and ears to me
It brought us close together
I guess it broke her heart
But it opened up the space for us to be
What a lovely place, a lovely space to be

[Verse 3]
This old guitar gave me my life, my living
All the things you know I love to do
To serenade the stars that shine
From a sunny mountain side
Most of all, to sing my songs for you
Ooh, I love to sing my songs for you
Yes I do, Lord, I love to sing my songs for you
I was born in Saginaw Michigan and I grew up in a house on Saginaw bay
My daddy was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl in Saginaw Michigan she was the daughter of a very, very wealthy man
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And not good enough to ever claim his daughter's hand

That's why I'm up here in Alaska lookin' around for gold
Like a crazy fool I'm diggin' in the frozen ground so cold
But with each day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw Michigan

I wrote my love in Saginaw Michigan
I said honey I'm a coming home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad that I'm coming back a richer man
I hit the biggest strike in Klondyke history

Her daddy met the bus in Saginaw Michigan
And he gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said son you're a wise young, ambitious man
Why don't you sell your father-in-law your Klondyke claim
Now he's up there in Alaska diggin' in the cold, cold ground
That greedy fool is a lookin' for the gold I never found
But it serves him right and nobody here is missing him
Least of all the newly weds of Saginaw Michigan

[Verse 1]
Empty room, empty room
How am I gonna fill you?
How am I gonna fill this empty room?

[Verse 2]
Love is strong, however long
We should've been forever
How am I ever gonna fill this empty room?

[Verse 3]
Found a strand of your hair
By the bathroom window
How am I ever gonna get you off my mind?

[Verse 4]
In my bed, in my head
Every word you've spoken
Now how am I gonna fill this empty room?

[Verse 5]
Lonely hearts, worlds apart
Why should they be broken?
When we could be somewhere makin' love

[Verse 2 Reprise]
Love is strong, however long
We should've been forever
Baby, why did you leave me all alone?
Why'd you do it?

[Verse 6]
Barren walls, tears fall
What's the use in cryin'?
I gotta find a way, find a way to fill this empty room
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)
(Ahh)
(Ah, my my, what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my my, what elation)
(Oh, my my, what)

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'

(Ahh)

Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations) (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations

Na na na na na, na na na

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
Now I know how to get down on the floor (Floor)
Experienced in moves you can't ignore ('Nore)
But something 'bout this beat that's got me hooked (Hooked)
Come over here and take a closer look (Look)

[Pre-Chorus: Kylie Minogue & Taio Cruz]
'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
I do this just for kicks, just for the thrill (Thrill)
I got this high without takin' a pill (Pill)
This groove has got me way over the sun (Sun)
I'm dancin' like I am the only one (One)

[Pre-Chorus: Kylie Minogue & Taio Cruz]
'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Bridge: Taio Cruz, & Kylie Minogue]
The music's got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Jennifer Lopez]
You don't do love? You do love
You do love *laughs

[Joe Budden]
Jenny *laughs
We gon do it like

[Verse 1]
Taking away the fact that I care about you, it's just your way
So sweet, everything seems right around you
Did you know that you had this calming way about you when you touch?
And I wanna know if I could be your girl

[Chorus]
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you

[Verse 2]
I'm happy to say in a lot of ways you've changed me
Makes me smile when you said you were glad the day you found me
I'm wishing away any harm that might ever find you
Heaven knows, I really feel I'll always be your girl

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The one who puts her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you (Your girl)
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else sees, I can see it (I just wanna be your girl)
The one who knows when something's wrong
The one who knows your favorite song (I just wanna be your girl)
The one who all your family loves
The one you place no one above (Your girl)

[Chorus]
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She used to make her own pay checks
And bring them all home to me
I would go out on the hillside, you know
And make every woman look I see

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She said she was gonna leave me
She'd been running around with the boys
She said she was gonna leave me
Gonna be over in Illinois
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you
What can I say - she's walking away - from what we've seen
What can I do - still lovin' you - it's all a dream

How can we hang on - to a dream
How can it ever be - the way it seems
How can we hang on - to a dream

What can I say - she's walking away - from how it was
What can I try - I still don't see why - she says what she does
How can we hang on - to a dream
How can it ever be - the way it seems

What can I say - she's walking away - from what we've seen
What can I do - still loving you - it's all a dream

How can we hang on - to a dream
How can it ever be - the way it seems
How can we hang on - to a dream
Here's to you baby
May Christmas bring you happiness
Oh here's to you baby
May Christmas bring you happiness
I want you to have a good time

Yeah, Merry Christmas baby, Happy New Year
Have fun because Christmas don't come but once a year
Here's to you honey
May Christmas bring you happiness
I want you to have a good time
Like we did on all the rest

All the presents my love, under the Christmas tree
Remind me of your love that means so much to me
Here's to you
May Christmas bring you happiness
I want you to have a good time baby
Like we did on all the rest
We'll enjoy ourselves together, Christmas dinners and everything
We'll share every little pleasure every Christmas brings
Here's to you
May Christmas bring you happiness
I want you to have a good time
Like we did on all the rest

I wanna be home with you baby when New Years roll around
We'll make our resolutions before the sun goes down
Here's to you honey
May Christmas bring you happiness
I want you to have a good time
Like we did on all the rest
Railroad Bill, Railroad Bill
He never worked, and he never will
And it's ride, ride, ride

Railroad Bill he was a mighty mean man
He shot the midnight lantern out of the brakeman's hand
And it's ride, ride, ride

Railroad Bill you know he took my wife
Said if I didn't like it, he would take my life
I'm gonna ride, ride, ride

Goin' up the mountain, goin' out west
.38 Spec a-stickin' out of my vest
I’m gonna ride, ride, ride

Buy me a pistol just as long as my arm
And shoot anybody who does me any harm
I’m gonna ride, ride, ride

Railroad Bill, Railroad Bill
He never worked, and he never will
Ride, ride, ride
Honey honey, honey think that I'm a fool
Think I would quit you when the weather is cool
Ride, ride, ride
I don't want you to be no slave, I don't want you to work all day
I don't want you to 'cause I'm set for you
I just wanna make love to you, love to you, love to you

Snow Man - PRINCE

Christmas in Belgium was different
Than the ones spent in L.A
The Christmas I got no presents
Still me and my brother played
Near the ocean makin' the snow man
On his face we were makin' a smile
Cuz just like a daddy
The snow man had style

CHORUS:
Snow man, snow man
Another Christmas gone
I got a chess game this time
A bishop takes the pawn
Sometimes I wanna go back where
The ocean swallows the shore
I could still see him smiling
When my snow man is no more, no more
Winter seldom passing
Where the memory doesn't sway
2 the smell of a Christmas dinner
Shared the family way (Shared in the family way)
Everything seems so perfect
That nothing would dare go wrong
But tears come with the summer
So long, so long (So long)

CHORUS

Snow man

I look at my hands and I wonder
Will they ever make anyone smile
The way the snow man made me

CHORUS

(Snow man) {repeat till end}

[Verse 1]
On the road of experience
I'm trying to find my own way
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away
When I think that I'm moving
Suddenly things stand still
I'm afraid 'cause I think they always will

[Chorus 1]
And I'm looking for space
And to find out who I am
And I'm looking to know and understand
It's a sweet, sweet dream
Sometimes I'm almost there
Sometimes I fly like an eagle
And sometimes I'm deep in despair

[Verse 2]
All alone in the universe
Sometimes that's how it seems
I get lost in the sadness and the screams
Then I look in the center
Suddenly everything's clear
I find myself in the sunshine and my dreams

[Chorus 1]
And I'm looking for space
And to find out who I am
And I'm looking to know and understand
It's a sweet, sweet dream
Sometimes I'm almost there
Sometimes I fly like an eagle
And sometimes I'm deep in despair

[Verse 3]
On the road of experience
Join in the living day
If there's an answer
It's just that it's just that way

[Chorus 2]
When you're looking for space
And to find out who you are
When you're looking to try and reach the stars
It's a sweet, sweet, sweet dream
Sometimes I'm almost there
Sometimes I fly like an eagle
And sometimes I'm deep in despair

[Outro]
Sometimes I fly like an eagle
Like an eagle
I go flying high

[Verse 1]
Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends, then when do we start?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

[Chorus]
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have some things to say
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?

[Verse 2]
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
Yeah, oh, oh
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive

[Chorus]
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel

[Outro]
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel
Love me tender, love me sweet, never let me go
You have made my life complete and I love you so
Love me tender, love me true, all my dreams fulfilled
For my darling, I love you and I always will

Love me tender, love me long, take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong and we'll never part
Love me tender, love me sweet, all my dreams fulfilled
For my darling, I love you and I always will

Love me tender, love me dear, tell me you are mine
I'll be yours through all the years till the end of time
Love me tender, love me sweet, all my dreams fulfilled
For my darling, I love you and I always will
I'm not the one in search of friction
I'm not the one to look for fights
When it gets down to me and you
I think it over twice
We sing the same song
With it all subject to change
There is another place in time, girl
You and I will meet again

I saw the signs I never knew
Didn't have enough on you to follow through
Call it innocent or guilty
Inside you, it's still me

Oooh, whose word you gonna take
Whose heart you gonna break
Not mine
If I believe your true confessions
I'm never gonna make it
You know you hurt me for the very last time
I need you darlin', and it tears me apart
And if someone comes between us
It's the death of my heart
I think about you and I paint a picture
You wanna love above the law
And you got a taste for adventure
It's what you're livin' for
We say the same lies
Anyone to crucify
We're the victims of the same sensations
I can be as bad as you

I step aside, you can understand
I won't stand in the way but I will if I can
Not to be your judge and jury
It's still you inside me

Oooh, whose word you gonna take
Whose heart you gonna break
Not mine
If I believe your true confessions
I'm never gonna make it
You know you hurt me for the very last time
I need you darlin', and it tears me apart
And if someone comes between us
It's the death of my heart

My gun is loaded and I'm ready for war
I come and get you and I kick down the door
There's no way, I can't let you leave
I'm not working for the enemy
Oooh, whose word you gonna take
Whose heart you gonna break
Not mine
If I believe your true confessions
I'm never gonna make it
You know you hurt me for the very last time
I need you darlin', and it tears me apart
And if someone comes between us
It's the death of my heart

In the Playa's Club
Checking at your body, baby
Steadily tossing that cash flow, baby
'Cause you drive me crazy
Won't you be my lady?
Betcha I can make your body talk to me
(Talk to me)
All I need is my CD, bag of weed and some Cristie (yeah)
Then I'm gonna stroke you up and down
Messing with your head
And when you leave up out my room
You'll be walking bow leg
I can keep your body coming like a CTA
You're dealing with a true baller, baby
Giving you the keys to my Mercedes

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not gonna stop 'til you scream my name
And say ooh Kelly you make me holla
Keep on jumping like an Impala
You sliding that sexy ass down the pole like what

[Chorus]

Looking for some love, babe

You're gonna trip, gonna trip
Gonna trip, gonna trip, gonna trip
When I show you my love Jones, babe
And make the room go black
Baby girl keep your body right there
I'm gonna sock it to you, baby
I wanna hear you say yeah, yeah
Now the sign of the knob says privacy
You and me
On the low, fruit bowls and whipped cream
We can get up on a fancy suite
Thugged out with some Hennessy
See, see, see
Lock your body up and throw away the key

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not gonna stop 'til you scream my name
And say ooh Kelly you make me holla
Keep on jumping like an Impala
You sliding that sexy ass down the pole like what
(What, what, what, what, what)
Come and get some of this

Trying to get some ass, babe
Do you wanna thug, babe?
I'm just an R&B thug, babe
Looking for some love, babe
Do you wanna date, babe?

[Verse 3]
Now feel a knot down in my pants
While you breaking me off with a lap dance
Said it's getting me high, it's got me feeling hazy
I'm going around your body like a worldwide tour
I'll make you say toot toot, beep beep
Pull up to my bumper, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not gonna stop 'til you scream my name
And say ooh Kelly you make me holla
Keep on jumping like an Impala
You sliding that sexy ass down the pole like what
(What, what, what, what, what)
Come and get some of this
R&B thug baby

[Chorus]

On a snow covered night
Up in Eastern Wyoming
Another lazy day
Lookin' for the sun

In a draughty old cabin
Outside a whiskey basin
Another shining light
And a good man on the run

There's a lady back in Laramie
And her reason no one else can see
For him to spend
The winter on his own

Nothing much for him to do tomorrow
Just a matter of survival
Another friendly fight
In a life chocked full of fun

(Yodalling)
It's a special kind of medicine
And all that you can do is win
Though it tastes so sweet
You can refuse

Put your heart on the table
Fill your fountain with moonshine
Another empty case of
The Whiskey Basin Blues

(Yodalling)
Well, there's one kind favor I'll ask of you
One kind favor I'll ask of you
Oh, there's one kind favor I'll ask of you
See that my grave is kept clean

There's two white horses in a line
Two white horses in a line
Two white horses in a line
Gonna take me to my burying ground

Well, my heart stopped beating
My hands are cold
Well, my heart stopped beating
And my hands are cold
Well, my heart stopped beating
And my hands are cold
I believe just what the Bible told

Did you ever hear a coughin' sound?
Did you ever hear a coughin' sound?
Did you ever hear a coughin' sound?
Then you know that the poor boy's in the ground
Dig my grave with a silver spade
Well, you dig my grave with a silver spade
Dig my grave with a silver spade
Let me down the golden chain

Have you ever heard the church bell tone?
Ever heard the church bell tone?
Did you ever hear a church bell tone?
Then you know that the poor boy's dead and gone

I feel so good

One kind favor I'll ask of you
One kind favor I'll ask of you
It's one kind favor I'll ask of you
Please see that my grave is kept clean
I'll be long gone
By the time you make up your mind
Gotta make my own way
Around the kinda misery I find

I'll send you my best
Of regards and the rest
I'll leave up to your own sense of time

Yes I'm gonna get up and make my life shine
I'm gonna get up and make my life shine
I've made up my mind... to make my life shine

I'll be high flyin'
By the time you come round to me
Todays a new day
Different from tomorrow you'll see

Good luck with your path
But it wasn't built to last
Or we might take it differently
I'm gonna get up and make my life shine
I'm gonna get up and make my life shine
I've made up my mind... to make my life shine

Good luck with your path
But it wasn't built to last
Or we might take it differently

I'm gonna get up and make my life shine
I'm gonna get up and make my life shine
I've made up my mind
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm gonna get up and make my life shine
I'm gonna get up and make my life shine
I'm gonna get up and make my life shine
I'm gonna get up and make my life shine
Get up... yeah yeah yeah........

[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be far away

[Verse 3]
And here we are, as In olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us
Once more

[Verse 4]
Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
You think you're so way out
And you got all the action
Still you can't find no satisfaction
Baby - try me, and I'll make you see

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
Ah ah, at all

You like to kiss and run
And that's where it is
'Cause somebody told you
Love was heartaches and tears
Baby, although you're free
I'll make you see

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Oh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
You ain't livin' at all
To be in love, I know it's not your ambition
But before you go, think about my proposition
You may conquer the world and be king on a throne
But you still ain't nobody, baby
When you're sittin' all alone

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all

Get up Jimmy Newman,the morning is come
The engines are rumbling the coffee's all brewed
Get up Jimmy Newman, there's work to be done
And why do you lie there still sleeping
There's a waiting line forming to use the latrine
And the sun is just opening the skies
The breakfast they're serving just has to be seen
And you've only to open your eyes

Get up Jimmy Newman my radio's on
The news is all bad, but it's good for a laugh
The tent flap is loose and the peg must be gone
And why do you lie there still sleeping
The night nurse is gone and the sexy one's here
And she tells us such beautiful lies
Her uniform's tight oh her marvelous rear
And you've only to open your eyes

Get up Jimmy Newman you're missing the fun
They're talking us next, Jim. It's time to go home
It's over for us there's no more to be done
And why do you lie there still sleeping
It's state side for us, Jim. The folks may not know
And we'll let it be such a surprise
They're loading us next, Jim we're ready to go
And you've only to open your eyes
And you've only to open your eyes
Get up Jimmy open your eyes
Oh, my God! Jimmy! Open your eyes!
Nobody calls
Fall into pieces
Don't be afraid
Life isn't easy
Sunshine to rain
Counting the windows

But nobody calls
Nobody calls
Sunshine to rain
Smile for the camera
But nobody phones
Nobody phones
Anyone
At all
Not at all

Nobody phones
Anyone
At all
Nobody phones
Anyone

Nobody phones

Nobody phones

I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to se we've met
La da da da da dum
Had it been another day I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware but as it is I'll dream of her tonight
La da da da da dum

Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

I have never known the likes of this I'd been alone
And I have missed things and kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this
La da da da da dum

Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
La da da da da dum

Falling yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again

[Verse 1]
Coming from where he did
He was turned away from every door like Joseph

[Chorus]
To even the toughest among us that would be too much

[Verse 2]
He didn't know what it was to be black
'Til they gave him his change
But didn't want to touch his hand

[Chorus]
To even the toughest among us don't you know that would be too much

[Post-Chorus]
Isn't it just enough
How hard it is to live
Isn't it hard enough
Just to make it through a day

[Bridge]
The secret of their fear and their suspicion
Standing there looking like an angel
In his brown shoes
His short suit
His white shirt
And his cuffs a little frayed
Coming from where he did
He was such a dignified child

[Chorus]
To even the toughest among us don't you know that would be too much

[Post-Chorus]
Isn't it just enough
How hard it is to live
Isn't it hard enough
Just to make it through a day

[Verse 1]
Coming from where he did
He was turned away from every door like Joseph

[Chorus]
To even the toughest among us don't you know that would be too much

[Verse 2]
He didn't know what it was to be black
'Til they gave him his change
But didn't want to touch his hand

[Chorus]
To even the toughest among us that would be too much

[Justin Timberlake:]
I'm wakin, up in the morning
Hustling to the stage and fuckin performin'
Bustlin' through the hate and bustin' the door in
Lately nothing misses I must've been scorin'
Speaking of the Misses I'm watchin' 'em pour in
Just like a drink that I'm enjoying
I don't mean bottles - you're welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin' - Feeling like Jordan

Oh-oh
Hold up I ain't finished yet
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut, I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands, let me say it again
Oh-oh
You ain't heard, I'm the shit
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut, but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on, but guess what?

[Chorus:]
I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
Cause I'm a winner, yeah I'm a winner

[Jamie Foxx:]
I'm steppin', out in the evening
People in there screaming, you gotta be cheating
But I'm so breezy, I make this look easy
No faking I'm seizing, you gotta believe it
I went from TV's, to screens, to DVDs
To CDs, to MP3s, overseas - I got
No time, the talkin' is boring
Just look at me soarin' - Feeling like Jordan

Oh-oh
Hold up I ain't finished yet
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut, I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands, let me say it again
Oh-oh
You ain't heard, I'm the shit
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut, but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on, but guess what?

[Chorus:] I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
I can't miss, can't lose, can't miss
You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
Cause I'm a winner, yeah I'm a winner

[T.I.:]
That's right
You see the - Porsche Panamera got 'em in hysteria
The turbo super fast, and that Mclaren even scarier
Hemme turnin' corners, burnin' rubber in your area
I'm hard to follow once i pop clutch and hit the throttle
ReI'm recession-proof
I don't run to money - money run to me
In this economy guess I'm considered an anomaly
Bugattis, Maseratis, new Ferraris - I got one of each
My future bright, tight
Like the bitch I got in front of me
Turn pain to progression in every studio session
Passion into perfection, to failure I'm an exception
Fuck if you wanna lose, to battle me is a blessing
You couldn't die at the hands of a better man
I ran from the bottom to the best - no Auto-Tune
Been in the lead, so you seen can't follow whom
Never that, I'm the freshest go ask whoever that
King back, money long as an old Cadillac

You know you lookin' at a winner, winner, winner
Cause I'm a winner, yeah I'm a winner

[Verse 1]
Do they know
That Jesus was born on this day to save our lives
Do they know
That he carried the sins of the world upon his heart
So that you and I could live
And we'd have an alternative
In this life

[Chorus]
Do they know what this day means
Do they know where we've been and how it should be
Tell me do they know
Do they know we should love one another
Do they know
The world will be alright only if they know

[Verse 2]
Do they know
That sharing love to each other is how we all should live
Do they know
That the reason for giving is more than what you give
And to you and your's this day
On a very special holiday
Give your love

[Chorus]
Do they know what this day means
Do they know where we've been and how it should be
Tell me do they know
Do they know we should love one another
Do they know
The world will be alright only if they know

[Bridge]
And Lord if they know
Keep them in your care
Keep them inside your heart
And help them spread the word

[Chorus]
Do they know what this day means
Do they know where we've been and how it should be
Tell me do they know
Do they know we should love one another
Do they know
The world will be alright only if they know
Do they know what this day means
Do they know where we've been and how it should be
Tell me do they know
Do they know we should love one another
Do they know
The world will be alright only if they know

I wanted so to tell that old man, Oh so many things
Like the corn was 10 feet tall, that he had planted in the sping
And the books he'd ordered came in in the mail just yesterday
But he never said a word and life slowly slipped away

I wanted so to tell him just how much he meant to me
I wanted so to thank him for what he taught me that I could be
I wanted him to know, that his grandchildren all were there
And that his four year old grandson said "Papa, I said a prayer"

I wanted to apologize for always being on the go

For never having enough time to talk about the things that he needed so
I wanted so to tell him "Pop, your loved ones all are here"
But he just lay there with his eyes closed, and I think he shed a knowing tear

Yes, I wanted so to tell that old man, Oh so many things
Like the corn was 10 feet tall, that he had planted in the sping
And the books he'd ordered came in, in the mail just yesterday
But he never said a word and life just slowly slipped away

[Verse 1]
I saw when you arrived looking like a supermodel
Your ass from the side looks just like a coke bottle
I love the way you ride, put that thing on full throttle
So get, get get get up on the saddle

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna see you moving like they're moving in jamaica
Pretend that I'm a dinner, she can be my salt shaker
You ain't tryin to hide it, girl you a troublemaker
And I'm a troublemaker maker maker maker maker

[Chorus]
I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
And sing out oeo oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa
Oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa

[Verse 2]
Sexy little mama, it's really nice to meet you
Can I be in your classroom and be your private teacher
If I bring out my camera, will you be in my feature
Cause we gon' do some things
Hope your daddy ain't a preacher

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna see you moving like they're moving in jamaica
Pretend that i am dinner you can be my salt shaker
You ain't tryin to hide it girl you're a troublemaker
And i'm a troublemaker maker maker maker maker

[Chorus]
I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
Sing it oeo oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa
Oeoeoeoa oeoeoeoa

[Bridge]
I love the way you dance, oh it makes me crazy
I wanna see you move, so just let it go baby
I feel like we can do this if you wanna go with it
Let's take it to the top, p-p-push it to the limit
Take it to the top, p-p-push it to the limit, to the limit, to the limit, to the limit, limit, limit, limit...

[Chorus]
I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
And sing out
Oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea
Oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea
(Oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea oeoeoeoea)
Last time this happened
Thought it wouldn't happen anymore
But that was before
And now once again
As it happens
Well why do I listen anymore
Facing the door
I wonder again

(Isn't it time you got the news)
Isn't it time you knew
(There's someone else up here with you)
There's someone else
And you can trust in me

Think back and remember
All the disappointments you've been through
Well I felt them too
And all I can say
Is crazy stories
Really shouldn't get the best of you
I want you too
So I wouldn't let them
(Isn't it time you got the news)
Isn't it time you knew
(There's someone else up here with you)
There's someone else
And you can trust in me

(Isn't it time you got the news)
Isn't it time you knew
(There's someone else up here with you)
There's someone else with you
(You can trust in me)
Its me

(Isn't it time you got the news)
Isn't it time you knew
(There's someone else up here with you)
(You can trust in me)
You can trust in me.. well

(Isn't it time.. you got the news.. isn't it time)
(Isn't it time.. you got the news.. isn't it time)

How I love the kisses of Dolores
Aye-aye-aye Dolores
Not Marie or Emily or Doris
Only my Dolores

From a balcony above me
She whispers Love me and throws a rose
Ah but she is twice as lovely
As the rose she throws

I would die to be with my Dolores
Aye-aye-aye Dolores
I was made to serenade Dolores
Chorus after chorus

Just imagine eyes like moonrise
A voice like music, lips like wine
What a break if I could make Dolores
Mine all mine

How's your love life
How's your heartbeat
How do you do with me?
How's that new boy
How does he rate
How do you do without me?
My doctors say I'm fit and healthy
I really come on
My bank will tell you that I'm solvent
Except that I'm overdrawn
So how's forgiving
How's forgetting
How can you do this to me?
And how's for living
How's for getting a flat with me as a lessee?
I tell you what
You're in a rot
You need a caretaker, see?
Honey, how could you do
How do you do without me?
I've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping instead
I say, I've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping instead
To pick up me a tombstone, and be pronounced dead

When I read your letter this morning, that was in your place in bed
I read your letter this morning, that was in your place in bed
That's when I decided, that I would be better off dead

It read, there is no use you looking, or ever hoping to get me back
Oh, there's no use you looking, or ever hoping to get me back
Yes, because it's all over now, and you can bet on that
And nobody's falling in love
Everybody here needs a shove
And Nobody's getting any touch
Everybody thinks that it means too much
And nobody's coming undone
Everybody here's afraid of fun
And nobody's getting any play
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A

And nobody's falling in love
Everybody here needs a shove
And Nobody's getting any touch
Everybody thinks that it means too much
And nobody's coming undone
Everybody here's afraid of fun
And nobody's getting any play
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A

And nobody's falling in love
Everybody here needs a shove
And Nobody's getting any touch
Everybody thinks that it means too much
And nobody's coming undone
Everybody here's afraid of fun
And nobody's getting any play
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A

Ol' Man River, that Ol' Man River
He must know somethin'
He don't say nothin'
He just keeps rollin'
He keeps on rollin' along

He don't plant taters, he don't plant cotton
And then that plants are soon forgotten
But Ol' Man River
He keeps on rollin' along
Smiling faces sometimes pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces show no traces of the evil that lurks within

[Chorus]
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth, uh
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies, and I got proof

The truth is in the eyes
'Cause the eyes don't lie, amen
Remember, a smile is just a frown turned upside down, my friend
Let me tell you

[Chorus]
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth, uh
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies, and I got proof

(Beware) Beware of the handshake that hides the snake
I'm telling you beware
Beware of the pat on the back
It just might hold you back
Jealousy (jealousy)
Misery (misery)
Envy (envy)
I tell you, you can't see behind smiling faces

[Chorus]
Smiling faces sometimes, they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies, and I got proof
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies, and I got proof
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes

I'm telling you beware, beware of the handshake
That hides the snake
Listen to me now
(Beware) Beware of that pat on the back
It just might hold you back

[Chorus]
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies, and I got proof

Your enemy won't do you no harm
'Cause you'll know where he's coming from
Don't let the handshake and the smile fool ya
Take my advice, I'm only tryna school ya

[Chorus]
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies, and I got proof
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies, and I got proof
The impossible task is to figure out which of the smiles is a mask
Think about it
Did you hear me?
The impossible task is to figure out which of the smiles is a mask

[Chorus]
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
Don't show the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies, and I got proof
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes

Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
Don't show the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies, and I got proof
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes

[Outro]

[Intro]
I don't know man
Maybe, maybe, I might have missed something
You know what I'm sayin'
Maybe y'all know something I don't know
But I like slow dancing in the club, fuck the bullshit
I like getting close to a fine ass chick, you feel me
So DJ Wayne Williams, put on a slow cut

[Verse 1]
Jupiter, Pluto, Venus and Saturn
I'm leaving Earth, girl, to explore your galaxy
Ten to zero, blast off, here we go
We'll be climaxing 'til we reach Mercury, girl
Tell me are you ready, girl
To take a trip out of this world
I guarantee you'll like it
It'll take your breath away
Gonna get you so excited
Once I taste your milky way
Girl, spend the night, come take a flight with me
Out into space, yeah
Girl, you're sending me these sexual energies
And I gotta grab it
Right now I've gotta have it
Shooting stars, a trip to Mars
I can get us there from where we are
So don't trip, I got a giant rocket
Gliding through, just hitting your pockets

[Chorus]
Sex planet
Come fly away with me
Riding my ecstasy
Out in the galaxy
Sex planet
Get ready for take off, baby (zoom)
And have a safe trip, babe

[Verse 2]
Now it's just us both
I've got the control
In the middle of darkness
Girl, relax and just flow
I'm about to twinkle it and touch your soul
Once I enter into your black hole (baby, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Girl, now that you're next to me
We'll be just like satellites
Watching over the Earth
We'll make space our paradise
Girl I promise this will be painless (painless)
We'll take a trip to planet Uranus, anus
Ooh, just put your trust in me
And girl, I promise destination will be
A trip that you will never forget
I'm gonna take you out of this world
So hold on tight, my dear
'Cause I'm about to take you out of here
And get you to my...

[Chorus]
Sex planet
Come fly away with me
Riding my ecstasy
Out in the galaxy
Sex planet
Get ready for take off, baby (zoom)
And have a safe trip, babe
Oh...

[Bridge]
We'll stick a flag on the Moon
First couple to ever make love on planet Neptune (ooh)
And if time allow us
We'll be gone for hours
I won't stop until I give you meteor showers
So if you want it say (ooh)
And if you need it say (ooh)
If you really gotta have it say (ooh)
And you want me to take you to space

[Chorus]
Sex planet
Come fly away with me
Riding my ecstasy
Out in the galaxy
Sex planet
Get ready for take off, baby (zoom)
Have a safe trip, babe
Sex planet
Come fly away with me
Riding my ecstasy
Out in the galaxy
Sex planet
Get ready for take off, baby (zoom)
Have a safe trip babe

[Outro]
So get ready for lift off, baby
Get ready for lift off, baby
You ready? (Yes)

Baby, start our engines...

Oh oh oh, baby (blast off)
Said it feels so good, girl, when we (blast off)
See my rocket is so full of fuel, baby

(...sat on my windowsill light...)
(Phil?)
(Phil's my style...)

With all nations behind us
We shall all be free
And as people we can see
A bright and decent end light
Frosted windowpanes
Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree
Santa's on his way
He's filled his sleigh with things
Things for you and me

It's that time of year
When the world falls in love
Ev'ry song you hear seems to say
"Merry Christmas
May your New Year dreams come true"

And this song of mine
In three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours the same thing, too

[Instrumental 0:00 - 4:09]

[Verse 1]
Out of the mist, rising!
Ten thousand Navajo Braves, shining!
Like golden eagles in flight, climbing!
High on the Plains!

[Verse 2]
Born of the Earth, set free!
To run away with the sun, so free!
To sing in tune with the world, gladly!
Dance for the rain!

[Instrumental 4:59 - 6:17]

[Verse 3]
So many moons, have flown
Now all your ghosts dance the long, shadows
War cries that died on your lips, echo
Above the Plains

[Instrumental 6:38 - 7:17]
I'll be loving you always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you've planned need a helping hand
I will understand always, always

Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour, not for just a day
Not for just a year, but always

Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour, not just a day
Not for just a year, but always

[Verse 1]
I was a fool when I left you
I should have known
To find a good man was a hard thing to do
But temptation got the best of me

[Chorus]
So there's nothing I can say
Except if you let me come home to stay
I'm on my way, I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
I must have been blind to go away
And leave you behind
But can you find it in your heart to forgive me
And try one more time?
I want a chance to do things your way

[Chorus]
So there's nothing I can say
Except if you let me come home to stay
I'm on my way, I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
I've had my little run out
And I know you I can't do without
But give me a chance and I'll be more to you
Than just a pair of hands
I'll do whatever, whatever
Whatever you want me to
Because I feel, yes, I feel
I owe that much to you

[Chorus]
But there's nothing I can say
Except if you let me come home to stay
I'm on my way

[Outro]
If you let me come home, I'm on my way
If you let me come home, I'm on my way
If you let me come home, I'm on my way

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman]
Oh, come, oh, come Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile
Until the Son of God appear
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
Oh, come, O key of David, come
And open wide our heav'nly home
Make safe the way that leads on high
And close the path to misery
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel

[Verse 3: Nathan Morris]
Oh, come, oh, come our Lord of might
Who to your tribes on Sinai's height
In ancient times gave holy law
In cloud and majesty and awe
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Spoken: Let's be on with our little holligag, Axel, play that Venetian waltz so popular down at the pirate's den, will you?

When Madame Pompadour was on the ballroom floor
Said all the gentlemen, obviously, the madame has the cutest personality
And think of all the books about Du Barry's looks
What was it made her the toast of Paree?
She had a well-developed personality
And what did Romeo see in Juliet or Hero in Perriet, or Jupiter in Juno? you know!
Or when Salome danced and had the boys entranced
No doubt it must have been easy to see
That she knew how to use her personality

You're quite a ladies' man just how d'you do advance, I know it can't be publicity
Boys to Sinatra: The boys at Metro call it a personality
Oh Frank you're awfully thin, just how did you begin
To set the style in the swoon industry
Frank: I did it with my famished personality
I know it's not the place for me to make this crack
But I hear tell that Gable's back

Boys: Frankie, here's a bromo, why, a Como (ow!)
We're grateful to the flock to where those bobbies sack
Because without them we must agree
We would never have made it with a personality
You give me that funny feeling in my tummy

Oh shit, yeah, that's right
(Rollercoaster of love)
Say what
(Rollercoaster) Yeah! (Oohh oohh oohh)
Oh baby, you know what I'm talking about
(Rollercoaster of love)
(Rollercoaster) Yeah! (Oohh oohh oohh)
You're all gonna come on time
Lovin' you is really wild
Oh we're still in that rollercoaster
Step right up and get your ticket

Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride yeah (awawaw)
Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride yeah

Move over there 'cause I'm a double dipper
Won't stop now, I'm a zip zip zipper
One, two, one-two-three
I got a ticket, come ride with me
Let me go down on the merry-go-round
All hands there, or be let down
Love go slow, love go fast
Licorice whip, gonna whip your ass
Rollercoaster
Say what...

Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride yeah (awawaw)
Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride yeah

Move over there 'cause I'm a double dipper
Won't stop now, I'm a zip zip zipper
One, two, one-two-three
I got a ticket, come ride with me
Let me go down on the merry-go-round
All hands there, or be let down
Love go slow, love go fast
Licorice whip, gonna whip your ass

Rollercoaster
Say what...

Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride yeah
Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride yeah
(repeat & fade)
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
Ooh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Ooh, white Christmas
Sleigh bells in the snow
Ooh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Oh, Bess, oh, where's my Bess?
Won't somebody tell me where?
I ain't care what she say, I ain't care what she done
Won't somebody tell me where's my Bess? Bess

My Bess, I want her now
Without her I can't go on
I counted the days that I was gone
Till I got home to see her face

Won't somebody tell me where's my Bess?
I want her so, my gal, my Bess
Where is she?

Oh, Lord, in your big heaven
Please show me where I must go
Oh, give me the strength, show me the way

Tell me the truth, where is she?
Where is my gal?
Where's my Bess?

[Verse]
Pretend you're happy when you're blue
It isn't very hard to do
And you'll find happiness without an end
Whenever you pretend
Remember, anyone can dream
And nothing's as bad as it may seem
The little things you haven't got could be a lot if you pretend
You'll find a love you can share
One you can call all your own
Just close your eyes, she'll be there
You'll never be alone
And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?

[Outro]
You'll find a love you can share
One you can call all your own
Just close your eyes, she'll be there
You'll never be alone
And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?
How I love my girl

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries in a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a hot muggy morn by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish heads and tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails, that can swallow the moon

And he yells to the cook with his arms open wide
"Hey! Bring me more fish, throw it down by my side"
And he wants so to belch but he's too full to try
So he stands up and laughs and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to porch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night with their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow underneath the street lamps
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again
He'll drink to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who've given their bodies to a thousand other men
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue, their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins, well, he just can't go on
Throws his nose to the sky and he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry on the unfaithful love
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of Amsterdam
Back in '64 I was feeling 63
The strangest sort of feeling
Started creeping over me
It's not the kind of feeling
You would easily forget
My head started burning
And my knees began to sweat

I figured I was crazy
So I went back to my chair
But I looked into my mirror
And I just wasn't there
Just then the window shattered
And a monkey hit the floor
Looked like it was time for me
To make it to the door

But the monkey grabbed my coat
And took away my hat
And I don't remember
What happened after that
Except my friends hear the story
About how I left it all behind
Seems ever since that day
I've had that monkey on my mind
Tried to do my best
And make something of my life
So I cut off all my relatives
And then I left my wife

I've tried a hundred cures
Anything that I could find

But you know life ain't easy
With a monkey on your mind

Every time I make my mind up
I'm really gonna try
Well that monkey starts jumping
And looks me in the eye

Oh dig the monkey

Well something exploded
When the monkey got loaded
And we went out on the town
The monkey got so drunk
He started getting funky
It was hard to hold the poor boy down

He did the boogaloo the shoogaloo
The Eskimo the Hindu
He even made the teenage queen
Oh the joint started leaping
Everybody was a-freaking
The greatest show they'd ever seen
Then someone started screaming
And I woke up from my dreaming
Tried to get myself realigned
But it's all right
And it all comes easy
When you got a monkey on your mind

Dig the monkey
Oh one more time
Dig the monkey
Well I'm sitting in church
In an old wooden chair
I knew nobody
Would look for me there
. . . Sorrow and pity
. . . Rule the earth and the skies
Looking for nothing
Anyone's eyes

Once I had pretty girls
Did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Snowflakes are falling
Around my head
Lord have mercy
It feel heavy like lead
. . . I been hit too hard
. . . Seen too much
Nothing can heal me now
But your touch
Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Loneliness
Got a mind of its own
The more people around
The more you feel alone
. . . I'm chained to the earth
. . . Like a silent slave
Trying to break free
Out of death's dark cave

Once I had a pretty girl
Done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Boys in the street
Beginning to play
Girls like birds
Flying away
. . . I'm carrying the roses
. . . That were given to me
And I'm thinking about paradise
Wondering what it might be
Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Go over to London
Maybe gay Paree
Follow the river
You get to the sea
. . . I was hoping we could drink from
. . . Life's clear streams
I was hoping we could dream
Life's pleasant dreams

Once I had a pretty girl
But she done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Well the weak get weaker
And the strong stay strong
The train keeps rolling
All night long
. . . She looked at me
. . . With an irresistible glance
With a smile
That could make all the planets dance
Once I had a pretty girl
She did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

My house is on fire
Burning to the skies
I thought the rain clouds
But the clouds passed by
. . . When I'm gone
. . . You'll remember my name
I'm gonna win my way
To wealth and fame

Once I had a pretty girl
But she did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

I don't know
When I get off of this mountain, you know where I want to go?
Straight down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana, little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half
She tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea
Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box
She said, "I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk"
Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold
And this living on the road is getting pretty old
So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted to go and see my Bessie again

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
Written by Jeremy Spencer

Whoa, treat me sweet mama 'low me one more show
Treat me sweet mama 'low me one more show
I swear to the lord I won't do wrong no more

I don't love no woman - if she got easy ways
I don't love no woman if she got easy ways
I'm crazy about my little girl she's always been my crave

Break:

I woke up this morning, just before the brake of day
I woke up this morning, just before the brake of day
I looked at the pillow where my good girl used to lay

I hung my head boys, I - cried just like a child
I hung my head boys, I - cried just like a child
I said the way I'm treated, mama, sure ain't satisfied

I've got the blues so bad, little girl - my poor ol' heart is sore
I've got the blues so bad, mama - poor ol' heart is sore
I just can't rest - mama know where I go

[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh...

[Verse 1]
Get out your guns it's time to start a fight
Whoa, and it won't take too long
I want to make it right
Just tell me that you feel the call
It's so wonderful
So I can feel wonderful
(Ooh-ooh ooh…)

[Chorus 1]
You'll drive in my car
Just tell me we are going somewhere
Where the stars meet the sky
And all these people with small dreams
Are looking up at the big screen
Well, am I wrong or am I right?
It's so wonderful
(Ooh-ooh ooh…)

[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh...

[Verse 2]
Get out the car it's time for me to drive
Oh, you can't hide for long
I want to spend the night
Just tell me you were all alone
It's so wonderful
Hey, I feel wonderful

[Chorus 2]
I'll drive in my car
Just tell me we are going somewhere
Where the stars meet the sky
And all these people with small dreams
Are looking up at the big screen
Well, am I wrong or am I right?
It's so wonderful
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ooh…)

[Bridge]
Feel wonderful
Ooh, feel wonderful
How wonderful
Yeah!

[Chorus 3]
I'll drive in my car
Just tell me we are going somewhere
Where the stars meet the sky
And all these people with small dreams
Are looking up at the big screen
Well, am I wrong or am I right?
It's so wonderful

[Post-Chorus 3]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Feel wonderful
Ooh...

This time the dream's on me

You'll take my hand
And you'll look at me adoringly
But as things stand
This time the dream's on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I at least
Supply the shoulder you cry upon

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true
But this time the dream's on me

It would be fun
To be certain that I'm the one
To know that I at least
Supply the shoulder you cry upon
To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be
It can't be true
But this time the dream's on me
This time the dream's on me

Caught me in, in the palm of your hand
I'm right where you knew that I would land
So, baby, if you'll love me everyday
I wouldn't want it, I wouldn't have it any other way

You make me jump like a puppy on a string
But when I'm in your arms I feel like a king
So, baby, if you'll love me everyday
I wouldn't want it, I wouldn't have it
I wouldn't want it any other way

Take my lips, my arms, darling, take all of me
You can do what you please but just don't set me free
Baby, if you'll love me everyday
I wouldn't want it, I wouldn't have it
I wouldn't want it any other way

You know I wouldn't want it, baby
I wouldn't have it, baby in any other way
Just tell me you love me
All I wanna hear from you, baby
I don't want it any other way
Baby, I wouldn't want it any other way
Just say you love me because I need it
Don't wanna have it any other way
Baby, you can own two hearts
Baby, don't try to tear me apart
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise

Baby, you can't fool around
Baby, can't turn me upside down
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise

It's just a matter of time before you call him on the phone
Tell him please, please leave him alone
Please leave him alone
It's just a matter of time, call him on the phone
Tell him please, please leave him alone
Please leave him alone

Baby, you've got me used
Baby, Can't you be like you?
Someone's got to go and I won't, I won't
That's a promise

[Verse 1]
Mansions, hills, and acres
Women, drinks, and caterers
I will toast until the break of dawn
Swimming pools and strippers
Conversation, six figures
Never crossed my mind to call home

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a note on the bathroom mirror
Telling me that you've had enough
It took you leaving me for my blind eyes to see
That you mean

[Chorus]
(Far more) Than this planet to me
(Far more) Than the air I breathe
(Far more) From here to overseas
(Far more) Girl, you're all I need
(Far more) Than the mountains and tree
(Far more) You mean more than the birds and bees
(Far more) Honey, take it from me
(Far more) You are all I need

[Verse 2]
Hanging out with friends
Never calling to check in
Neglecting you in every way
Taking the home front for granted
What was straight is now slanted
And I don't know what to do about this letter

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a note on the bathroom mirror
Telling me that you've had enough
It took you leaving me for my blind eyes to see
That you mean

[Chorus]
(Far more) More than this planet to me
(Far more) More than the air I breathe
(Far more) From here to overseas
(Far more) Girl, you're all I need
(Far more) Than the mountains and tree
(Far more) Than the birds and bees
(Far more) Honey, take it from me
(Far more) You're all I need

(Far more) Woo

(Far more) I realize, girl
(Far more) Just what it is I had at home
(Far more) Oh baby, you mean far more
(Far more) Than this planet to me
(Far more) Than this air I breathe
(Far more) Nothing can compare to your love for me

[Chorus]
(Far more) To your love for me
(Far more) To your love for me
(Far more) To your love for me
(Far more)
You only live twice
Or so it seems
One life for yourself
And one for your dreams

You drift through the years
And life seems tame
'Til one dream appears
And Love is its name

And love is a stranger
Who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger
Or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you
So pay the price
Make one dream come true
You only live twice

And love is a stranger
Who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger
Or the stranger is gone
This dream is for you
So pay the price
Make one dream come true
You only live twice

When do you ever see the light?
Don't you ever feel a fright?

You got me burnin' and I'm turnin'
But I know I must be learnin' Rita May

All my friends have told me
If I hang around with you that I'll go blind
But when you hold me
I know there must be somethin' on your mind
Rita May, Rita May
Won't you come out and play?

[Incomprehensible] where you been?
What's that crazy place you're in?

I'm gonna have to go to college
'Cause you are the book of knowledge Rita May

All my friends have told me
If I hang around with you that I'll go blind
But I know when you hold me
That there really must be somethin' on your mind

Rita May, Rita May
You got your body in the way
You're so damn nonchalant
It's your mind that I want

I'm gonna have to go to college
'Cause you are the book of knowledge Rita May
Starlight , summer nights
Don't leave me here alone to die
Someone , somewhere cried

Oh Starlight , oh in my eyes
Too far away to see the lights
Drifters , drifting by

Now you've come back again
And I ain't over it yet
Please won't you walk with me
Talk with me
Starlight , yeah

Starlight , oh winter nights
The snow has come and love has gone
Now I'm feeling cold
Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah

Starlight , oh in my eyes
Too far away to see the lights
And I'm growing so old
Now you've come back again
And I ain't over it yet
Please won't you walk with me
Talk with me
Starlight

Now you've come back again
And I ain't over it yet
Please won't you walk with me
Talk with me
Starlight
Sooner or later you're coming thru that door
You've heard it before
Love me or leave me
I'm on your side
But the way you leave me hanging on the line
Is driving me crazy
Woke up this morning, felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old walking blues
I woke up this morning, felt around, felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old, mean old walking blues

Leaving in the morning if I have to, robbed blind
I've been mistreated and I don't mind dying
I'm leaving in the morning if I have to, robbed blind
I've been mistreated and I just don't mind dying

She got a belgium movement from her head down to her toes
Breaking on a dollar 'most anywhere she goes

Well I got a good woman coming my way
Tried to try, some electric pantin', some electric chillin' cryin'
But, ooh, mistook, misgiven
Got me up and walking baby, but I'm walking blue, walking blue

Well some people say boy, the walking blues ain't bad
It's the worst old feelin' I 'most ever had

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
It would be easier to take the wet from water or the dry from sand
Than for anyone to try to separate us or stop us from holding hands

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you (I love you)
Oh, I love you from the bottom of my heart
What love has joined together, what love has joined together
Can no one take it apart

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
It would be easier to take the cold from snow or the heat from fire
Than for anyone to take me love from you 'cause you're my heart's desire

[Chorus]
I really love you (I love you)
Oh, I love you from the bottom of my heart
What love has joined together, what love has joined together
Can nobody take it apart

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks]
Even if they separate us a thousand miles apart
We will still be together in each other's heart
It would be easier to change all the seasons of the year
Than for anyone to change the way I feel about you; I love you, dear

[Chorus]
I really love you (I love you)
Oh, I love you from the bottom of my heart
What love has joined together, what love has joined together
Can nobody take it apart
All My Love's Laughter
All my love's faces
She comes in the morning
Her cloak in her arms
She's following after
The King of all Places
And your tenderest warnin'
Could bruise all her charm

But don't lose your heart
To that beautiful sinner
Who walks without shining a light
She stands in the shade
And the sun is there in her
But you'll never know til it's night

All my love's softness
All my love's graces
She carries all things
In her tiny white glove
She hides all her lostness
In satins and laces
And everyone says
She's searching for sweet love
But don't try to hold on
To Satan's proud lady
Who stands with her flock
All alone on the hill
Her stockings are hung
And her eyes are so shady
She's winning, and you never will
Down in the jungle living in a tent
You don't use money you don't pay rent
You don't ever know the time
But you don't mind
Ho hey ho

When your light is on the blink
You never think of worrying
What's the use of worrying?
When your bus has left the stop
You'd better drop your hurrying
What's the use of hurrying?
Leave me alone Mrs. Vandebilt
I've got plenty of time of my own
What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of hurrying?
What's the use of anything?

Ho hey ho

What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of hurrying?
What's the use of anything?
Ho hey ho

When your pile is one the wane
You don't complain of robbery
Run away don't bother me
What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of anything?
Leave me alone Mrs. Washington
I've done plenty of time on my own

What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of hurrying? (no use!)
What's the use of anything?

Ho hey ho
All this joy, all this sorrow
All this promise, all this pain
Such is life, such is being
Such is spirit, such is love

City of joy, city of sorrow
City of promise, city of pain
Such is life, such is being
Such is spirit, such is love

World of joy, world of sorrow
World of promise, world of pain
Such is life, such is being
Such is spirit, such is love

All this joy, all this sorrow
All this promise, all this pain
Such is life, such is being
Such is spirit, such is love

Such is spirit, such is love

Well now C., C. C. Rider, well now see, see what you have done

Just might find me that good girl and everything would be alright
Once upon a time there was an engineer
Drove a locomotive both far and near
Accompanied by a monkey that would sit on a stool
Watching everything the engineer would do
One day the engineer wanted a bite to eat
He left the monkey sitting on the driver's seat
The monkey pulled the throttle, the locomotive jumped the gun
And did 80 miles an hour down the mainline run

Big locomotive right on time, big locomotive coming down the line
Big locomotive No. 99, left the engineer with a worried mind

The engineer called up the dispatcher on the phone
To tell him all about his locomotive was gone
Dispatcher got on the wire, switch operator to the right
Cause the monkey's got the main line sewed up tight
The switch operator got the message on time
Said there's a Northbound livin' on the same main line
Open up the switch I'm gonna let him through the hole
Cause the monkey's got the locomotive under control
Big locomotive right on time, big locomotive coming down the line
Big locomotive No. 99, left the engineer with a worried mind
Way down South there's a clear stream running
In the night I feel my heart turning
I'm feeling some day I'd like to come
Back to the place I started from
Take it home

Country night with the stars above me
Way down there with the ones who love me
Mother, Sister, Father, Son
They mean more than anyone
Take it home

Fall winds blow and the red leaves falling
Don't know there's a voice keeps calling
Saying, you have found your song
You've been gone so long
Take it home

Seems my life is a long road winding
Gone so far but the ties are binding
I'll pack up my bags and fly away
To a far better day
Take it home
Don't know why I was made to wander
I've seen the light, lord I've felt the thunder
Someday I'll go home again
And I know they'll take me in
Take it home

[Verse 1]
Downtown, my darling dime store thief
In the War of Independence rock 'n' roll rang sweet as victory
Under neon signs a girl was in bloom
And a woman was fading in a suburban room

[Chorus 1]
I said take me to the dance, do you want to dance?
I love to dance
And I told him they don't take chances
They seem so removed from romance
They've been broken in churches and schools
And molded to middle class circumstance
And we were rollin', rollin', rock 'n' rollin'

[Verse 2]
Downtown, the dancehalls and cafés
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart
Just doing the latest dance craze
Gail and Louise in those push up brassieres
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings, drinking up the band's beers

[Chorus 2]
Young love was kissing under bridges
Kissing in cars, kissing in cafés
And we were walking down Main Street
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays
In France they kiss on Main Street
Amour, mama, not cheap display
And we were rollin', rollin', rock 'n' rollin'

[Verse 3]
Downtown in the pinball arcade
With his head full of pool hall pitches
And songs from the hit parade
He'd be singing "Bye, Bye, Love" while he's racking up his free play
Let those rock 'n' roll choir boys come and carry us away

[Chorus 3]
Sometimes Chickie had the car or Ron had the car
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hotwire head
We'd all go looking for a party
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead
And I'd be kissing in the back seat
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said
And we'd be rollin', rollin', rock 'n' rollin'

[Outro]
Rollin', rollin', rock 'n' rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rock 'n' rollin'
Yes I caught your flashy hand jive
From the corner of my eye
Talk about a cheap shot honey
My my my

Next you're makin' eyes at three dudes
Do you think that I can't see
What you gonna do for encores
Don't look to me

Lean and mean Barbara Jean
You got a mind like a tattle tale magazine
So stop your scheming you must be dreaming
To think I'd fall for you
You got some imagination

Talk about some mumbo jumbo
Talk about a mixed up mind
You've got all those egos
Working overtime
Long about the stroke of midnight
No doubt where you'll be
Getting off across town
Getting over me

Lean and mean Barbara Jean
You got a mind like a tattle tale magazine
Stop your scheming you must be dreaming
To think I'd fall for you
You got some imagination

You don't hang around with sleazos
You don't jump in bed too fast
You just floor me honey
Talk about some class

We're talking low blow dynamo
Any way you can
Wear em down eventually
You play knock down drag em out and get your man
But you don't get to me

Lean and mean Barbara Jean
You got a mind like a tattle tale magazine
So stop your scheming you must be dreaming
To think I'd fall for you
You got some imagination
Lean and mean Barbara Jean
Got a mind like a dirty dirty magazine
So stop your screaming riff you must be crazy if
You thought I'd fall for you
You got some imagination

Lean and mean you got a mean machine
A mind like a dirty dirty magazine
Stop your scheming just get on dreaming
You thought I'd fall for you
You got some imagination

Lean and mean ba ba ba Barbara Jean

[Verse 1]
I've been lately thinking
About my life's time
All the things I've done
And how it's been
And I can't help believing
In my own mind
I know I'm gonna hate to see it end

[Verse 2]
I've seen a lot of sunshine
Slept out in the rain
Spent a night or two all on my own
I've known my lady's pleasures
Had myself some friends
And spent a time or two in my own home

[Pre-Chorus]
And I have to say it now
It's been a good life all in all
It's really fine
To have a chance to hang around
And lie there by the fire
And watch the evening tire
While all my friends and my old lady
Sit and pass the pipe around

[Chorus]
And talk of poems and prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone
How right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday
And what about tomorrow
And what about our dreams
And all the memories we share

[Verse 3]
The days they pass so quickly now
Nights are seldom long
And time around me whispers when it's cold
The changes somehow frighten me
Still I have to smile
It turns me on to think of growing old

[Verse 4]
For though my life's been good to me
There's still so much to do
So many things my mind has never known
I'd like to raise a family
I'd like to sail away
And dance across the mountains on the moon

[Pre-Chorus]
I have to say it now
It's been a good life all in all
It's really fine
To have the chance to hang around
And lie there by the fire
And watch the evening tire
While all my friends and my old lady
Sit and pass the pipe around

[Chorus]
And talk of poems and prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone
How right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday
What about tomorrow
What about our dreams
And all the memories we share
Star maker
First, unwrap my body like I'm your birthday gift
And like a birthday wish, tell me what you need and I got you girl
Let me perform for you, (for you) get it warm for you (make it hot)
And your always welcome to another round of me and you

Let your inhibitions go, go, (let it go)

Baby open up wide for me

And put your touch with my kiss, your skin with my sweat
A slow jam with my stroke, get this love inside of your heart and rejoice
Let your love re-, ooh let your body re-joice
Ooh let your body rejoice

When your ready for round two, let these lips of mine annoint you
How could i ever dissappoint you, oh look at you, oh look at you
Leave your footprints on the wall, take that pillow off your face
I got to see the passion in your face when i'm in your sacred place right before you explode
Let your inhibitions go, go (too dirty)
I'm gonna make your make up run, run , (get naughty baby)

Let the smell of my sweat and cologne, turn you on baby
And as the mattress springs squeak-sqeak, the way i feel your heart beat- beat
Gonna make these nights feel like weeks when I sex you in these sheets
Baby open up wide for me

Put your-your touch(your touch) with my kiss (my kiss), your skin( my lips) with my sweat (make it wet)
A slow jam (slow jam) with my stroke, put this love inside of your heart and rejoice
Let your love, re-, oooh let your body rejoice
Oh let your body, rejoice
Rejoice

Like we just reached the finish line (rejoice) to climax at the same time (rejoice)
Like you just jumped the broom (rejoice) like it's our honeymoon (rejoice)
You and I should rejoice (rejoice) like it's your birthday baby (rejoice)
Put your love (all your love) in my heart, (rejoice)baby

Put your touch with my kiss, your skin with my sweat
A slow jam with my stroke, put this love inside of your heart and rejoice
Let your love, re-, oooh let your body rejoice
Oh let your body rejoice

Ain't got no house

All I got, Lord, is my guitar
But you can have that mister banker
Won't you bury my papa for me
Oh mister banker please

Won't you take it mister banker
Won't you bury my papa for me
Oh mister banker please
When I'm kissing my love
I can hear a thump thumping in my head
Mmm when I'm kissing my love
I close my eyes and see

[Verse 1]
Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
This Christmas
The fireside is blazing bright, woah-oh-oh
We're caroling through the night, woah-oh-oh
This Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me
Woah-oh-oh-woah-oh-oh-oh
Ha, let's go (Woo!)

Oh, haha, shake a hand, shake a hand now
Na-na-na-na-na-na

Woah-oh-oh, ha
Shake a hand now
Come on, everybody shake a hand now, ha
Family, hey
We'll be together
To make this Christmas bright, yes, we will
The other night I got arrested by the Karma police beat down
And didn't bother waiting for my receipt, hopped on my feet and skipped town
They say “What Goes around Comes Around” and I have found that that's real
Cuz even with a stomach filled with chill pills I still feel ill

The other night I got arrested by the karma coppers
Tossed in the back of sarcastic patty wagon and beaten bloody buddy
And I didn't resist I knew I had it coming to me
I didn't get pissed when they issued the summons to me
For years and years I've have perfected ignorance
The Peers and Peers that Listened so well
And for tears and tears I tasted more than influence
I'm still here on this pier preparing setting sail
Evidence proved I let paranoia get the best of me
I gave my girl a little, and let my friends receive the rest of me
So her I am with nothing, empty pockets, twenty stock tips
A stick of gum and far too many dreams of having something
So this is for the frogs that felt wrath of my firecrackers
And all the roaches that I stomped with no regard
And all the candy that got stolen from the corner store
I'm really sorry being human's kind of hard
I got arrested by the Karma police beat down
And didn't bother waiting for my receipt, hopped on my feet and skipped town
They say “What Goes around Comes Around” and I have found that that's real
Cuz even with a stomach filled with chill pills I still feel ill

Ok, ok, ok, this is what I get; I mean no disrespect but…
I'll accept the charges you can keep your plea bargains, Pardon
I made this machine and every rusty cog-nance in it
And gave you the dreams just wait a cotton picking minute
The time the time left over on my dinner plate
The crimes, the crimes committed as a youth
I'm fine, I'm fine just let me reevaluate
I'm innocent, don't believe me? Well here's the proof
I've been that model citizen paper route and all
Small enough to look up skirts and tall enough to play basketball
I had to ball just to stand and realize I'm just a man
So here I am in handcuffs the shit that makes a man tough
So this is for the farmers we have mass soaked with our water guns
And all the animals that died Cuz we were bored
Then all the girls with broken hearts I'm truly sorry
I learned my lesson, I'm confessing, hit record

I got arrested by the Karma police beat down
And didn't bother waiting for my receipt, hopped on my feet and skipped town
They say “What Goes around Comes Around” and I have found that that's real
Cuz even with a stomach filled with chill pills I still feel ill
The other night I got arrested by the Karma police beat down
And didn't bother waiting for my receipt, hopped on my feet and skipped town
They say “What Goes around Comes Around” and I have found that that's real
Cuz even with a stomach filled with chill pills I still feel ill

When you're smilin', when you're smilin'
The whole world smiles with you
When you're laughin', when you're laughin'
The sun comes shinin' through

But when you're cryin', you bring on the rain
So stop that cryin', be happy again
Keep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin'
The whole world smiles with you

When you're smilin', when you're smilin'
The whole world, it smiles with you
When you're laughin', oh babe, when you're laughin'
The sun would-a come shining through

But when you're cryin', you bring on the rain
So stop that sighin', come on and be happy again
Keep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin', baby
The whole world smiles with you
Night after night I cry myself to sleep
And night after night, I count the tears I weep
It's easy to get through the days, the days go fast
But when they're past, that moon comes on
And you're gone, and you're gone
Night after night you're always in my heart
It just isn't right for us to be apart
I have one special dream, dear
And if that dream comes true
I'll spend night after night after night with you

I have one special dream, dear
And if that dream comes true
Then I'll know that my arms have the right
To hold you ever so tight
Spending night after night after night with you

[Verse 1]
Like a bolt of lightin' you struck me down
You really upset my soul
I fell in love with you the first time I saw ya
I've been tryin' to let you know
But I can see you're in love with somebody else
So take my love and put it on the shelf
And when you find that his love won't do
Try mine, see what it does for you

[Chorus]
I got plenty of time so keep me in mind
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Find a place in your heart and save it for a rainy day

[Verse 2]
By now you think he's somethin' special
Believe me girl I know better
You're puttin' your heart in danger my dear
'Cause it's not a love changes like the weather

[Verse 3]
He'll always be around when it's sunny
When times get stormy he'll stay away
Girl my love will always be true
Through the good and bad times too

[Chorus]
I got plenty of time so keep me in mind
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Find a place in your heart and save it for a rainy day

[Verse 4]
I will say good things are comin' your way
That's somethin' that I found
That's why I'm waitin' for that rainy day
'Cause I know he won't be around

[Verse 5]
And I'll take you in my arms and make you forget
That you ever thought about him at all
Girl, my love will make you see
What your one love really means

[Chorus]
I got plenty of time so keep me in mind
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Find a place in your heart and save it for a rainy day
Find a place in your heart and save it for a rainy day
Save it, save it, baby please save it
Save it, save it, baby please save it
Please don't dominate the rap, Jack
If you've got nothing new to say
If you please, don't back up the track
This train's got to run today

I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
I heard some say, "better run away"
Others say, "better stand still"

Now I don't know, but I've been told
It's hard to run with the weight of gold
Other hand, I have heard it said
It's just as hard with the weight of lead

Who can deny, who can deny
It's not just a change of style?
One step done and another begun
And I wonder how many miles

I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
Things went down we don't understand
But I think in time we will
Now I don't know, but I was told
In the heat of the sun, a man died of cold
Keep on coming or stand and wait
With the sun so dark and the hour so late

You can't overlook the lack, Jack
Of any other highway to ride
It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very few rule to guide

I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
I saw things getting out of hand
I guess they always will

Now I don't know, but I been told
If the horse don't pull you, got to carry the load
I don't know whose back's that strong
Maybe find out before too long

One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give
One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give
One way or another, one way or another
One way or another, this darkness got to give

[Verse 1]
I've been fragile for a long time
A big ol' hole inside my heart
And I was searching through the valley
Stumbled on love in the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Was afraid
To try
But afraid to never know
What it feels
Like
To be loved
Had a hill
To climb
But the places we could go
Oh-oh
I've gotta know

[Chorus]
So if we ever fell in Love
Would the wind know?
Would the pain go?
Ohh
So if we ever fell in love
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I was empty, it was all gone
The birds would sing, but make no sound
'Till I met you, found I was all wrong
You picked me up right off the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Was afraid
To try
And afraid we'll fall again
Crashing down
From the sky
Y'know
Had a hill
To climb
But with you my hand will make
There's the one thing
We all wanna know

[Chorus]
So if we ever fell in love
Would the wind know?
Would the pain go?
Ohh
So if we ever fell in love
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh

[Bridge]
I just wanna know (Know)
I just wanna know
Tell me, tell me so, baby, I just wanna know
I just wanna know (Know)
I just wanna know
Tell me, tell me so, baby, I just wanna know
I just wanna know (Know)
I just wanna know
Tell me, tell me so, baby, I just wanna know
I just wanna know (Know)
I just wanna know
Tell me, tell me so, baby, I just wanna know

[Chorus]
So if we ever fell in love
Would the wind know? (Wind know)
Would the pain go?
Ohh (Yeah)
So if we ever fell in love
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
So if we ever fell in love
Ohh
I wanna know
What it feels like to be loved

[Verse 1]
I'd be glad to stay right here with you
Fact is, that is what I'd planned to do
But from that cool look on your face
I think I'll head South to a warmer place

[Verse 2]
Thought I'd given you the best of me
I'd be glad to share the rest of me
But there's a chill in your embrace
So I'd better head South to a warmer place

[Bridge]
Seems like yesterday we could kiss and build a fire
But now it's ten below
Seems like yesterday nights were warm with love's desire
But now it feels like snow

[Verse 3]
I don't mind a cold day now and then
But this long deep freeze has done me in
And it's too late to plead your case
So I'm goin' South to a warmer place

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I don't mind a cold day now and then
But this long deep freeze has done me in
And it's too late to plead your case
So I'd better go South to a warmer place
Father can you hear me when I'm callin' (callin', callin')
I need you to be near me when I' fallin' (fallin', fallin')

Stop me Lord, I'm going down the wrong road
And I'm moving fast for a person with a strong load
But the weight I bare
U can't wait to share
Scrapped it there, my faith was always here
I'ma make it yeah, life is what it is
Nobody said that you would make it fair
And I'ma take it there, built for war
Gladiator with a good heart but built for more
But sometimes ain't enough sunshine till you dark cloud
Cause the devil on line
Casue there was one time
You put your hand on me and said
Don't worry about where you go
Cause you're being led

Father can you hear me when I'm callin' (callin', callin')
I need you to be near me when I' fallin' (fallin', fallin')
Day gets hard, but it's supposed to
Call on God cause that's who I'm close to
Told him, I chose you
I was introduced to the Devil
And through it all, I still chose you
I needed you, you rose to the occassion
Stood beside me, no matter what I was facing
Here I go chasing the wrong thing again
But if I fall, I know its you not him
That's be right there to pick me up
Put me back on my feet, ugh, lift me up
Plus you gave me the voice so I'm gon say it now
I love my God and I'm gon say it proud

Father can you hear me when I'm callin' (callin', callin')
I need you to be near me when I' fallin' (fallin', fallin')
Down where the trade winds play
Down where you lose the day
We found a new world where paradise starts
We traded high way down where the trade winds play
Music was everywhere, flowers were in her hair
Under an awning of silvery boughs
We traded vows the night that I sailed away
Oh trade winds, what are vows that lovers make
Oh trade winds, are they only made to break
When it is May again, I'll sail away again
Though I'm returning, it won't be the same
She traded her name way down where the trade winds play
C'mon Girl, C'mon Girl, C'mon Girl, Hey

In this world of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you

In this world of overrated pleasures
Of underrated treasures
I'm so glad there is you

I live to love
I love to live with you beside me
This role so new
I'll muddle through with you to guide me

In this world where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you

In this world where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever, I'm glad there is you
There's a girl I love, Sandy Mary is her name
There's a girl I love, Sandy Mary is her name
She got those bony bare looks
Enough to drive a vegetarian insane

She do not read so well, made the teacher go back to school
Do not read so well, make the teacher go back to school
A bony bare baby, yes, and I'm her bony bare fool

When we're lovin' - Sandy Mary
Get so high - feel so ready

Hold me baby - hold me darling
Feel my love come, to you fallin'
Hold me baby - hold me darling

Hold me baby - hold me darling
Feel my love come to you fallin', now

Sandy Mary, Sandy Mary -

You got just what it takes
To make a flesh-eater out of me, yeah
Break:

You got just what it takes to make a flesh eater out of me

[Verse 1]
Oh, people gather round me
This is to who it may concern
I'm not tryin' to run your life
But you're never too old to learn
Stop worryin' about your neighbors
And the fancy things they've got
'Cause if you do you'll find it's true
You're gonna wind up on the spot, oh

[Chorus]
Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, woo, one more time
Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, whoa, down
Ooh, hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

[Verse 2]
Huh, you may not believe it
But nine times out of ten it's true
The people you're tryin' to keep up with
Are tryin' to keep up, too
Remember that old sayin'; "All that glitters ain't gold"
Take heed, don't ignore it, and to your money tightly hold, oh

[Chorus]
Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down whoa, down
(Here me now now)
Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, whoa, down

[Bridge]
You're a leader yourself but you don't even know it
You're so busy followin' Joneses you ain't got time to show it
Keeping up with the Joneses, it only makes your life a mess
Bill collectors, tranquilizers, and gettin' deeper in debt

You better leave the Joneses alone
(Tell 'em one more time)
You better leave, oh leave, the Joneses alone, uh-huh

Joneses got a new car today
Here's what you should say; (Hooray for the Joneses)
Instead you worry 'til your whole head turns gray
(Worryin' about the Joneses)
Remember it's their car and they're the ones who had to pay
So leave (boom boom) the Joneses alone
Listen, your car might be old but, remember
It never fails to get you where you want to go

[Chorus]
Oh, don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, whoa, down
(Here me now now)
Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, whoa, down

[Bridge]
(scatting)

You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses blow your mind

Now listen, if you see somethin' you want
And you know you can't afford it
Well, the very next thing for you to do
Is start saving towards it
The Joneses have been the downfall
Of many a person you see
So, people, take my advice
And let the Joneses be, ow

[Chorus]
Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, whoa, down
Don't let the Jones, don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses get you down, whoa, down

[Outro]
You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses blow your mind, woo-hoo
You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses blow your mind, woo-hoo

(scatting)
When you awake, the day takes a bow at your door
When you awake, the sun shines like never before
Cloud soaked with rain find it hard to explain to the earth below
They can't let it rain for then it would stain a heavenly show, you make it so
When you awake, you open the eyes of my heart
When you awake, my day really gets its great start
All the winds and the birds join the simple refrain of a rippling stream
My world becomes a midsummer night's dream, when you awake
Strange music in my ears
Only now as you spoke did it start
Strange music of the sphere
Could its lovely hum be coming from my heart?

You appear and I hear song sublime
Song that I'm incapable of
So dear, let me hold you near
While we treasure every measure
So that time can never change
The strange new music of love

You appear and I hear song sublime
Song that I'm incapable of
So dear, let me hold you near
While we treasure every measure
So that time can never change
The strange new music of love
The boat rides we would take
The moonlight on the lake
The way we danced and hummed our favorite songs
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

The Midway and the fun
The Cupie dolls we won
The bell I rung to prove that I was strong
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

The early morning hike
The rented tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack

We never could explain that sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back
The leaves began to fade
Like promises we made
How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long
Well it's Twinkle, twinkle, little star
'Long comes Brady in his 'lectric car
Got a mean look right in his eye
He gonna shoot somebody just to see him die
He been on the job too long

Well Duncan, Duncan was tending the bar
'Long came Brady with his shiny star
"Brady," said Duncan, "you are under arrest"
Duncan shot a hole right in Brady's chest
He been on the job too long

"Brady, Brady, Brady, you know you done wrong
Breakin' in here while my game's  goin' on
Breakin' down the windows, bustin' down the door
Now you lyin' dead on the barroom floor
You been on the job too long"

Old King Brady was a big, fat man
Doctor reached up and took hold of his hand
Felt for the pulse, the doctor he said
"I believe to my soul, king Brady's dead"
Yes, He been on the job too long
Well, those rubber-tired carriages standing around
Taking Brady to the burying ground
High-top carriages and rubber-tired hack
Well, they took him to the graveyard
But they didn't bring him back
He been on the job too long

When the women they heard King Brady was dead
They all go home and they re-rag in red
Come slippin' and a-slidin', shuffelin' down the street
In their big mother hubbards and their stockin' feet
They been on the job too long

"Brady, Brady, Brady, you know you done wrong
Breakin' in here while my game's  goin' on
Bustin' down the window, knockin' down the door
Now you lyin' dead on the barroom floor
You been on the job too long"
If you want my love, baby
If you really do
Don't be afraid, baby
Just ask and ooh, I'm gonna give it to you

Though I do declare, I want to see you with it
Stretch out your arms little boy
You're gonna get it
'Cause I love you
Baby, baby, baby I love you
Ain't no doubt about , I love you
Baby, baby, baby I love you
I love you, I love you, Baby I love you

Some day, you might wanna run away
Leave me sitting here, crying
But if it's all the same to you baby
I'm gonna stop you from saying goodbye
Because I love you, baby I love you, I love you
I love you baby
Some day you might wanna run away
Leave me here, sitting and crying
But if it's all the same to you baby
I'm gonna stop you from saying goodbye
Baby I love you, baby I need you, gotta have you baby, tell you darling
Don't let your neighbors tell you that I don't want you
Don't let your low down friends tell you I don't need you
Ooh, baby I love you. I got to have you
Baby, baby I love you

[Intro]
So there you are
About time you showed up
Yeah, I know what you heard
But let me talk

[Verse 1]
Baby, take a look outside your window
And see your future standing there
I've been here for a while now, baby
Or maybe you weren't aware
I knew that you heard every single story
About all the friends that I've got
But baby, if you give me seven years of your time
All the friends I would have not

[Chorus]
Player, if I had you girl, I wouldn't be one
Player, if you'd let me in the mix, we could have fun
Player, if life was a movie, you'd have the main part
Girl, you're number one with a bullet on my charts

[Verse 2]
Don't make me say I need you like a beggar man
Why don't you let me come inside?
I'm the type of male that a girl like you is in need of
Sho' do right
I could take you sailing in a glass bottom boat
You could drink wine while I read poems that I wrote

I'm sick of fishing in the big sea, baby
I wanna check out the settling down
I wanna dock my boat in your fairway
In your kisses I wanna drown
In your kisses I wanna drown
In your kisses I wanna drown

[Chorus]
Player, if I had you girl, I wouldn't be one
Player, if you'd let me in the mix, we could have fun
Player, if life was a movie, you'd have the main part
Girl, you're number one with a bullet on my charts

[Interlude]
If I had you girl, I wouldn't be one

[Verse 3]
Friends, whatever they told you, they lied
My life's an open book, I ain't got nothing to hide
I need you like a beggar, yeah, I got no pride
Open your heart, let me come inside

[Chorus]
Player, if I had you girl, I wouldn't be one
Player, if you'd let me in the mix, we could have fun
Player, if life was a movie, you'd have the main part
Girl, you're number one with a bullet on my charts

[Verse 4]
Baby, take a look outside your window
And see your future standing there
I've been here for a while now, baby
Or maybe you wouldn't care
I knew that you heard every single story
About all the friends that I've got
But baby, if you give me seven years of your time
All the friends I will have not

[Chorus]
Player, if I had you girl, I wouldn't be one
Player, if you'd let me in the mix, we could have fun
Player, if life was a movie, you'd have the main part
Girl, you're number one with a bullet on my charts

[Outro]
Player
Player
Player
So that's my day in court

[Chorus]
I got a big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh)
System on blast, cops just pass
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky

[Verse 1]
Grease don't pop on the stove no more
Moved on up, double shot Hennessy
Fill my cup, Luda choke smoke
In a big black truck, should I wild out?
What the fuck? Act like my rims ain't clean
How you gon' act like my neck don't bling?
Haters get sprayed like Afro Sheen
But they don't ever really wanna pop them thangs
Cane-cane sugar mane, Luda don't go
And I stopped at a light, pulled off so slow
But I'm out for the night, so pass that 'dro
'Til daddy come home in a Cadillac Brough'm
(Cadillac Brough'm?) Now don't it sound absurd?
Claim College Park where they flip them birds
Trick car alarms then bend them curves
Chop-chop, chunk it up, fat man herb

[Chorus]
I got a big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh)
System on blast, cops just pass
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky

[Verse 2]
It's illegal, but the plants in my backyard grow
That's my buds, smoke 'til ya drop out
That's my luck, keep a couple rolled
And I hit the club, in the back door
Nigga, what? Act like I don't make clouds
How you gon' act like I don't get loud?
How you gon' act like I don't rock crowds
And leave a lot of people with a gap-toothed smile?
If I recollect right, then you sound like dirt
But I guess what you really don't know don't hurt
With a vest and a pump hear the shotgun squirt
My folks on the block, man, they got that work
(They got that work?) Don't it smell so good
In Southwest where they rep that hood
Protect your chest, they up to no good
And come through flossin', they wish y'all would

[Chorus]
I got a big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh)
System on blast, cops just pass
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky

[Verse 3]
Worldwide hustlers, get that dough
Work that tip, get rid of evidence
Move that brick, keep a D. Eagle
With a extra clip, think it ain't so?
Suck a dick, act like I just do rap
How you gon' act like I just ain't strapped?
How you gon' act like I don't push 'Lacs?
Black Eldorado, fifth wheel on back
Itchy finger-trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze
With a MAC or the Glock I'ma make 'em say please
And I'm back on the block where the cops say, "Freeze"
And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed
(You got a nose bleed?) Don't it smell so sweet?
In Decatur where they pack that heat
And rob neighbors in the night, creep-creep
I'll see you later, we'll be in them streets

[Chorus]
I got a big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh)
System on blast, cops just pass
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
I got a big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh)
System on blast, cops just pass
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky

[Chorus]
Can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more

[Verse 1]
Wipe out the paintings of slogans
All over the streets (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Confusing the people
While your asphalt burns our tired feet
I see borders and barriers
Segregation, demonstration and riots (ooh, ooh, ooh)
A-sufferation of the refugees
Oh-oh, when, when will we be free?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, we can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more
No more sweet talk from-a grimepit
No more sweet talk from the hypocrites

[Instrumental Solo]

[Chorus]
So we know we can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more
No more sweet talk from-a pulpit
No more sweet talk from the pulpit

[Outro]
No more sweet talk from-a grimepit
No more sweet talk from the hypocrites (oh, no hypocrites!)
No more sweet talk from-a grimepit (wo-ah yeah)
No more sweet talk (no-no-no-no sweet talk) from the hypocrites (hey!)
No more sweet talk from-a grimepit
No more sweet talk (no-no-no-no sweet talk) from the hypocrites (no-no-no-no hey!)
I cross the green mountain, I slept by the stream
Heaven blazin' in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream
Somethin' came up out of the sea
Swept through the land of the rich and the free

I look into the eyes of my merciful friend
And then I ask myself, is this the end?
Memories linger, sad yet sweet
And I think of the souls in heaven who will meet

Altars are burnin' with flames far and wide
The foe has crossed over from the other side
They tip their caps from the top of the hill
You can feel them come, more brave blood to spill

Along the dim Atlantic line
The ravaged land lies for miles behind
The light's comin' forward and the streets are broad
All must yield to the avengin' God

The world is old, the world is gray
Lessons of life can't be learned in a day
I watch and I wait and I listen while I stand
To the music that comes from a far better land
Close the eyes of our captain, peace may he know
His long night is done, the great leader is laid low
He was ready to fall, he was quick to defend
Killed outright he was, by his own men

It's the last day's last hour of the last happy year
I feel that the unknown world is so near
Pride will vanish and glory will rot
But virtue lives and cannot be forgot

The bells of the evening have rung
There's blasphemy on every tongue
Let 'em say that I walked in fair nature's light
And that I was loyal to truth and to right

Serve God and be cheerful, look upward, beyond
Beyond the darkness of masks, the surprises of dawn
In the deep green grasses of the blood stained wood
They never dreamed of surrenderin', they fell where they stood

Stars fell over Alabama, I saw each star
You're walkin' in dreams, whoever you are
Chilled are the skies, keen is the frost
The grounds froze hard and the morning is lost

A letter to mother came today
Gun shot wound to the breast is what it did say
But he'll be better soon, he's in a hospital bed
But he'll never be better, he's already dead
I'm ten miles outside the city and I'm lifted away
In an ancient light that is not of day
They were calm, they were blunt, we knew 'em all too well
We loved each other more than we ever dared to tell
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

Oh yeah, all right
Are you gonna be in my dreams
Tonight

And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
One day you may find true love
That will last forever and ever
Till then you'll spend
A lifetime wishing one together

You never thought she'd say goodbye
And you'll never understand
The reasons why

Heart of mine
How will you keep from dying
Stop the reminiscing
Who is she kissing

Heart of mine
Oh, what's the use in trying
No one can mend you now

Love plays cruel games
You can't believe
She's found another lover
Does she miss me?
Sometimes you just
Can't help but wonder

No, you can't hold
The hands of time
And you'll always be
The one she left behind

Heart of mine
(Oh, heart of mine)
How will you keep from dying
Stop the reminiscing
Who is she kissing

Heart of mine
(Oh, heart of mine)
Oh, what's the use in trying
No one can mend you now

And you will never
Understand the reasons why

Heart of mine
(Oh, heart of mine)
How will you keep from dying
Stop the reminiscing
Who is she kissing
Heart of mine
(Oh, heart of mine)
Oh, what's the use in trying
No one can mend you now

(Heart of mine)
Oh, heart of mine
(Heart of mine)

Heart of mine
(Oh, heart of mine)
Heart of mine
She's young, but lord what a woman she's quick as a brawl at five
She's class, one hell of a woman, she really confused my mind
She's bad, power of the pleasure is far enough ta chase
She's fast, power of the pedal is keeping up the pace

Wise up, she's some kind of woman
Wise up, you can't get away
Wise up, ooh just when you think that its safe

I'm gone, I can't justify when I ain't got some control
So long, I ain't gonna stop 'till I step right off this world
She's gone, I guess I'm the winner of an innocent little time
Don't look, a tap on the shoulder sends a shiver down my spine

Wise up, she's some kind of woman
Wise up, can't get away
Wise up, oh just when you think that its safe (safe) ...
She's back

Cryin', to give all the lovin' but I never was enough
I cried, I prayed up to Heaven but the Lord said, "Boy that's tough."
This smile, only served me to ruin me when I thought I had direction
That walk, how the hell did she do it every move was perfection
Wise up, she's some kind of woman
Wise up, you can't get away
Wise up, ooh just when you think that its safe
Ooh she's back
Ah she's back
Ahh my motors runnin'
It's buzzin'
Ooh she's back
Ah
Ooh she's back
Ooh
Come to Bethl'em, come to Bethl'em
Dooy dai dooy dai dooy dai da
Come children all, to the lonely stall
Where the little Jesus sleeps

Bring Him flowers, bring him flowers
Dooy dai dooy dai dooy dai da
Make of them a crown, gently lay it down
Where the little Jesus sleeps

[Bamboo]
The music's starting
My name is B-A-M-B-O-O
I'm so fast and everybody is slow
I'm so strong I can pick anybody up
I will throw you down and I will give you a pop
He farts a lot and plus drools a lot and he's sleeping a lot

[Cross]
You don't kill me like that!
My name is Cross
I am the boss
I'm a vicious bowler
I wear a Polo – with the horse on it
I'm on it! I'm on it!
And I pop a wheelie
If somebody speeds me I hit 'em!
I can't remember...
I want to dance
Can I dance?

[Verse 1]
Can I go on my way without you?
Whoa, how can I know?
If I go on my way without you
Whoa, where would I go?

[Bridge]
Set sail with me
Misty lady, set my spirit free
New love to find
And though I leave another behind

[Chorus]
I'll always (Come back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)

[Verse 2]
She's my lady, now and ever
Whoa, how can I know?
Can we go all the way together?
Whoa, let it be so

[Bridge]
So we'll say our last goodbye
And we'll make it this time
Ho-oh, oh, set sail with me
To a paradise out beyond the sea

[Chorus]
Atlantis (Is back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
Atlantis (Is back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
Atlantis (Is back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
Atlantis (Is back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
Atlantis (Is back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
Winding down the Drury Lane
I fall with the evening rain
My thoughts with the water flow
Like steam rising off the road

Passers-by watch their step
To see that they don't get wet
And I'll just sit beneath this tree
Let the drops fall all over me
And watch the city lights flick on

The crowds collide just out of my reach
The taxi's lights flash up and down the street
I sit and watch the faces go by
I don't wonder where to or why

Cos it's me the rain my warm dark pain
Alone at ease and nowhere at all
My thoughts just drift on back to you
It seems you're here so it must be true
We never parted you never went away
So I order up another glass
Not to let the moment pass
Turning around in love with you
Oh I know you loved me too
And it's always been this way

Here sitting in my wet cafe
I catch a spark across the way
A string of tiny painted bells
Seem to have a tale to tell

A string of tiny painted bells
On someone that I once knew well
Is all that's left
The rest's not true
I smile I see it's really you
The rain will go
And you will too

And I order up another glass
Not to let the moment pass
Turning around in love with you
Oh it got too hard to do
And it's always been this way
Yes it's always been this way
Wine and women and song will only make me sad
Love and kisses and hugs, the things I never had
If this should end, I don't mind
If this should end, I will find
What shall I do (what shall I do)
What shall I do (what shall I do)

Cars and buses and trams make a lot of noise
All my women have gone out with other boys
If this should end, I don't mind
If this should end, I will find
I won't complain (I won't complain)
I feel no pain (I feel no pain)

Ooh..
If this should end, I don't mind
If this should end, I will find
I won't complain (I won't complain)
I feel no pain (I feel no pain)

Wine and women and song will only make me sad
Love and kisses and hugs, the thing I never had
If this should end, I don't mind
If this should end, I will find
I won't complain (I won't complain)
I feel no pain (I feel no pain)
I won't complain, cry
The moon was all aglow and heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies
The stars all seemed to know that you didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me those little white lies
I try but there's no forgetting when evening appears
I sigh but there's no regretting in spite of my tears
The devil was in your heart but heaven was in your eyes
The night you told me those little white lies
Verse 1:

Could you ever need me
And would you know how, yeah
Don't waste our time
Tell me now

Is speak out my name
And I would come running anyway

And I said
Could it be me
Could it really, really be
Over and over
Could it really, really be

Ohh, over and over

Ohh, I said
Could it be me
Could it really, really be
Over and over
Could it really, really be
Don't turn me away
And don't let me down, yeah
What can I do
To keep you around

Over and over
Over and over
Over and over

Over and over
Over and over
Well, about the time my daddy left to fight the big war
Saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store, when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen
I asked if I could have one when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs and she really blew up
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

My very first pistol was a cap-and-ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
It loads a mite slow and I soon found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
Then I went and bought myself a Colt .45
Called a Peacemaker but I didn't know why
I never knew why and I didn't understand
'Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
I never knew why, I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

I got into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheating and I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
I found your lips tonight but where do you keep your heart?
I found your arms just right, but where do you keep your heart?
It's very plain to see I'll never win you
Unless you long for me deep down within you
I looked into your eyes, to see if you really care
You took me to the skies, but where do we go from there?
Oh, it's been such a lovely evening, but darling before we part
Please tell where you keep your heart
And the two friends went home
No need for words, they are as one
And now summer's over
The light on the fields grows older
Oh, but all I know, is all I know
It's the disco infiltrator for sure
But all I see, is all I see
But still you want it, oh
Stop, you can't believe, what you believe
Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh, stupid me, oh, stupid me
But still we want it, oh

Stop, we can't shake the waist
Oh, stop, you've got to shake the waist

Stop, what you've been told is what you're told
It's the disco infiltrator gone cold
Oh, stupid you, I bet' told the truth
But you don't want it, no
Stop, you make me frown your little town
You run the disco infiltrator on down
Oh, stupid you, oh, stupid me
And we deserve it, oh
Stop, you can shake the waist
Oh, stop, you've got to shake the waist

Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time

Oh, but all I know, is all I know
It's the disco infiltrator for sure
But all I see, is all I see
But still you want it, oh
Stop, you can't believe what you believe
Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh, stupid me, oh, stupid me
Oh, but still we want it, oh

Stop, you can't shake your waist
Oh, don't stop, you've got to shake your waist
Stop, you can't shake your waist
Oh, don't stop, you've got to shake your waist

Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind
From time to time
Behind
Yeah, I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help myself
Yeah, I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help myself
You've always fooling around, givin' my love to somebody else

Still I stay in the mood for you and I can see you everywhere I go
Still I stay in the mood for you and I can see you everywhere I go

Well, if something soon don't happen, my heart is gonna break I know

Well, you said that you love me, you've sworn that you'll be true
But now you're tellin' stronger, that I'm just a fool you know
But I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help myself
Please come back to me baby, 'cause I'm tired of livin' by myself
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That's when my love comes a-tumbling down
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
When there's nobody else around

I'm gonna take you girl and hold you
Do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour
Yes I am

I'm gonna wait till the stars come out
And twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour
That when my love begins to shine

'Cause you're the only girl I know
That can really love me so
In the midnight hour
Ladies, you're damn right, you can't read a man's mind
We're living in two tribes and heading for war
Well, nobody's perfect, we've all gotta work it
But fellas, we're worth it so don't break the law
Your call's late, big mistake
You gotta hang about in limbo for as long as I take
Next time, read my mind and I'll be good to you
We're gift-wrapped kitty cats
We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back
Let's go, Eskimo, out into the blue
Come take my hand, understand that you can
You're my man and I need you tonight
Come make my dreams, honey, hard as it seems
Loving me is as easy as pie
(Ai)
I'm just a love machine, feeding my fantasy
Give me a kiss or three and I'm fine
I need a squeeze a day 'stead of this negligee
What will the neighbors say this time?
I've been going crazy while you sleep
Thinking of a language that the two of us can speak
So Mr. Prehistoric, make your wheel
And I'll breathe underwater 'cause I like the way it feels
I said your call's late, big mistake
You gotta hang about in limbo for as long as I take
Next time, read my mind and I'll be good to you
We're gift-wrapped kitty cats
We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back
Let's go, Eskimo, out into the blue
Come take my hand, understand that you can
You're my man and I need you tonight
Come make my dreams, honey, hard as it seems
Loving me is as easy as pie
I'm just a love machine, feeding my fantasy
Give me a kiss or three and I'm fine
I need a squeeze a day 'stead of this negligee
What will the neighbors say this time?
Oh, it's very new
Can anybody tell me what to do?
Oh, this feeling's very strange
Can anybody tell me what's your game?
(Oh)
A little education
(Oh)
To give you motivation
(Oh)
We'll turn the situation round
(Oh, Oh)
(Oh)
Making you a stranger
(Oh)
I'll only re-arrange ya for now
(Oh)
I'm just a love machine
(Oh)
To give you motivation
(Oh)
I'm just a love machine
(Oh)
I'm just a love machine
(Oh)
To give you motivation
(Oh)
I'm just a love machine

[Verse 1]
Yes I do, I love you
I swear on the stars above I do
I swear on the streetlight on the corner
Shoving back the shadows

[Chorus 1]
One shadow cursing, another shadow laughing
Underneath the streetlight
I don't know where they're coming from, I just see 'em passing
Underneath the streetlight

[Verse 2]
Yes I do, I love you
I swear on the buildings above I do
I swear on a billion yellow
And TV blue windows

[Chorus 2]
Gay boys with their pants so tight out in the neon light
Underneath the street light
A m- m- madman-madman kicking over garbage cans
Underneath the streetlight

[Verse 3]
Yes I do--I love you
I swear on the blinkin' planes above I do
I swear on the truck at the stoplighr
With his airbrakes moaning

[Chorus 3]
All night the trucks roll up to the tunnel toll
Underneath the streetlight
They come rollin', rollin', rollin' for a living
Underneath the streetlight

[Verse 4]
Yes I do, I love you
I swear on the disco sparkle dark I do
I swear on the be-bop boys
Chasing the black bird

[Chorus 4]
Rock 'n' roll broadcast movin' up now full blast
Underneath the streetlight
They come dancin', dancin', really rock 'n rollin'
Underneath the streetlight

[Outro]
Yes I do, I love you
I really love you
Yes I do, yes I do
I love you

Now then tell me sugar mama
Now where in the world did you get your sugar from?
Now then tell me sugar mama
Now where in the world did you get your sugar from?
Was it back in Philadelphia woman?
Back from the place where you come from

You know they're braggin' about your sugar
Yes I said they're braggin' about it all over town
Yes I said they're braggin' about your sugar
Whoa I said they're braggin' about it all over town
Everyplace I go
Sugar Mama, sure can here your name

I like my coffee sweet in the morning baby
Yes you know I'm crazy about my tea at night
Yes I said I like my coffee sweet in the morning
Baby you know I'm just crazy about my tea at night
Don't get my sugar three times a day
Baby you know you and me just can't get along right
In the rattle of the battle, came a whisper soft and low
From a soldier who'd been wounded in the fray
"I am dying, Captain, dying and I pray before I go
You will give your promise here I pass away"

Do not ask me dear to linger, for I know not what to say
When duty calls, just sweetheart's name in vain
I hope your heart will not be crying, if I'm not among the dying
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again

Yes, when the roses bloom again, beside the river
And the Robin Redbreast sings it's sweet refrain
As in days of Old Lang Syne, I'll be with you sweetheart mine
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again

Do not ask me dear to linger, for I know not what to say
When duty calls, just sweetheart's name in vain
I hope your heart will not be crying if I not among the dying
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again

When the roses bloom again beside the river
And the Robin Redbreast sings it's sweet refrain
As in days of Old Lang Syne, I'll be with you sweetheart mine
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again

[Verse 1]
The storm is over, and I'm so glad the sun is shining
We fast and pray and it feels good to know that he answers
Confusion everywhere without a clue on how to make it better (yeah)
A toast to the man upstairs 'cause he puts the pieces back together

[Pre-Chorus]
Now let's step to a new tune (come on)
'Cause everything's okay (yeah)
You alright, and I'm alright
Well, let's celebrate

[Chorus]
What a relief to know that (yeah), we are one (ooh)
What a relief to know that (ooh), the war is over
What a relief to know that, there's an angel in the sky
What a relief to know that, love is still alive, yeah

[Verse 2]
Though we struggle, know that help is on the way, yeah (ooh)
The power of love, we cannot underestimate, no (ooh)
Seems like you're gonna break (yeah), and there is no escape (yeah)
You've still got to have faith (yeah)
And know that love is gonna step up to the plate, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Now let's step to a brand new tune
'Cause everything's okay (ooh)
You alright (yeah), and I'm alright (yeah)
Ooh, so let's celebrate

[Chorus]
What a relief to know that (ooh), we are one (we are one)
What a relief to know that (the war), the war is over
What a relief to know that (yeah), there's an angel in the sky
What a relief to know that, love is still alive

[Bridge]
Listen, see I'm just trying to bring relief to that who need it (yeah)
Somebody help somebody, now go and repeat it
Understand that struggle has no colors (no)
See, we all got our stormy weather (yeah)
Which all the more reason why we should join hands and pull it together (yeah)
Stepping gives us a way out through the back door (yeah)
So take a deep breath and grab somebody and hit the floor

[Chorus]
What a relief to know that, we are one (we are one, yeah, we are one)
What a relief to know that (what a relief, yeah), the war is over
What a relief to know that, there's an angel in the sky
What a relief to know that, love is still alive
What a relief to know that (yeah), we are one (ooh)
What a relief to know that, the war is over
What a relief to know that, there's an angel in the sky
What a relief to know that, love is still alive
Life lands a crushing blow
And once again a heart is broken
And as history repeats it's self
These few words are sadly spoken

I've passed this way before
I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

As I watch love walkin' away
It brings back old memories
A familiar pain still feels the same
Once again heartache has found me
A dark cloud covered my heart ooh
When she told me goodbye
Now there's nothing left but emptiness
And the tears that fill my cryin' eyes

I've pass this way before
I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again
No matter how strong a man is
Without a love he walks in the dark baby
If love deserts him it would surly hurt him
'cause his weakness is his heart
A lonely journey now stands before me
The endless pain has started
But this time I know the way
Walkin' alone and broken hearted because

I've pass this way before
I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again
I'm a stranger here and I just rode into town
I'm a stranger here and I just rode into town
Just because I'm a stranger, everybody wants to dog me around
I wonder, how long does my baby know I'm here?
I wonder, how long does my baby know I'm here?
Just because I'm a stranger, everybody wants to dog me around
I'm a stranger here and I just rode into town
I'm a stranger here and I just rode into town
Just because I'm a stranger, everybody wants to dog me around
I wonder, how long does my baby know I'm here?
I wonder, how long does my baby know I'm here?
Just because I'm a stranger, everybody wants to dog me around
I'm a stranger here and I just rode into town
I'm a stranger here and I just rode into town
Just because I'm a stranger, everybody wants to dog me around
My bills are all due and the babies need shoes, but I'm busted
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound and I'm busted
I got a cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills that gets bigger each day
The county will haul my belongings away, I'm busted

I went to my brother to ask for a loan, I was busted
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone but I'm busted
My brother said, "There ain't a thing I can do"
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu
And I was just thinking of calling on you, I'm busted
Saw a bird with a tear in his eye
Walking to New Orleans---my, my, my
Hey, now, Bird, wouldn't you rather die
Than walk this world when you're born to fly?

If I was the sun, I'd look for shade
If I was a bed, I would stay unmade
If I was a river I'd run uphill
If you call me you know I will
If you call me you know I will

Ooo, Freedom
Ooo, Liberty
O... Leave me alone
To find my own way home
To find my own way home

Say what I mean and I don't give a damn
I do believe and I am who I am
Hey now Mama come take my hand
Whole lotta shakin' all over this land
If I was an eagle I'd dress like a duck
Crawl like a lizard and honk like a truck
If I get a notion I'll climb this tree
Or chop it down and you can't stop me
Chop it down and you can't stop me

Ooo, Freedom
Ooo, Liberty
O ... leave me alone
To find my own way home
To find my own way home

Went to the well but the water was dry
Dipped my bucket in the clear blue sky
Looked in the bottom and what did I see?
The whole damned world looking back at me

If I was a bottle I'd spill for love
Sake of mercy I'd kill for love
If I was a liar I'd lie for love
Sake of my baby I'd die for love
Sake of my baby I'd die for love

Ooo Freedom
Ooo Liberty
O... Leave me alone
To find my own way home
To find my own way home
I'm gonna find my own way home
I am a bird; watch me go drifting by
With my feathers of power I laugh as the hours go slowly by
That could mean ev'rything
I am a street watching the people walk
As I listen their conversations glisten as they start to talk
Then I hear ev'rything

Little white jug, me and Kilburn Towers
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill
Till the early hours
Then I am ev'rything
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
That could mean ev'rything

Little white jug, me and Kilburn Towers
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill
Till the early hours
Then I am ev'rything

Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers

[Verse 1]
When I look at you
A beautiful theme of every dream I ever knew
Down deep in my heart I hear it say
I feel it start, then melt away
Yes, I hear music when I touch your hand
A beautiful melody from some enchanted land
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say
"Is this the day?"

[Bridge]
I alone have heard this lovely strain
I alone have heard this glad refrain
Must it be forever inside of me?
Why can't I let it go? Why can't I let you know?

[Verse 2]
Why can't I let you know the song my heart would sing?
Beautiful rhapsody of love and youth and spring
The music is sweet, ah, the words are true
The song is you

[Outro]
How must it be forever inside of you?
Beautiful rhapsody of love and youth and spring
The music is sweet, ah, the words are true
And the song is you
Have a little drink
No thank you brother
Do you want to get rich?
Don't need it brother
Wanna fool around
No thank you sister
Ain't you heard that old evil man within me died
Let's have a party
I ain't going what you gonna do
I'm gonna keep praying
And keep working out my salvation

Trying to sanctified
No more condemnation
Repented Jesus brought salvation
He saved me
Justification brought me safely to his side
And as I get to know him more
He gives me a taste of the coming glory
And I'm trying to whip the devil
Trying to get sanctified
Sanctified, sanctified
I'm working to whip the devil
I'm trying to get sanctified
Don't go to church
Yes I'm going
Why you read that old Bible?
Cause I like it

Well I don't believe in god
Well God bless you
You ain't got no argument
For what I feel inside
Aww, have a little fun
That's what I'm having
Life's passing you by
I can hardly wait
I've got my mind set on Eternity

Trying to get sanctified
And there's no more condemnation
Repented Jesus brought salvation
He saved me
Justification brought me safely to his side
And as I get to know him more
He gives me a taste of the coming glory
And I'm trying to whip the devil
Trying to get sanctified
Sanctified, (sanctified)
Sanctified, sanctified
Yes I'm trying to whip the devil
I'm trying to get sanctified
Sanctified, sanctified
Sanctified, sanctified
I'm working out my salvation trying to get sanctified
Sanctified
Oh, well, I'm sittin' here, la, la
Waiting for my ya ya
Uh huh, uh huh
Er, sittin' here, la, la
Waiting for my ya ya
Uh huh, uh huh
It may sound funny
But I don't believe she's comin'
Uh huh, uh huh

Baby, honey, don't leave me worried
Uh huh, uh huh
Er, baby, honey, er, don't leave me worried
Uh huh, uh huh
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
Uh huh, uh huh
When the moon comes up the sun goes down
Rita starts her creeping around
Flame in her blood fire on her breath
Fourteen names carved on her chest
She gotta rose tattooed on her thigh
Dead men raise and sigh
It drives my young blood wild

My baby's got the Cadillac walk
The Cadillac walk
She's got the Cadillac walk
Cadillac walk

When Rita turns down her bed
Grown men plead and beg
Baby honey baby you're the one
Carve your name right on my gun
Oooh
Ain't she something nice
Bones rattle my dice
Ooh
My baby's got the Cadillac walk
The Cadillac walk
She's got the Cadillac walk
The cadillac walk

Lonely late at night honey hear my call
She said "boy I'm gonna make you crawl"
Rita pound by pound
Knows how to work it on down
Weep and moan to and fro
Leave your heart she'll steal your soul
No matter what the cost
Them dual exhausts
Make my motor sigh

My baby's got the Cadillac walk
She's got the Cadillac walk
She got the Cadillac walk
Cadillac walk

Lonely late at night honey hear my call
She said "boy I'm gonna make you crawl"
Rita pound by pound
Knows how to work it on down
Weep and moan to and fro
Leave your heart she'll steal your soul
No matter what the cost
Them dual exhausts
Make my motor sigh
My baby's got the Cadillac walk
She's got the Cadillac walk
She got the Cadillac walk
She got the Cadillac walk
Whoo
I think the stars are especially bright tonight
And I love the way they shine
Reflecting inside your eyes
It's you and me forever
That's what I know for sure
My heart is here for you
Just like an open door

I can't say in any better way
Hard to explain
What you mean to me

You're beautiful

And I can't find
Any better line
For design
Any better sing for
You're beautiful

I feel the sun
He's especially warm today
Well I guess you may
I guess the rain, go and come back another day
You know I love your smile
But that's all I need for me
And living my life with you
It's just like a fantasy

I can't say in any better way
Hard to explain
What you mean to me

You're beautiful

And I can't find
Any better line
For design
Any better sing for
You're beautiful

I can't say in any better way
Hard to explain
What you mean to me

You're beautiful
As I awake this lonely mornin'
I do thank God that U were born
And I picture us on furry floors
And I like it so me touch myself

I prayed that I could have U all 2 myself
So U came 4 me and no one else
Now my heart beats wild 4 U I melt
I want U so me touch myself
Hallelujah

CHORUS:
Me touch myself, me touch myself
Until U and I can truly melt
Every morning me touch myself

This power that U have is unexplainable
If I could live without U honey - debatable
I'm not used 2 this feeling of unstable
Come and get me before me touch myself
CHORUS

Like ice I will become until U come 4 me
No one ever will warm me, I'll be cold as can be
I need the pictures only U and I can see
I need U so me touch myself
I bleed 4 U and me touch myself
U planted the seed, now me touch myself
It's a shame indeed, now me touch myself
Me touch myself

CHORUS

(CHORUS)
I.. I.. I will finally free
Come and get me and U'll see
I'll be like others never be
Ooh wee, baby, U make me touch myself

Oh baby, me touch myself
Me touch myself {repeat 2 fade}
Confidential as a baby's kiss
Smooth like a baby's breath
Your love for me will always be
Confidential to me

Oh, to look...
I'll never find a girl like you

Oh... i'll never find i'll never find someone like you

Girl, you take my breath away and when i with someone new i'd rather be here
With you baby, forever ooh my heart belongs to you girl i'm thinking 'bout you
All the time i know my love is true when we're together i played around girl
And i made you cry when i looked up you were saying goodbye i'm begging you
Please i need you so bad don't leave me now you're the best that i've had

Chorus: i'll never i'll never find someone like you no i'll never i promise
It's true oh i'll never i'll never find someone like you ooh baby cuz i love
The way that you are and girl i won't no i won't let you go no one could ever
Do love me like i love you

All i have is just my heart and my feelings i give to you that's all that i can
Do girl baby, forever ooh you don't know that you're hurting me cuz it's not
Just a sexual thing i wanna share my dreams baby, together oh girl i'm afraid
Just to give you the love my heart's telling me to hold on to our love but when
You get close i want you to know i start to get weak and i can't let you go
Chorus

Just your smile that's all i need think again girl i won't let you down girl i
Will never find someone that compares to you

Chorus (2x)
Are you lonesome tonight
Do you miss me tonight
Are you sorry we drifted apart
Does your memory stray
To a bright summer day
When I kissed you
And called you sweetheart
Do the chairs in your parlour
Seem empty and bare
Do you gaze at your doorstep

And picture me there
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again
Tell me dear
Are you lonesome tonight
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again
Tell me dear
Are you lonesome tonight
I don't care if I spent my dough
Night gonna be
Gonna rock it up
Gonna shake it up
Gonna roll it up
Have 'em ball tonight
Rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you never done nothing
To save your doggone soul
Well get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said to my soul:
You're the devil in a frying pan
Well I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you never done nothing
To save your doggone soul
You can knock me down
Slap my face
Slander my name
All over the place
Do anything that you want to do
But oh oh honey
Lay off of them shoes
Now don't you step
On my blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything
But lay off of them blue suede shoes
Ah go!
You can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar
Do anything
That you want to do
But ah ah honey
Lay off of them shoes
And don't you step
On my blue suede shoes, please
Well you can do anything
But lay off of them blue suede shoes
Ah go, hit it, Carl 

[Perkins]!
Well blue blue
Blue suede shoes
Yeah blue blue
Blue suede shoes
Babe blue blue
Blue suede shoes
Yeah brown brown
Brown suede boots
Well do anything
But lay off of them blue suede shoes
Seven o'clock in the morning
And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells, "Good morning, darlin", from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me
And to my surprise, she ain't you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face
Like, what have I done?
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun?
Lost the track of time
Oh, what was on my mind?
From the club, went to her home
Didn't plan to stay that long
Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys
Tryin' to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, "You can't go this way"
Looked at her, like she was crazy
Said, "Woman move out my way"
Said, "I got a wife at home"
She said, "Please don't go out there"
"Lady, I've got to get home"
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs
"Shh, shh, quiet
Hurry up and get in the closet"
She said, "Don't you make a sound
Or some shit is going down"
I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"
"Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor"
"Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet"
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
Then he walks in and yells, "I'm home"
She says, "Honey, I'm in the room"
Walks in there with a smile on his face
Sayin', "Honey, I've been missin' you"
She hops all over him
And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water?
I'm tellin' you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar
Throws her in the bed
And start to snatchin' her clothes off
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna believe it
But things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said, "There's a mystery going on
And I'm gonna solve it"
And I'm like, "God please, don't let this man open this closet?
He walks in the bathroom
And looks behind the door
She says, "Baby, come back to bed"
He says, "Bitch say no more"
He pulls back the shower curtain
While she's biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room
Right now, I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed
Then under the dresser
He looks at the closet
I pull out my Beretta
He walks up to the closet
He goes up to the closet
Now he's at the closet
Damn he's opening the closet?
Honey passing kissing rhyme, and we can smell on your face
How was I supposed to show my love and all my rage?
I didn't like the taste of words to express my love to you
Hiding emotions, my arms keep missing you
Stumbled in to embrace that bounds us side by side
My frozen heart was shivering with loneliness
Spirits of the sky attached... away my passion
Like snowflakes in the air, when you give me your last goodbye
In the snow we... sky
You never show me your tears, till your turn your back so slow
Now I know that you are the one
Being strong for the two of us
When you saw my reflection in the snow, you saw it from the heart
Now that I'm all alone, still regret everything I had wrong
Knowing to confess it to, just kept it to myself
If I tried to put it into words, exactly what my heart asks
So afraid it might melt away, like snowflakes in your hand
And after that I fall in love time in time again
Oh, why can't I erase you from my memories?
There always will be a place for you in my heart forever
Kind snowflakes from my world
Oh, some of us keep going back, some of us keep coming back
But I'll never see you again forever eternally
As we're under the same skies, looking at the same stores tonight
I just wish for you more love than most will find, will find
So glad it's over
My tears froze in front of us, the stillness of my heart is waiting
Please... fade away, all the good...
Heavenly white, please send my love away
When you give me your last goodbye
In the snow we... sky
You never show me your tears, till your turn your back so slow
Now I know that you are the one
Being strong for the two of us
When you saw my reflection in the snow, you saw it from the heart
Saw it from my heart
When you give me your last goodbye
In the snow we... sky
You never show me your tears, till your turn your back so slow, till you turn your back so slow
Now I know that you are the one
Being strong for the two of us
When you saw my reflection in the snow, you saw it from the heart
No baby, no baby, no baby, no, oh no
No baby, no baby, no baby, no, oh no
I woke up this morning, my baby was gone
Woke up this morning, my baby was gone
I've been so bad, I'm all alone

I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me
I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery

Well baby, I'm all alone
Yes baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin'
Since my baby's been gone
All right... (guitar solo)

Oh baby, I'm all alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery

Oh baby, come on stay with me
Yes baby, come on stay with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery
Oh baby I'm all alone
Oh baby I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin' since my baby been gone

[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
And this is the bit where I don't know the words
But I don't think I'm even gonna bother to try and learn them
Before the end of the tour
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

[Verse 3]
I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

Boy, you're going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're going to carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Outro]
You break down
You break down
You break down
Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
Tonight
Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
Tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
Tonight
I've been working on the railroad
All the live long day
I've been working on the railroad
Just to pass the time away
Can't you hear the whistle blowing
Rise up so early in the morn
Can't you hear the whistle blowing
Dinah, blow your horn

Dinah won't you blow
Dinah won't you blow
Dinah, won't you blow your horn
Dinah, won't you blow
Dinah, won't you blow
Dinah, won't you blow your horn

Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Someone's in the kitchen I know
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strumming on the old banjo
Fee fie fiddle eell o
Fee fie fiddle eell o
Fee fie fiddle eell o
Strumming on the old banjo
Whiskey bottles and brand new cars
Oak tree you're in my way
There's too much coke and too much smoke
Look what's going on inside you

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Angel of darkness is upon you
Stuck a needle in your arm (You fool, you)
So take another toke, have a blow for your nose
One more drink fool, would drown you (Hell, yeah)

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Now they call you Prince Charming
Can't speak a word when you're full of 'ludes
Say you'll be alright come tomorrow
But tomorrow might not be here for you (Yeah, you)
Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Aw, you fool, you
You stick them needles in your arm
I know I been there before

One little problem that confronts you
Got a monkey on your back
Just one more fix Lord, might do the trick
One hell of a price for you to get your kicks (Hell, yeah)

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Ooh, that smell
Can't you smell that smell?
Ooh, that smell
The smell of death surrounds you

Oh, you fool, you
Don't stick those needles in your arm
You're just a fool, just a fool, just a fool
It worries me
You seem to be unhappy
And that worries me

I hate to think that maybe
I have made you blue
Just what did I do
Was I mean to you
Wish I knew

I worry so
If anything is wrong
I have the right to know

So while I hold you close
And kiss you tenderly
Tell it all to me
Darling can't you see
Anything that worries you, worries me
If Jesus ever loved a woman, I think Mary Magdalene
Was the woman that He loved
If Jesus ever loved a woman
It was Mary Magdalene

His life was pure perfection
And He never did no sin, nor lust nor greed
And He fell to no temptation
And only did His Father know about His human need

And many were the women and the men
Who followed each place He was seen
From seven dirty devils
Did He free the soul of Mary Magdalene

If Jesus ever loved a woman, I think Mary Magdalene
Was the woman, Jesus loved
If Jesus ever loved a woman
It was Mary Magdalene

He never did condemn a man, a woman
Just for being man, or woman
And He always will forgive
If someone tells Him, that they're really truly sorry
But He couldn't stand a hypocrite
A person who'd pretend that they were holy
And we're not
I'd think He'd loved someone like Mary Magdalene, quiet a lot

If Jesus ever loved a woman, I think Mary Magdalene
Was the woman that He loved
If Jesus ever loved a woman, it was Mary Magdalene
If Jesus ever loved a woman, I think Mary Magdalene
Was the woman that He loved
If Jesus ever loved a woman, it was Mary Magdalene
Well hello pretty baby
I just called to say that we're through
Because I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you

I want to meet you in the sunlight
Not in a secret rendezvous
Because I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you

Oh you never, you're never meant to be mine
I was just too blind to see
Oh but I've got my pride, so why should we hide
When you might as well be free

Oh I love, you know I love you
Oh, and I want to tell the world I do
That's why I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you
Oh I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you
Oh, I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you
Five hundred guys have one thousand eyes for my baby
They stand around and stare, no matter where she goes
Five hundred men have one great big yen for my baby
They'd like to buy her things, like diamond rings and clothes

I really had to overcome a lot of competition
And I'm not telling how I reached my number one position

But 499 are wasting their time with my baby
And here's the reason why they have my sympathy
'Cause, baby, she got eyes for me

(Five hundred guys have one thousand eyes) For my baby
They stand around and stare, no matter where she goes
(Five hundred men have one great big yen) For my baby
(They'd like to buy her things, like) Diamond rings and clothes

I really had to overcome a gang of competition
And I'm not telling how I reached my number one position

But 499, man, they're wasting their time with my baby
And here's the reason why they have my sympathy
'Cause, baby, has two eyes, great big bright two eyes
Baby just has eyes for me
My baby just has eyes for me
I know you don't love me no more
You're not the kind that would tell me so
Be a woman and talk to me
That's the way I'd rather it be
Feeling sorry for me in your own way
You've got to hurt me by telling me one day
So you get it over baby
Please, stop leadin' me on
You're miserable and I'm the cause
Feeling sorry won't help you at all
I hate to see you live this way
So you go on baby, I'll make it someday
Ah, yes, I know you don't love me no more
Yes, you're not the kind that would tell me so
Get it over baby
Please, stop leadin' me on
You are miserable and I'm the cause
Feeling sorry won't help you at all
I hate to see you living this way
So you go on baby, I'll make it someday
Yes, yes I know you don't love me no more
You're not the kind that would tell me so
So you go on baby
Please, stop leadin' me on
Please, stop leadin' me on
Can you hear me baby
Please, stop leadin' me on
I get stoned
I can't go home
I'm calling long distance on a public saxophone
My head is achin'
Lord, my mind is breakin'
Feel I got run over by Captain Coconut and his dog name Rover
Gotta keep movin'
Gotta keep movin'
To understand both sides of the sky
You gotta kepp on groovin', yeah
Good groovin'
'Cause you got your God and so do I
We gotta keep on lovin'
Good, good, good lovin'
Make love on my dyin' bed
We gotta stop smokin', stop, stop
I mean cigarette smokin'
Or else I cough myself to death
And to make love to you, baby
I wouldn't even have the breath
We gotta keep movin'
Keep on groovin'
Understand both sides of the sky
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
You got your God and so do I

[Verse 1]
When you asked how I've been here without you
I like to say "I've been fine" and I do
But we both know the truth is hard to come by
And if I told the truth, that's not quite true

[Chorus]
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes the cold winds blows a chill in my bones
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone

[Verse 2]
Now the face that I see in my mirror
More and more is a stranger to me
More and more I can see there's a danger
In becoming what I never thought I'd be

[Chorus]
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes the cold winds blows a chill in my bones
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
Sometimes the cold winds blows a chill in my bones
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone

[Fading Outro]
Some days are diamonds, some days are stone
Sometimes the hard times won't leave me alone
I was born on a side road far from here
While the town was burning out my dark window
I was crowned with a cage of cold barbed wire
And my bottle I keep with me even till now

Curse my pain, curse the sunrise every dawn
Those sidewalks ran me ragged, those cracks my only guide
Long for midnight, long for darkness sweet release
Beg the alleys for your endless time to cease

Screaming blackbird on my shoulders
Mark my nearness to his youth
Left my senses reeling as he cried, "I understand you"
(Sweet release, sweet release)

Try the handle, try the doorway, try the path
Try to enter, to enter and to find some solace there, there
In this clearing, you'll find nothing but a song
Give it breath, give it sunshine and with you it will belong, belong

It will whisper, it will stir a gentle breeze, its hands are your hands
They will take you where you please, if you please
Will you choose to be gentle? It's just your life whatever you feel
Are we blind for a reason or is it just to make it real, real?
(Sweet release, sweet release)
Show me do, give me seashells for my ears
Tell your neighbors and forgive them for their fears
(Sweet release, sweet release, sweet release)
You think you're so way out
And you got all the action
Still you can't find no satisfaction
Baby - try me, and I'll make you see

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
Ah ah, at all

You like to kiss and run
And that's where it is
'Cause somebody told you
Love was heartaches and tears
Baby, although you're free
I'll make you see

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Oh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
You ain't livin' at all
To be in love, I know it's not your ambition
But before you go, think about my proposition
You may conquer the world and be king on a throne
But you still ain't nobody, baby
When you're sittin' all alone

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all

[Verse 1]
When shadows fall and stars appear
A pain I feel I cannot bear
If I could relive that faithful day
I would not turn my love away

[Chorus]
I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her
I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her

[Verse 2]
When I think of her tender lips
Gentle touch of her fingertips
Reminisce on her eyes so fair
Moonlight soft on her downy hair

[Chorus]
I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her
I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her

[Verse 3]
If some day I should see her smile
Hold her hand and me heart beguile
Feel her warmth in her earnest prayer
Darling, shield me from all despair

[Chorus]
I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her
I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her

[Verse 4]
Now I'm standing alone and sad
Thinkin' upon the joys I've had
Time makes fools of men they say
Take me back to that distant day

[Chorus]
I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her
I'd reveal how I do adore her
Hang my heart on my sleeve just for her
All my love throughout life assure her
If this moment I could amour her
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
The ring of fire, the ring of fire
To know you is to love you
But to know me is not that way, you see
'Cause you made me so happy
That my love for you grows endlessly

When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me

Baby, to know you is to love you
You smile when I see your face
'Cause there ain't no one on this earth
Baby, could ever, ever take your place

When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me

Oh to know you is to love you
Is to see you being free as the wind
'Cause the power of your loving
Is too strong to hold within
To know you is to love you
To see you blowing free in the breeze
The power of your loving
I never found a woman like you
That could be my lover
And my best friend

I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and can't you feel our love
Just growing, growing, growing
Growing, growing, growing

Hey, I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and can't you feel our love
Just growing, growing, growing
Growing, growing, doggone it, baby

I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and can't you feel our love
Just growing, growing, growing
Growing, growing, hey doggone it, baby

I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
And I think you love me, too
Mm baby, I know you
Now it is the time to say no to the war
Yes, we can stop it before it gets too far
The process is already engendered
Stop it before it does get too far
The ways to pressurise are numerous
Often at the threshold of your door
Can't you see the power is limitless
It can take us beyond any bounds
Hey
I need it too
Well, alright
You know you need it
It's good for you
We're gonna move

(Ooooooooh, merry Christmas Saint Nick)
(Christmas comes this time each year)
(Oooooooo-ooooooooh)

Well, way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick
(Oooooh, little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick
(Oooooh, little Saint Nick)

Just a little bobsled, we call it old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy-apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel

It's the little Saint Nick
(Oooooh, little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick
(Oooooh, little Saint Nick)
Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer
He don't miss no one

And haulin' through the snow at a frightenin' speed
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead
He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every pad with a little surprise

It's the little Saint Nick
(Oooooh, little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick
(Oooooh, little Saint Nick)

(Aaa-aaa-aaah)
(Ooooooooh, merry Christmas Saint Nick)
(Christmas comes this time each year)

Four strong winds that blow slowly
Seven seas that run high
All these things that don't change come what may
Now our good times are all gone
And I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

Guess I'll go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the Fall
Got some friends that I can go to workin' for
Still I wish you'd change your mind
If I asked you one more time
But we've been thru that a hundred times or more

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that don't change come what may
Now our good times are all gone
And I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are going good
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Nothing much for you to do
And the wind sure blows cold way out there

Four strong winds that blow slowly
Seven seas that run high
All these things that don't change come what may
Now our good times are all gone
And I'm bound for movin' on

I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
Yes, I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

Send on my jacky baby, call her terry bracelet baby
Bart one was spent 'bout 20 G, Gucci drop three eighty baby
Multicolor carrot tee, my necklaces are heavy mane
Hit the club then leave the club then come back with another chain

Mighty mouse is icy dog, Bart shit is just stupid
Yellow, blue, black, green and white, the diamonds match the groupies
Digitally enhance stones, pink is like a movie
Truly I'm a walkin' lick, Gucci man the talkin' brick

If you ain't gonna talk to chickens dog who you talkin' to?
7:30 in the kitchen, Nate, Nate about to go to school
Saturday I'm cookin' chickens, momma about to go to work
Sunday Gucci cookin' chickens, granny about to go to church
See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

Heavy wrist activity got me livin' lovely
Cocka nina, heaven land, cocka nina shawty
Breakin' down ten chickens, dog about to cook the shake up
All these extra grams might as well go buy a Jacob

Gucci man for mayor, Gucci man so player
Repin' East Atlanta, that's ten minutes from Decatur
Almost match are cars and are belts going to match are gators
You can't swang like Gucci 'cause you don't got enough flavor

Heavy on the lickerish, industry ridiculous
Bitches I'm magnificent, I'm not very articulate

Gucci what's the penalty, shawty what's the business
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas
Gucci what's the penalty, shawty what's the business
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas
See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

My girlfriend say she love me but it's just the jewelry
Multicolor carrots got your girlfriend kinda curious
First I drop my verses and then I go and drop the chorus
Then I'm out the booth back to my trap, you know I'm mournin'

'74 restored it, Beethoven recorded
Say you charging 30 like that Gucci can't afford it
Gucci chargin' 40 dog, that's a couple birdies
Gucci stoopid jewelry dog, I don't think you herd me

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

[Verse 1]
You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill

[Verse 2]
You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing seems to matter
Here's my heart on a silver platter

[Chorus]
Oh where is my will
Why this strange desire
Flaming higher and higher
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still
You're my thrill

[Chorus]
Oh where's my will
Why this strange desire
Flaming higher and higher
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still
Oh you're my thrill

[Spoken: Charles]
I never had it too, too hard, uh, y'know. All my life, uh y'know, just everything I touched turned, turned to gold. I'm not, I'm not rich but, y'know, I've always had a few, some dollars in my pockets. 
There's... A sickness in the land so heaven... (heal it)
There's a sickness in the land so heaven... (heal it)

Woah there's a sickness in the land, so we're reaching up our hands...
Heaven we need, you to, heal it

Planet Earth, heaven we need you to... Heal it
Got to have you back I need you
A jealous lie hurt my foolish pride
Made me break your heart
Now our love has died
I see a closing door - a door never more
A door of jealousy between your love and me
Now I face a storm of tears
You took the sunshine from my face
Now I'm just another man
Who walks the undestined way
Without your guiding hand
I can hardly tell when I'm the man
Pride made a fool of me
Now I'm drowning in misery - misery is drowning me

And I've got to have you back I need you
Between the night and day oh heaven speed you
Cos I need you girl
I've been told - it's a loneliness
Oh dark is the emptiness
Since you've been gone in me
Oh gone is the lover I need
Pride destroyed the love we knew
But not my need for you
Without your love around
My whole world is falling down - falling down - all around
And I've got to have you back
Got to have you back
Got to have you back
Got to have you back
Got to have you back

I see a closing door...

Got to have you back - I'm drowning in misery
Got to have you back - my pride made a fool of me
Got to have you back - my whole world is falling down
Got to have you back - without your sweet love around

Got to have you back
There's a man on tv claims he killed 23
Burnt their bodies and collected their teeth
There's another man at home with his wife and family tree
Who agreed this would make a good movie?
And I'm sittin' here, wonderin' what this is all doin' to me

He sold the book rights, and he was set for life
A woman on a talk show wants to be his wife
Another man decides to purchase his knife
A court decides he's got the right
And I'm sittin' here, wonderin' how he can ever sleep at night

I don't want to walk where he walked
I don't want to talk to who he stalked
I don't want to walk where he walked

First it was a book, and then it was a movie
They cut it all up and they put it on the tv
The starring role was played by Christopher Reeves
He was fine, he was something to see
And I'm sitting here, wondering what this is all doing to me
I don't want to walk where he walked
I don't want to talk to who he stalked
I don't want to walk where he walked
Oh Lord I didn't catch how he got caught

[Verse 1]
My time, my patience, my love
My blood, my sweat, my tears
My burdens, my drama, my pain
My car, my money, my home
My ups, my downs, my fears
And my hours, my work, my strength
My fault, my this, my that
Nigga please

[Chorus]
If you don't stop
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna lay in your bed
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna eat your food
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna wear your clothes
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna fit your shoes
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna get your keys
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna open your doors
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna get your check
(This is a warning)
This is a woman's threat
Baby, this is a woman's threat, ummm yeah

[Verse 2]
My shaking, my sleep, my stress
My days, my nights, my rest
My do's, my don'ts, my dares
And my church, my pastor, my prayers
My all, my faith, my vows
And my kitchen, my sink, my towels
My joy, my sad, my hate
And my sister, my cousin, my friends
My lights, my gas, my bills
My role, my way, my will
My holla, my fussing, my fights
Nigga please

[Chorus]
If you don't stop
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna lay in your bed
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna eat your food
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna wear your clothes

(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna open your doors
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna get your check
(This is a warning)
This is a woman's threat, baby
(This is a warning)

[Verse 3]
My future, my hopes, my dreams
My panties, my socks, my things
My flowers, my dress, my ring
My man, my lover, my king
My live, my chance, my fault
And my guts, my courage, my wounds
My fence, my neighbors, my yard
My chains, my lock, my guards
My win, my lose, my gain
And my credit, my card, my name
Myself, my freedom, my roof
Nigga please

[Chorus]
If you don't stop
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna lay in your bed
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna eat your food
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna wear your clothes
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna fit your shoes
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna get your keys
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna open your doors
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna get your check
(This is a warning)
This is a woman's threat
Baby, this is a woman's threat

[Bridge]
Listen
(Whoa, whoa...)
Have you ever heard the story
About the three little bears
See they papa was gone
For a long, long, long, long time
When he returned
To his sweet little home
He had come to find
That all of his porridge was gone

[Chorus]
If you don't stop
(This is a warning)
Someone's gonna lay in your bed
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna eat your food
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna wear your clothes

(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna eat your food
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna wear your clothes
(This is a warning)
And someone's gonna fit your shoes
The times of loneliness, heartbreak
Despair and sadness
I've always found that a good song of inspiration
Lift me up, make me feel just a little bit better

Who at my door is standing
Patiently drawing near?
Entrance within demanding
Whose is the voice I hear?

Sweetly the tones are falling
Open the door for me
If thou wilt heed my calling
I will abide with thee

Who at my door is standing
Patiently drawing near?
Entrance within demanding
Whose is the voice I hear?

Sweetly the tones are falling
Open the door for me
If thou wilt heed my calling
I will abide with thee

[Verse 1]
I took advantage of you
A stepping stone to my pedestal
When you had enough of it
I said 'Fine, good luck replacing this'
Cause I seem strong and independent
Self sufficient, confident
And I'm like Mercury rising to the top so selfishly

[Chorus]
The better half of me was you
I'm like a hive without a bee without you
I gotta find you, gotta remind you
That two is better than one

[Verse 2]
So please accept my apology
Cause I'm feeling like a branch without its tree
It took me a fall to really see
That you're the catch I want to keep
Cause I get weak thinking about you
Living without you life has no value
Baby, come back to me
Cause you're the only missing piece

[Chorus]
Cause the better half of me was you
I'm like a hive without its bee without you
I gotta find you, gotta remind you
That two is better than one

[Bridge]
Ooh, it took a little earthquake
To appreciate the stability you've given me so consistently
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
The better half of me was you
I'm like a bird without its wings, without you
I gotta find ya, gotta remind you
That two is stronger than one
The better half of me, oh it's you
I'm like a heart without its beat without you
I've gottafind ya, gotta remind you
I promise you that I'm going to try to
I'm gonna love you because two is better than one
Baby's back all dressed in black. Silver buttons all down her back
High ho tip the toes, she broke the needle now she can't sew
Walking the dog, I'm just a walking the dog
If you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk that dog
Mary, Mary, quite contrary, how does your garden grow
With silver bells and cockle shells and pretty maids all in a row
I asked my mother for fifteen cents, I see her ever I jump the fence
I jumped the sky I touched the sky, never come down 'till the fourth of July
Frank Sinatra
Miscellaneous
I Wish I Didn't Love You So
I wish I didn't love you so, my love for you should have faded long ago
I wish I didn't need your kiss, why must your kiss torture me as long as this
I might be smiling by now with some new tender friend
Smiling by now with my heart on the mend
But when I try, something in my heart says no
You're still there, I wish I didn't love you so
Oooooooo
Merry Christmas Saint Nick

It's the little Saint Nick

Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year

Ahaaaaaaaaaa
Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year

Ahaaaaaaaaaa
Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year
Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
He kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny and his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak

And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig?

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He ain't got no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
And to fool the people is his only thought
Though he slippery, he still gets caught

But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

And all the monkeys aren't in a zoo
Every day you meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swinging on a star

[Verse 1]
From the very start, it
Came apart, it
Broke up into pieces and
There was a chance I could've missed it
It could risked it
But I put myself into your hands

[Chorus]
'Cause you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun
Oh, you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun

[Verse 2]
I should've run my courses
For the opposing forces
And all men are just mortals, and
If you want me, you can have me
Take me, oh baby, grab me
'Cause if you want me, then you can have me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun
Oh, you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun

[Bridge]
Oh now boy, what you been and done
You set a course that you couldn't run
Oh now boy, what you been and done

[Verse 3]
I had it all and I risked it
A chance and I missed it
I had it and I risked it all
And I risked it all

[Outro]
I risked it all
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
I had it all and I risked it all
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
I had it all and I risked it all
About this planet, there is something I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow

Here, above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution
If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution
And that's a heart felt shame
'Cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?

Time now to take you to a different place
Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space
A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at them with a gun
They have a lot of love for every living creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you
Back to the land of the policeman
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new
Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke-ridden prisons and sex-sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the American tradition
Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?
Waterfall
Nothing can harm me at all
My worries seem so very small
With my waterfall
I can see
My rainbow calling me
Through the misty breeze
Of my waterfall
Some people say
Daydreaming's for all the
Lazy minded fools
With nothin' else to do
So let them laugh, laugh at me
So just as long as I have you
To see me through
I've got nothing to lose
Long as I have you
Waterfall
Don't ever change your ways
Fall with me for a million days
Oh, my waterfall

[Intro]
Aw!

[Chorus 1]
Police helicopter sharking through the sky
Police helicopter landin' on my eye
Yeah!

[Chorus 2]
Police helicopter takes a nosedive
Police helicopter, no, he ain't shy
Yeah!

[Chorus 1]
Police helicopter sharking through the sky
Police helicopter landin' on my eye
Yeah!

[Bridge]
Police helicopter don't take nosedive
Police helicopter, no, he ain't shy

[Outro]
Aaw!
I saw a Berkley woman
Sittin' in her rockin' chair
A dulcimer in her lap
A feather in her hair
Her breasts swayed freely
With the rhythm of the rockin' chair
She was a-sittin' and a-singin' and a-swayin'
Her cheeks were red I declare

Twas hard to believe
What my eyes showed me then
The colour in her cheeks
Was just her natural skin
She wore no makeup
To make her look that way
She was a natural mama with the red cheeks
What more can I say

Well I finally realised
There was hunger in my stare
In my mind I was swayin'
With the woman in the rockin' chair
But the lady I was livin' with
Was standin' right by my side
She saw my stare and she saw my hunger
And Lord it made her cry
So with anger on her face
Yes and the hurt in her eyes
She scratched me and she clawed me
She screamed and she cried
"Oh you don't give me near
All the lovin' that you should
Yet you're ready to go and lay with her
You're just no damn good?
Well I guess she's probably right
Oh I guess I'm probably wrong
I guess she's not too far away
She hasn't been gone very long
And I guess we could get together
And try it one more time
But I know that wanderlust would come again
She'd only wind up a-cryin'

Well now you've heard my story
Plain as the light of day
It's hard to feel guilty for lovin' the ladies
That's all I gotta say
'Cept a woman is the sweetest fruit
That God ever put on the vine
I'd no more love just one kinda woman
Than drink only one kinda wine
I'm not that someone who's got what you want
I can do nothing but watch what you do
You just want someone to kiss you good night
But lips are never enough to get you through

You stole my nights and you got your way
And now you got me dying inside, oh baby

Ebony, don't walk out on me, listen to what I say
Pick up the pieces of my life into the night of day
How do you break this heart of steel, nobody ever could
Open the pages of my life, I'm only flesh and blood

I'll be your savior but baby I swear
I'm not living my life over you
Some satisfaction you get if you dare
But is it ever enough to get you through?

You stole my mind and you watch me fall
Now you leave the scene of the crime, oh no
Ebony, don't walk out on me, I never thought you could
I'm only what you make of me, I'm only flesh and blood
I'm only flesh and blood

When you're gone, you'll leave me behind

[Incomprehensible] with nothing to hide
Oh, lost in the night in a town without pity
You learn how to cry, you learn how to cry

Ebony, don't walk out on me, listen to what I say
Pick up the pieces of my life into the night of day
How do you break this heart of steel, nobody ever could
Open the pages of my life, I'm only flesh and blood

Gone are the days that came and went
Houses are made of wood
Live in a world of sand and stone
I'm only flesh and blood

Ebony, don't walk out on me, I never thought you could
I'm only what you make of me, I'm only flesh and blood
Oh yeah, all right
I do believe in you more than myself
I can depend on you when I need help
So when I tell you, please understand
That I do love you, love you man to man

Oh yeah, all right
I remember oh so well when the times were bad
If I needed anything, you'd give me all you had
And when the troubles came you were by my side
You said use God as your guide my son don't you know
He's alive, he's alive

Oh yeah
But now you have gone and I'm on my own
But I realize one thing, one man is never alone
But I wish that you were here right by my side
I would love to tell you that I know
He's alive
Oh yeah, all right

[Intro]
Ooh-whoa, oh
You give me fever
Fever, oh
Oh, you give me fever

[Chorus]
Fever in the morning
Fever when it's late at night
You give me fever (fever)
Fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
You give me fever (fever)
Fever in the evening
Fever all through the night
You give me fever, yeah (fever)
Fever when you're with me
Fever when you love me right

He's so sweet
He's so good to me
He's so intelligent
He's so confident

My baby's so damn sexy (uh-huh)
My baby put the fever on me (uh-huh)
My baby knows just what to do (uh-huh)
You got me boilin' past 102 (uh-huh)
You give me a fever

[Verse 2]
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever (fever)

[Chorus]
When you kiss me
And fever when you hold me tight
You give me fever (fever)
In the morning
And fever all through the night

[Refrain]
My baby's so damn sexy (uh-huh)
My baby put the fever on me (uh-huh)
My baby knows just what to do (uh-huh)
You got me boilin' past 102 (uh-huh)
You give me a fever

[Verse 2]
Everybody's got a fever
That is somethin' you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet
And Juliet felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said - Julie baby, you're my flame
Thou give me fever
When we kisseth
A fever with the flaming youth, yeah
Fever, I'm on fire
Fever yeah, I burn forsooth

[Verse 3]
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said - Daddy, oh don't you dare
He gives me fever
With his kisses
A fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Mrs
And Daddy, won't you treat him right?"

[Verse 4]
Now that you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give ya fever
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade
They give ya fever
When ya kiss 'em
And ever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
Fever till ya sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

[Outro]
Fever
I got a fine looking woman
I call her "that gal of mine"
Yes, she's a fine looking woman
I call her "that gal of mine"
Yes, the reason I love her
Because she's dressed so fine

Well, she's a fine looking woman
And she lives across the town
Well, she's a fine looking woman
And she lives across the town
Yeah, my baby's trying to leave me
She's trying to put me down

Hey, it's bye bye baby
Bye bye and fare you well
Hey, it's bye bye baby
Bye bye and fare you well
Well, what I'm gonna do now
Baby, it's hard to tell
Yeah, it's bye bye
Bye bye baby bye
Well, bye bye baby
Bye bye bye baby bye bye
Yes, since you're gonna leave me
I have no need to cry
Frank: I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own
Dinah: Darling this place is a lover's oasis where lights where we chase is unknown
Frank: Far from the cry of the city where flowers pretty caress the stream
Both: Cozy to hide in, to live side by side in, don't let it abide in my dream

Frank: Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two, and two for tea
Just me for you, and you for me alone
Dinah: Nobody near us, to see and to hear us, no friends or relations
On weekend vacations, we won't have it known, dear, that we own a telephone, dear
Frank: They will brake (?) and you'll awake, and start to bake a sugar cake
For me to take for all the boys to see
Both: We will raise a family, a boy for you and a girl for me
Can't you see how happy we will be
Call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
Well, now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load

Ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
Well, there ain't no change in the weather
Ain't no changes in me
And I ain't hidin' from nobody
Nobody's hidin' from me
Oh, and that's the way it's supposed to be

Well, I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin' on
Well, I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin' on
Well, I might go out to California
Might go down to Georgia, I don't know
Well, I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
Well, now I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
But I don't love me no one woman
So, I can't stay in Georgia long

Well, now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
Well, now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin' down the road
I ain't got me nobody
I don't carry me no load
Ooh Mr. Breeze

[Chorus]
Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same to my brain
And I'm high, so high
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
Just need to find me a style of my own
And I'm high, so high

[Verse 1]
Some people can't understand
Just bein' inside a church don't make a righteous man
You're high, so high
In time we all die, all music gone
So we better try our best to get along
And get high, so high, oh

[Verse 2]
Ain't got no theory, ain't got no rules
I just let the purple music tell my body what to do
And I'm high, so high
Every subject, any key
Purple music can't be judged, it happens naturally
It's alright, alright, oh
We'll find a serpent to sacrifice
We'll make a wish and then we'll visit purple paradise
We'll get high, yes we will, so high

[Chorus]
Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same to my brain
And I'm high, so high
Next page

[Verse 3]
Don't want reaction, I just want the act
It's easier to give love than it is to give it back
'Cause I'm high, so high

Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same to my brain
And I'm high, oh
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
Just need to find me a style of my own
And I'm high, oh oh oh

I'd love some
I'm high, so high

Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same to my brain
And I'm high, so high
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
Just need to find me a style of my own
And I'm high, so high

[Breakdown]
We'll find a sacrifice
To get some purple paradise
So nice, purple paradise is so nice
Yeah

Baby, baby, I say, I say, I say
Oh, oh, oh yeah, oh yeah

If you understand my color
Put your hand in your crotch

No, no, no, no, no, yes!

[Chorus]
Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same to my brain
And I'm high, so high
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
Just need to find me a style of my own
And I'm high, so high
Some people can't understand
Just bein' inside a church don't make a righteous man
And you're high

You got to be high

In time we all die, all music gone
So we better try to get along
And get high, so high

All get high

I ain't got no theory, I ain't got no rules
I just let the purple music tell my body what to do
And I'm high, so high

Every subject, any key
Purple music can't be judged, it happens naturally
Ain't it alright?

Ain't it alright?
Don't try to fight it

It's time for your morning bath, sir
What would you like to bathe in this morning?
With all due respect sir, I think that...
I think that it might...
Oh, oh no
I don't want to play anymore
I don't want to play anymore

Purple music does things to my brain and I'm high
Step on it
That's right
Drive, you idiot
Faster, faster!

Don't need no reefer, don't need cocaine
Purple music does the same to my brain
And I'm high, so high
Don't need no cymbals, no saxophone
Just need to find me a style of my own
And I'm high, so high

Some people can't understand
Just bein' inside a church don't make a righteous man
And you're high, yeah

[Verse 1]
Here he comes, baby
Here comes your lover man
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
I'll sneak out your window, babe
I really gotta go as fast as I can
Reach down, baby
And get on my running shoes
Reach down, baby
And get on my running shoes
See your man coming
Babe, I've got no time to lose

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I wanna love you longer, baby
I wanna love you stronger, stronger
But I wanna love you all night longer
But that's your man, way over yonder now

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh ohh

[Verse 1: Nathan]
I don't understand your thinking
Thought we were happy, guess I was mistaken
Gave you all my love and my attention
(Say you dont want me) 'cause something is missing
Gave you all you wanted and you know it's true
All that I was doin' it meant nothing to you
And if I dogged you out, we'd probably be cool
But I was good to you, so good

[Pre-Chorus]
First you want a guy that's real nice
That'll spend all his dough and his time
But then you change your mind and want a thug guy
That won't act right
It doesn't pay to be the good guy
You callin' me late nights
Tellin' me how he won't act right
Stayin' with him but he makes you cry
Tell me why
Doesn't pay to be the good guy

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I try to be the good guy
You take me for granted, throw me to the side
Rather have a man that'll tell you lies
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Why should I be the good guy
And get left for the man that don't treat you right?
There's nothing good in being good guys
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

[Verse 2: Shawn]
I don't understand your reason
Sayin' you love me, then sayin' you're leavin'
The situation here is really changin'
Don't wanna fall in love 'cause you played me (oh)
You've gotta be kiddin' me (no)
Been tryin' to get rid of me
I did more for you than any brother would do
I was good to you, so good

[Pre-Chorus]
First you want a guy that's real nice
That'll spend all his dough and his time
But then you change your mind and want a thug guy
That won't act right
It doesn't pay to be the good guy
You callin' me late nights
Tellin' me how he won't act right
Stayin' with him but he makes you cry
Tell me why
Doesn't pay to be the good guy

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I try to be the good guy
You take me for granted, throw me to the side
Rather have a man that'll tell you lies
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Why should I be the good guy
And get left for the man that don't treat you right?
There's nothing good in being good guys
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

[Bridge: Wanya]
I was good to you (I played the fool)
Played the fool for you
You messed it up for the next girl in my life
I'll never do
The things I do for you
Our love just wasn't true
I was good to you, so good to you
So good to you
Every time I try...

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I try to be the good guy
You take me for granted, throw me to the side
Rather have a man that'll tell you lies
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Why should I be the good guy
And get left for the man that don't treat you right?
There's nothing good in being good guys
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
'Cause every time I try to be the good guy
You take me for granted, throw me to the side
Rather have a man that'll tell you lies
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Why should I be the good guy
And get left for the man that don't treat you right?
There's nothing good in being good guys
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
'Cause every time I try to be the good guy
You take me for granted, throw me to the side
Rather have a man that'll tell you lies
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Why should I be the good guy
And get left for the man that don't treat you right?
There's nothing good in being good guys
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
'Cause every time I try to be the good guy
You take me for granted, throw me to the side
Rather have a man that'll tell you lies
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Why should I be the good guy
And get left for the man that don't treat you right?
There's nothing good in being good guys
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
I've grown accustomed to her face
She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune
She whistles night an' noon

Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in

I was serenely independent
And content, before we met
Surely I could always be that way again, and yet
I've grown accustomed to her looks
Accustomed to her voice
Accustomed to her face!

[Intro]
Get up and jump, get up and jump, get up, get up, get up and jump
Jump on up
Jump on down
Just jump a jump a jump a jump a jump around
Jump the day away
Jump all over town
Because jumping is okay in a jumping kinda way, hey hey

[Verse 1]
Jump a boy
Jump a girl
Jump a rope
Jump for joy
Just don't stop jumping
Keep your heart muscle pumping
Hillel be jumping on that little baby Frumpkin
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants
When you're just standing or sitting still
Think about the frogs getting a thrill
Take a little lesson from the kangaroos
Don't you know they're jumping foos, jump you
Jump a nun
Jump a Jack
Jump for fun
Jump back
How's about us jumping in the sack?
And now, it's time for a jump attack

[Chorus 1]
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump
Get up and jump

[Chorus 2]
Jam Bob, Jim Bob, Slim Bob Boogie
To the tune of slima Billy
Looking like you're mighty silly
Say what, you got a pumpkin in your pants
Jam Bob, Jim Bob, Slim Bob Boogie
To the tune of slima Billy
Looking like you're mighty silly
Say what, you got a pumpkin in your pants

[Verse 2]
Mister Mexican jumping bean knows
His fun is squeaky clean
Christ, how'd you think that he got so clean
Not from sitting on his goddamn spleen. Get up
Oh, I be jumping I be jumping I be jumping alone
I be jumping for the phone
I be jumping Misses Jones
I really want to jump on Kinski's bones

[Chorus 1]
Get up and jump
Get up and jump

To the tune of slima Billy
Looking like you're mighty silly
Say what, you got a pumpkin in your pants
Jam Bob, Jim Bob, Slim Bob Boogie
To the tune of slima Billy
Looking like you're mighty silly
Say what, you got a pumpkin in your pants
Oh, breaking up is very hard, so very hard, so hard to do
So make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do

If you really love him, and there's nothing I can do
Don't try to spare my feelings, just tell me that we're through

And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do

And if the way I hold you, can't compare to his caress
No words of consolation, will make me miss you less
My darling, if this is goodbye, I just know I'm gonna cry
So, run to him before you start crying too

And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do
Breaking up is very hard, so very hard, so hard to do
Breaking up is very hard, so very hard, so hard to do
Breaking up is very hard, so very hard, so hard to do
Breaking up is very hard, hard to do

Breaking up is so very hard, so hard to do, not easy
Breaking up is so hard to do
Breaking up, breaking up is very hard, so
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisoner of love

For one command, I stand and wait now
From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape, 'cause it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love

What's the good of my caring
If someone is sharing
Those arms with me?
Although she has another
I can't have another
'Cause I'm not free

She's in my dreams, awake or sleeping
Upon my knees, to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring
If someone is sharing
Those arms with me?
Although she has another
I can't have another
'Cause I'm not free

She's in my dreams, awake or sleeping
Upon my knees, to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love
Just a prisoner of love
Don't take what she says into you
Don't blame and distract me, it's too deep inside
Weird kid, color it white. Clear mask, light black-it will not hide
I like this, never that
I like this, never sad
Being overlooked, being slept on
Being started but I just keep going
Being up, being down
Payed dues, earned stripes
Been in lawsuits, welcome to my life

I'm too Latin for hip hop
And too hip hop for Latin
So you all figure it out I'ma keep rappin'
But that's okay
'Cause I'ma be on the top one day

Con pasiensia y vaselina
El elefante se la metio a la ormiga
And that's the slogan I live by
Me, I just hang in the hood
Y'all just drive by
Lights out, lights out like a drive by

My life is real
I ain't got nothing to lie about
You can ask anyone that's with me
How this lil' chico right here
Took over the city
Luke, trick they were the start
But that lil' chico Pitbull, he was the spot
Now this nigga's picking up rappers
Like they know what's up

Two at a time, nigga
Who would have thought
The bottom on top
Today's lil rappers not to take it to heart

If you can't finish don't start
Hey, if you can't finish don't start
Hey, if you can't finish don't start, rah

[John Legend]
If this world were mine, I would place at your feet
All that I own, you've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
And you'd be always beside me, be all that I need
If this world were mine, I'd give you anything

[Imani Uzuri]
If this world were mine, I would make you a king
With wealth untold you could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give you each so sunny and blue
And if you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

[John Legend]
Oh baby, you're my inspiration
And there's no hesitation
When you want me, all you gotta do is call me

[Imani Uzuri]
Oh baby, you are my constellation
And I feel so much sensation
When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me

[John Legend]
The way that you do

[Imani]
Ooh, the way that you love me more

[John]
The way that you do

If you believe...
I was sittin' on a stump down in New Orleans
I was feelin' kinda low down, dirty an' mean
Along come a fella and he didn't even ask
He said, "I know of a woman who can fix you up fast."

Well I didn't think twice, I just said like I should
"Let's go find this lady who can do me some good."
We walked across Rampart on a sailin' spree
And we come to a door called one-oh-three

I's just about ready to give my little knock
When out comes a fella who couldn't even walk
He's linkin' and a-slinkin', couldn't stand on his feet
And he moaned and he groaned and he shuffled down the street

Well, out of the door there comes another man
He couldn't even talk and he couldn't even stand
He moaned and he groaned and he shuffled his feet
And he slid slidin' backwards down on Rampart street

Well, I peeked thru the key hole and comin' down the hall
Was a long legged man who could hardly crawl
He had a terrible mean look in his eye
Like he'd just fall to burn, he's was ready to die
Well somebody else with his hell of a miss
Fell out of the window and he fell the test
Well he slid and he slunk in broken french
And he looked like he'd been thru a monkey wrench

Well, by this time I was a-scared to knock
I was a-scared to move, I's in a state of shock
I hummed a little tune and I shuffled my feet
And I started walkin' backwards down Rampart street

Well, I got to the corner I tried my best smile
I turned around the corner and I ran a bloody mile
Man, I wasn't around for to meet my wife
I's just a-runnin' for to save my life

Well, I's coughin' in my ears and wheezin' in my chest
I musta run a mile in a minute or less
I tripped on a log and I flumped on a stump
I caught a fast freight train with a one-arm jump

So if you're travellin' down Louisiana way
And you're feelin' kinda lonesome and you need a place to stay
Man, you're better off in your misery
Than to tackle that lady in one-oh-three
Oh yeah, listen
I used to say I'll never let a woman break my heart, no na na
And I used to say I'll let no girl leave me scars
I was so, so proud
Cause in the mist of us breaking up
Uh baby I talk like, I was so, so tough
Now I can run up all day, call you out your name, girl
But at the end of the day, I'm just a fool for you baby
Oh yeah, girl
I'm just a fool for you baby
Alright now baby, yeah
And I don't mind

I used to tell my friends no girl could ever break me down
Oh no, no, ah
No girl is sweet enough to ever turn my world around
And you changed my mind
Cause every time I walk out of the door
Uh baby, I yell out, I ain't coming back no more
Now I can run up all day, call you out your name, girl
But at the end of the day, I'm just a fool for you baby
Oh yeah, girl
I'm just a fool for you baby
Alright now baby, yeah
And I don't mind, I don't mind
And I don't care what my friends have to say
Baby... feeling this way, oh no
Whatever the cost, I'm willing to pay
Cause I can't see me walking away
I'm your baby, girl
Oh, yeah, whoa, no, na na, baby
Na na baby

I'm just a fool for you baby
Oh yeah, girl
I'm just a fool for you baby
Alright now baby, yeah
And I don't mind, cause your loving's just hat good baby
Uh, my friends say I'm crazy
But I'm crazy about you baby
Yes I am, I guess it's my honey
That's why your love keeps me running, for you baby
I'm a fool, for you baby
I'm a fool, yeah, for you baby
For my baby, baby, baby
Day after day alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Well on his way his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill...
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill...
She's just been to russia and they're dying their faces
They're dying over there

A pretty pink rose

That r'n'r lady takes a space-ship ride she's out of this world

A pretty pink rose

And we're living for you my love, we're living for you
And we're dying for you my love
Pretty pink rose

She tore down paris on the tall of thom paine
But the left wings broken the right insane

A pretty pink rose

Have a nice day, it's a killer, turn a cheek
It's a christian code
A pretty pink rose

And we're living for you my love, we're living for you
And we're dying for you my love

Pretty pink rose

She's the poor mans gold she's the anarchist crucible
Flying in the face of the despot cannible

She's a pretty pink rose

Never let it rain, never let it rain on the heart of the pretty pink rose

Pretty pink rose

And we're living for you my love, we're living for you
And we're dying for you my love, pretty pink rose

Get me thru the pain, thru the pain of the thorn on the pretty pink rose

Never let it rain, never rain never rain, the pretty pink rose

Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart, of the pretty pink rose

Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart
Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart, of the pretty pink rose

Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart

Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart,, of the pretty pink rose

Take me to the heart, to the heart, to the heart

[Verse 2]
Pulse's racing, darling
How grand we are
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark

[Hook]
It oughta be illegal
Make it a crime to be out in the cold
It oughta be illegal
You got a reason for living
You battle on with the love you're living on
You gotta be mine
We take it away
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time

[Hook]
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love, will climb and mountain
Near or far, we are
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love, is one in a million
Eyes can see, that we
Got a highway to the sky
Don't want to hear goodbye
Don't want to hear goodbye
I don't want to hear your

[Hook]
And we got and we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love, will climb and mountain
Near or far, we are
And we never let it end
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see, that we
Got a highway to the sky
Don't want to hear,  goodbye
Don't want to hear,  goodbye
I don't want to hear your

And we got nothing
(Oh Oh Oh)
She don't press me
Not like she used to
Everything that she don't do
That's what I want, what I need

Sinking rapidly
And that's when you sail through
Let me sail away with you
Everything that she won't do, you do for me

Say what you say (say)
Floating away (way)
Baby, I was drowning in my sorrow
Couldn't see tomorrow today
(Then you came)

Say what you say (say)
We're floating away (away way)
Now I see the solemn of horizons
Now I know that I'll be ok
Since you came yeah
12 am she leaves
She don't say where to
Won't see her again until 12 noon
And she don't smell like me

(Oh) suddenly I see
I see don't do what she used to
She's found someone who
Well, baby, needs you, so sorry

Say what you say (say)
Floating away (way)
Baby I was drowning in my sorrow
Couldn't see tomorrow today
(Then you came)

Say what you say
We're floating away
Now I see the solemn of horizons
Now I think that I'll be ok
(Since you came yeah)

Baby in all, we can just go
Can't stay, lets sail away
Open your eyes, say your goodbyes
We'll cruse into paradise
Say what you say (say)
Floating away (way)
Baby I was drowning in my sorrow
Couldn't see tomorrow today
(Then you came)

Say what you say
We're floating away (way) (way)
Now I see the solemn of horizons
Now I think that I'll be ok
(Since you came yeah)

Say what you say (say)
Floating away (way)
Baby I was drowning in my sorrow
Couldn't see tomorrow today
(Then you came)
Speaks:
How can you say something new about being alone
Tell somebody you're a loner?
Right away they think you're lonely
It's not the same thing, you know
It's not wanting to put all your marbles in one pocket
And that's caring enough not to care too much
Mostly, I guess it's letting yourself come first for a while

One day, I'm gonna find me an island, a think place
Go there with a mess of records and a ukalele
Just sit strumming, I might even do some thinking
About the women and the towns that I left behind
Ooh I'm so excited, I can't help it, I'm so fortunate to be here with you girl

And I promise that you are the only one for me out of every single woman in the world, yes you are

And it's so much joy in the things that you do, how you do, when you do those things you do to me

Let us lay down baby and imitate the lifestyles of the birds and bees, mmhm

Heaven must have sent your love to me
Cuz when I look at you heaven is all I see
Baby you bring me joy

Chorus

You bring me joy, night and day
Girl you and me should get away
I've got this special hideaway
Where you and me can be alone (lovin' ya body all night long)

You bring me joy, night and day
Girl you and me should get away
I've got this special hideaway
Where you and me can be alone
Ooh baby this love makin' is so good I just don't know what to do with myself, mm

And I'm sittin here thinkin' God cuz girl he could've place you with somebody else, uh

The way you walk, the way you dress, your smile, your grace, your sex
Girl, tonight nothing's gonna come between us but sweat

Heaven must have sent your love to me
Cuz when I look at you heaven is all I see
You bring me joy

Chorus

Baby now that I've got you here with me, I just wanna break it down
And tell you, what I wanna do, to you

Like a mountain, woo I'm gonna climb up all on top of you girl
Like a see-saw, I'm gonna be going up and down on you girl
And like a horsie, ooh I'm gonna saddle up and ride you girl
Like the river, ooh ooh ooh ooh hoh I can't wait to see us flowin'
As our bodies shivers, oooh

Heaven must have sent your love to me
Cuz when I look at you heaven is all I see

Chorus
You bring me joy, night and day
Girl you and me should get away
I've got this special hideaway
Where you and me can be alone
(I'll be strokin'it baby up and down turnin' yo body all around)
You bring me joy, night and day
Girl you and me should get away
I've got this special hideaway
Where you and me can be alone
(Wanna hear you say my name yeah)

You bring me joy, night and day
Girl you and me should get away
I've got this special hideaway
Where you and me can be alone
You bring me joy, night and day
Girl you and me should get away
I've got this special hideaway
Where you and me can be alone
Goodbye, no use leading with our chins, this is where our story ends
Never lovers ever friends
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day, but before you walk away
I sincerely want to say

I wish you bluebirds in the spring, to give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this, I wish you love
And in July a lemonade to cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health, and more than wealth, I wish you love
My breaking heart and I agree that you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best, I set you free
I wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you warm
But, most of all, when snowflakes fall, I wish you love
(musical interlude)
I wish you shelter from the storm, a cozy fire to keep you warm
Most of all, when snowflakes fall, hot damn, I wish you love
All kinds of love, a whole gang of love
I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And this stuborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door

I keep forgetting you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting bout those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things
That you said
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head
Keep forgetting you don't love me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more

Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe that our love is dead
Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my head

Keep forgetting you don't love me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more
Keep forgetting you don't want me no more

[Verse 1]
I had some problems
And no one could seem to solve them
But you found the answer
You told me to take a chance
And learn the way of love, my baby
And all that it had to offer
In time you will see that love won't let you down
Oh...

You said that you loved me
Said hurt only came to pass me
And it sounded so convincing
That I gave it half the chance
And learned the way of love, my baby
There is so much love inside me
And all that I have I'll give my all to you
Oh, all my lovin'

[Chorus]
And all this love is waiting for you (my baby, my sugar)
And all, all my love is waiting for you

[Verse 2]
I had some problems
And no one could seem to solve them
But you, you, you found the answer
You told me to take this chance
And learn the way of love, the ways of love, my baby
And all that it had to offer
And all that I have I give my all to you

[Chorus]
And all this love is waiting for you (my baby, my darling)
And baby, all, all this love is waiting for you

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
And all this love is waiting for you (my love is waiting now)
And all this love is waiting for you

[Outro]
As the sun has its place up in the sky
I love you, so dearly
All the same, there's no need to wonder why
I need you, please hear me

Say you really love me, baby
Say you really love me, darling
For I really love you, baby
You know I really love you, darling
Say you really love me, baby
Say you really love me, darling
Oh, for I really love you baby
Sure enough love you, darling

Say, say you love me
Oh, I love you
And baby, all, all my love is waiting for you, yeah
Raise up your hands
And put a smile on your face
I'm talking to everyone
In the human race
We're proud and strong
So stand up tall
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world

There's a train of love
Beginning right here
So jump on to it
And have no fear
It's yours, it's mine
We got the call
Let's all get together
And bring peace to the world

Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Every man and woman
Boy and girl
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Shelter the homeless
Open your door
Feed the hungry
Give to the poor
Offer your heart
Don't think small
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world

Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
Every man and woman
Boy and girl
Let's all get together
Bring peace to the world
If a womans hips are ample
Then I want her in the hay
Skirt and stocking all a rample
Cheerfully
For that's my way
If the woman bites in pleasure
Then I wipe it clean with hay
My mouth, her lap together
Thoroughly
For that's my way
If a woman goes on loving
When I feel too tired to play
I'd smile and go off waving, Amiably
For that's my way
I want you to fly
I want you to grow
I like you to get back
Whatever you lose

I want you to learn
What you wanna know
I like you to follow
The road that you choose

Ooh, at the same time

I wanna hold on
Don't want you to go
I like to be near you
Whatever you do

I want us to hide (ooh)
I want to lay low (ooh)
Doesn't make sense but (ooh)
I wanna be you (ooh)

I want us to hide
I want to lay low
It doesn't make sense but
I wanna be you

I want you to fly

So the cages open now
We take him fly to
Rising and falling like snow
In the nights

I'm feeling while a windy scene
Between my palms
I've got my hands and the bird
Flies out

Yes, I'm sittin' here thinkin'
Thinkin' about Miss Martha King
Well, I'm sitin' here thinkin'
Thinkin' about Miss Martha King

I'm in love with that woman
I ain't afraid to call her name

Lord, I did everythin' for you
Done everything I could
Everything that I did, you know
It didn't do me no good

Miss Martha King
Do you think you're doin' me right?
Know you go out everyday, darlin'
And you don't come home tonight

Done everything, babe
Everything I could
Everything I did, you know
It didn't do me now good
Miss Martha King
Do you think you're doin' me right?
Know you go out everyday, baby
And still you want to fight

[Spoken Intro]
From the motion picture Sandpiper comes a very beautiful ballad
Won the Academy Award in 1965
And I shall never forget...

[Verse 1]
The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light, light the dawn
Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things you are to me

[Verse 2]
Our wistful little star was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
So did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile

[Outro]
Our wistful little star was way, way too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
Darling, so, so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
Oh, I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile

Thank you
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change come what may
But our good times are all gone
And I'm bound for moving on
I look for you if I'm ever back this way

Think Ill go out to Alberta
Weathers good there in the fall
Got some friends I can go to working for
Still I wish you change your mind
If I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are going good
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Ain't too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there
Frank with (chorus)
(If the future proves sweet, would it tell us to leap before we move,)
(Would it care for us to live with danger or face the final foe,)
(If tomorrow brings us love, you can bet,)
(We will need all the help we can get.)
(And to tell me how this moves everyone of us to you.)
(How you're glad its winter, how you're glad to say it's true.)

When I see a young couple walking slowly through the trees
I don't have to follow them to know how far they'll go
I've been there
If the boy is sulking and the girl is close to tears
I know it doesn't matter, who is right or who started the fight
I've been there
I've been there when the music played old songs
Young songs, good songs, bad songs, sweet songs, sad songs
I've been there when a pretty smile made it difficult to breathe
But so easy to fly and a pleasure to cry
So to all of you in the throes of early love
Where delightful confusion reigns supreme
Let me try to help you rearrange your dream
Let yourself live, let yourself love, let yourself go
I've been there, and I know

[Skit]
DVD's, got dem bootleg Idlewild DVD's
What chu got? What chu got?
What's up Sean?
Come here man, come here, come here, come here, come here

Got them bootleg Idlewild DVD's
Got Girls Gone Idlewild
I got the uncut version of the Idlewild

The G version just in case
You don't want to see Three take his shirt off
I got the director's cut of Idlewild

I got that kush man, I got that 'dro
I got that purp', I got that light pink
Let me see your teeth
Boy I can make you a grill, right now

Gimme two, naw, your shit kinda buck
Give me about thirteen minutes
Dig what I'm sayin'?
Shit, I heard Big and Dre are
Supposed to be comin' up here right now anyway
Well shit man, let me drop on out of here man like a roller coaster baby
I'll get up witcha
Life in the city gets all closed in
When you stand in a crowd all alone
Wishing that someone would call out your number
Hoping that someone might phone

Nights in the city can drive you crazy
There's so very much going on
Try to get quiet, you'll miss out on something
Like someone who's looking for
Someone who's looking...

There, I almost got caught again
Lost in the night all alone
With nowhere to hide, crying inside
A wild heart looking for home

Sleeping without you is always cold
The nights are so dark and so long
Dreaming of touching your face in the moonlight
Filling the silence with song
Living without you the days are endless
The clock winding steadily down
Imagining footsteps, your hand at the gatepost
The wind shuts the open door
The wind shuts the open...
There, I almost got caught again
Lost in the night all alone
With nowhere to hide, crying inside
A wild heart looking for home

The songbird, she trembles all day long
She sings as if her poor heart must break
Watching the freedom that flies past her window
Dreaming won't fit in a cage

Fly away songbird, the wind she loves you
Your prison is forsaken at last
Follow your dreaming, you're bound up to heaven
You're reaching for something more
Reaching for something...

There, I almost got caught again
Lost in the night all alone
With nowhere to hide, crying inside
A wild heart looking for home
There, I thought of your face again
A vision to have and to hold
My spirit still sings, I'm flying again
A wild heart looking for home
A wild heart looking for home
It happened in Monterey
A long time ago
I met her in Monterey
In old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine

It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart
Longs for the sweetheart
That I left in old Monterey

It happened in Monterey
A long time ago
I met her in Monterey
In old Mexico
Stars, guitars
Lips red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I fear that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
And without thinking twice
I left her and I threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart
How it longs for that sweetheart
That I left in old Monterey

I'm walking down the middle of the road
Close my eyes pretend i'm going home
The trees surround my mind like your perfume...

Your voice is in the wind that blows
I see your name on stony ground
I look around and everything is you

Buh - duh - buh - duh - buh

Buh - duh - buh - duh - buh - duh

Wake up each morning rise up from my bed
A little piece of leather 'round my head
To stop the sweat from dripping on my eye...

Your grace is in the tree I see
Your strength is in the axe I wield
I look around and everything is you

Buh - duh - buh - duh - buh

The foreman is an evil man
(He stops my pay
Gets in my way
But I've got to stay)

I've got to earn some money
(make your dreams come true)
I look around and everything is you

Buh - duh - buh - duh - buh
Buh - duh - buh - duh - buh
Buh - duh - buh - duh - buh - duh
The nights are cold, your memories keep me warm
Just the thought of you can keep me working on
Showed your picture to the guys in my gang...

Whilst sitting 'round an open fire
My memories grow warm and strong
I look around and everything is you

Buh - duh - buh - duh - buh

Oh my darling tell me where I'm bound
(Yesterday was your day of rest)
Now I see too much racing around
(Yesterday you had to beat up your (miss))
I've been here too many times before
(I don't know, I would resist)
I've got to see the other side of your door
(I don't know, no, I've got a call for you)

Whoa-oh, can't you see I got a lot to learn
(I've got to know, no, no, now what's going on)
Oh I don't even have a torch to burn
(I've got to go, have I done you wrong)
Now I can't be found by the wailing wall
(You better stop girl, and take a look around)
Sometimes, you have got to be ten feet tall
(You better stop girl, and see what's going down)

(all together)
{Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday ...
{Summer, winter, spring and fall
{Tick, tick, tick, tick ...
Well I been in your neighbourhood for a long long time
(You say to me, now, that you know it all)
You breed confusion in that you forge my life
(You said to me that you would never fall)
Years go by while I'm standing in the cold
(Well you tell me girl, everything's all right)
Well it's all I get to sing, (and all men's soul)
(I find out now, well, late at night)

Well old man on the bus wants to (play ???)
(Yesterday was your day of rest)
As he takes my dime and tells me how to die
(Yesterday now, now, now)
Here's my life, my love, set it up to (???)
(I don't know if you what you say is true)
(???) to say we're gonna really move
(I don't know, I got to, got to talk to you)

(all together)
{Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday ...

Time goes by, just a little bit, now
You gotta wait, you gotta wait until the time goes by, now
It doesn't matter what you do now
It's gonna keep on going on by
Going by
Going by now
Going by
Going by
Going by
Going by
Well you better
You may find you gotta wait awhile
But you can't wait because the time is right now
If you going to lose it now, you're gonna lose it forever
'Cause time keeps on by
Na, na, na

Whoa-oh it goes on by
Keep on rolling
Keep on rolling
Keep on rolling
Keep on rolling by
Keep on rolling by

Go show your (fingers)
Out your hands
Out your pockets
Out your (bed)
It's going on
Keep on going
Keep on going, babe
Now, now, now, now
Keep on going now
Keep on going by

Well you may want to stop it babe
And you can't turn it around
Well you may want to turn it up babe
But you sure can't turn it down
You gotta slow down a little bit girl
Keep on rolling by
Keep on rolling by
Keep on rolling by
Time keep on going by
Ain't a thing you can do now
Just keep on going with it
And just stay on top of it for a little while
For a little while
Just for a little while
Just for a little while

Keep on going by
There goes Ezy
Ezy Ryder
Ridin' down the highway of desire
He says the free wind
Takes him higher
Tryin' to find his heaven above
But he's dyin' to be loved, dyin' to be loved

He's tellin' me livin'
Is so magic
Something is forever
So he claims
He's talkin' 'bout lyin'
It's so tragic baby
But don't you worry 'bout today
We got freedom comin' our way, freedom's comin' our way

How long
Do you
Think he is gonna last
Carryin' on outta gas
See all the others say
"Do what you please"
Gotta get the brothers together
And the right to be free
In a cloud of angel dust
I think I see me a freak
Hey motorcycle mama
You gonna marry me?

Bridge:
I'll be stone crazy
Love comin' in at you
Stone crazy baby

There goes Ezy
Ezy Ryder
Ridin' down the highway of desire
He says the free wind
Takes him higher
Searching for his heaven above
But he's dyin' to be loved, dyin' to be loved
I can read the papers
But I can't read you
Cancel my subscription
I'll take pay per view
This lover from another planet
Made up to look like you
You're out there, honey
This is out of hand
Or is it all smoke and mirrors
Some holographic stunt
I'm going through
Or is it voodoo
And though your fingers don't leave your hand
They just don't touch me anymore
Anymore

Well, I see your face
It's here
And it's like your voice
Is here
Your pretty pink mouth
Mmm, it's hot
Everybody's here
You're not
Well I know you're in range
The jingle of your change
Is ringing a bell
Ring a ringer
This knee jerk show of affection
A sticky new confection
Well I can't get it down

And even when you do that thing
That kinky thing you do
Well you're getting too good
You've been practicing without me
And I just don't recognize
The space behind your eyes anymore

Well you got your little dog
He's here
Even your, your good intent
It's here
You say you'll meet me
You're on the dot
Well the gang's all here, honey
But you're not

I see the writing on the wall
Looks like I'm headed for a fall
Uh oh
But the supernatural fact
This is a disappearing act
I'm about to debut
Why couldn't you be true
You're not
You're not
You're not
You're not
You're not
You're not
You're not
You're not
You're not
You're not

I dream of you more than you dream I do
How can I prove to you this love is real?
You're mean to me more than you mean to be
You just can't seem to see the way I feel

When I am close to you, the world is far away
The words that fill my heart my lips can't seem to say
I want you so, more than you'll ever know
More than you dream I do, I dream of you
If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder

If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder

I read all your letters
I read each word that you've sent to me though it's past now
And your words start to fade
All the memories I have still remain

I've kept all the pictures
I hide my feelings so no one knows, no one
Oh, sure, my friends all come round
But I'm in a crowd, I'm on my own
'Cause you're gone though your heart, heart still remains
And it'll be here if you come again
You see I'd heard the rumors
I knew before you let me know, you let me know
But I didn't believe it
You would not let me go
Seems I was wrong and I love you, love you the same
And that's the one thing that you can't take away

So just remember
(I love you)
(Remember I love you)

If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder
Yes! Yes! Thank you for inviting me here for my final speech
Ladies and gentlemen, homosexuals, lesbians, and transvestites
Allow me to introduce myself as the Hungry Hustler, Afroman
I am the American Dream. Even though the government tried to experiment with me
By placing me in the projects, I'm still the American Dream
Surrounded by drugs
Jeopardized my life by living around thugs
But I'm still the American Dream
Kicked outta Palmdale High School
Because I was considered a distraction to the educational process
I've traveled through the complete metamorphosis of the justice system
And I'm still the American Dream
Entered Juvenile Hall as a tadpole;
Hopped outta prison as a bull frog
But I'm still the American Dream
The most rejected, disrespected
When I went for a job I was never selected
But I am still the American Dream
And right about now
I find it quite serendipitous to see that all of you some-timin'
Wishy-washy, two-faced, back-stabbin'
Coniving hypocrites have accumulated here in my midst to persecute my character
With such flagrant slanderousity
But I counter-attack by calling it constructive criticism
And all of your negativity has been recycled into motivation
And I am still the American Dream
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found; was blind, but now I see
There's a lot of people out there who can identify with me
Young lady right here, you may be a single teenaged mother
But you are still the American Dream
The lady next to you, yes. Your breasts may not be as big as men think they should be
But you are still the American Dream
Young man, you may not be a baller, shot caller
With 20 inch blades on the impala, but you are still the American Dream
Young man right here, you may have spent all your money on a hood rat bitch
And didn't get no pussy last night, but you are still the American Dream
Yes sir, I am just like Ham. I'm for the black man
The mexican, and even poor white
All human beings that have no rights. So put down your past, pick up your future
Follow me as we journey through the Red Sea
Cause I have been to the mountain top
I've seen the Promised Land
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the Underground Category
My mind has been delivered
My spirit has been reinstated from the Corporate World's modern-day slavery
I've been emancipated. Free at last! Free at last! Fuck a drug test
I'm fittin' to roll some grass. Love, peace, and Afro grease, Fro-ever! Buccooocc!
A-E-I-O-U, and sometimes W. 'Cuz I'm high, cuz I'm high, cuz I'm high
People talkin' but they just don't know
What's in my heart and why I love you so
I love you baby like a miner loves gold
Come on sugar let the good times roll
Hey

So many people live and make believe
That they keep a lot a dough up their sleeves
Well my love baby isn't the kind that folds
Come on baby let the good times roll
Hey!

Let the good times roll
Oh come on baby
Come on baby and let daddy do you so
Hey yeah, baby let the good times roll

Our love is nice if its understood
It's even nicer when your feelin' good
You got me flippin' like a flag on a pole
Come on sugar let the good times roll
Hey!
Let the good times roll
Hey!
Let the good times roll
Let me show a baby
Let the good times roll
Wish I knew
Why I'm so in love with you
No one else in this world will do
Darling please save your love
For me

Mmmm run away
If I were wise I'd run away
But like a fool in love I stay
And pray you'll save your love
For me

I can feel it
Even when you're not here
Can't conceal it
I really love you my dear
Though I know no good
Can come from loving you
I can't do a thing
I'm so in love with you
So darling help me please
Have mercy on a fool like me
I'm so unwise but still I plead
Darling please save you love
For me h-hmmm

I can feel it
Even when you're not here
Can't conceal it
I really love you my dear
Though I know no good
Can come from loving you
I can't do a thing
I'm so in love with you

So darling help me please
Have mercy on a fool like me
I know I'm lost but still I plead
Darling please save your love for me

Save your love for me

You can have fun with the crowd
But for crying out loud
Darling save your love for me
Mmmm save your love for me
All for me
Cos I need you babe
Need your sweet love
Need it all just for me girl
You better save it now
Bring it on home mmmm
Please save your love.. for me
Darling save your love
Save your love
Save it all
I need it all
I want it... all your love
All your love girl mmmm
Save it all for me.. Yeah
Well have you ever lived down in the ghetto?
Have you ever felt that cold wind blow?
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't you stand up and scream?
'cause there's things goin' on that you don't know

Too many lives they spent across the ocean
Too much money they spent upon the moon
Well until they make it right
I hope they never sleep at night
They better make some changes and do it soon

Do it now
Do it good

Well they're gonna ruin the air that we breathe Lord have mercy
They're gonna ruin us all by and by
I'm telling all you beware
I don't think they really care
Think they just sit up there
And just get high
Well have you ever lived down in the ghetto?
Have you ever felt that cold wind blow?
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't you stand up and scream?
'cause there's things goin' on that you don't know
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't you stand up and scream?
'cause there's things goin' on that you don't know
Tell it
Tell it, tell it
Let me check this out...
Take this shit out...
Candy... So fine...
Yeah... Babe...
It's my favorite kind
Would you let me take a bite
I can taste it now
Let me fill my appetite
Don't be stingy girl
I will share my peice with you
Now take off the wrapper
Let me get a lick or two
As sweet as chocolate
Or juicy ligo
If I can't get a bite
I lick will be fine
I've had a taste it
It was good as can be
That's why I want another taste
Of your sweet sweet sweet...

[Chorus:]
Candy!
(Candy)
Candy!
So fine
Candy!
(Candy)
Candy!
Blow mah mind
Candy!
(Candy)
Candy!
Devine
Candy!
(Candy)
Candy!
Candy! It's sweeter than Randy girl
I love my candy! It's sweeter than Randy
Everybody says not to eat too many sweets
But I got a taste for itty bitty treats
Girl you got the flavor and I gotta get me some
Mm! Mm! Mm!
Just like a fruity plum
As sweet as chocolate
Or juicy ligo
If I can't get a bite
I lick will be fine
I've had a taste it
It was good as can be
That's why I want another taste
Of your sweet sweet sweet...

[Chorus:]
Candy!
(Candy)
Candy!
So fine
Candy!
(Candy)
Candy!
On mah mind
Candy!
(Candy)

Devine

(Chorus until end)
Written by Stevie Nicks

Isn't just that we cause each other such pain
Everywhere we go now, at home or at play
It hurts my self esteem, it hurts my everything
I am reeling... oh, it hurts my feelings
Sometimes it was heavenly (Sometimes it was heavenly)
Sometimes it was too heavy (Sometimes it was too heavy)
Sometimes it's just too much for me (Sometimes it's just too much for me)
Well I want to run away (Oh, well I want to run away)

Then there are the things, cast this doubt away
Those things that made me stay for so long
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now
I didn't understand then, but I understand now

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
And they both rushed by, like a thief in the night
Taking no prisoners, just like the first time
Adventures in paradise
Just like the first time
Then there are the things, cast this doubt away
Those things that made me stay for so long
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now
I didn't understand then, but I understand now

Then there are the things, cast this doubt away
Those things that made me stay for so long
Not make believe then, I'm not make believe now
It’s not make believe then, I'm not make believe now
I didn't understand then, but I understand now

[Verse 1 - Jemaine]
Lives are like retractable pencils
If you push them too far they're gonna break
And people are like paper dolls
Paper dolls and people, they're a similar shape
Hmm hmm hmm

[Verse 2 - Bret (Jemaine)]
Love is like a roll of tape
It's real good for making two things one
(But just like that roll of tape)
Love sometimes breaks off before you were done
Another way that love is similar to tape
That I've noticed
Is sometimes it's hard to see the end

[Pre-Chorus - Bret (Jemaine)]
You search round the roll (search round the roll)
Search round the roll (searching round the roll)
Search round the roll (search)
With your fingernail, again and again
And again and again and again

[Chorus - Bret and Jemaine]
Whoa ah oh
Brown paper, white paper
Stick it together with the tape
The tape of love, the sticky stuff
Whoa ah oh
Brown paper, white paper
Stick it together with the tape
The tape of love, the sticky stuff

[Interlude- Bret (Jemaine)]
You know recently, I've been thinking about love
About mutual love, when two things love each other mutually
And, um, I guess I've realized that
Out of all the things we're given
That love is the very strongest adhesive, yeah
Jemaine! (I'm sorry, sorry, what were you saying?)
Ah, it's just, I just--I don't really wanna say it again

[Chorus - Bret and Jemaine]
Brown paper, white paper
Stick it together with the tape
The tape of love, the sticky stuff
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Bridge - Jemaine]
People People, Paper Paper
Paper Paper, People People
People People, Pencil Pencil
Pencil Pencil, Paper Paper
Put the pencil to the paper
Give the paper to the people
Let the people read about the sellotape
Oh baby baby, yeah

[Chorus - Bret and Jemaine]
Brown paper, white paper
Stick it together with the tape
The tape of love

[Outro - Bret]
Stick, stick it together
Stick stick, stick it together
Ye-yeah
I was on my way home
From high school
Stuck at the crossing
I dug in for a duel
But at the last moment
I buried the brakes
My life split in two directions
Into two separate fates
I got on the last flight
To Amsterdam
But couldn't hit the runway
So we took off again
'Aw, there's no need to worry'
The captain cut in
'The winds are less angry
Over in Berlin'
You know it's true
The other shoe
It waits for you
What can you do?
Remember to show gratitude
The darkest night is nothing new
Sonny's got a problem
All the mini-mart clerks know
She knows nothing of Eminem's
Suburban gangster flow
Oh maybe it's random
How each moment unfolds
It didn't feel like the wrong time or place
Until they cut off her clothes
A sunny feeling is taken away
A sunny feeling is taken away
A sunny feeling is taken away
A sunny feeling is taken away
I'm on my way home
From my high school
I'm always contemplating
Why the kids are still cruel
Oh
The kids are still cruel
A sunny feeling is taken away
A sunny feeling is taken away
A sunny feeling is taken away
Some of the feeling gets taken away
I know baby's bad for my self-esteem
FInd another face for your sympathy
Some of us cry, some of them lie
But no one sees inside

The spark of baby's eyes and I turn to stone
Maybe I can't survive in the danger zone
Sounds of the night
Streets without light
And baby's not alone

Try to hold her to myself
Someone else is breaking all my dreams, she
Needs so many games to play
One more time I climb the stairs
Open up the door and she was gone
And baby here I go

Like a lamb to slaughter
Don't stop haunting me in this old house
I still love you when you're not around
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride
I'll still love you when it's cold outside
Me so sorry that I let you down
But you keep haunting me in this old town
Spoken:
And the smile is no longer there
The face and the eyes and the hair
Nothing stands the test of time
You live forever, never mine
I cling to dreams that turn to sand
Our life is now a distant land

We commit emotional suicide
Every single room is electrified
Your memory shadowing me
The house where sorrow hides

Pull it down, blow it up
Help me send these walls of love away
And baby here I go

Like a lamb to slaughter
Don't stop haunting me in this old house
I still love you when you're not around
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride
I'll still love you when it's cold outside
Me so sorry that I let you down
But you keep haunting me in this old town

[Chorus]
Slow down heart, you're beating much too fast
Why don't you, slow down heart
As she goes walking, past you

[Verse 1]
When I first saw you (Hey) my heart stood still (Hey)
Down my spine,(Hey) I felt cold chills (Hey)
My head started spinning, my knees got weak
Aw, I couldn't even speak

[Pre-Chorus]
When my heart started pounding
Like a, mallet of a judge
I couldn't budge
I couldn't budge
I couldn't budge

[Chorus]
So I said, slow down heart
A, Slow down a heart
You're beating much too fast
You know that you're beating too fast
Slow down heart
As she goes walking, past you

[Bridge]
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey, Hey

[Verse 2]
Everyday I wait outside my door (Hey)
Hoping you'll come by just once more (Hey)
That's when in a distance can see it's you
Aww, what could I do

[Pre-Chorus]
When my heart started pounding
Like a, thousand drums
Here she comes (Oh, here she comes)
Oh, here she comes
Oh, here she comes

[Chorus]
So I said, slow down heart
Slow down heart
You're beating much too fast
You know that you're beating too fast
Slow down heart
As she goes walking, past you
Why don't you, slow down heart
Punctured bicycle
On a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet ?
When in this charming car
This charming man

Why pamper life's complexities
When the leather runs smooth
On the passenger seat ?

I would go out tonight
But i haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said "it's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"

A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said "return the rings"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
I would go out tonight
But i haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said "it's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man ...
Oh, da-da, da-da, da-da, this charming man ...

A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
I would gather stars out of the blue, for you, for you
I would make a string of pearls out of the dew, for you, for you
Over the highway and over the street
Carpets of clover I'll lay at your feet

There's nothing in this world I would not do for you, just for you
Over the highway and over the street
Carpets of clover I'm gonna lay at your feet
There is nothing in this world I would not do, baby, for you, just for you

[Chorus:]
Do you think you're ready
To settle down, settle down babe
Do you think you're ready
To settle down with me babe
Do you think you're ready
To settle down, settle down with me babe
Settle down with me, babe
Settle down

[Verse 1:]
Would you like a house on the hill
Overlooking the ocean side
Tell me, would you like that baby
Or how about a high-rise apartment
In Manhattan on the east side
If that's what you need
I'm here to please
Won't you settle down with me, baby

[Chorus:]
Do you think you're ready
To settle down, settle down babe
Do you think you're ready
To settle down with me babe
Do you think you're ready
To settle down, settle down with me babe
Settle down with me, babe
Settle down

[Verse 2:]
We could take a jet plane all the way to Spain
Just to buy you a wedding ring
Tell me, would you like that baby
Oh, talk to me girl
We could get married on Christmas day
On the shores of Montego Bay
If that's what you need
I'm here to please
Won't you settle down with me

[Chorus:]
If you're ready
Only if you're ready
To settle down, settle down babe
Tell me if you're ready, ready yeah
To settle down with me babe
Do you think you're ready
To settle down, settle down with me babe
Settle down, settle down
Settle down

[Bridge:]
I'm not trying to buy your love
Money ain't in it
You can't put a price on love
Tell me if I'm worthy of
Worthy of you're hand
Girl, let's start making plans
You're shining like a star above
You're the light of my life
Oh girl, be my wife
Settle down, baby
Oh, but first...

[Chorus:]
Do you think you're ready
To settle down, settle down babe
I wanna know if you're ready, tell me baby
To settle down with me babe
Do you think you're ready
To settle down, settle down with me babe
Settle down babe
Settle down

[Ad-Libs:]
Ooh
Oh, whoa
Oooh
No no no no no no no
Yeah yes
Oh settle down babe
Settle down
You tell me when you're ready
(I'm ready, I'm ready)
Do you think you're ready
(I, yes I am baby)
Please tell me
(You already know)
When you're ready
(Yes I'm ready)
Then We can settle down
(Settle down babe)
Settle down
(I'm ready)
I wanna know if you're ready
Oh wee, oh it feels like you're ready babe
I can tell if you're ready
We need to settle down babe
Settle down

[Chorus]
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat
One for the head, and two for the beat

[Outro]
Give me something to do!
Out of all the reindeer you know you're the mastermind
Run, run Rudolph, Randalph's not too far behind
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Randalph he can hurry, he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a merry-go-round
Said Santa to a boy child "What have you been longing for?"
"All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a shooting star
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Can't you make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a merry-go-round
Said Santa to a girl child "What would you like most to get?"
"I want a little baby doll that can cry, scream and wet"
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a Saber jet
Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, a running like a son-of-a-gun

We got the baddest jam in the land
Everybody shut up, listen to the band
Housequake
Shut up already, damn
We made camp along Red River
Watched the cattle as they bedded down
Back at the wagons, right after supper
We spread our bedrolls on the ground
And me and Willie, we took the night guard
And the sage never smelled so sweet
The prairie moon, was blazin' silver
No chance tonight for a stampede

Way over yonder, off in the distance
Towards the mountains there in the west
Did I see lightnin', did I hear thunder
My mind is weary, I could use some rest
Then all at once, the wind shifts directions
The clouds roll in behind the tumbleweeds
These longhorn cattle, are gettin' restless
God help us all, if they stampede

Smell the rain, hear the thunder
The midnight sky, turns black as death
The lightnin' crashes, smell the sulphur
It's rank and strong, it's Satan's breath
The cattle rise up, and go to runnin'
I spur my pony on and take the lead
And across the herd, I can hear Willie yellin'
Hey Stampede!
Dust clouds rise, as the rain falls
They mix together, turn the air to mud
I feel the longhorns brush against me
And I can feel the demons racin' through my blood
Then all at once, my pony stumbles
We hit the ground, I rise up to my knees
In a flash of light, I can see the cattle comin'
Lord I know I'm gonna die in this stampede

Then I awake, and I look around me
I'm in my bedroll and I'm layin' on the ground
Over there's the wagon, and there's the campfire
I was only dreamin', but what's that sound?
Then I feel the earth tremble underneath me
As the midnight sky begins to bleed
And from the blackness I can hear Willie yellin'
Hey Stampede
Written by Peter Green

Well, I feel so bad - I wonder what's wrong with me
Well, I feel so bad - I wonder what's wrong with me
I think I'll call my baby, find out just what the matter can be

Last night I dreamed about my baby
I woke up and the tears were runnin' all down my face
Now, when I woke up - early this morning
The tears were runnin' all down my face
You know I was dreamin', that some other man was takin' my place

I said, I dreamed about you baby
I dreamed you didn't want me 'round no more
I said, I dreamed about you baby
You know I dreamed you didn't want me round no more
Now, That's the reason I'm callin' you this evening
Baby, tell me, 'cause I've just got to know

Break:
I've been worried all day long
I just don't know what to do
I've been worried all day long
You know, I just don't know what to do
You know it may sound silly to you woman
But tell me that dream was not true
Baby, do you understand me now
And sometimes you see a little mad
Can always be an angel
When every things goes wrong you seem to be bad

I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
Most of the time
I'm so full of worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy, I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I've got in more my share
And that's one thing I never mean to do
'cause I love you baby
I'm just human
Have thoughts like any one
Sometimes I think I spend the rest of my life regretting
Some simple thing that I have done

(x4)
I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
I've been watching you, I like those little moves you make
Said I'm feeling you, tell me, are you feeling me too?
I'd like to know your name but I'm so scared
Afraid of what you might say
But if I don't ever see you again, can't let you just walk away

Now you're approaching me, excuse me, can I know your name?
Took the opportunity, and now we're standing here face to face

It's amazing that you're so beautiful, tell me, are you really real?
And you say you wanna see me again, you have been watchin' me too
I'm so excited, excited, excited, excited
Light the lamp and fire mellow
Cabin essence timely hello
Welcomes the time for a change

Lost and found, you still remain there
You'll find a meadow filled with grain there
I'll give you a home on the range

Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?
Who ran the iron horse?

I want to watch you windblown facing
Waves of wheat for your embracing
Folks sing a song of the grange
Nestle in a kiss below there
The constellations ebb and flow there
And witness our home on the range

Who ran the iron horse?
(Truck driving man do what you can)
Who ran the iron horse?
(High-tail your load off the road)
Who ran the iron horse?
(Out of night-life, I'm a gas man)
Who ran the iron horse?
(I don't believe I gotta grief)
Who ran the iron horse?
(I'm out of luck)
Who ran the iron horse?
(With a buck and a booth)
Who ran the iron horse?
(Catchin' on to the truth)
Who ran the iron horse?
(In the vast past, the last gasp)
Who ran the iron horse?
(Land in the dust, trust that you must)
Who ran the iron horse?
(Catch as catch can)

Have you seen the grand coolie workin' on the railroad?
Have you seen the grand coolie workin' on the railroad?
Have you seen the grand coolie workin' on the railroad?
Over and over
The crow cries uncover the cornfield

The crow cries uncover the cornfield
Over and over
The thresher and hover the wheat field

Over and over
The crow cries uncover the cornfield
Over and over
The thresher and hover the wheat field
Hark! the herald angels sing

I'm sad to see that you are sad
I'm sad to see that you are sad
But there's nothing to be sad about
Really nothing to feel bad about

There she was standing peacefully
Sending the message through telepathy
Way beyond the speculation
Furthest away from any condition

But there's nothing to be sad about
Really nothing to feel bad about

There she was standing peacefully
Sending the message through telepathy
Way beyond the speculation
Furthest away from any condition
Here to pacify, connected to joy
I promised you the day you marry me
I'll be everything to you that I should be
And while you're in the springtime of your years
You'll not know what it's like to shed a tear
I'll be the same through all that we go through
I promise you I promise you

I promise you for richer or for poorer
I'll more than share each pain that you endure
And when you're in the autumn of your years
You'll call me in the night and I'll be near
I love you and I'll let you know I do
I promise you I promise you

I promise you for better or for worse
I'll stand by you as I did at the first
And when you're in the winter of your years
I'll be right by your side to dry your tears
Yes I'll be the same through all that we go through
I promise you I promise you
I promise you I promise you
People, I was standing at my window
Tears running all down my cheeks
Yes, standing at my window
Tears running all down my cheeks
Well, I could see the woman I'm loving
Stopping everyone in the world she meets

Well, standing on the corner
Between 35th and Main
Well, standing on the corner, people
Between 35th and Main
Yeah, that's where a blind man's seen my woman
People, a dumb man called her name

He said, "Oh, I'm blind
You brought eyesight and made me see"
"Oh, I'm blind
You brought eyesight and made me see"
Yes, and the dumb man asked a question
"Woman, who may your good man be?"
Yes, I'm standing by trembling, people
People, my heart's laying in my hand
I'm standing by trembling, darling
With my heart's laying in my hand
Well, I could hear my baby say
"Lord, I ain't got no man"
Irene, would you tell me what you said?
Irene, would you tell me what you said?
This is my world, and you'll tell me what you said
We could beat them, if you'd tell me what you said
Ooooooh

Irene, would you tell me what you said?
Irene, would you tell me what you said?
This was your world, 'til he wished that he was dead
Now it's my world, and you'll tell me what you said
Ooooooohhhh
The moon belongs to everyone
The best things in life are free
The stars belong to everyone
They gleam there for you and for me

The flowers in spring, the robins that sing
The moonbeams that shine
They're yours, they're mine

And love can come to everyone
The best things in life are free

And love can come to everyone
The best things in life are free

[Verse 1]
You can take me to the paradise
And then again you can be cold as ice
I'm over my head (Over my head)
But it sure feels nice
You can take me anytime you like
I'll be around if you think you might
Love me, baby (Over my head)
And hold me tight

[Chorus]
Your mood is like a circus wheel
You're changing all the time
Sometimes I can't help but feel
That I'm wasting all of my time

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Your mood is like a circus wheel
You're changing all the time
Sometimes I can't help but feel
That I'm wasting all of my time

[Verse 2]
I think, I'm looking on the dark side
But every day you hurt my pride
I'm over my head (Over my head)
Oh, but it sure feels nice
I'm over my head (Over my head)
But it sure feels nice
I'm over my head (Over my head)
But it sure feels nice

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
You ain't got no halo hangin' over head
You ain't got no wings that you can spread
You ain't got no harp so you can play me song so sweet
You ain't got no golden slippers on your pretty little feet

[Chorus]
Oh, but to me you're an angel
To me you're an angel
You're not an ordinary girl
Because you're an angel to me, yeah

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
Now you don't have sugar sprinkled all over you
You're not made of peppermint through and through
You don't come in assorted flavors like a package of charms
And you won't stain my shirt if you melt in my arms

[Chorus]
Oh, but to me you're candy
To me you're candy
You're not an ordinary girl
Because you're candy to me, yeah
(Candy, baby)

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks]
I know I have a cause
I have missions on trees
You might not know all the facts
About the birds and the bees
You don't send me sweet love letters with the smell of perfume
My photograph might not be plastered all over your room

[Chorus]
Oh, but to me you're a sweetheart
To me you're a sweetheart
You're not an ordinary girl
You're a real sweetheart to me, yeah
(Sweet, sweet baby)
You're not an ordinary girl
You're a real sweetheart to me, yeah
(Sweet, sweet baby)

Pussy Control (Are U ready?)
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books 4 the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat 4 some clothes and her rep
With her chin up, she scolded "All y'all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step"
And step she did 2 the straight A's
Then college, the master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work 4 free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are triflin'?
They just don't know
Mama didn't tell'em what she told me
"Girl, U need Pussy Control" (Are U ready?)

Oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone

Your mother might wanna visit us
But you tell you mamma I get home bout the break a day
And that's too late to visit anybody, baby
So, tell you mamma to please, please, please stay away
'Cause I don't want a soul, baby
Hangin' around my house when I'm not at home
Yes, I don't want you to open the door for anybody, woman
Oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone
You might feel a little sick, baby
And you know you're home all alone
I don't want the doctor at my house, baby
You just suffer, suffer, suffer till I get home
'Cause I don't want a soul, baby
Hangin' around my house when I'm not at home
Yes, I don't want you to open the door for nobody, woman
Baby, when you're home and all alone
Yeah!
Eleven times I been busted, eleven times I been to jail
Some of the times I been there nobody could go my bail
Well it seems to me, Lord that this ol' boy just don't fit
Well I can jump in a rosebush and come out smelling like sh...

Those misters dressed in blue never done so right by me
Some of the times I was innocent but the judge said guilty
I'm not one to complain now son I tell you true
When the black cat cross your trail, Lord
It comes in misery times two

(Chorus)
Double trouble--that's what my friends all call me
(Double trouble)
I said, double trouble
T-R-O-U-B-L-E

Well I was born down in the gutter
With a temper as hot as fire
Spent ninety days on a peat farm just doin' the county's time
Well now, even mama said Son you're bad news
And it won't be too long before someone puts one through you
(Chorus)

(Chorus)
Sunshine, daydream, walking in the tall trees, going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose, Now come on over sweetly
Ride out singin', "I got you in the morning sunshine."

Sunshine, daydream, Now come on over daydream
Sunshine, daydream. Hey come on, Never gonna sweet dream
Sunshine, daydream, Wading in a cold stream

Say calling out your window, "Wake Up!"
Going where the wind goes, Never gonna miss that, No no no!
Ride out singin', "I got you in the morning sunshine."

Sunshine, daydream, (Hey) Street coming daydream
Hey, hey, I'm moving on a daydream, (Hey)
Hey, Sweet coming daydream, (Hey)

Sun coming daydream, Come on over daydream
Come on over, Come on over daydream
Sweet coming daydream, Hey, never fade away dream
Yea, Hey hey, Sweet coming daydream, Never fade away dream
Retrieve the past like a prayer, bringing it back into the light
What was yesterday will reform today to retrieve lost life
Lost loves (unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness)
Retrieve (unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness)
Lost words (unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness)
Ideas (unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness)
Overcome (unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness)
(Unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness)

Unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness into
Consciousness, made conscious out of the darkness into
Consciousness, made conscious out of the darkness into
Consciousness, made conscious out of the darkness into

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la...
There's a man going around taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There will be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around

The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup?
Or disappear into the potter's ground?
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
'Til Armageddon, no salam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet, they'll cast the golden crowns
When the man comes around

Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come

And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

In measured hundredweight and penny pound
When the man comes around

[Radio DJ]
Hey a little bit ago we were talking about uh, songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song, and um, up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift, and have you heard this song yet?

[Tim McGraw]
I have heard this song

[Radio DJ]
Tim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?

[Tim McGraw]
It was awesome. Uh, except for, I didn't know if I should, I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old?

[Radio DJ]
Ah, ha ha ha

[Tim McGraw]
I didn't know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more, I don't know if its true or not, but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old, I don't know if that's true, but that's what I choose to think.

[Radio DJ]
Why don't we find out. Taylor is a compliment, or uh, he's old?

[Taylor Swift]
Oh its definitely a compliment. Yeah. (Laughing)

[Radio DJ]
Tim McGraw, meet Taylor Swift.

[Tim McGraw]
Nice-

[Taylor Swift]
Nice to meet you.

[Tim McGraw]
Nice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?

[Taylor Swift]
I'm doing great. How are you doing?

[Tim McGraw]
I'm doing good. Congratulations on your record. It's doing great.

[Taylor Swift]
Thank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for, uh, having good... music and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker (Laughing)

[Radio DJ]
Well-

[Taylor Swift]
The funny thing about this song is ya know, as a writer, some of the songs that you write like four hours, you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes. And ya know, I really didn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so I kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But, um, my label heard it and was like, "we're putting that out."(Laughing)

[Tim McGraw]
Well, I'm glad ya did, 'cause, um, it's doing well for ya.

[Radio DJ]
So I-, so I understand that you two guys have not talked.

[Tim McGraw]
No.

[Radio DJ]
You haven't met.

[Tim McGraw]
No.

[Taylor Swift]
No, we've never talked or met or anything.

[Tim McGraw]
I sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly
Or something like that. Oh, I don't remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message, so, I don't know if she got it or not.

[Taylor Swift]
Oh my God. They never gave that to me.

[Tim McGraw]
They didn't? Okay, well, there ya go. I did. (Laughing)

[Radio DJ]
So I-I.

[Taylor Swift]
We've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.

[Tim McGraw]
Not at all.

[Radio DJ]
So I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called Tim McGraw without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?

[Taylor Swift]
It was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know, I didn't say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking, ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad.

[Tim McGraw]
Well, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad
I'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-

[Taylor Swift]
Could you tell Faith that I said hello?

[Tim McGraw]
I sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.

[Taylor Swift]
Oh my gosh, she's awesome.

[Tim McGraw]
I agree.

[Radio DJ]
This, this...Tell me about writing a song. Um, did this, did this really happen?

[Taylor Swift]
Well, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing
Session on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw
Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um... (Laughing).
I actually this this is kinda strange, but I actually came up with the
melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year
of high school.

[Tim McGraw]
Now I feel old.

[Taylor Swift]
And um, I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself. And I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And it's kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know? That my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.

[Tim McGraw]
Aww, thank you.

[Taylor Swift]
And uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first. And so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano. And wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes, "Well, that's your first single." (Laughing)

[Taylor Swift]
And I'm like, well.

[Tim McGraw]
Well, you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor (Laughing)

[Taylor Swift]
That's awesome. There's a part two coming out next month.

[Tim McGraw]
Alright, great (Laughing)

[Tim McGraw]
Well, congratulations 'cause it's your first single. First top ten hit and thats pretty exciting. And I know you're off to the races here.
You're just doing great and, uh, congratulations, very exciting for you!

[Taylor Swift]
Awesome, its been so exciting, Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?

[Tim McGraw]
Um, I don't know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that. (Laughing)

[Taylor Swift]
Well, I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.

[Tim McGraw]
Ya do? What would-

[Taylor Swift]
Yeah.

[Tim McGraw]
What would their name be?

[Taylor Swift]
Uh, um, I think Taylor something.

[Tim McGraw]
Something like that, yeah

[Taylor Swift]
But.

[Tim McGraw]
Well, I'll, I'll be more than happy to have you out with me.

[Taylor Swift]
Just consider it.

[Radio DJ]
Ah, well that's very good! You're pretty fearless, Taylor Swift. I'll tell ya that.

[Tim McGraw]
Right she's, she's gonna be forward this time.

[Radio DJ]
I think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well.

[Tim McGraw]
Absolutely.

[Radio DJ]
Hey Taylor, I know you're on the road, thank ya so much for joining us.

[Taylor Swift]
It was awesome and thank you. It was good to meet you, Tim.

[Tim McGraw]
You too. Good talking to you. Bye bye now.

[Taylor Swift]
Bye.

[Tim McGraw]
Good luck out there.

[Taylor Swift]
Thanks!

Woke up this morning, my baby's gone
Woke up this morning, my baby's gone
I ain't had no loving since my baby been gone

I ain't got nobody to stay at home with me
I ain't got nobody to stay at home with me
I wonder 'bout my baby, what's gonna happen to me

My baby's gone, gone away from me
My baby's gone, gone away from me
My whole life is in misery

My baby's gone, gone away from me
My baby's gone, gone away from me
And now I'm worried taht you can see
Wake up, my love, beneath the midday sun, alone, once more alone
This traveling boy was only passing through, but he will always think of you
One night of love beside a strange young smile, as warm as I have known
A traveling boy and only passing through, but one who'll always think of you

Take my place out on the road again, I must do what I must do
Yes, I know we were lovers but a drifter discovers
A traveling boy and only passing through, but one who'll always think of you

Take my place out on the road again, I must do what I must do
Yes, I know we were lovers but a drifter discovers
That a perfect love won't always last forever

I won't say that I'll be back again cause time alone will tell
So no goodbyes for one just passing through, but one who'll always think of you
No goodbyes
The townsfolk react coldly towards
Rhayader because of his odd appearance
But their fear is mixed with curiosity for he
Has a noble bearing
Step into the velvet of the morning
Let yourself lay back within your dreams
Take on the situation but not the torment
Now you know it's not as bad as it seems

Well, I know you'd like to come away
But, baby, you can't come
Fortune is your life's love

Oh, and anytime you think about leaving
Think about what you know
Well, think about it
Think about it before you go

And the heart says danger
And the heart says whatever
It is that you want from me
I am just one small part of
Forever falling star, star catcher

Even when you feel like your life is fading
I know that you'll go on forever, you're that good
Heartbreak of the moment is not endless
Fortune is your life's love

Well, honey I know you'd like to come away
But, baby, you can't come
Fortune is your life's love

Oh, and anytime you think about leaving
Think about what you know
Well, think about it
Think about it before you go
Well, think about it
Think about it before you go

And the heart says danger
And the heart says whatever
Think about it before you go

Think about it before you go

Moonlight on the Ganges, my little Hindu
When I whisper love's sweet melody
All our dreams and our schemes came true
Someday on the Ganges, I'll need you once more
And I'll kiss you and caress you
Where the waters kiss the silent shore
(musical interlude)
Moonlight on the Ganges, my little Hindu
When I whisper love's sweet melody
All our dreams and our schemes came true
Someday on the Ganges, I'll need you once more
And I'll kiss you and caress you
Where the waters kiss, kiss the silent shore
My woman's been accusing me
Of stepping out
Jealous rumors have her mind filled
With so much doubt
And I've gotta convince her
I'm not doing her wrong
Before she leaves me
Sad and all alone

So when the clock hits five
I'll be gone
There's a matter
That I'm gonna settle later on
So if the boss man talks
About overtime
I'm just gonna smile
And pay him no mind

I've got business with my baby tonight
We're gonna talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight
We'll go out to dinner
At our favorite restaurant
I'll hold her hand
And tell her she's all I'll ever want
When we get home
I'll take her straight to paradise
And we'll still be loving
Till the morning light

I've got business with my baby tonight
We're gonna talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight

Now don't you start talking
About gossip or news
I'm warning you now
I'll put on my walking shoes
'Cause to me nothing in this world
Is a big deal
When it's compared to the way
She makes me feel, all right

I've got business with my baby tonight
We're gonna talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight
B.B.'s got business tonight
We're gotta talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight
I can turn a gray sky blue
I can make it rain whenever I want it to, oh I
I can build a castle from a single grain of sand
I can make a ship sail on dry land
But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue
'Cause I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you, babe
I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you, babe
I can't get next to you
I can fly like a bird in the sky
Hey, and I can buy anything that money can buy, oh I
I can turn a river into a raging fire
I can live forever if I so desired
Unimportant are all the things I can do
'Cause I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you, babe
I can't get next to you
I can turn back the hands of time, you better believe I can
I can make the seasons change, just by waving my hand, oh I
I can change anything from old to new
The things I want to do the most, I'm unable to do
Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess
'Cause girl you're the key to my happiness
And I, oh I
Can't get next to you
Girl, you're blowing my mind 'cause I can't get next to you
Can't you see these tears I'm crying? I can't get next to you
Girl, it's you that I need, I gotta get next to you
Can't you see these tears I'm crying? I can't get next to you
I, I, I, I, I can't get next to you
I, I, I, I, I can't get next to you
Girl, you're blowing my mind
Now when I saw you this morning
Tell me, why did you walk away?
When I saw you this morning, baby
Tell me, why did you walk away?
Can't believe that you don't love me
I thought our love was here to stay

Well, buzz me baby
I'll be waiting for you when you call
Buzz me, buzz me baby
Yes, I'll be waiting for you when you call
And if you forgot my number
Come on over and don't call at all

I never lied to no one
I ain't gonna lie to you
Say I'm yours forever
Every word I say is true

Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me baby
I'm like a ship that's lost at sea
If I ever get my arms around you
I ain't gonna let go till 1973
Buzz me, baby
I said buzz me, buzz me, buzz me baby
Yes, I'll be waiting for you when you call
If you forgot my number
Come on over and you don't even have to call at all
I can relate
The story of my life
No brighter hope
No stronger emotion
I believed I could die over you
How you could ever
Break down and never see me through
Through my darkest night

And as I lie awake
One prayer within me burning
And there's no price on what you hold
Till it's gone
And it keeps moving on

Where is my heart
You know I will be waiting to be
A part of you
You'll never feel the pain
How can you say to me
That I should go on living
I left the only life I had with you
The only love
No use in me pretending to be
A part of you
And you the heart of me
How can you say to me
That I should go on living
I left the only life I had with you
So we agree
To let each other go
No long goodbye
Just your way and my way
And I can stand how you cried to be free
High as the wind blows
But not enough to bring you home to me
And only lonely knows

You see my open arms
You know my flame is burning
But I'm too blind to see the end has begun
And it keeps movin' on

The only love
No use in me pretending to be
A part of you
And you the heart of me
How can you say to me
That I should go on living
I left the only life I had with you

The only love
One love that will not die
I may sorry that I built my
World around you
The only love
Is only you and I
There will be others who would
Leave you as I found you
The only love
One love that will not die
I may sorry that I built my
World around you
The only love
Is only you and I
There will be others who would
Leave you as I found you
Candle lit, and my eyes are slits
Jumpin' now, paper clip
Make a move, sail a ship
Tap it in, tap it in, ruby lips

She's a mixed up, shook up girl
Got me so strung out
I don't know what to do
She's a mixed up, mixed up, shook up girl

Take a breath, in the night
Hurry over, she said
But there was no one in sight
Now break away, is in her eyes
You know that little girl, she cut me deep
Inside out

She's a mixed up, shook up girl
Got me so strung out
I don't know what to do
She's a mixed up, mixed up, shook up girl
Hey, you, I remember
All the empty streets
Fill me now
And though you're gone away
I know not forever
Why don't you just come over here and tell me, baby
Is it over now?

She's a mixed up,shook up girl
Got me so strung out
I don't know what to do
She's a mixed up, mixed up, shook up girl
She's a mixed up, shook up girl
She's a mixed up, shook up girl
And she got me so strung out...
She's a mixed up, shook up girl...

And she got me so strung out...

She's a mixed up, shook up girl...
Taking my time making up my mind
Choosing the girl that's suppose it have to love me forever
I'm gonna make sure
That she has a heart of gold yeah
And the love to whole me

Falling, that's way I'm taking it slow
'Cause I wanna know if it that kind of love
That's gonna last me forever
Don't gonna waste precious time
Don't play lovers part, coz I one day end up with a broken heart
No, no, no, no, no, not me, not me, not I, not me

Do you believe?
I wise man once told me a long time ago
'If a women don't love you, let her go'
I don't need you baby

That's way I'm taking it slow
'Cause I wanna know if it that kind of love
That's gonna last me forever
Don't gonna waste precious time
Don't play lovers part, coz I one day end up with a broken heart
No, no, no, no, no, not me, not me, not I, not me
Taking my time making up my mind
Choosing, choosing
When I first met you we burned like a flame
Now it's gettin' colder and you know that's a same
Love's out there somewhere but you know it won't come in
So let's remember baby how sweet all this has been
But when two real good lovers start bein' real good friends
You know that's the beginning of the end

I make you sparkle like strawberry wine
And when I felt bad you make me feel fine
Oh it's good when it's goin' and gone when it's gone
We both know enough to leave well enough alone
When two real good lovers start bein' real good friends
Baby can't you see that's the beginning of the end

The cool of the morning the heat of the night
The loving was good (but you know) it just wasn't right
Someday when you wake up and call out my name
Don't feel bad about it I'll probably do the same
But when two real good lovers start bein' real good friends
Baby don't ya know that's the beginning of the end
Can U come outside and play?!

Give me your name and number
Give me the keys 2 your ride
Put the top down
Let me cruise up the ocean side
Let me put my arm around U
Unsnap your self-consciousness
Take off everything except your stockings
I wanna kiss U more or less

Can U come outside and play? {"Play" repeats is BG of song}
Tell me baby, what do U say?

I got a bet goin' with my partner
That U're the best kisser in L.A
If I'm, uh, out of line, U can tell me
But if I'm not, we can get busy

Come on baby, tell me what do U say?
Can U come outside and play?
Play! Play!
Take off everything except your stockings
I wanna kiss U more or less {x3}
I wanna.. I wanna.. I wanna..
I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna play!

I got a bet goin' with my partner
That U're the best kisser in L.A
Come on baby, come on baby
Come on, come outside and play {x3}
Play

(Can U come outside and play?)
Come outside and play!
(Play) {x8}
(Can U come outside and play?)
(Play) {x15}
(Can U come..)
(Can U come..)
(Can U come outside..)
(Can U come outside and play?)

U'll be fine {segue}
We can withstand the test of time
It's all or nothing
Everything we do
Even when I can't be
Can't be with U
It doesn't mean U're any farther away
Just means we're still prisoners
Not entirely free
There's a new age dawning
Slowly opening heaven's door
Contrary 2 rumour
Heaven is keeping score

The New Power Generation has just taken control

[Verse 1: Nathan]
Here I am again
Wondering if you're okay
Can't stop this troubled heart 'cause we're apart... miles away
Phone pressed up to my ear, wish you were here, holding me
A face to go with your sweet voice will bring me joy ...totally

[Chorus]
I know I can't be there, baby, it's all right
(But I know it's alright)
I'll be waiting for you tonight (tonight)
I pray that you'll be there when I close my eyes
Meet me in my dreams tonight

[Verse 2: Shawn]
One thing that never changes no matter what
I can't wait to see you
Can't wait to feel you
And there's a place of our own
Where we can go, nobody knows
I close my eyes real tight
And make love to you all night

[Chorus]
I know I can't be there, baby, it's all right
I'll be waiting for you tonight (ooh yeah)
I pray that you'll be there when I close my eyes
Meet me in my dreams tonight

[Bridge: Wanya]
I wish I may, I wish you might
Find sometime when you sleep tonight
To think of me and I'll appear before your eyes
It's my paradise, your world
You're my heart, my life, my girl
Ooh, can't wait to go to sleep
'Cause there's a possibility... you'll meet me...

[Chorus]
I know I can't be there, baby it's all right
(it's okay)
I'll be waiting for you tonight (tonight)
I pray that you'll be there when I close my eyes
Meet me in my dreams tonight (tonight)
I know I can't be there, baby it's all right
(it's alright)
I'll be waiting for you tonight (tonight)
I pray that you'll be there when I close my eyes
Meet me in my dreams tonight

[Verse 1]
My stupid mouth
Has got me in trouble
I said too much again
To a date over dinner yesterday
And I could see she was offended
She said "well anyway..."
Just dying for a subject change
Oh, it's another social casualty
Score one more for me
How could I forget?
Mama said "think before speaking"
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do?
I guess he better find one soon
We bit our lips. She looked out the window
Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker
And I could see clearly
An indelible line was drawn
Between what was good
What just slipped out
And what went wrong
Oh, the way she feels about me has changed
Thanks for playing, try again
How could I forget?
Mama said "think before speaking"
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do?
I guess he better find one

[Chrous]
I'm never speaking up again. It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery than she desert me
Oh I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now

[Bridge]
No I was not listening
Sorta missed it baby, come around again
Yes my head is swirling welcome to my world
It's population one
And you can't come
So take it or leave it
That's just who I am
It might be hard to believe it
But you know that you know that you got to understand

[Verse 2]
One more thing
Why is it my fault
So maybe I try too hard
But it's all because of this desire
I just wanna be liked
Looks like the joke is on me now
So call me captain backfire

[Chorus]
I'm never speaking up again it only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery than she desert me
Oh I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now

[Verse 1]
Oh my, naked eyes
I should have kept you
I should have tried
I should have been a wiser kind of guy
I miss you

[Verse 2]
Give me wings
Give me space
Give me money for a change of face
Those noisy rooms and passion pants
I loved you

[Chorus]
Where's the morning in my life?
Where's the sense in staying right?
Who said time was on my side?
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

[Chorus]
You alone across the floor
You and me and nothing more
You're the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hated when you lied
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

[Verse 3]
Beatle boys, all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs every night
Wish I'd sent a Valentine
I love you

[Outro]
I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
My naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
I'll Survive
When somebody loves you
Its no good unless he loves you...
All the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you
All the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
Thats how its got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
Thats how deep it goes if its real

When somebody needs you
Its no good unless she needs you
All the way

Through the good or lean years
And for all those in between years
Come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
Its for sure I'm gonna love you
All the way
All the way...

So if you let me love you
Its for sure I'm gonna love you
All the way
All.. The ... Way...

Got a chopper, kinda like a helicopter
For any nigga that think it's sweet
And you better call the doctor, have you shakin' like a maraca
Drippin' like this beat
Blood spillin' like a faulty faucet
Plug his ass, before you end up in a hearse put the gear in reverse then you better hit the fucking... gas {tires screech}
You broke n' now you bitter
But how the hell is a nigga gonna start beef with me on his fucking twitter? (for real?)
You know where I be, you know where I stay I ain't that hard to find
All up on my D, when the DTP boy you sweeter than a valen... tine
How can you call yourself a man boy (man boy)
Yous ludacris number one fan boy (fan boy)
Then you left and you're gone "goodbye" lazy, I dont miss you
Then you signed to a nigga, who signed to a nigga, who signed to another nigga (what the fuck?)
Smart move, boy you dumb as hell
You should take your soul and have a end of the summer sale
But all your records are my theme song (why?)
'cuz I'm still shopping off your ringtone
(Hook)
Verse 2 - Ludacris

I'll buy you the glow of an evening star
A song of the winds that cry
Promise you more than all you can dream
Anything love can buy

I'll give you the gold at the rainbow's end
The clouds of a summer sky
Tell me your wish, and so it shall be
Anything love can buy

A silver brook flowing down to the sea
Daffodils kissed by the sun
These are the treasures fortune gave me
Money I have none

Come walk by my side and hold my hand
We'll build our castles high
I'll give you the whole wide world on a string
Anything love can buy
Anything love can buy
It starts with just a little glance now
Right away you're thinkin' 'bout romance now
You know you ought to take it slower
But you just can't wait to get to know her

A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing
But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring

It makes you feel so bad
It makes your heart feel sad
It makes your days go wrong
It makes your nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Right now you think that she's perfection
This time is really an exception
Well you know I hate to be a downer
But I'm the guy she left before you found her
Well I'm not saying you won't have a good love with her
But I keep on remembering things like they were

She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
Mercy on judgment, Lord
Mercy on judgment, Lord
Mercy on judgment, Lord
Ohh, along that day, sad day

Downpressor man, where you gonna run to?
Tell me, downpressor man, where you gonna run to?
Downpressor man, where you gonna run to?
Ohh, along that day, along that day

You run to the rocks, rocks will be melting, man
When you run to the rocks, the rocks will be melting, so run
When you run to the rocks, rocks will be melting
Ohh, along that day, sad day for you

Ohh, when you gonna run to the sea, the sea will be boiling
When you run to the sea, the sea will be boiling
Run to the sea, the sea will be boiling
Ohh, along that day, that day

So, you gonna run to the Lord, ohh, what you hidin'
Run to the Lord, Lord, what you hidin'?
Run to the Lord, Lord, what you hidin'?
Ohh, along that day, sad day for you, man
Mercy on judgment, Lord
Mercy on judgment, Lord
I said, mercy on judgment, Lord
Ohh, along that day

I wouldn't like to be a plea, in your color, man
Wouldn't like to be a plea, in your color, man
I wouldn't like to be a plea, in your color, man
Ohh, along that day

You get a run but the being's high
Stonehaven Sunset the water's on fire
My true love of singing, we kiss and conspire
Sing a song for the ocean a song for the sky
A song for tomorrow love sweet by and by
For the child who is coming and for dreams that come true
Sing a song for each other for me and for you
Sing a song for all lovers all the stars in the skies
Sing of Stonehaven water home, Stonehaven Sunrise

Stonehaven Sunset the desert's on fire
Christ on the cross again burns with desire
They are shooting at random though they aim at us all
It's the children who rise up and children who fall
All the angels are weeping the sweetest of tears
Fall like rivers of mercy to wash all our fears
Sing a song for Old Glory and a future that dies
Sing of Stonehaven desert home, Stonehaven Sunrise

Stonehaven Sunset the city's on fire
The soldiers just smile and say this gun's for hire
Give in to the beast boy give in to the thrill
It's just human nature to hunt and to kill
We all die together and yet somehow alone
Just together we have memories and many are gone
Singing songs for old soldiers a chorus of sighs
Sing of Stonehaven city home, Stonehaven Sunrise
Stonehaven Sunset the mountain's on fire
My spirit is lifted, rising higher and higher
All the prophets are laughing they say we told you so
It's one thing to play guessing games, another to know
For the needs of many are the sins of a few
And the day is forthcoming when accounting is due
Sing a song for sweet justice with a fire in her eyes
Sing of Stonehaven mountain home, Stonehaven Sunrise

Stonehaven Sunset the water's on fire
My true love of singing, we kiss and conspire
Sing a song for the ocean a song for the sky
A song for tomorrow love sweet by and by
For the child who is coming and for dreams that come true
Sing a song for each other for me and for you
Sing a song for all lovers all the stars in the skies
Sing of Stonehaven water home, Stonehaven Sunrise
A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an "Oh, beg your pardon?"
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said "May I have the next one?"
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage made of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words "ever after?"
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss my pug-nosed dream

[Verse 1: Paul Williams]
When you're feeling alright, I never see you coming
But when you're hurt, you always come running
But one of these days I know, I'm gonna have to let you go

[Chorus]
Then, tell me, who you gonna run to, baby?
Where you gonna hide?
I wanna know, who you gonna tell that you're hurting inside?

[Verse 2: Paul Williams]
When you're going strong (going strong)
I don't see you at all (I don't see you at all)
But when something goes wrong (when something goes wrong)
That's when you call (that's when you call)
But if you keep doing me like you do
Then I'm gonna turn my back on you

[Chorus]
Then, tell me, who you gonna run to? Baby, baby, where
Where you gonna hide?
Now who you gonna tell that you're hurting inside?

[Verse 3: Paul Williams]
When you climbed love's tree, you thought that love was a game
But now you're out on a limb, oh yes, and you're calling my name
But one of these days I'm bound, to let you come tumbling down

[Chorus]
Then, tell me, who you gonna run to? Baby, baby, where
Where you gonna hide?
Who you gonna tell that you're hurting inside?
Baby, baby, who you gonna run to? Exactly where
Where you gonna hide?

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Some things in life are bad, they can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle, don't grumble give a whistle
This will help things turn out for the best

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life

If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly, chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

So, always look on the bright side of death
Just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a counterfeit and when you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's the joke, it's true
You see, it's all a show, keep them laughing as you go
Just remember the last laugh is on you
Always look on the bright side of life
And always look on the right side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
And always look on the right side of life

Anyway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
I ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone
I'm a-comin' home
My baby she wrote me a letter
My baby she wrote me a letter
Gotta get a ticket cause I really gotta go
There's a party goin' down at the rock 'n' roll show
Baby get ready if you really wanna go
Now everybody's goin' to the rock 'n' roll show

I saw some surfer girls in west L.A
And right away it got me thinkin' 'bout my high school days
Well I was always kinda shy you know I never learned to dance
And I remember bein' nervous I was scared to take a chance
And it happened it was lookin' through my mamma's things
I found some rock and roll records and I learned to sing!

Rock 'n' roll to the rescue
Rock 'n' roll to the rescue
Rock to the rescue
I said it rescued me
And it'll rescue you

Now believe it when I tell ya that I never felt alive
Not 'til the night I started rockin' to my mamma's 45's
Well it was one for the money now and two for the show
Baby you better get a'ready now and go cat go!
Yeah the long tall Sally got me boppin' 'round the room
She sing be bop wadda loo bop a-whop bam boom
Rock 'n' roll to the rescue
Rock 'n' roll to the rescue
Rock to the rescue
I said it rescued me
And it'll rescue you

So we got a band together now we're really quite the rage
Oh how I lose my inhibitions when I move across the stage
We're the hottest ticket goin' what a fantasy flight
They tell me fifty thousand people come to see us every night

Rock 'n' roll to the rescue
Rock 'n' roll to the rescue
Rock to the rescue
I said it rescued me
And it'll rescue you

Gotta get a ticket cause I really gotta go
There's a party goin' down at the rock 'n' roll show
Baby get ready if you really wanna go
Now everybody's goin' to the rock 'n' roll show
Need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad

So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad

Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so bad

[Verse 1]
This is not novelty
This is nothing delicate
This is the result of some Google search for something relevant
Stake claim immediately
Cause hot products cool down
At which point will flot the new sounds
Take fame intravenously
But when nature turns to habit
I'll be sure to leave the scene and start stacking it
This is nothing fraudulent
This is that sure shot itchy finger lingering behind your target audience
You got em all convinced
But we ain't buying it buddy
Demand for lies is high
And you're supplying it
Truth is brutal and consumes you if you let it
Type that in your little away message and set it

[Hook]
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs for me
Man you're boring me, with your monotony
Keep singing songs for me
Just following the leader with your blah blah blah
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep

[Verse 2]
And this is not a fashion statement
It's elegant intuition
Far beyond your bed wetter kindergarten compositions
This is a part of me
How can you sleep at night
When what you don't bite you write half-heartedly
Go join the army
And be the best you can be
Give new meaning to blowing up overseas
Please
We kick them doors down when nobody would let us in
And give you that proverbial taste of your own medicine
We took your formula and relabeled it
And sat patiently and giggled it when you drank it
See poison street cred weigh just about the same reflesh
Pop bottles and dropped names
And you'll dismiss it cause it isn't what you're used to
But who the fuck died and made you King Koopa?

[Hook]
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs for me
Man you're boring me, with your monotony
Keep singing songs for me
Just following the leader with your blah blah blah
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep

[Verse 3]
Wow congratulations on your new purchase
I heard you bought a crib on biters block downtown plagiarism's paradise
You're not a movement
You're purely amusement
The poster boy for Xerox and the role model for parasites
You serve no purpose
You're purely decorative
And bore use to death with your auditory sedatives
Oh they don't see
No, we don't sleep
And hog tie your runaway bride with cold feet
We built this city on lock and load logic
And burned it down the same night
So go ahead and put your tears on ice baby
I think we got a winner
And kiss your crucifix your boy's a certified sinner

[Hook]
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Keep singing songs for me
Man you're boring me, with your monotony
Keep singing songs for me
Just following the leader with your blah blah blah
Keep singing songs for me
That I can write in my sleep like I'm counting sheep
Lazy lightning
That sleepy fire in your eyes
Is that desire in disguise
I keep on trying but I
I can't get through

Lazy lightning
I'd like to find the proper potion
To try to capture your emotion

[Alternative: To kind of capture your emotion]
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

You're a loop of lazy lightning
Just a loop of lazy lighting
Must admit you're kind of frightening
But you really get me high

So exciting
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to
So exciting

[Alternative: So inviting]
The way you're messing with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasing
Tell me a lie and I will swear
I will swear it's true

You're a loop of lazy lightning
Liquid loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening
You're a loop of lazy lightning

Rope of fire round my heart (lightning)
Rope of fire ever tightening
Rope of fire round my heart (tightening)

[Alternative: It's either lunacy or lightning]
Come on come on lazy lightning

You're a loop of lazy lightning

Lazy lightning
You say you never start the same place
I want a double dose in any case
I'd fly a kite if I thought
Thought that would do
Here's to lightning
Well you always electrify me
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightning will be
My lightning too

Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)

[Verse 1: Nathan & (Shawn)]
Been working hard every day (9 to 5)
I need a place to get away
(Where I can feel alive)
Seems like my drama, it won't ever cease
(I had to stay away)
Now it's time to find my inner peace
(I'm coming out to play)

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
This will be my night
I will get up on this floor
And lose what's left of my mind
Let the rhythm take control

[Chorus]
Step on up, let your body go
'Cause I know you wanna do it so
When you hear the groove
You've gotta know
That it's time to make your move
Just step on up now

[Verse 2: Nathan & (Shawn)]
This party's got me feeling right, yeah
(I found a place to unwind, oh yeah)
I'm thinking 'bout myself tonight
(Relax and ease your mind)
Ain't holdin' back, I'm gonna let it go, yeah yeah
(Throw all my cares away, yeah yeah)
Now I'll be sure to let my feelings flow
(I'm coming out to play)

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya]
This will be my night, yeah
I'ma get up on this floor
And lose the last of my mind
Let the rhythm take control

[Chorus]
Step on up, let your body go
'Cause I know you wanna do it so
When you hear the groove
You've gotta know
That it's time to make your move
Just step on up now
Step on up, let your body go
'Cause I know you wanna do it so
When you hear the groove
You've gotta know
That it's time to make your move
Just step on up now

[Bridge]
And you won't turn away
Gotta get on the floor
Let's go, before it's too late
Keep it movin' all night long

[Break]

[Chorus]
Step on up, let your body go
'Cause I know you wanna do it so
When you hear the groove
You've gotta know
That it's time to make your move
Just step on up now
Step on up, let your body go
'Cause I know you wanna do it so

'Cause I know you wanna do it so
When you hear the groove
You've gotta know
That it's time to make your move
Just step on up now
The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember in September in the rain
The Sun went out just like a dying amber
That September in the rain

To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play our sweet refrain
Though spring is here to me it's still September
That September in the rain

To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play our sweet refrain
Though spring is here to me it is still September
That September in the rain

That September that brought the pain
That September in the rain
Writer(s): Ahlert/Young

I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em

I'm gonna smile and say: "I hope you're feeling better"
And close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit (right) down and write myself a letter
(And make believe it came, though I know it's not the same)
And (I'll) make believe (that) it came from you

[Verse 1]
Every day he wakes up in his million dollar home
His life is like a video, the only reality he knows
He jumps inside of his hundred thousand dollar car
Cruising up the boulevard
Driving pass people living hard
Complains about the gas prices, but still supports the war
He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor
He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think it's genocide
That millions die from three lethal letters
So he does sh— to make it better
And I'm thinkin' new

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna touch the sky
And nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly
Everybody wants Heaven
If you don't wanna sacrifice
You don't say nothing
Don't say nothing

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, hush) Don't say nothing
(Ooh, hush) Don't say nothing

[Verse 2]
She watches television full of fabricated show
Thinks the world is just a joke, but oh, little does she know
That there's a real life drama happening right outside her door
'Cause she continues to ignore, but she's like the TV
The story repeats, yeah
She's searching through the channels
Skipping pass the news
She's more entertained by lies and gossip
'Cause it hurts to see the truth
She complains about the nation
Thinks it's a waste of time to vote
She says the world has been corrupted forever
No one tries to make it better
And I'm thinking who

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna touch the sky (Ooh)
And nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly (Scared to fly)
Everybody wants Heaven (Heaven)
If you don't wanna sacrifice (Oh)
Don't say nothing, no
Don't say nothing

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, hush)
Don't say nothing (Hand to your brother)
Ooh, hush (Hand to your sister)
(Don't say nothing)
(Ooh, hush) (Don't say nothing)
Ooh, hush (Don't say nothing)

[Outro]
Ooh, hush
Don't cry no more
Wipe away your tears
Don't cry no more baby
Wipe away your tears
And I know I know
That your love is real

Don't cry don't cry
I'm begging you
Don't cry no more baby
I'm begging you
Every tear you shed
Tells me that your love is real

Hey hey

You cried me a river
Cried me a sea
And I believe without a doubt
That you really really really love me
You cried me a river
Cried me a sea
And I believe without a doubt
That you really really really love me

Wipe away your tears
Don't cry no more baby
Wipe away your tears
I know I know that your love is real
Cry baby
Cry baby
It's crying time
And the loving ain't so easy
Oooh oooh
Don't want you to cry babe
Wipe away your tears
Wipe away your tears

Cried me a river
Cried me a sea
And I believe without a doubt
That you really really really really really really really love me
Cry no more baby
Wipe away your tears
Oh no oh no
And I believe
And I believe
And I believe without a doubt
That you really really really really love me

[Verse 1]
Don't worry 'bout me, I'll get along
Forget about me, just be happy my love
Let's say that our little show is over and so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way and still be friends?

[Verse 2]
Look out for yourself, that should be the rule
Give your heart and your love to whomever you love, darlin' don't be a fool
Why do we cling to this old faded thing that used to be?
So if you can forget, then don't worry about me

[Outro]
Why should we cling to some old faded thing that used to be?
So if you can forget, then you don't worry about me
Welcome back to the pipe...

(Intermittent noise, voices and clips of songs appear as the user of the radio flicks through stations
Twice some French is heard until finally a station is settled upon)

Oh, hello, thank you for tuning in
You're listening to 106.2, Breeze FM
Where we shoot the breeze, all day long
Up next we have a little treat for you
A few new songs from newcomer Mac DeMarco
So sit back and enjoy, ladies and gentlemen
And once again, thank you for tuning in
Ciao
(Chorus: 2x)
Don't grab my keys when the party's over
I drive better drunk, than you do sober

(Verse 1)
I don't know what you've been told
I've been drinkin since 12 years old
Started in 1988
Hangin at the liquor store real real late
I drunk a swallow, drunk a cup
Drunk the bottle, I threw up
Over the years, I learned to pace it
Get kinda tipsy, but not that wasted
I like beer, but I love malt liquor
Cuz malt liquor, get me drunk quicker
Stop on the freeway, take a whiz
Hop in my Cadillac and handle my biz
I drive better drunk than I do sober
Cuz when I'm sober, right
I think I can make through the, red light
(Go, go, go)
I hope I'm not dead right
But when I'm drunk, I know I can't
So I ain't, I drive like a saint
Drinkin is a class I did not flunk
I'm a Colt 45 certified drunk
(Chorus: 2x)

(Verse 2)
I dropped outta school in 9-0
Became the world's greatest wino
I drink at home, I drink at work
Ignore the boss, he just a jerk
I drink 12:00 in the day
Relax my nerve, serve my yay'
When my day go bad, I always drink
Calm down, relax and think
On weekdays, we like to clown
A 24-ounce 'fore the sun go down
On weekends, that's when it's cool
To drink a 40-ounce, and act a fool
Once I get into that zone
I leave that beer and that liquor alone
I can barely walk, I can barely talk
But I can glide that Cadillac like a hawk

(Chorus: 2x)

(Verse 3)
I ran from the cops in the rain
With my church shoes on
I drove from Palmdale, California to Compton
Drunk two 40-ounces, Old English 800, the club ended
All the homies left me in the parkin lot toe' back
Wasn't nobody out there but me and the sheriff department
Fell asleep on the 14
Woke up on the 405
Fell asleep on the 405
Woke up on the 105
Fell asleep on the 105
Woke up in bed
Call that, uh, autopilot
But don't try that at home; I got skills
I am to liquor, what the Crocodile Hunter is to alligators
"These crocs, they're not your ordinary crocs
"You gotta grab them in the mandible"
We can't find no hotels man (you know what I'm sayin)
So we might have to drive
All day, and all night
I got some music
So it's alright
(Repeat 4x)
All day, and all night
I got some music
It's alright

Make you feel good
Rollin through the hood
With your windows down
Checkin out your sounds
Just lend me a light
No stress and strive, baby
Well, I wish, I was a catfish
Swimmin' in the, the deep blue sea
I have all, all you pretty women
Fishin' after me
Fishin' after me
Fishin' after me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Well, I went down to my girlfriend's house
And I sat down alone on her front step
And she said a come in out of there
Her husband is not there
Just now left
Just now left
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My girl has found another and gone away
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom
So day after day, I stay locked up in my room
I know to you it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain
(Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
(Such a lovely day)
When everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I got to cry 'cause crying, ooh eases the pain, oh yeah
People this hurt I feel inside words could never explain
I just wish it would rain
(Oh, how I wish that it would rain)
Oh, let it rain, rain, rain, rain
(Oh, how I wish that it would rain)
Ooh baby, let it rain
(Let it rain)
Oh yeah, let it rain
Day in day out, my tears stained face
Pressed against the window pane
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
'Cause rain drops will hide my teardrops
And no one will ever know
That I'm crying, crying when I go outside
(Crying, crying, crying)
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain
Oh, I wish it would rain
(Oh, how I wish that it would rain)
Ooh baby, lt it rain, let it rain
(Let it rain, let it rain)
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
(Let it rain, let it rain)
Oh, let it rain, oh yeah, yeah
(Let it rain, let it rain)
Listen, I'm a man, I ain't got no pride
(Let it rain, let it rain)
Till it rains, I'm gonna stay inside
Let it rain
Let it rain

[Intro]
Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long

[Verse 1]
Before you get into the shower
Before you worry about your hair
Baby give me one more hour
I want you to stay right there
I dont wanna lose a moment
I dont wanna miss a kiss
If i could plan the perfect day, love
Then i would start it just like this

[Chorus]
Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long
Good morning morning
Good morning love
Before we start the day dear
Im whispering in your ear
Good morning

[Verse]
Now baby how can i convince you
I'll make it so you can't resist
Whatever else you have to do now
It can't be half as good as this
I'll chase you underneath the sheets, love
And i won't let you get away
The day won't be complete, love
Unless we get a chance to say

[Chorus]
Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long
Good morning morning
Good morning love
Before we start the day dear
Im whispering in your ear
Good morning

[Bridge]
Open your eyes
See my son rise
I feel you're skin
So warm inside
Day breaks so sweet
When you're next to me
So stay each night
So each morning will be

[Chorus]
Before We Start The Day Dear
Im Whispering in your ear
Let's get lost together
I will smile forever
Was morning
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes (whooo)
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou ah-whoo, ah-whoo, ah-whoo
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes

Well she walked in the shoe-store, picked out a shoe
She tried on a twelve, but that wouldn't do

Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou bought a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou ah-whoo, ah-whoo, ah-whoo
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes

Well, she cracked up over the solid fit
Walkin' down the street with her brand new kit

Well, she's walkin' down the street, she met an undertaker
He tried to burry her new shudebakers
Well, she went to a rock 'n' roll party the other night
Someone stepped on her shudebakers and she started a fight!

Well, she walked in the shoe-store, gave the man a tip
She told him to go buy himself a rocketship

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman, Boyz II Men]
Back in school
We used to dream about this every day

Or do dreams just fade away?
Then we started singing
And they said it sounded smooth
And we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you, oh, oh

Rappin' hype and we can get down
We are ready to roll
So now the world will know that we flow

Hear my voice, where you are, take a train, steal a car

Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me

Catch a flame, catch a breeze, on your hand, on your knees

Swim up high, only please come on back to me

On a mule, in a jet, with your hair in a net

In a shower wet, I don抰 care

This is where you should be, from the hills to the shore

By the wind to my door, raise the highway dust

Break the law if you must, throw the world, only just

Come back to me

Musical interlude
Blast your hide, you recall, must I fight City hall

Here and now, damn it all, come on back to me

Where on earth must I be, still I yell till I抦 blue

In control then when you come on back to me

Have you gone to the moon, or the corner saloon

And to crack and to croon, madamselle, where in hell can you be?

In a crate, in a trunk, on a horse, on a junk

In a road or a van, wrapped in mink or saran

Anyway that you can, came back to me

Come back to me, come back to me, come back

Come back to me, me!
I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the gray skies to blue
If I had you

I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life anew
If I had you

I could climb a snow-capped mountain
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side

I could be a king, dear, on crown
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothin' I couldn't do
If I had you

I could climb a snow-capped mountain
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burnin' desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king on crown
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do
If I had you
Baby, if I had you
MC: From Hollywood, the Armed Forces Radio Service presents Personal Album
Today we bring you The Voice, the voice of Frank Sinatra assisted by Axel Stordahl
And the orchestra. Now here's Frank

Frank:
The charm of you is comparable to a Christmas tree with toys
With little girls and boys when first they see the tree
The thrill of you is comparable the thrill I felt when I first learned the heart could sigh
And you were the reason why, and yet, and yet if we two have never met
I'd know your grace that warms a face that only the angels get, and
So comparing you with all of these things, is all that I can do
Because they add up to the charm of you
(musical interlude)
So comparing you with all of these things, is all that I can do
Because they add up to the charm of you
Now, when I call her by her name
You know she don't come
She don't leave me down easy, jell but I don't
I called him in a steady ??
But I don't have ?? because you know she don't

Alright, I'm alright
I'm a three time loser
But I'm alright
Alright, I'm alright
I'm a three time loser
But I'm alright

Oh, it's so high, so defensive
It's ??, I swear this gal
You know she's gonna be the death of me
Well, she holds me in my heart
And then she ?? bread, but I
You know, she’s sucking out the breath of me

Alright, I'm alright
I'm a three time loser
But I'm alright
Alright, I'm alright
I'm a three time loser
But I'm alright
Alright, I'm alright
I'm a three time loser
But I'm alright

[Verse 1]
Samuel, I'm sorry that he sunk
His teeth into your back
I'm sure we'll find it too
Breathe out, so we can slow down
All the bleeding from your skin
And no one will die
No one will die

[Chorus]
No one will die, no one will die
No one will die, no one will die
No one will die, no one will die
No one will die, no one will die
No one will die, no one will die

[Verse 2]
Samantha, I'm sorry that your brakes
Went out along a hill
I know your leg's been scarred
Stand still and let me rub
This alcohol on your legs
And then you won't cry
No one will cry

[Chorus]
No one will cry, no one will cry
No one will cry, no one will cry
No one will cry, no one will cry
No one will cry, no one will cry

[Chorus: Frank Sinatra, Chorus]
I love those J-I-N-G-L-E bells
Oh, those holiday J-I-N-G-L-E bells
Oh, those happy J-I-N-G-L-E
B-E-double-L S
I love those J-I-N-G-L-E bells
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

[Verse: Frank Sinatra, Chorus]
Dashing through the snow (Rudolph)
In a one horse open sleigh (Today)
O'er the fields we go (Rudolph)
Laughing all the way (Today)
Bells on bob-tail ring
Makin' our spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighin' song tonight

[Interlude: Chorus]
Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

[Chorus: Frank Sinatra, Chorus, Both]
Jingle bells, jing-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
I love those J-I-N-G-L-E bells
Oh, those holiday J-I-N-G-L-E bells
Oh, those happy J-I-N-G-L-E
B-E-double-L S
I love those jingle bells all the way! (Jingle all the way!)
Day in-day out
The same old voodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart
Whenever I think of you and darling, I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out-day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain-come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love? Can there be any doubt
When there it is, day in-day out?
I'm nobody's someone
'Cause nobody loves me
And each night I sleep
The pain is so deep
Your memory haunts me
If millions of eyes
Could just realize
The shadow is me
The shadow is me
I'm everyone's no one
'Cause nobody likes me
Each hour of the day
I reach and I pray
That someone will reach me
If millions of eyes
Could just realize
The shadow is me
The shadow is me
The shadow is me
I'm nobody's someone
'Cause nobody loves me
And each night I sleep
The pain is so deep
Your memory haunts me
If millions of eyes
Could just realize
The shadow is me
The shadow is me
The shadow is me
The shadow is me
Two brothers on their way
Two brothers on their way
Two brothers on their way
'Twas on a pleasant summers day

On a pleasant summers day
When they marched along their way
A fife and drum began to play
There on a beautiful morning

One was gentle, one was kind
One was gentle, one was kind
One came home, one stayed behind
A cannonball don't pay no mind

A cannonball don't pay no mind
If you're gentle or you're kind
It don't think of the folks behind
There on a beautiful morning

Two girls waiting by the railroad track
Two girls waiting by the railroad track
For their darlings to come back
One wore blue and one wore black
One wore blue and one wore black
Waiting by the railroad track
For their darlings to come back
There on a beautiful morning
Uhm, so this next song is about love, appropriately

I love you like kings love queens
Like a gay geneticist loves designer genes
I need you like New Orleans needs a drought
Like Hitler's father needed to learn to pull out

And I want you, yeah
Like a lawyer-slash-mathematician wants some kind of proof
And I want you, yeah
Like JFK wanted
A car with a roof

Because love is taking that dive
Then getting really comfortable and peeing in the pool
And love is a real-life porn
Minus all the stuff that makes porn cool

And love is a homeless guy, searching for treasure in the middle of the rain and
Finding a bag of gold coins and slowly finding out they're all filled with chocolate and
Even though he's heart broken, he can't complain cause he was hungry in the first place
Because I love you like Dora loves maps
Like the Pope's toilet loves holy craps. (Just's a little one.)
I need you like a voyeur needs a branch
Like boys tossing salad need a little bit of Neverland Ranch

And I want you, yeah
Like all the gothic kids that look exactly the same never want to conform
And I want you like Anne Frank wanted
Nobody to read her fucking diary
Cause a diary is a collection of secret things that no one's supposed to read, that's the whole point of a diary. Millions of people that breached this little girl's privacy after she was chased by Nazis; kick her while she's down

And if we met in 10,000 BC
I was your caveman, you's my cavelady

If we got hot, we'd start rubbing
If we got hungry, we'd go clubbing
There's woolly mammoths, but I will protect us
You're making me devolve to a homo erectus, mothafucker

And if we met in 1780
I was a white southern aristocratic plantation owner and you were my dark-skinned servant lady...slave
Whenever I could get away from the missus
I go to your shed and then I'd steal you kisses
But let's be serious, I'd still work you full-time as a slave, there's a difference between romantic language and a complete disregard for socio-economic trends

And if we met in 1941
I was a Nazi, you's a Gypsy on the run (That's a little redundant)
That... probably wouldn't have worked out
Because...
Love is your favorite food for every breakfast, lunch, and dinner
And love is the Holocaust, 'cept you don't die quick and you don't get thinner
And love is being the owner of the company that makes rape whistles
And even though you started the company with good intentions trying to reduce the rate of rape
Now you don't want to reduce it at all cause if the rape rate declines, you'll see an equal decline in whistle sales
Without rapists, who's gonna buy your whistles?

Yeah, love is all about...
Whistles. Thank you

[Talking to Audience]
Uh, that one was a bit vulgar, but uh, you know, dicks and vaginas are sorta like Coke and Pepsi, you know? Ah, I strongly prefer one, but my dad thinks they taste the same
You were my sunshine, my only sunshine
You made me happy when skies were blue

You'll never know, dear, how much I loved you
How could you take my sunshine away?
What makes a man go crazy when a woman wears her dress so tight
What makes a man go crazy when a woman wears that ol' dress so tight
Must be the same ol' thing that make a tom cat fight all night
Now, why do all the big men try to run a big-legged woman down
Now, why do all the big men try to run a big ol' woman down
Must be the same ol' thing that makes a bulldog a huggling 'round
It's that ol' same thing, now tell me who's to blame
The whole world is fighting about that ol' same thing
What make you feel so good when your baby's in her evening gown
When your baby get a little bit of an evening gown
Must be that same ol' thing that makes a preacher lay his bible down
It's that ol' same thing, it's that ol' same thing

[Verse 1]
Let us worship Christ our Savior
Let us worship Christ our Savior
Let us worship Him
Let us worship Him
Let us worship Christ, our Lord

[Verse 2]
Let us worship Christ our Savior
Let us worship Christ our Savior
Let us worship Him
Let us worship Him
Let us worship Christ, our Lord

[Outro]
All the earth should praise Him
Let us bow down before Him
Let us enter into His gates with thanksgiving
Come before His courts with praise
Let us honor and adore Him
Let us exalt Him for His goodness
For His love and kindness
And for His tender mercy
I will, I will, I will, I will worship Christ the Lord
I will worship Christ
I will worship Christ the Lord
I will worship You
I adore Your name
Lord, You're worthy
I worship Christ the Lord
When I first saw you standing there, you set my heart a-reeling
Baby, you gave me such a feeling
My heart cries timber, timber, timber, timber
Timber baby cause I'm a-fallin' for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, it happens ev'ry time I look in your eyes
Baby, it's paradise
My heart cries timber, timber, timber, timber
Timber baby cause I'm a-fallin' for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, I wish that you were mine to be forever and ever
Without you darling I just can't sleep
I'm only happy when we're together

I guess it's time that I told you so
I'll always want to hold you
Baby, have I ever told you
My heart cries timber, timber, timber, timber
Timber baby cause I'm a-fallin' for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I wish that you were mine to be forever and ever
Without you darling I just can't sleep
I'm only happy when we're together

I guess it's time that I told you so
I'll always want to hold you
Baby, have I ever told you
My heart cries timber, timber, timber, timber
Timber baby cause I'm a-fallin' for you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Timber baby cause I'm a-fallin' for you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Timber baby cause I'm a-fallin' for you

[Chorus]
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins, and losers weep
Reflection will show this connection
We can lean on each other
This is all we need to know

[Verse 1]
Well, I admit I've been a fool sometimes
I believe I may be losing you
It's now or never, we talk before a tear is shed
Under your spell and over my head
You took me in your arms, and you told me
We don't need to worry
But you, you never say your sorry

Keep this love alive for us, it's all I feel
How can we survive if we change what is real

[Chorus]
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins, and losers weep
Reflection will show this connection
We can lean on each other
This is all we need to know

[Verse 2]
I see the angel and the devil in your heart
I confess, either one is my addiction
And where you're leading me
I don't have the will to fight
Out of the darkness and into the light
But living in your arms, I can take it
Please don't make me shiver
I know together we deliver

Let the gods decide who finds the sweetest thrill
Who can justify the truth, God, I love you still

[Chorus]
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins, and losers weep
Deception will show
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know

[Verse 3]
Don't let him get too close to you
You've got a stranger on your mind
The dream is free
I know I'm only human if I cry
Or maybe we should kiss and say goodbye

[Chorus] (x2)
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins, and losers weep
Deception will show
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection
This is all we need to know
I gave you something for nothing my love
This apparition of living your lie
I had the power but you stole control my love
I need you close to me I can't deny
It's your night world
Places I've never known
All of the wonders lay before me
I pray this heaven never stops

It's your night world
Things are revealed to me
And all the arms cannot hold you
I will see your face in the morning sunrise
Hear your crying every lonely winter long
I need your body and sould to get me through
Holding me over you

So don't tell me that I came one love too late
No other women would I place so high above
I'll that the little that I get in return for
My eternal love
When you're lonely do you cry baby cry
What do they give you when the dream is not enough
This is the hour and the candles are burning
My eternal love, my eternal love
I get to watch you when the moon is full
Time to love you when the others are gone
Though what I follow may be fictional
I need to be with you or I may die
In your night world
Doors that are open wide
Then can make my promise to you
You will hear my voice in the mountain thunder
Feel me loving you across the universe
And when the pieces are whole
There's me and you, you and me eternally

I may be broken but I try baby try
Whatever gets you are the things that I must do
I'd like to hit you with a little of my
Eternal love for you
I will be with you when my sweet baby cries
You let me give you what the dream is worthy of
This is the hour and the candles are burning
My eternal love, my eternal love
My eternal love

I'll take the little that I get in return for
My eternal love
I may be lonely but I'll try baby try
You let me give you what the dream is worthy of
This is the hour and the candles are burning
My eternal love
I will be with you when you cry baby cry
You let me give you what the dream is worthy of
I'll take the little that I get in return for
My eternal love

[Intro: Michael McCary]
Turn off the lights on your way over here
Come here
Take your clothes off, slowly
I wanna enjoy each layer peeled from your body
Shh, don't say a word, just lay back

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris, Wanya Morris, Boyz II Men]
Close your eyes, and tell me what dreams run through your head
(Of you and me, me and you)
I've got some of my own that I want to share
Here in our bed
Don't say a word, 'cause like a rocket on the rise
I'm ready to explode
(Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one)
Take control of my love, and feel the passion
'Cause I will do anything, girl, you need, only ask it, baby

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
I wanna make love to you
Holding you all night long
I wanna make love to you
And I will not let go 'til you tell me to
(Never let you go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I wanna make love to you
Holding you all night long
(Holding you all night long, yeah)
I wanna make love to you
And I will not let go 'til you tell me to

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman, Boyz II Men]
Girl, relax
(Let me near your body so I can do what pleases you)
I wanna concentrate on you, that's all I wanna do
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
It's gonna be a long night
Throw your clothes on the floor (On the floor)
'Cause I took mine off at the door
So hit the lights, baby, and explore
Girl, when you ask me what time, you don't have to ask anymore

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
I wanna make love to you
Holding you all night long (Long)
I wanna make love to you
And I will not let go 'til you tell me to
I wanna make love to you
Holding you all night long
(Holding you all night long)
I wanna make love to you
And I will not let go

[Bridge: Wanya Morris]
Baby, tonight (Girl, it's so right)
Know I'll do you right
Just make a wish (Just make a wish)
And you don't have to ask me
I'll give you the love of your life, woo

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
I wanna make love to you (Wanna make love)
Holding you all night long
(Wanna hold you, wanna hold you all night long)
I wanna make love to you
And I will not let go 'til you tell me to
(I'll make love)
I wanna make love to you
Holding you all night long
(I'll make love)
I wanna make love to you
And I will not let go 'til you tell me to

[Outro: Wanya Morris, Boyz II Men]
(I wanna make)
I wanna make love, love, la-la-la-love, love
(I wanna make) Love to you
Mama said, "Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John"
Come the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn

Take me back to another morning, to a time so long ago
Where the sweet magnolia blossomed, cotton fields are white as snow

Catfish John was a river hobo who lived and died by the river's bed
Looking back, I still remember, I was proud to be his friend

Mama said, "Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John"
Come the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn

[Instrumental break]

Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg, traded for a chestnut mare
Lord, he never spoke in anger, though his load was hard to bear
Mama said, "Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John"
Come the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn

Mama said, "Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John"
Come the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn

That sounds cool
And when the time comes round
We will be duty bound
To tell the truth of what we've seen
And what we haven't found
Will not be going down
Despite too easy ride to see

From a lover to a friend
Take your own advice
Let me love again
Now that you turned out to be
Someone I can trust
Someone I believe

Ohh la la la
How can I walk when I can't find a way
I have a dilemma
All I want is to tell me
You're going to take it away

From a lover to a friend
Take your own advice
Let me love again
Now that you turned out to be
Someone I can trust
Someone I believe
And what we haven't found
Will not be going down
Despite too easy ride to see

From a lover to a friend
You turned out to be
Someone I believe

From a lover to a friend
Take your own advice
Let me love again

Ohh la la la
How can I walk when I can't find a way
I have a dilemma
All I want is to tell me
You're going to take it away

From a lover to a friend
From a lover to a friend
From a lover to a friend
Let me love again
If I had a nickel, I know what I would do
I'd spend it all for candy and I'd give it all to you
I'd spend it all for candy and give it all to you
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you, baby
If you were a picture, I'd hang you up on the wall
Sit back where I could see you and I'd never move at all
Sit back where I could see you, never move at all
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you, baby

If you were a kitten, with pretty glossy fur
I'd take you up and stroke you, listen to you purr
I'd take you up and stroke you, listen to you purr
Mmmm, that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you, dear
And if you were a tiger, I'd hang around your den
And pester you, my honey, until you let me in
And pester you, my honey, till you let me in
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you, baby
Baby, if you were horse fly and I an old gray mare
I'd stand and let you bite me, and I'd never move a hair
I'd stand and let you bite me, never move a hair
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you, baby
If you want to marry, now let me tell you what
We'll go and find a parson, and I'd let him tie the knot
We'll go and find a parson, and let him tie the knot
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby
That's how much I love you, dear

When I say you I love you, honey child, I leans on you a little bit
Autumn and Friday the winds blew
July, September, I knew you
And now I sit on the sand hill
I sing our song to the sea

August, October
Mid-April, November, May
Beckoning hands made you fly
I cry, it's curtains today

In August, October the grass grew
The sky was blue and I want you
Now as I look out my window
I see the world carry on

August, October
Mid-April, November, May
Beckoning hands made you fly
I cry, it's curtains today

August, October
Mid-April, November, May
Beckoning hands made you fly
I cry, it's curtains today
Announcer:
"Lady's and gentlemen, The Jimi Hendrix Experience."

Jimi:
"I see that we meet again hmmm. yeah well, well, well. Dig dig, I'd like to get something strait, we ummm we got tired of the experience, and every once in a while we're blowing our minds too much, so we decided to change everything around. And a call it 'gypsy sons and rianbows' for short nothin' but a band of gypsies. We have Billy Cox playin' bass, and um from Nashville Tennessee we have Lary Lee playin' guitar over there. We got juma playin' congos over there, juma, and we have granny Goose, oh I'm sorry Mitch Mitchell on drums over there, and we got Jerry Velez on Congos too. you got yours truly on Pete Whistle. What me worry? Gives us about a minute and a half to tune up ok. Like we only had about two rehearsals so a we'll only do a primary rhythm thing. (someone in the background) I have mine thank you
I have mine thank you, baby."
I hear them telling me that you're selling off the furniture
And even keep my personalized autographs
You might as well go all the way and sell your granny to the zoo
And while you're at it, may I go to my psychiatrist?
He's making money out of making me laugh
But I don't mind, I wish that I could say the same about you
It seems to me that you've still got no values
Oh you know you're not so hot, no values
And I'll be glad if you went away again
No values... no values... no values at all

The city shark is at the dark and of the alleyway
You pays your money and you takes your choice
The artful dodger says he wants to pick a pocket or two
But you, you've taken up a place in high society
A personal friend of Messrs Rolls and Royce
Got them all convinced that everything you say to them is true

It seems to me that you've still got no values
Oh you know you're not so hot, no values
You know you've got a lot, but no values
And I'd be glad if you went away again
No values... no values... no values at all

I like your wife's smile, I like her car
If I had your lifestyle, I wouldn't go far wrong
On the waters of life you row your boat
Into the strongest tide that you can find
On the darkest of nights we were two of a kind
We went through it all before the tide went out
And left us stranded on the shore
How was I to know
How was I to know

Well you ain't got no values
You know you think you're hot, no values
You know you've got a lot, but no values
And I'd be glad if you went away again
No values... no values... no values at all

[Verse 1]
Everybody's building the big ships and the boats
Some are building monuments, and some are jotting down notes
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy

[Chorus]
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

[Verse 2]
Now I like to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet
But guarding fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat
Everybody's just standing around 'neath the trees
Feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, all the pigeons gonna run to him

[Chorus]
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Have you do like I want you to, I can't decide in my heart
Tell me where to put it and I'll tell you who to call
Nobody can get no sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze

[Chorus]
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Everybody tell me, come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Hey, don't worry, I've been lied to
I've been here many times before
Girl, don't you worry, I know where I stand
I don't need this love, I don't need your hand
I know I could turn, blink, and you'd be gone
Then I must be prepared any time to carry on

But minute by minute by minute by minute
I keep holding on
Oh, minute by minute by minute by minute
I keep holding on

You will stay just to watch me, darlin'
Wilt away on lies from you
Can't stop the habit of livin' on the run
Take it all for granted like you're the only one
Livin' on my own somehow that sounds nice
You think I'm your fool well, you may just be right

'Cause minute by minute by minute by minute
I keep holding on
Oh, minute by minute by minute by minute
I keep holding on, I keep holding on, oh
Call my name and I'll be gone
You'll reach out and I won't be there
Just my luck you'll realize
You should spend your life with someone
You could spend your life with someone

Minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on
Oh, minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on

Minute by minute by minute by minute
I'll be holding on
Oh, minute by minute by minute by minute
I don't need anybody . I don't need anyone
Take it nice and easy mama , chicken on the run and I don't care
I'd show my body anywhere
Ain't no big city winner's gonna pass my buck anywhere
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care

Go down to the courthouse and I've been on display
Don't you think that I don't know
It ain't been a perfect day , but I don't care
I'd sell my body anywhere
In the name of creation , I can't find an explanation anywhere
Ain't no easy rider gonna settle my luck and I don't care

Down , down the road , up the road
Down , down the road , up the road

Been rejuvenated to the highest degree
Ain't no words describing what this feeling's done to me and I don't care
I'd show my feelings anywhere
Ain't no heavy Mister Leather's gonna paddle my butt anywhere
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care
Down , down the road , up the road
Down , down the road , up the road

Down, down the road , up the road
Down, down the road , up the road
Down, down the road , up the road
Down, down the road , up the road
Down, down the road , up the road

[Verse 1]
My love, she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
But she's true like ice, like fire

[Verse 2]
People carry roses
Make promises by the hours
My love laughs like the flowers Valentines can't buy her

[Verse 3]
In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall

[Verse 4]
Some speak of the future
My love, she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all

[Verse 5]
The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge

[Verse 6]
Statues made of matchsticks crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge

[Verse 7]
The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers' nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring

[Chorus]
The wind howls like a hammer
The night goes rainy
My love, she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing

[Verse 8]
My love, she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
To all the gifts that wise men bring

[Chorus]
The wind howls like a hammer
The night goes rainy
My love, she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing
I'm dreaming of a White Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten, and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a White Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas's be white

I'm dreaming of a White Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas's be white
Quiet nights 'n quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together
Reflections in the water like shadows in my mind
Speak to me of passing days and nights and passing time
The falling leaves are whispering, ?Winter?s on it?s way?
I close my eyes, remembering the warmth of yesterday

It seems a shame to see September swallowed by the wind
And more than that, it?s, oh, so sad to see the summer end
And though the changing colors are a lovely thing to see
If it were mine to make the change, I think I?d let it be
But I don't remember hearing anybody asking me
When I step on the scene (scene)
Y'all know me (me)
Cause I walk with a limp
Like an old school pimp
A real OG
I'm rockin' Vans (Vans)
I'm in the sand (sand)
I got a Red Bull and Vodka up in my hand
Hey! You look kinda cute (ey)
In that polka dot bikini girl
Hey! This what I wanna do (What?)
Take off that polka dot bikini girl
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in LA trick!
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in LA trick!
Everybody on smash (smash)
Hands in the air (air)
I'm feeling on the ass
Like a nigga don't care (Like a nigga don't care!)
I got a plan
What's your cell?
We're playing Naked Twister back at my hotel
Hey! You look kinda cute (ey)
In that polka dot bikini girl
Here's what I wanna do (What?)
Take off that polka dot bikini
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in LA trick
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in LA trick!
Get your hands up (Hollywood)
Whip that ass up (Hollywood)
Get your hands up (I'm in LA trick)
Whi-whip that ass up (Hollywood)
Getcha Getcha Get Getcha hands up
Whip that whip that whip whip that ass up
Getcha Getcha Get Getcha hands up
Whi-whi-whip whip whip that ass up
Getcha Getcha hands up
Whi-whi-whi-whip that ass up

I'm in LA Trick!
Damn... I'm mothaf*ckin thirsty or somethin'
Yeahh
It's morning time (shh)
And the girls' still there
They're lying naked with some **** in the air
(That's what I'm talkin' bout)
And I won't sit back
She's got some big cojones
But I say I be back
Time to get some Bossanovas
Hey! You look kinda cute (ey)
In that polka dot bikini girl
Hey! This what I wanna do (What?)
Take off that polka dot bikini girl
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in LA trick
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in LA trick!

[Spoken: Mary J. Blige as Justice]
That stage is a pedestal
And when you're up there
You're untouchable
And when you're up there
You can have it...

[Chorus]
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

[Verse 1]
Take Destiny!
She loves to laugh
She loves to sing
She does everything
And Saphire...
She loves to move
She loves to groove
She loves the lovin' things

[Bridge]
Oh, all night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight, hold tight
Oh, baby, hold tight
When it comes to the customer...

[Chorus]
She said: "Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it"
She said: "Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it"

[Verse 2]
I was alone, I never knew
What good love could do
Ooh, then we touched
Then we sang, about the lovin' things
Hold on, hold on, hold on!
Oh!

[Chorus]
She said: "Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it" (Anyway)
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said: "Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it" (Anyway)

[Julianne Hough as Sherrie]
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Anyway!
Any way you want it

[Chorus]
Oh, she said
"Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it"
Someone said, drink the water, but I will drink the wine
Someone said, take a poor man, rich don't have a dime
So fool yourselves if you will, I just haven't got the time
If you can drink the water, I will drink the wine
Someone gave me some small flowers, I held them in my hand
I looked at them for several hours, I didn't understand
So fool yourselves if you will, you can hold out your hand
I'll give back your flowers, and I will take the land
And I will drink the wine
Sometimes I'm very very lonely, there's only me to care
And when I'm very very lonely, I want someone to share
I'm going to drink the wine, I'm gonna take my time
And believe in a world that is mine
Someone gave me flowers, held them in my hand
Looked at them for many hours, didn't understand
Go on and fool yourselves if you will, you can hold out your hand
I'll give back your flowers, and I will take the land
And I will drink the wine, and I will take the l
I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova
I could walk like Brando right into the sun and dance just like a Casanova
With my blackjack and jacket and my hair slicked sweet
Silver studs on my duds just like a Harley in heat
When I strut down the street I could hear its heartbeat
The sisters fell back and said, "Don't that man look pretty"
The cripple on the corner cried out, "Penny, nickels for your pity"
Them gasoline boys downtown, they sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city

I was a king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash
I was a prince of the paupers, crowned downtown at the Beggars' Bash
I was a pimp's main prophet, I kept everything cool
Just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground, mama
Devil appeared to me like Jesus through the steam in the street
And showed me a hand that even the cops couldn't beat
And I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat
It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy out on the street
And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
As the tracks clack out the rhythm, the eyes fixed straight ahead
They ride the line of balancing, hold on by just a thread
Well, it's too hot in these tunnels, you can get hit up by the heat
When you get up to get out at your next stop, but they push you back down in your seat
And your heart starts beating faster as you struggle to your feet
Then you're out of that hole, back on the street
And them southside sisters, they sure look pretty
And the cripple on the corner cries out, "Nickels for your pity"
And them downtown boys, they sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city
Take hold of that star I give to you
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you

I'd give you the moon or the sun
Or the starlights with a love so true
And if it rains, I'll give you a rainbow too

Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you

I'd give you the moon or the sun
Or the starlights with a love so true
And if it rains, I'll give you a rainbow too

Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you
La la la... as I love you
I got to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around
And I
Get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you
Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain
When will we meet again
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
This world may end
Not you and I
My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you
And that cannot be reversed
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me
Out of my mind
I am held by the power of you love
Tell me when do we try
Or should we say goodbye?
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
Oh
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
My love for you, ooh
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Baby just stay with me a little longer
Baby I'll guarantee the feeling stronger
You don't know what you do to me
I wanna be inside you baby
Baby just stay with me a little longer
Baby I'll guarantee we'll get it on
Read my mind and I know you'll find
I wanna be inside you baby

There ain't nothing but love inside you girl
And I wish that you knew what goes on inside of me baby
Stay with me a little longer
Baby I'll guarantee we'll get it on
All I know is what you do to me
I wanna be inside you baby

There ain't nothing but love inside you girl
And I wish that you knew what goes on inside of me
Baby just stay with me a little longer
Baby I'll guarantee the feeling stronger
You don't know what you do to me
I wanna be inside you baby
Baby just stay with me a little longer
Baby I'll guarantee we'll get it on
There ain't nothing but love inside you girl
And I wish that you knew what goes on inside of me baby

Baby just stay with me a little longer
Baby I'll guarantee the feeling stronger
You don't know what you do to me
I wanna be inside you baby
Temper is a package pulling at its bow
Darling, disasters help you grow
Panthers build their blood to bury
Daughters leave their dads to marry

Hide in the weeds
The orchestra
Is proving death again

Temper is the warp speed of red flashes
And all the bells ringing God forbid, God forbid
Did I catch you in the flashes?
Did I catch you in the flashes?

Hide with me in the weeds
I'm proving death
Alive in the weeds
The orchestra
Is proving death
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby please don't go

When the man done gone
When the man done gone
When the man done gone down to the county farm
He got the shackles on
Baby, please don't go
Don't leave me

I'll be a dog
I'll be a dog, woah
I'll be a dog kiss your way down there
When you walk along
Baby, please don't go

Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby, please don't go
No baby, please don't leave me
Why must you go away and do this to me, baby
I wanna suffer for you, suffer, suffer
Oh baby, please don't go
No!

Baby, baby, baby, please don't go, please don't go
Don't go and leave me, please don't go
Baby, humm
Baby, ahah
Oh don't go, no don't go
Oh don't go, no don't go
Ah don't go, don't go so slow
Oh don't go, no don't go

Why must you leave me lying on my back
Going across left side of the track
Found yourself a new man I know
So baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go

No no no no
Oh please, please don't leave me
I don't want to be left alone baby
Ah don't go, don't go, don't go
No!

[KRS]
Yo, my man, how bad do you want it?
You know how many cats I threw the pitch, and they never caught it?
I told them to bring they lyric, but they never brought it
Scared to get ripped off, cheated, deleted, rejected and shorted?
Yo, how bad do you want it?
FearóI ain't got no time for it
If you want it, yo there's the trackóput your rhyme on it!

[Peedo]
This hunger inside of me's unexplainable, Kris
The struggle we put in this box will be put into disc
Birth and ever, these family problems is hurtin'
Both of my sisters is pregnant, fuckin' feel like murkin'
All I have is my word and my balls
And my fam and my music speaks for them all
It's the Dominican animal ready to damage, you puttin'
Pressure to rappers that think they can challenge you, Kris (uh huh)
We been through it all, the grimiest days, this earth ain't
Ready for my brain, comin' to face (word)
Everyone plus everyone
Do you hear me, KRS-One?

[KRS]
Well listen
You grimy and hungry?
But how long you gonn' trust me?
You really down for this cause or just chasin' the money?
I be up in them spots to be hot, so dusty and ugly
Nothin' be funny, it's all dark, nothin' sunny
Can you walk with me? Talk with me? Pop the cork with me?
When we in other cities, will you rep New York with me? (yeah!)
I need respect and honor
Discipline and no drama
How bad you want it, poppa? (with all my…)

[Peedo]
Loyalty is the key to it all (remember)
Get used to my face, we the winners of all
By mi gente, yo I go low to say-ah
Real like them Washington Heights
Niggas there (say yeah!)

[KRS]
After you rap, will you stab my back? (never)
You gimme a track, will you take that back? (never)
I give the word, yo you bustin' your Gatt? (whatever)
Respect from your crew? They livin' like that? (they better)
This is no game! Why should I make you popular?
You know I'm the philosopha
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you need it?
If you see it, you can believe it, perceive it, retrieve it and flaunt it
How bad do you want, doggone it, there's the track, if you want it
You got to put your rhyme on it!

[Peedo]
How bad do I want it? I'm ready to die like Big
A serious man with blood in my eyes for this
Success doesn't come overnight
It's gonna be dark a while until I see light (that's right!)
What is it?

[KRS]
This is no game, why should I do it?
KRS-One, me and Peedo runnin' through it
I saw you down the street in FedEx
You said you had the beats was comin', like "I Got Next"
So we went upstairs, my man Choco hooked it up
This is KRS-Oneóturn my voice up! Whaó (wha-,wha-)
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you see it?
How bad do you hear it?
How bad do you BELIEVE you can be it?
If you doubt, then you're out
If you believe, you can achieve
I got the city on lock, but I'm gonna hand you the Keys like Alicia
You know my style, you know I'm the teacha
Philosopha, minister, emcee, Hiphop's spiritual leader
With the heater
You comin' with me? You runnin' with me?
In the spirit Scott LaRock, JMJ and Pun is with me
Yo, cats be steppin' to me ALL the time
With the rawest rhyme
But two weeks later, they fall to crime
If you listenin' to this song, and you want to be put on
You must be loyal to the cats that made you strong
It could be your friend, your father, you sister, your mother, your brother
Or some other
Just remember the days when YOU was under!
Before the Hummer, before the Benz
Before the hundreds, before the fifties, the twenties and tens
When you was thirsty, remember the living water, and who poured it
Now ask yourself, how bad do you want it?
Well, Jesus gave me water
(Gave me water, gave me water)
Well, Jesus gave me water
(Gave me water, gave me water)

Jesus gave me water, Lord
(Gave me water, gave me water)
And it was not from the well

There was a woman from Samaria
Came to get some water
There she met a stranger, Lord
Who did a story tell
Yes, the woman dropped her pitcher
She drink and was made richer
From the water, Lord
Was not from the well

Hey, Jesus gave me water

Jesus gave me water, Lord
(Gave me water, gave me water)
And it was not from the well

Hey, so on that woman, He had pity
She ran back to the city
Crying, "Glory, Hallelujah"
And did His wonders tell
Yeah, she left my Savior singing
And she came back to Him bringing
Yeah, the water, Lord
That was not from the well

Hey, Jesus
(Gave me water, gave me water)
Well, Jesus gave me water
(Gave me water, gave me water)

Hey, Jesus gave me water
(Gave me water, gave me water)
Lord, I wanna let His praises swell

Hey, Jesus gave me water
(Gave me water, gave me water)
Oh, Jesus gave me water
(Gave me water, gave me water)

Well, Jesus gave me water
(Gave me water, gave me water)
Lord, it was not from the well

Yes, that woman left a shouting
There was no room for doubting
That she had met a Savior
Who did her wonders tell
Yes, every time she doubted Lord
She started to think about Him
The man that gave her water, Lord
And it was not from the well

Hey, Jesus
(Gave me water)
Hey, Jesus
(Gave me water)

Hey, Jesus
(Gave me water)
Oh, Lord
(Gave me water)

Jesus gave me water
(Gave me water, gave me water)
I wanna let His praises swell

Yeah, Jesus
(Gave me water)
Yeah
(Gave me water)
Jesus gave me water
(Gave me water, gave me water)

Well Jesus gave me water, Lord
(Gave me water, gave me water)
And it was not from the well

Hey, Jesus gave me water
(Gave me water, gave me water)
Well, Jesus gave me water
(Gave me water, gave me water)

Jesus gave me water, Lord
(Gave me water, gave me water)
Let His praises swell

Yeah, Jesus gave me water
(Gave me water, gave me water)
Hey, Jesus gave me water
(Gave me water, gave me water)

Well, Jesus gave me water, Lord
(Gave me water, gave me water)
And it was not from the well

[Intro]
RedOne
Gaga

[Verse 1]
I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys?
I lost my phone

[Pre-Chorus]
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool
What's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright

[Chorus]
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Spin that record, babe
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just j-j-just dance

[Verse 2]
Wish I could shut my playboy mouth
How'd I turn my shirt inside out?
Control your poison, babe
Roses have thorns, they say
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool
What's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, alright

[Chorus]
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Spin that record, babe
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just j-j-just dance

[Verse 1]
These are my twisted words
Went off the roof still walking
I know I should not look down
But I'm so sick of just talking

[Verse 2]
When are you coming back?
I just can't handle it
When are you coming back?
I just can't handle it

[Outro]
When are you coming back?
I just can't stand it
I just can't handle it
My silent prayer is the love we knew
If it should reach all of the heart of you
I'll offer the heart you had manage to break
I'll offer the love that forgave your mistake

Deep in my heart you still belong to me
I only know I'll never, never be free
Please don't consider the love a closed episode
The love that we knew comes to few
For my silent love is for you and only for you

[Verse 1]
We got a break, unbelievable
We got a break right in the middle of this Hollywood heartache
We got this solid love
All around the town, good hearts are going under
Love bandits con and plunder
Let nobody put asunder this solid love

[Verse 2]
We got a chance, hot dog darlin'
We got a chance, no more, no more fly-by-night romance
We got this solid love
Love has always made me feel so uneasy
I couldn't relax and just be me
More like some strange disease than this solid love

[Chorus]
Tested and blessed, darlin'
I'm gonna give you my very best
You're my hope, you're my happiness
You open my heart, you do
You open my heart, you do, yes, you do

[Verse 1]
We got a break, unbelievable
We got a break right in the middle of this Hollywood heartache
We got this solid love
All around the town, good hearts are going under
Love bandits con and plunder
Let nobody put asunder this solid love

[Verse 2]
We got a chance, hot dog darlin'
We got a chance, no more, no more fly-by-night romance
We got this solid love
Love has always made me feel so uneasy
I couldn't relax and just be me
More like some strange disease than this solid love

[Chorus]
Tested and blessed, darlin'
I'm gonna give you my very best
You are my happiness
You open my heart up, you do
I went down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
Down to the crossroads
Fell down on my knees
I said I'm beggin' for mercy won't you take me
If you please

I went down to the crossroads
Tried to beg a ride
I went down to the crossroads
Tried to beg a ride
Nobody seemed to know me
Everybody passed me by
Take a ride

Going down toward Rosedale
Took Loretta by my side
Going down to Rosedale
Took Loretta by my side
Can still buy a house there
On the riverside
One more time
You can run, you can run
Tell all my friends I'll be by
You can run, you can run
Tell my friends I'll be by
And I'll be stayin' in the crossroads
I believe I'm sinkin' down

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Riding with a head full of buckets of red
And when they said still stuck in the head
A thoroughbred thoroughly bled
And led to the land of the mental combats
Following a front attack so you can never run from that

Dark planetary signs rising over the horizon
Smaller than a fly stand, I'm a lyrical lamp
The power that I got on my cynical hand
With a pen, once again

Swimming in the center of the hit or the miss
A list of the thoughts getting lost in the mist
Realizing one not the size of the fist
And the killing of the killer with a flick of the wrist

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I lived for them
(Still see it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
The second it's gone
The weapon of time is stronger than a nuclear bomb
Eternity-you have not- Something that math can't write, you can't fight nor flee
Still be around if it wasn't for me

Way back first whatever my friends
That you see the attraction of the payback
Don't mean to say that, playback the thing now
Getting lost in the chaos tossing it down

Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Set this to the tempo to be on time
An addict to the panic of my confine

Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Set this to the tempo to be on time
An addict to the panic in my confine

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I lived for them
(Still see it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds

Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds
Soon, the Aztec moon will heat my room, heal my wounds

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I lived for them
(Still see it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Outro: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
Burn! Burn! Burn!
Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic in my confine

Singing again to myself, electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
An addict to the panic of my confine
Woo
Thaaa
Thaaa

Always in trouble
Never to blame
Must be a double
You are the same
Here it comes again

Doing the wrong thing
Forgetting your li..ines
Waiting for something better to shine
Take that same okay

After today, fortune man will find you
After today, they will find you working
After today, you'll find the ones you're after
After today, look out, after today

What kind of rescue?
What will you be?
Where can you take it, baby boy? For me
Break that heart for me
After today, the fortune fan will find you
After today, they will fly you away
After today, you'll find the one you're after
After today, look out, after today

After today, the fortune fan will find you
After today, they will fly you away
After today, you'll find the one you're after
After today, look out, after today

Today

After toda-ay, hey
Look out, after today
Ah, yeah
Look, ah (laughter)
(spoken : I was gettin' in to that)
(laughter)
Got a good reason for taking the easy way out
Got a good reason for taking the easy way out now
She was a day tripper, one way ticket yeah
It took me so long to find out, and I found out
She's a big teaser, she took me half the way there
She's a big teaser, she took me half the way there now
She was a day tripper, one way ticket yeah
It took me so long to find out, and I found out
Tried to please her, she only played one night stands
Tried to please her, she only played one night stands now
She was a day tripper, Sunday driver yeah
It took me so long to find out, and I found out
Say tripper, day tripper yeah

[Verse 1]
I remember the first time, you laughed with me
And I remember the promises, you would never leave my side
Now I'm standing with the news of a tragedy
Standing here with a fragile heart, mmm
You see I never shed a tear
I stayed strong for them, oh yes I did
When everybody disappears
It's only you that kept me strong
And I can't imagine going on
Without you in my life
Going on with a fragile heart

[Chorus]
When I think about, think about life
Lord I think of you
I forget about everything else
There's only you and I
And I can't think about ever giving up
Can't give up a fight (no..no..)
The only thing that matters Lord, is you

[Verse 2]
I ain't got no time to pretend
That I'm not missing you, oh no no no no
I know you're in good hands
The same hands that hold my heart
And I'll cherish every moment we spent
As a gift from God above
For he takes care of all the fragile hearts

[Chorus]
When I think about, think about life
Lord I think of you, and I
Forget about everything else
There's only you lord and I
I can't think about ever, ever giving up
(a fight)
Lord the only thing that matters
When I'm going through
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you

[Bridge]
You see my fragile heart's been broken
And you're the only one
Who can put it all together again
So I'm trusting you Lord to see me through

[Chorus]
There's only you and I
I can't think about ever giving
I can't give up(up a fight)
The only thing that matters
When I'm going through
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you

[Outro]
When I think about my life
I, I, I, I forget about everything else
Only you and I, and I can't think about ever giving up
Can't give up, can't give up
For the only thing that matters...
I hear you callin', "Here I come baby"
To save you, oh oh
Baby no more stallin'
These hands have been longing to touch you baby
And now that you've come around, to seein' it my way
You won't regret it baby, and you surely won't forget it baby
It's unbelieveable how your body's calling for me
I can just hear it callin' callin' for me
My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you
Tell me, what's your desire
Baby your wish is my deal oh yes it is baby
Let me take you higher
Show you how you should feel, baby
Oh So we speak now and forever hold your body
Whatever it is you want from me, baby
You see you don't have to say nothing
Knowing your body wants something
And it's easy for me to see
That your body's callin' for me
My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you
I'm listening baby
I hear you callin' me
I'm listening baby
I hear you callin' me
I'm listening baby
I hear you callin' me
I'm listening baby
I hear you callin' me
My body's callin' for you
I hear you callin' me
My body's callin' for you
I hear you callin' me
My body's callin' for you
I hear you callin' me
My body's callin' for you
Don't you ever be afraid to go home
Don't ever be afraid to go home
When you've hitched your wagon to a fast falling star
And the last string is broken on your lovesick guitar
Whatever you're doing and wherever you are
Don't ever be afraid, don't ever be afraid to go home

I used to be afraid to go home
But one day, I was made to go home
Now I was almost certain they would lock the door on me
'Cause I'm that sour apple on my old family tree
But folks who really love me made me welcome as could be
Don't ever be afraid, don't ever be afraid to go home

I used to be afraid to go home
But one day, I was made to go home
Now I was almost certain they would lock the door on me
'Cause I'm the sour apple on my old family tree
But the folks who really love me made me welcome as could be
Don't ever be afraid, don't you ever be afraid
Don't ever be afraid to go home
And nobody's falling in love
Everybody here needs a shove
And nobody's getting any touch
Everybody thinks that it means too much
And nobody's coming undone
Everybody here's afraid of fun
And nobody's getting any play
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A

And nobody's falling in love
Everybody here needs a shove
And nobody's getting any touch
Everybody thinks that it means too much
And nobody's coming undone
Everybody here's afraid of fun
And nobody's getting any play
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A

And nobody's falling in love
Everybody here needs a shove
And nobody's getting any touch
Everybody thinks that it means too much
And nobody's coming undone
Everybody here's afraid of fun
And nobody's getting any play
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A
It's the saddest night out in the U.S.A

[Intro]
Baby, I've just been sitting here thinking
How blessed I am to have someone like you in my life
And I'm so excited, so so excited about
Being with you for the rest of my life
Listen

[Verse 1]
Looking at all this land
Damn, I use to be a lonely man
Could never understand
Why I had no one to take my hand
But then the weather changed
Mother Nature brought the sun my way
Now girl, you're who I am and I am you for the rest of my days

[Chorus]
How the sun comes up in the early morning time
Girl, I vow to be forever loving you, rain or shine
How the moon takes on this so romantic glow
I'll be lovin' you forever more, oh, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Now, I used to think that I would never have a serious relationship
Always praying for that one to come along and give me what I miss
But now those thoughts are no more, ever since you came into my life
It's like Heaven opened up its doors, showered down on me the perfect wife, oh oh

[Chorus]
How the sun comes up in the early morning time
Girl, I vow to be forever loving you, rain or shine
How the moon takes on this so romantic glow
I'll be lovin' you forever more, oh yeah oh yeah

[Bridge]
Baby, now our house (our house) is a home
(The cars) we own
(What's mine) is yours
(The keys to the doors) Oh yeah
(My family) My family, (and friends) my friends
(The church) we belong (together), Heaven drum sing
(Our house) is a home
(The cars) we own
(What's mine) is yours
(The keys to the doors)
(My family) My family, (and friends) my friends
(The church) we belong (together) standing strong..

[Chorus]
How the sun comes up in the early morning time
Girl, I vow to be forever loving you, rain or shine
How the moon takes on this so romantic glow
I'll be lovin' you forever more
How the sun comes up in the early morning time
Girl, I vow to be forever loving you, rain or shine
How the moon takes on this so romantic glow
I'll be lovin' you forever more
How the sun comes up in the early morning time
Girl, I vow to be forever loving you, rain or shine
How the moon takes on this so romantic glow
I'll be lovin' you forever more
How the sun comes up in the early morning time
Girl, I vow to be forever loving you, rain or shine
How the moon takes on this so romantic glow
I'll be lovin' you forever more...

[Verse 1: Eddie Kendricks]
What's so good about goodbye?
All it does is make you cry
Well, if leavin' causes grievin'
And to part can break your heart

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks + The Temptations]
Tell me what's so good about it
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?

[Verse 2: Eddie Kendricks]
Since you say goodbye to me
All I've known is misery
Well, if everything goes wrong when lovers stay so long

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks + The Temptations]
Tell me what's so good about it
I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?

[Verse 3: Eddie Kendricks]
Won't somebody tell me now
How can goodbye be good to a lover who really cares
And another thing I would like to clarify
Is how can farewell be fair
So won't you please (please) please tell me why
You would have the nerve to say this is goodbye
Well, if everything goes wrong, you never say so long

[Chorus: Eddie Kendricks + The Temptations]
Tell me what's so good about it
Lord, I could have done without it
What's so good about goodbye?
Baby, baby
What's so good about goodbye?
What's so good about it?
What's so good about it?
Since we can no longer make it, girl
I found a new place to live my life
It's really no place at all

Just a hole in the wall, you see
It's cold and dusty but I let it be
Livin' here without you
On Second Avenue

And since our stars took different paths
I guess I won't be shavin' in your looking glass
Guess my old friendly grin
Must have started to dim, somehow

And I certainly don't need it now
Still, I keep smiling through
On Second Avenue
I can still see you standing

There on the third-floor landing
The day you visited we hardly said a word
Outside it was rainin'
You said you couldn't be stayin
And you went back to your flowers and your birds
Since we can no longer see the light
The way we did when we kissed that night
Then all the things that we felt

Must eventually melt and fade
Like the frost on my window pane
Where I wrote, "I. M. U." (I Miss You)
On Second Avenue
I look forward to
That day when
The show will stop
Will stop
Stop renewing itself

When the most mundane
The most pedestrian show
Will cause and instill such boredom
BOOM

The time when all forms
Of expressions of life
Will be so
Destitute of substance
BANG

Then life will become
So intolerable that perhaps
Our senses will wake up
WOOAY!
We're going through the impatient years
The years when the day seems twice as long
Restless and sighing and laughing and crying
And dreaming a dream people say is wrong

But we'll journey through the impatient years
To each other's arms where we belong
Clinging together, I'm certain we'll weather
The warm and stormy gay and impatient years

But we'll journey through the impatient years
To each other's arms where we belong
Clinging together, I'm certain we'll weather
The warm and stormy gay and impatient years

[Chorus]
Freedom for the stallion
Freedom for the mare and her colt
Freedom for the baby child
Who has not grown old enough to vote

[Verse 1]
Lord, have mercy, what You gonna do
About the people who are praying to You?
They got men making laws that destroy other men
They make money, God, it's a doggone sin
Oh Lord, You got to help us find a way

Big ships sailing
Slaves all chained and bound
Headed for a brand new land
That some cat says he up and found

Lord, have mercy, what You gonna do
About the people who are praying to You?
They got men making laws that destroy other men
To make money, God, it's a doggone sin
Oh Lord, You got to help us find a way, yeah

[Chorus]
Freedom for the stallion
Freedom for the mare and her colt
Freedom for the baby child
Who has not grown old enough to vote

[Verse 2]
Lord, have mercy, what You gonna do
About the people who are praying to You?
You know if I could look inside Your mind
I'd bring back all the truth I find
Oh Lord, You gotta help us find a way

[Chorus]
Freedom for the stallion
Freedom for the mare and her colt
Freedom for the baby child
Who has not grown old enough to vote

[Verse 1]
When I wake up in the morning
There's something on my mind
And suddenly without warning
Somebody's standing behind

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's you, babe
And it's you, babe

[Chorus]
If I were the sky
I could look down onto you
That one day, if you join me
Every sky will be blue
Every day with you

[Verse 2]
You know I still think you own me
I dream every night that you do
So what is it that's making me lonely
I've known all along what it is

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's you, babe
And it's you, babe

[Chorus]
If I were the sky
I could look down onto you
That one day, if you join me
Every sky will be blue
Every day with you
If I were the sky
I could look down onto you
That one day, if you join me
Every sky will be blue
Every day with you, with you
With you

[Verse 1]
It takes a real good woman to know how to love a good man
It takes some hugging and kissing, but most of all some understanding
And I've got all of the hugging and kissing and understanding I want

[Chorus]
That's why I'm crazy 'bout my baby
Crazy about my baby
Mad about my baby
And I know for sure she crazy 'bout me

[Verse 2]
Now you can talk about your real fine chicks, say they're nice and sweet as they can be
But I've got a woman suits me to a T
Now she may not look like Venus, she's good enough for me

[Chorus]
And I'm crazy 'bout my baby
Crazy about my baby
Wild about my baby
And it's plain to see she crazy 'bout me

[Verse 3]
Now me and my baby, yeah, yeah, we're doing all right
We love one another, vow to treat each other right
Now I've got enough woman to last me for the rest of my life

[Chorus]
I'm crazy 'bout my baby
Mad about my baby
Wild about my baby
So wild about my baby
And I know for sure she crazy 'bout me
I'm crazy 'bout my baby
I'm crazy 'bout my baby
What makes the sunset?
What makes the moonrise?
What makes the tide remember to hide and why does it soon rise?
What makes a star fall?
Where does it fall to?
Why does its flight make us stop in the night and wish as we all do?

And what holds a cloud together?
What makes the sky so blue?

What makes the sunset?
What makes the moonrise?
Is it my love for you?

Instrumental

And what holds a cloud together?
And what makes the sky so blue?

What makes the sunset?
What makes the moonrise?
Is it my love for you?
His wisdom, his art surpassed all expectancies, and yet
Reality is dual, walking with good and evil

Two poles guiding his step
Two poles guiding his step

Good is the one that can weave all together
Our passions, impulsions, into city laws
Evil sets in when man thinks he is sole judge
Only him can think right, no one else be just

His wisdom, his art surpassed all expectancies, and yet
Reality is dual, walking with good and evil

Two poles guiding his step
Two poles guiding his step

Good is the one that can weave all together
Our passions, impulsions, into city laws
Evil sets in when man thinks he is sole judge
Only him can think right, no one else be just
You're always in a great big hurry, grab a kiss and off you scurry
Off to there, and there to who knows where
I'd give the world and all creation for a little conversation
Just a word or two, how are things, what's new?
Please talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Your magical kiss can take me just so far
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Don't leave me like this, dangling from a star
You set me all aflame and it's so pleasin'
It would be a shame if you were only teasin'
So, my love, before I go, turn the light way down low
And talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Temperatures rising
And Your body's yearnin' for me
Girl, lay it on me
I place no one above thee
Oh, take me to your ecstasy

It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready)
Girl are you ready
To go all the way?
It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready)
Girl, are you ready
To go all the way?

I can smell your perfume
Step into my bedroom
Let me love you constantly
Oh,oh, your body is my playground
Let me lick you up and down
Make you feel like a woman should

It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready)
Girl, are you ready
To go all the way?
It seems like you're ready (seems like you're ready)
Girl, are you ready
To go all the way?

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Harlem Boys Choir]
Throw your hands up high
'Til they reach the sky

[Chorus: Harlem Boys Choir]
Throw your hands up high
'Til they reach the sky

[Instrumental]

[Outro: Mos Def (w/ Harlem Boys Choir)]
Red, white, blue, black (Throw your hands up)
Calm down, move back
Motherfuckers askin' "who is that?"
You know it's the almighty Black Jack
Mos Def, K. West
Ghetto people get this shit off ya chest
North to the south, to the east, to the west
Black Jack Johnson, it's no contest
(High) And show it to 'em like
(God has my fortune laid away)
Oh, the world is full of people with money just to burn
Affording all the things in life for which a man might yearn
Some can take life easy but I live from day by day
God has my fortune laid away
I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain
The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame
Pockets that stay empty dreams that go astray
God has my fortune laid away
(God has my fortune laid away, laid away)
Oh, how often I have wondered why some things have to be
Some people live in riches while some live just like me
The more I try to work and save the more I have to pay
But God has my fortune laid away
(Laid away)
I search for sunshine
I've been alive forever, and I sang the very first song
I put the words and the melodies together, I am music and I sing this song:
I sing the songs that make the whole world sing
I sing the songs of love and special things
I sing the songs that make the young girls cry
I sing the songs, I sing the songs
My home is deep within you, and I've got my own place in your soul
Now when I look out through your eyes
I am young again even though I'm growing old
I sing the songs that make the whole world sing
I sing the songs of love and special things
I sing the songs that make the young girls cry
I sing the songs, I sing the songs
My music makes you dance, it gets your spirit to take a chance
And if the music's from the heart, it's a real fine way to start
It's from me, it's to you, it's from you, it's to me
It's a world-wide symphony
I sing the songs that make the whole world sing
I sing the songs of love and special things
I sing the songs that make the young girls cry
I sing the songs, I sing the songs
I sing, and the whole world sings
I sing the songs of love and special things
I sing the songs that make the young girls cry
I sing the songs, I sing the songs. I am music, and I sing the songs

[Intro: Boyz II Men]
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris & Boyz II Men]
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman & Boyz II Men]
From God, our Heavenly Father
A blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

[Verse 3: Wanya Morris & Boyz II Men]
Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Mama, take this badge off of me, I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark, too dark for me to see
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

Mama, put my guns in the ground, I can't shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
She's just a baby, a baby
But she's my lady
My lover, my only friend

She's just a baby
But maybe she'll understand
That I am made of a true love
That will never end (Hey, hey)

People don't understand what she sees in an older man
They never stop 2 think that maybe I'm what she's lookin' 4
They never take the time 2 look into her mind
They just keep on sayin' she's just a baby
But maybe one day they will see
She's not such a baby, no baby is she
She's just in love with me

She's just a baby, a baby
But she's my lady
I know there are some things she'll never see
She's just a baby
But maybe one day she'll see
Although she's young
She's the only one that can bring out the man in me
Can't U see? Yeah

People don't understand what she sees in this lonely man
Don't they know that everybody needs somebody sometime? Oh
I give her all I can
But the people don't give a damn
They just keep on sayin' that she's just a baby
But maybe one day they will see
She's not such a baby, no baby is she
She's just in love with me
Oh no, no, no, yeah
Try to remember the kind of September
When life was slow and oh so mellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green and grain was yellow

Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a tender and callow fellow
Try to remember and if you remember then follow
Follow

Try to remember when life was so tender
When no-one wept except the willow
Try to remember when life was so tender
When dreams were kept beside your pillow

Try to remember when life was so tender
When love was an ember about to billow
Try to remember and if you remember then follow
Follow

Deep in December it's nice to remember
Although you know the snow will follow
Deep in December it's nice to remember
Without a hurt the heart will hollow
Deep in December it's nice to remember
The fire of September that made you mellow
Deep in December our hearts should remember and follow
Follow

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he stepped to the bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over, and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack on Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hick'ry just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 5]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Outro]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on
Don't throw bouquets at me, don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much, people will say we're in love
Don't sigh and gaze at me, your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine, people will say we're in love
Don't start collecting things, give me my rose and my glove
Sweetheart, they're suspecting things, people will say we're in love
Don't praise my charm to much, don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me, people will say we're in love
Don't take my arm too much, don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine, people will say we're in love
Don't dance all night with me, till the stars fade out of sight
They'll see it's alright with me, people will say we're in love
I know how I feel
Lonely in the black of night
There can be no love for me now
Nobody listens when the words ain't right
And you get into someone else
It's hard for me to know
Who's lovin' who
And where do I stand
What did I do it all for
There's no one I could love more
I did it for your heart alone
All that I try to be growin' inside to me
I can be strong if you're there

And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
I live in a world where the face of an angel is all that a fool can see
You got the power to find me whenever I'm lost
Where are you? Who are we?

I believe in time
Can eat away a heart of stone
And baby if I leave you too late
It's just a feather and the bird has flown
It's colder when the fire dies
With all the trouble I'm in if I lose you too
Then what is my life
If I don't wanna go through
Anything without you
Couldn't be life at all
I could be lyin' on
You are the only one
We didn't make it by chance
And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
I'm caught in a world on the edge of tomorrow
It's all that a fool can find
I don't belong in the arms of a love that is lost
Nowhere to cry
There must be something we can say my love
Something except goodbye

Then what is my life
If I don't wanna go through
Anything without you
Couldn't be life at all
I could be lyin' on
You are the only one
We didn't make it by chance

And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
Winter Lady, where you going
With your hair all soft and loose like snowing
Winter girl, December child
Don't run away

Winter Lady, walking sadly
Does your lover treat you badly
Do you dream or wish on stars
To hear him say

"Oh Winter Lady I won't hurt you
I won't cheat you, I won't desert you
Winter Lady you need loving
I need loving too
I need loving you"

Staring out your winter window
At a silver sky you know you've been to
In a kiss, upon a day
Bfore a spring
Winter Lady, cry those crystal tears
He won't know what he's missing
Love's too late, you've changed your mind
And it's my turn to sing

Oh Winter Lady I won't hurt you
I won't cheat you, I won't desert you
Winter Lady you need loving
I need loving too
I need loving you
Mary was an only child
Nobody held her, nobody smiled
She was born in a trailer, wretched and poor
And she shone like a gem in a five and dime store

Mary had no friends at all
Just famous faces pinned to the wall
All of them watched her, none of them saw
That she shone like a gem in a five and dime store

And if you watch the stars at night
And find them shining equally bright
You might have seen Jesus and not have known what you saw
Who would notice a gem in a five and dime store?
You're so right for what's wrong in my life
You're as right as rain; how can I explain?
You just fill every void in my life
Oh, so right for what's wrong

Fingers reaching; searching for the touch
Of love's first meeting. something tells me that
You're right for what's wrong in my life
You're as right as rain; how can I explain?
You just fill all the need in my heart
Oh, so right for what's wrong

You've changed my world into a shangri-la
Without a single word, I knew that you
Would right every wrong in my life
Through the darkness of night
You're my one shining light
You're so right for what's wrong
Well, I think I'm goin' out of my head
Yes, I think I'm goin' out of my head over you, over you

I want you, want you to want me, I need you so badly
I can't think of anything but you

Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head, day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right
I must think of a way into your heart
There's no reason why my being so shy should keep us apart

And I think I'm goin' out of my head
'cause I can't explain the tears that I shed over you, over you

I see you each morning, but you just walk by me
You don't even know that I exist

Goin' out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head, day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right, day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right, day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right
When I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
When I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
You just left your home then, woman
Ah, the sweetest thing I'd ever seen

But you wouldn't do nothing, baby
You wouldn't do anything I asked to
You wouldn't do nothing for me, baby
You wouldn't do anything I asked to
You know you ran away from your home, baby
And now you wanna run away from old B. too

You know I loved you, baby
I loved you before I could call your name
You know I loved you, baby
Baby I loved you, I love you before I could call your name
Well, it seems like everything I do now baby
Everything I do is in vain

My brother's in Korea, baby
My sister's down in New Orleans
Brother's in Korea baby
My sister's down in New Orleans
You know I'm having so much trouble woman
Baby, I wonder, what in the world is gonna happen to me
You know I love you
And I'll do anything you tell me to
You know I love you
And I'll do anything you tell me to
Well, there ain't nothing in the world, woman
Babe, it ain't nothing
Nothing in the world I wouldn't do it for you

You can treat me mean, baby
But I'll keep on loving you just the same
You can treat me mean baby
But I'll keep on loving you just the same
But one of these days, baby
You're gonna give a lot of money
To hear someone call my name

Yes, sweet sixteen baby... sweet sixteen...
Yes, the sweetest thing baby
The sweetest thing I ever seen
You know I'm having so much trouble, woman
Baby I wonder
Yes I wonder
Baby I wonder
Oh, I wonder what in the world's gonna happen to me

[Verse 1]
Lazy bones and no concern
Sees forty one mosquitoes flying in formation
I'm alright, but my pet cockroach died of starvation
Sleep 'till late, I won't mind if we do nothing today
Come and stay, bring your friends
Who needs floor space anyway?
So do you not want me to come over?
So do you not want me to come over?

[Chorus]
Not much we know, so off we go
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh

[Verse 2]
The other side of the land, they like my brain
They don't waste time and they don't wait
And do what they want
As long as I don't have to concentrate
Broken drums, thriving dreams
Not much else between these walls
One more spliff, I am already gone but duty calls
So do you not want me to come over?
So do you not want me to come over?

[Chorus]
Not much we know, so off we go
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh

(Allen Collins - Ronnie VanZant)

I asked the wiseman one sunny day
Can you help me find my way
You're so much older and wiser too
Would you help me mr wiseman
I'm feelin' blue
Oh I'm not satisfied

He said you're not doin too bad, not bad at all
You're just trying to walk son before you can crawl
You got stacks of money to sky up above
Now all you need is to find you a love

He sent me searchin' to find my love
He sent me searchin' to the Lord up above
He sent me searchin' just to find the mornin' dove
And she'll tell you where to find your love
Oh mr wiseman I need to find my love

You can have anything in this god's world
But you won't be happy son 'til you find a girl
Now you can be happy boy if you try
Find a woman boy, you'll be satisfied
He sent me searchin' to find my love
He sent me searchin' , I said Lord up above
He sent me searchin' just to find the mornin' dove
And she'll tell you where to find your love

He sent me searchin' to find my love
He sent me searchin' , I said Lord up above
He sent me searchin' just to find the mornin' dove
And she'll tell you where to find your love

Oh Lord, he sent me searchin'
Put your arms around me like a circle round the sun
I wanna love you moma like my easy rider done

You don't believe I love you, look what a fool I've been
You don't believe I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in
Stealin', stealin', pretty moma don't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my same old used to be

The woman I love she's just my height and size
A married girl, come to see me some time

You don't believe I love you, look what a fool I've been
You don't believe I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in
Stealin', stealin', pretty moma don't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my same old used to be

Well I'm going up North, gonna see my girl
Sweetest thing in the whole wide world

You don't believe I love you, look what a fool I've been
You don't believe I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in
Stealin', stealin', pretty moma don't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my same old used to be
Stealin', stealin', pretty moma don't you tell on me
I'm stealin' back to my same old used to be
I got a bad sensation
The enemy is all around
The traces of my naked heart
Are laid upon the ground
I suffered side effects
That might have been forever
Even in my dreams
And i was left alone to pray
When there was no one in the way
And nothin' what it seemed

And from a hard time, play time
Took a trip around the world
Made myself invisible
The taste was in the wine
And just when the thought of someone
Needing me forever
I don't believe the words are true
That only she could be my savior

Experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
She said experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
And she's all alone with me
Every night
And lighting all my days of sorrow
On my own
If there was any more to give
You know i'd sacrifice it for her

And in the prime of my life
I was blessed and i was sent
Someone sweet and innocent
And nervous when she kissed
And in the face of my
Forbidden fruit forever
Miracles are mine
And knowing i'm the first
In her secret universe
There's no sense of space and time

You take a small town, young girl
Someone warm and wonderful
That any man would understand
That love is like the wind
Something deep inside to give you
And when the words get in the way
The only thing you need is silence
Experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
She said experience is not enough
I'll show you how to fall in love
Well, I was feeling, feeling so bad
So I asked my family doctor just what I had
I said, "Doctor, Doctor, Mister M.D
Can you tell me, what's ailing me?"

And he said "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah"
All you need, all you really need:
Is good lovin'

Because you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Yeah, you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
A little lovin' now baby, good lovin'

Come on baby, now squeeze me tight
Don't you want your ever-lovin' daddy to feel alright?
I said now baby baby, that's for sure
I've got the fever, and you got the cure

And then she said
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need:
Good lovin'
Because you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Yeah, you got to have lovin' (good lovin')
A little good lovin' now baby, good lovin'

[Instrumental break]

Come on baby, now squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy to feel alright?
I said now baby baby, that's for sure
I've got the fever, and you got the cure

She said
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All you need, all you really need:
Good lovin'

Because you got to have lovin' (Good lovin')
Now you got to have lovin' (good lovin')
A little good lovin' now baby, good lovin'

Good, good, good, good, good lovin'
Good, good, good, good, good lovin'
Good, good, good, good, good lovin'

Lullabye and good night
In your dreams I'll hold you tight
Lullabye and good night
'Till the dawn's early light

Pillows lying on your bed
Oh my darling rest your head
Sand man will be coming soon
Singing you a slumber tune

Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Let's dance
Let's dance

Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
If you should fall
Into my arms
Tremble like a flower
Let's dance
Let's dance

Let's dance
Let's dance
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all

Let's sway
You could look into my eyes
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight

And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song we're playing
Let's sway
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, the serious moonlight

Let's dance
Let's
Let's
Let's
Let's sway
Let's

Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's sway
Let's sway
Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Yeah, yo
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady, something empty's within 'em
We say "Yeah", with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear (yeah)

Waiting for the end to come, wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned, it's out of my control
Flying at the speed of light, thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid, it's hard to let you go

I know what it takes to move on, I know how it feels to lie
All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room, trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last, I wish it wasn't so
I know what it takes to move on, I know how it feels to lie
All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Yo, yeah
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
I'm trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, picking up the pieces now, where to begin?
The hardest part of ending is starting again!

All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
(I'm holding on to what I haven't got)
But you listen to the tone and the violet rhythm
Though the words sound steady, something empty's within 'em

We say "Yeah", with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
(Holding on to what I haven't got)
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear
Well, its eight o'clock in Boise, Idaho
I'll find my limo driver
Mister, take us to the show
I done made some plans for later on tonight
I'll find a little queen
And I know I can treat her right

What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same

Back at the hotel, lord we got such a mess
It seems that one of the crew
Had a go with one of the guests, oh yes
Well, the police said we can't drink in the bar, What a shame
Won't you come upstairs girl
And have a drink of champagne

What's your name, little girl
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
For there ain't no shame
What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same

What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same

Nine o'clock the next day
And I'm ready to go
I got six hundred miles to ride
To do one more show, oh no
Can I get you a taxi home
It sure was grand
When I come back here next year
I wanna see you again

What was your name, little girl
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Well there ain't no shame

What was your name, little girl
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same

[Verse 1]
I'm never really sure where to go or what to do
All I really know is that I've got you
Every time I wake, I focus on the world I see
When I see it's you, I hope it's not a dream

[Chorus]
Every morning now
I wake up smiling
But I still haven't figured out
It's still a mystery

[Verse 2]
I washed up on the shore shaking and confused
I tempered all my thoughts of a less view of you
The stars are out tonight, everything is at it seems
And when I see it's you, I hope it's not a dream

[Chorus]
Every morning now I wake up smiling
But I still haven't figured out
It's still a mystery

[Instrumental Break]
You think you're so way out
And you got all the action
Still you can't find no satisfaction
Baby - try me, and I'll make you see

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
Ah ah, at all

You like to kiss and run
And that's where it is
'Cause somebody told you
Love was heartaches and tears
Baby, although you're free
I'll make you see

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Oh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
You ain't livin' at all
To be in love, I know it's not your ambition
But before you go, think about my proposition
You may conquer the world and be king on a throne
But you still ain't nobody, baby
When you're sittin' all alone

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all

You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't livin' at all
Call your ass up on the phone
Your momma tells me U ain't home
What the hell's wrong with U
U must think that I'm a fool
U gotta be crazy 4 playin' with my mind
I could kill U anytime

[Chorus:]
One way or another, girl
I'm gonna make U mine
I'm gonna thrill U or kill U
I'm walkin' the line
One way or another girl
I'm gonna make U mine
I'm gonna thrill U or kill U
I'm walkin' the line

Took U out 2 eat one night
U ate up everything in sight
Heaven knows I wanted 2 fight
When all I got was a kiss goodnight
Ooh, what a kisser
Your face could stop a clock
But I still love U, baby
I still wanna bust your clock
Hey, hey!

[Chorus 2x]
There is nothing I can do if you leave me here to cry
There is nothing I can do if you leave me here to cry
'Cause my love will follow you as the years go passing by

I'll give you all I own, that's one thing you can't deny
I'll give you all I own, that's one thing you can't deny
But my love will follow you as the years go passing by

I'm gonna leave it up to you, so long, so long, goodbye
I'm gonna leave it up to you, so long, farewell, goodbye
You know my love will follow you as the years go passing by

Yes, my love will follow you as the years go passing by
I found true love
One worth me waiting for
I found true love
One worth me waiting for
I'm gonna sign her to a contract
And won't find one with flaws

It's hard to believe
The condition the world is in
It's hard to believe
The condition the world is in
You can't trust nobody
Girl you know it's a sin

It's hard to believe
The condition the world is in
It's hard to believe
The condition the world is in
You can't trust nobody
Girl you know it's a sin
I found true love
One worth me waiting for
I found true love
One worth me waiting for
I'm gonna sign her to a contract
And won't find one with flaws
Aha, shake
Taper jean girl with a motel face
Aha, shake
Bury your eyes in a secret place
Aha, shake
Black as night on a summer day

Cunts watch their bodies
No room for make up
I think he's tasted
Tasted the watcher

Heartbreak
Knockin' 'em down like the seventh grade
Heartbreak
Cigarettes and songs with a winter's chafe
Heartbreak
Keep like my daughter and a run away

Cunts watch their bodies
No room for make up
I think he's tasted
Tasted the watcher
Aha, shake
Tapered jean girl kills me

Cunts watch their bodies
No room for make up
I think he's tasted
Tasted the watcher
Well now it's three o'clock in the morning
And I can't even close my eyes
Three o'clock in the morning baby
And I can't even close my eyes
Can't find my baby
And I can't be satisfied

I've looked around me
And my baby she can't be found
I've looked all around me, people
And my baby she can't be found
You know if I don't find my baby
I'm going down to the Golden Ground
That's where the men hang out

Goodbye, everybody
I believe this is the end
Oh goodbye everybody
I believe this is the end
I want you to tell my baby
Tell her please please forgive me
Forgive me for my sins
You know there's two old maids layin' in the bed
One picked up an' the other one she said
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me

Well, you know there late one night up on Blueberry Hill
One man turned to the other man an' said with a blood curdlin' chill, he said
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me

Well, you know we was layin' down around Mink Muscle Creek
One man said to the other man he began to speak, he said
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me

Well, you know we was cruisin' down the highway in a Greyhound bus
All kinds of little children on the sideroad they was hollerin' at us, sayin'
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me
Lately, I find myself gazing at stars
Hearing guitars, like someone in love
Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me

Lately, I seem to walk as though I had wings
Bump into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you, I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love

Lately, I seem to walk as though I had wings
I bump into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you, I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love
(Intro: T.I.)
Yo, ayyyyyy, huh-ayyyy

Hey ya ain't live, you don't ride, you don't do it like I do it
I keep it real - ya ain't real, you don't wanna get into it
Ya ain't crunk, ya ain't buck, ya ain't hard, ya ain't G
You ain't got what I got pumpin in your heart, you ain't me
You do all that yellin, holla, ya ain't real and ya ain't bout it
Ya ain't serious, ya ain't crazy, you know you don't wanna die
Ya ain't hustle from the bottom, you don't got it like I got it
You can hate and you can lie but pussy nigga I'm the hottest
(T.I.)
I'm the realer nigga in this shit, aside from all the business shit
I'm the nigga sucka niggas best to keep it pimpin with
People say I start a lot of shit, I say I finish it
Thank God it wasn't no witnesses, I'd still be servin sentences
Rap shit way more stressful that I love my other businesses
Thank God I'm a professional and scared I don't begin to get
Whether in a Phantom or the truck with all the kids in it
Still tote a hammer try me, man I hope you listenin
Your death gon' be elaborate, real fuckin' extravagant
I'm down to die myself to show you niggas I ain't havin it
Had to kill your son and a few your mama had to get
And they were playin dumb, we run in and ask where daddy at

(Chorus w/ ad libs)
(Mac Boney)
I carry niggas on my back like a bookbag
Put the pistol in his hand and tell him shoot his ass
I pull a little file faster than them credit people
Yo' ass dead, that's why you probably seein dead people
The weapon with me's really lethal, yeah it scare people (oh my God)
I know off top that I'm gon' bust, that's why I dare people
And I won't dare cheat you, I fair-and-square beat you
Same time, same time's why I'm on that Grey Goose
Don't make me spray and let loose, cause I won't hesitate to
I heard one shot then heard two, jumped up out the truck like what it do
I got a fo'-5 on me and got a nine too
A nigga sayin "Mac Boney, we ain't shoot at you"
I say you sucker ass niggas better keep it movin
'Fore y'all boys be the ones I end up doin
(Chorus w/ ad libs)
I heard a nightingale croon last night in town
I smiled up at the moon, had another round
You've got to be the prettiest girl I've found
And I'm gonna Sail On A Rainbow
I'm gonna dance all night in the rain
I'll keep on sailin' on a rainbow
Till I hold you in my arms again

In sunny spring we were sweethearts
Sleeping in the sand
Our love was an endless dream
No one could understand
Just like pennies from heaven
I know I cannot fail
And I'm gonna Sail On A Rainbow
I'm gonna dance all night in the rain
I'll keep on sailin' on a rainbow
Till I hold you in my arms again

So, I'm gonna Sail On A Rainbow
I'm gonna dance all night in the rain
I'll keep on sailin' on a rainbow
Till I hold you in my arms, till I hold you in my arms
Till I hold you in my arms again, till I hold you in my arms again
Till I hold you in my arms, till I hold you in my arms again

[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
It's 2 AM in the mornin
Pressin my alarm again
Stressin over my mom and friends
Sometimes, I wish I was in a coma

Damn! Wakin up to the cold wind
Sometimes, I wish I was a kid again
Sometimes, I don't even wanna remember it
Cause one time I remembered what I couldn't forget
Damn! My stepdad beatin me again
For a bad grade, he must of had A's
The way he was hurtin me in a bad way
My mom hearin the scream but just turned away
What the fuck, are you people crazy?
I was only a baby, five months when they gave me
To my grandma, who was racist
But I ain't give a fuck, I just faced it
Like mace to the police, I was danger
Feelin like I'm in a manger
Baby Jesus, save me from the anger
She's tryin to get me, into this closet I vanished quickly
Fuck that, I took 50
From her purse bag, told her "Don't miss me"
I ain't comin back, catch me on another path
I need a bubble bath
Someone, take me in the plastic basket
Sittin on bubble wrap, I'm abandoned
I need a new home, that isn't damaged
A family whom care, to be parents
Errant, my life on the mic
Might wasn't raised too right, so I
Had to decide to turn on the light
Do somethin right, before I'm layin with the mice
Rotten alone on my neighbor's stolen bike
Tryin to think what my afterlife, gon' look like
It gotta look right... it gotta look right...

[Chorus]
Back to my bad life
Another day in the fast life got me feelin like I'm on the crack pipe
No lie, just the thought
Of me gettin that type of high, but I'm in the dark
Where the shadows, follow, your every walk
And as I move, I'm feelin like a shopping cart
Gimme this, gimme that son
What'chu mean - ain't you supposed to be my mom?
Why don't you ask God, I worked hard for these two dimes
I care what it's worth - just the fact that it's mine
Check your purse, don't you got
My life savings that you've been savin from birth?
Oh - I forgot you spent that
On your own gift wrap - I ain't get shit last Christmas
But a hug and a family wishlist for next year and shit
Huh! 'Round next year and shit
I'm gonna be on shit you can't even pronounce, in English
I got anger
That's why I paint these songs, visually painting
It's awful ain't it? A little (Pinky) in (The Brain)
But hopefully, time is the pain
Cause as of now, I just wanna run away... run away...

[Chorus]

Another day another letter
Would bring me closer to your side
Another walk along the river
Another need be satisfied

Unto another you bring this trust
And with each footstep a doubt you remove
And it will follow as follow it must
No love is pretended no love need you prove

And once again you will try to replace
All the love we have lost
None of the worries we'll live for the call
Of our hearts made of iron or of stone

Into another's arms you trust
And with each footstep a doubt you remove
And it will follow as follow it must
No love is pretended no love need you prove

Another day another letter
Would bring me closer to your side
You go out when you get ready
And you come home when you please
You just love me when you want me baby
And you think it outta be all right with me

When I try to talk to you baby
And let you know just how I feel
You tell me if I don't like it
You know someone else will

Oh, but I done got wise to you baby
You're not the only bird in the sky
Oh so don't ask me no questions now baby
And I, I won't tell you no lies

Because I like to feel arms around me
And lips close, close to mine
So I don't have to beg you to love me
I don't have to beg you all the time

Oh, but I done got wise to you baby
You're not the only bird in the sky
So now don't ask me no questions baby
And you know I won't, I won't tell you no lies
Yes you can love me if you want me
Or you keep on flaying the field
Because I know if you don't love me
I know there's somebody else that will

[Intro]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Verse 2]
Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, "Hell, yes"
Low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now

Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Backwards Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me
Ah, there's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is a never gonna wither
Come on, everybody, time to deliver

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Intro]
Clean heart
Clean and sharp
Clean dream
Bad start

[Verse 1]
He loved his brother and his sister
Luke and Tony called him mister
They made him feel much more
Like a man
He loved his daddy though he never told him
And how he loved his mama
He loved, he loved, loved, loved her like an Italian

[Verse 2]
Little Janet said you look so fine
So fine
But something in his smile
Made them feel like strangers
And then he straightened his belt
With a lover's touch
And he said I'm gonna bring home
The things that are out of your clutch

[Bridge]
Seemed like the hottest night in summer
A heat that makes you feel like dying
Somewhere in the next block
There was a baby crying
Finger on the trigger for the years to come
Finger on the trigger for the years to come

[Verse 3]
And as the moon slid up over the restless streets
Sirens mocking, people stop to see
Ooh, their greedy eyes don't realize
He's someone's son
Finger on the trigger for the years to come
Finger on the trigger for the years to come

[Verse 1]
I don't know how, but nights get lonely now
They keep appearing in my eyes
Such a warm and tender glow
For just one moment, I remember all
The love we had was never all that bad
There were smiles and there were tears
On that special, starry night, with your arms around me
Held on tight

[Chorus]
Wasn't that the way it was?
Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause
Wasn't that the love we shared
Or just the restless years when no one cared?

[Verse 2]
I don't know why it's hard to say goodbye
Or even justify the end
You meant so very much to me
Then to let you go, start my life again
The love we had was never all that bad
There were smiles and there were tears
'Til that special summer day
When I reached out for you, you just walked away

[Chorus]
Wasn't that the way it was?
Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause
Wasn't that the love we shared
Or just the restless years when no one cared?
Before I tell them, Lord, please tell me
Before I serve them, Lord, please serve me
How can I lead where I've not been?
How can I show if I don't know?

Before I tell them, Lord, please tell me

Before I teach them, Lord, please teach me
Before I reach out to them, Lord, reach out to me
How can I lead where I've not been?
How can I show if I don't know?

Before I tell them, oh, Lord, tell me

Before I tell it my way
Sit me down and make me silent
And give it to me your way
Please don't let the things I do
Distract me from hearing a word from you

Before I tell them, Lord, tell me
Before I serve them, please serve me
Before I say one word or sing one word
Say it or sing it in me
Before I tell them, oh, Lord, tell me

Teach me, show me, reach out to me
Tell me

[Intro:]
Kelly: Yolanda, I'm just so happy to be a part of this song to remind everyone out there that they should not lose sight of what we're really here for
Yolanda: And you know, I thank you for being a part of this. You know you my one, now! Come on. Let's tell 'em about this

[Chorus:]
Jesus is coming back
Time to make up for all you lack
Neither you nor I know the day or the time
He'll arrive, he'll arrive

[Verse 1: Yolanda Adams]
There are things that seem right in your mind
Until the time in life When things must change
Will you sacrifice a little of your time to get right?
Now is the time to get it right 'cause

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kelly Price]
Coming like a thief in the night in the night for your life
And He'll catch you off guard if your heart ain't right
Don't you hesitate
The longer that you wait It may be too late
And you don't want it to end that way

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Ooh, wee ohh, ohh get your house in order
He's coming back, yes he is for me and you
Get right, Get right

[Chorus] (2x)

Jesus is on his way back
I'm waiting on him
It's been so long
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh Jesus is coming back
Time to get your house in order
Get your soul right, get your soul right, get your soul right
Neither you or I can tell when he's coming back, coming back
Gotta watch what you're doing
And you gotta watch what you're saying
And you gotta watch who you're doing it to
'Cause he's watching you
And someday, someday he will come back for you
I am waiting on him, yes I am
It's my heart's desire to go away with him
I wanna be where he is
So I gotta do what I gotta do down here too
He's coming back
I gotta love you like I love myself
I gotta love you like I love myself
I gotta treat you like I treat myself
I gotta hold you like I hold myself
I gotta love you with an everlasting, everlasting love
Woo! He's coming back! Yes he is!
Coming like a thief in the night, yeah
Well, I ain't got no home I'm just ramblin' round
Just a ramblin' worker, go from town to town
Police make it hard wherever I may go
I ain't got no home in this world anymore

All my brothers and my sisters have stranded on this road
That's a hard ol' dusty road that a million feet have trod
Rich men took our home and they drove us from our door
Man can't feel at home in this world anymore

Well, as I look around me it's funny and plain to see
This wicked cruel world is a funny ol' place to be
The gamblin' man is rich lord, the workin' man is poor
Can't fit his home in this world anymore
Try it one more, please

You know I got to find me
People, I got to find me
A part time love
Oh I need
I need me a part time love
Every time
Every time my baby leaves me
You know I need a part time love

The people in the cemetery
They're not all alone
Some turn to dust
And some have bone
You know I'd rather be dead
Six feet in my grave
Than to live lonely
Each and everyday

I need me
I need me a part time love
Every time my woman leaves me
You know I need a part time love
She came home this morning
I asked her where she'd been
She said, "Don't ask me
No questions, baby
'Cause I'll be leaving again"

I've got to find me
Don't you see, I've got to find me
A part time love
My baby leaves me
I need a part time love
Yes, I do

Oh every time my woman leaves me
Have to suffer
The whole time she's gone
I got to say it again
When she leaves me
I suffer every time she's gone
When she leaves me
I just got to have me a part time love
Is there somebody out there

Oh I need
Mm, I need me a part time love
Can't say it too much
I need, oh, I need . . 

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]
It's 2:00, and we're still going
I can't get enough of your lovin', nah
The way you're doing what you're doing (Ooh)
Keeps me coming back or more, so

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
Keep it flowin', baby (Girl, don't stop for nothing)
Keep it flowin', baby (Keep givin' your lovin')
Keep it flowin' baby (Kissin' and huggin')
Keep it flowin' baby (And don't stop it now)

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
Now is the time to do what I do
I'm gonna try my best to put my joy in you
Wanna be your lover, day and night
The way you're pleasing me, feels so right

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
Keep it flowin', baby (And don't stop for nothing)
Keep it flowin', baby (Keep givin' your lovin')
Keep it flowin', baby (Kissin' and huggin')
Keep it flowin', baby (Girl, don't stop it now)

[Bridge: Ronald Isley]
Just open up, and let me in
I wanna give you this love I have within
Ah baby, said that I wanna be your lover, girl
Ah baby, you know what I want

[Chorus: Ronald Isley]
Keep it flowin', baby (And don't stop for nothing)
Keep it flowin', baby (Keep givin' your lovin')
Keep it flowin', baby (Don't stop the flow, kissin' and huggin')
Keep it flowin', baby (Just like a boat)

[Outro: R. Kelly & (Ronald Isley)]
Just like a boat, girl, keep it flowin'
Don't you stop, girl, keep it going
(Don't stop for anything)
Up and down, girl, keep it strokin'
Feelin' so good, kissin and huggin'
Lovin' the way you give your lovin'
Girl, you're so hot, I wanna stay in
Feelin' the passion flowin' within
(Honey, make like you a river, keep it flowin')
Let it flow, let it flow, let it, just let it flow
Let it flow, let it flow, let it, just let it flow
Let it flow, let it flow, let it, just let it flow
Let it flow, let it flow, let it, just let it flow
(Just like a river)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it, just let it flow
(Like a boat)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it, just let it flow
(Keep it flowin', flowin')
Let it flow, let it flow, let it, just let it flow
(Keep it flowin', baby)
Let it flow, let it flow, let it, just let it flow

[Verse 1]
If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see

[Verse 2]
If I could read your mind love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind the drugstores sell
When you reach the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take

[Verse 3]
I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three-way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now love, let's be real
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone, and I just can't get it back

[Verse 4]
If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
But stories always end
And if you read between the lines
You'll find that I'm just trying to understand
The feelings that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back
We in your pussy, We fuck slow, We pull it out then we make your ass blow. We never stare like a trick, we make the pussy come and pay for the dick

We in your pussy, We fuck slow, We pull it out then we make your ass blow. We never stare like a trick, we make the pussy come and pay for the dick

- The preparations for my departure...
- Are made.
3:33 - 3:36
- At once, without delay.
- The ring.
3:36 - 3:40
Over the water we must go.
3:40 - 3:42
- Bhuta.
- You ask of me, Master?
3:42 - 3:45
- Obedience and Love.
- This is so.
3:45 - 3:47
- Ahme.
- This is so.
3:47 - 3:49
- The ring.
- Has nobody looked on the washbasin?
3:49 - 3:53
I am making the immediate
arrangements for my necessary...
3:53 - 3:54
- Are made.
- At once.
3:54 - 3:57

- In hand.
3:57 - 3:58
Something must be done.

Without the ring,
there will be no sacrifice,

This is so.
4:22 - 4:25

- I don't like to.
4:25 - 4:27
- Go on, wave.
- Shall I?
4:27 - 4:30
They expect it, don't they.
4:30 - 4:33
Lovely lads and so natural.
4:33 - 4:35
Adoration hasn't gone to their heads.
4:35 - 4:38
You know what I mean, success.
4:38 - 5:09
So natural and still the same
as they was before they was.
5:09 - 5:14
(Rattling)
5:14 - 5:31
(Organ music plays)
5:31 - 5:36
- Someone's got hold of my finger.
- You trying to attract attention again?
5:36 - 5:39
She's pulling at it.
5:39 - 5:40
(Yells) Oh!
5:40 - 5:50
Ow!
5:50 - 5:51
She had my finger, you know...
5:51 - 5:55
Stop trying to drag things down
to your own level.
5:55 - 6:02
I thought she was a sandwich
until she went spare on my hand.
6:02 - 6:06
It's cold. it's a cold place.
6:06 - 6:11
- So, the ring?
- No. I could not get it off, Swami.
6:11 - 6:17
Oh dear!
6:17 - 6:25
(Engine revs)
6:25 - 7:38
(Clock ticks)
7:38 - 7:51
(Thuds)
7:51 - 7:55
Hey! Have you been messing with me
in my kip?
7:55 - 7:57
I mean, with a fishing rod.
7:57 - 8:01
I wouldn't touch you with a plastic one.
What are you doing on the floor?
8:01 - 8:35
I'm tired.
8:35 - 8:41
(Phones ring)
8:41 - 8:44
- Hello?
- Hello?
8:44 - 9:02
(Alarm clock rings)
9:02 - 9:04
Hey, Bea-atle!
9:04 - 9:08
How about this, Shufti?
9:08 - 9:11
Gold! All of it, pure gold.
9:11 - 9:14
In easy to handle
denominational nuggets. Unmarked.
9:14 - 9:17
- Not a mark on them.
- No, I hate them.
9:17 - 9:23
- No.
- It makes your fingers go green.
9:23 - 9:26
It's not the Beatle with the ring.
9:26 - 9:30
- Aren't I?
- No, unfortunately.
9:30 - 9:37
(Giggles)
9:37 - 9:39
Ah!
9:39 - 9:43
Hey, Bea-atle.
You shall have fun, eh?
9:43 - 9:49
No thanks, I'm rhythm guitar
and mouth organ.
9:49 - 9:51
I didn't encourage that wink.
9:51 - 9:54
- It is not the one.
- My gosh.
9:54 - 9:57
They all look the same in their similitude
and language.
9:57 - 10:00
Swami, its raining on your...
10:00 - 10:06
After them.
10:06 - 10:09
- Quickly, quickly.
- Yes, yes.
10:09 - 10:11
- Right, right.
- All in.
10:11 - 10:15
- All in together now, sir.
- Now.
10:15 - 10:17
- Ah! Shilling!
- Shilling?
10:17 - 10:20
- Shilling.
- Oh, shilling!
10:20 - 10:30
- Now! Off!
- Off.
10:30 - 10:45
Oh... After them.
10:45 - 10:54
- What first attracted you to me?
- Well, you're very polite.
10:54 - 10:56

10:56 - 10:58

10:58 - 11:05

(indistinct chatter)
11:16 - 11:18
Ow!
11:18 - 11:20
- What are you doing?

Ow!
16:08 - 16:10
Oh! Oh, that stings.

(Yells) Kaili!
16:12 - 16:14
Kaili!
16:14 - 16:16
(Ahme) Flee!

Will you explain everything
when the opportunity presents itself?

- Flee!
- OK.
16:36 - 16:50
(Gunshot)
16:50 - 16:53
Oh, goodness me!
Sex is creeping in.
16:53 - 16:58
Young people see it in the bazaars,
market places, temple...
16:58 - 17:02
No wonder they turn up their noses
at a mystical impulse...
17:02 - 17:07
We're taking up fox hunting so young
people are involved in their sacrifices.
17:07 - 17:12
And will understand the deep
significance of blood well shed.
17:12 - 17:17
Of course I don't expect you to see
eye to eye with me...
17:17 - 17:22
What? Who? Where?
17:22 - 17:49
Now... lf you'll pardon me.
17:49 - 17:52
It's played out, any road?
You know, rings...
17:52 - 17:54
- Very nice.
- It's yours.
17:54 - 17:58
Nah! My missus wouldn't wear a ring
like that. Ostentatious, that is!
17:58 - 18:02
- He's from the west.
- Nah, east. Stepney.
18:02 - 18:06
- Does this ring mean anything to you?
- Freemason?
18:06 - 18:10
- You're all English!
- That's what unions are for.
18:10 - 18:15
I tell a lie. We have got one in there
from the mystic east... Or we did have.
18:15 - 18:17
(Hollers) Hey, Abdul!
18:17 - 18:20
- Yes.
- We did have one, didn't we?
18:20 - 18:23
That lad from the sunnier climate,
east of Suez?
18:23 - 18:26
Very nice he was, too.
18:26 - 18:39
I think he's still down there,
in the coal hole.
18:39 - 18:42
Doesn't the blood rush to your head, sir?
18:42 - 18:44
Doesn't the eastern flavour
come expensive?
18:44 - 18:47
Doesn't the blood rush to your stomach?
18:47 - 18:49
Is this ring nasty, sir?
18:49 - 18:55
Argh! Kaili! Oh dear, I must lie down.
18:55 - 18:59
Oh! That's better.
18:59 - 19:02
Excuse me...
This menu...
19:02 - 19:23
(Thump)
19:23 - 19:25
I've just seen the most amazing thing...
19:25 - 19:35
(Gasps) Oh...
19:35 - 19:41
Hey, did you...
19:41 - 19:46
There's a man down there on his head.
19:46 - 19:48
Arthur?
19:48 - 19:51
(Whooshes)
19:51 - 19:57
Could you pick this up for me, please?
19:57 - 20:02

20:05 - 20:11

I can say no more.

20:17 - 20:21
(Music resumes)
20:21 - 20:24
It's rather a jolly place.
20:24 - 20:27
- Soup, please.
- Soup, yeah.
20:27 - 20:29
He has three hours to live.
20:29 - 20:33
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
20:33 - 20:35
I ordered soup too.
20:35 - 20:48
- Soup!
- Soup.
20:48 - 20:53
Pardon me, sir. That's a very
fascinating ring you've got there.
20:53 - 20:55
- Unless I'm mistaken.
- Is it?
20:55 - 20:59
The dreaded sacred sacrificial
ring of the dread Kaili.
20:59 - 21:00
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
21:00 - 21:04
Excuse me. if he is to be sacrificed
before Kaili,
21:04 - 21:06
why is he not painted red?
21:06 - 21:14
I've never had the courage to ask him,
but as he's my best friend I will.
21:14 - 21:17
- Whats this? Glasses?
- That's right, sir. Glasses.
21:17 - 21:21
A victim is offered
to the dread Kaili everyday.
21:21 - 21:23
All are happy to go.
21:23 - 21:26
He who wins is privileged to wear
the sacred ring
21:26 - 21:29
from sun to moon,
from moon to sun.
21:29 - 21:33
And at the end of the happy day
he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
21:33 - 21:38
And sacrificed jolly with a knife,
so I'm told, with that ring.
21:38 - 21:39
Three hours to live.
21:39 - 21:43
- (Man) You have till five o'clock.
- Before a new victim is chosen.
21:43 - 21:46
You are lucky to be chosen!
21:46 - 21:51
My old mum would give her right hand
to be chosen.
21:51 - 21:54
- Whats this?
- A season ticket.
21:54 - 22:00
I like a lot of seasoning in my soup.
22:00 - 22:02
There's somebody been in this soup.
22:02 - 22:06
I got it from this Eastern bird... lady...
in a fan letter.
22:06 - 22:11
I get all sorts.
Rubbish, though, isn't it? Sacrifice.
22:11 - 22:13
No? Come off!
22:13 - 22:17
So, get in touch with your authorities
and send back the ring to this lady,
22:17 - 22:19
who will then go happy to Kaili.
22:19 - 22:22
- Thank you.
- (Bhuta) Three hours.
22:22 - 22:24
There's a footprint in here.
22:24 - 22:28
Here, you have a go.
22:28 - 22:35
(Gasps) Flee!
22:35 - 22:54
(Woman screams)
22:54 - 22:57
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.
22:57 - 22:59
(Laughs)
22:59 - 23:01
This ring is not stone.
23:01 - 23:12
- I've only got three hours to live.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.
23:12 - 23:17
- I don't know this metal.
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?
23:17 - 23:20
Early days yet, sir.
Therefore it must be an alloy.
23:20 - 23:26
There's a certain amount of hurry up
involved here. My life is in danger.
23:26 - 23:28
Three ten.
23:28 - 23:30
- The wheel.
- Not the wheel.
23:30 - 23:34
Even the Royal House of Hanover
had the wheel, sir.
23:34 - 23:46
(Whirring)
23:46 - 23:49
- I've never seen anything like it.
- You've failed.
23:49 - 23:53
- I suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind? Your tools are broken.
23:53 - 23:56
The fire brigade once got my head
out of some railings.
23:56 - 24:01
- Did you want them to?
- No. I left it there when not at school.
24:01 - 24:03
You can see a lot of the world
from railings.
24:03 - 24:09
(Electronic beeping)
24:09 - 24:12
I like operations,
they give you a sense of outlook.
24:12 - 24:14
This won't work.
24:14 - 24:17
It could work if the government
would spend more money.
24:17 - 24:20
Made in America you see.
24:20 - 24:22
Another failure.
24:22 - 24:25
The idea is...
The idea as I see it
24:25 - 24:29
is that we expand the molecules
and the ring grows bigger and drops off.
24:29 - 24:33
- Whats your electricity bill like?
- It's sort of a long counterfoil.
24:33 - 24:37
It's not dropping off.
24:37 - 24:41
Voltage!
Voltage... up, up...
24:41 - 24:43
Up, up!
24:43 - 24:46
- Are you sure I'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on. Thank you.
24:46 - 24:50
Made in America.
Streets ahead of anything we've got.
24:50 - 24:52
This is English.
24:52 - 24:55
- Is it green, the earth in America?
- In some places its brown.
24:55 - 24:57
He's not earthed.
24:57 - 25:04
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork. I ask you!
25:04 - 25:07
Done.
25:07 - 25:10
- 5... 4...
- Come on.
25:10 - 25:15
3-2-1-go! I observe the procedure.
He'll thank me for it in the end.
25:15 - 25:18
Scientist, you're getting nowhere.
25:18 - 25:22
It's the plugs.
Good British plugs.
25:22 - 25:26
All this America rig. Wrong voltage.
That's what foxes me.
25:26 - 25:28
- How do you feel?
- I used to use my hands.
25:28 - 25:32
He used to use his hands.
25:32 - 25:35
- Will he still be able to drum?
- Did he do a lot of it?
25:35 - 25:41
- Voltage... up!
- I'm no mean hand at the old sticks.
25:41 - 25:42
The voltage, up, up, up!
25:42 - 25:48
- Hey, he's calling you. Up, up, up!
- Up, up, up!
25:48 - 25:52
The bunker!
25:52 - 25:59
(Electronic humming)
25:59 - 26:03
- I can't watch.
- It's working! Give it the gun, Algernon.
26:03 - 26:10
(Whirring)
26:10 - 26:12
Stop it!
26:12 - 26:14
It's more than my job's worth!
26:14 - 26:17
He's out to rule the world
if he can get a government grant.
26:17 - 26:31
Outrageous!
You're nothing but a mad scientist!
26:31 - 26:33
Fantastic!
26:33 - 26:37
With a ring like that I could,
dare I say it, rule the world.
26:37 - 26:40
I must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser.
26:40 - 26:44
Get your hands off him
or I'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!
26:44 - 26:46
The laser...
26:46 - 26:50
- Get him off.
- I must have this ring. The laser.
26:50 - 26:55
Halt! Release him or I'll shoot
and I am a dead eyeshot shooting.
26:55 - 27:01
- I've got it.
- Switch off that machine.
27:01 - 27:04
- The laser.
- The laser, yes...
27:04 - 27:07
I'm better with animals
than plugs and transistors.
27:07 - 27:10
MIT was after me,
wanted me to rule the world for them.
27:10 - 27:13
Daddy being the local master
of the hounds.
27:13 - 27:16
That's where I get it from,
my love of animals.
27:16 - 27:20
They trust me.
I should have been in vivisection.
27:20 - 27:24
How do you know we can trust her?
She's had your fingers before, Ringo.
27:24 - 27:28
Well, that was a mistake.
I can vouch for her. We're very close.
27:28 - 27:32
- Lasers ready.
- Get them!
27:32 - 27:35
(Laser Beeps)
27:35 - 27:38
(Bang)
27:38 - 27:42
It's the wrong plug...
Just give me five minutes.
27:42 - 27:50
It's the brain drain.
His brain's draining.

(Gasps)
30:00 - 30:03
Now see what you've done
with your filthy Eastern ways.
30:03 - 30:07
No! it is Clang, the High Priest,
who is filthy in his ways.
30:07 - 30:10
(Posh accent) How do we know
you're not sent by him to nick the ring,
30:10 - 30:13
when you've lulled us
with your filthy ways?
30:13 - 30:16
- What filthy ways are these?
- You can put that away.
30:16 - 30:21
Until this moment you were safe
because my sister was chosen
30:21 - 30:24
and no other could be sacrificed
to Kaili.
30:24 - 30:32
Now my sister is safe and rises up.
30:32 - 30:35
(Soft clang)
30:35 - 30:39
(Ahme) 'And a new day dawns,
a new victim is chosen...'
30:39 - 30:45
From this moment it is death to him
who wears the ring.
30:45 - 30:48
This will make your finger shrink.
Be brave.
30:48 - 30:49
Don't look.
30:49 - 30:55
Alas, if he were brave
this would not be necessary.
30:55 - 31:05
(Birds chirp)
31:05 - 31:08
Where've you been?
You've been up that temple again.
31:08 - 31:21
You're as bad as your sister, coming
home from work at all hours and colours.
31:21 - 31:23
There might be some insurance.
31:23 - 31:26
I wouldn't think of such a thing!
Find out.
31:26 - 31:28
What did you say that stuff is?
31:28 - 31:32
This will just make his finger shrink
a little. It's a minor medical secret.
31:32 - 31:35
I'm sure there's no call for all this.
31:35 - 31:39
I'm allergic to Penicillin
and all them other wonder drugs.
31:39 - 31:42
- Gum?
- Are you sure its not or habit forming?
31:42 - 32:03
No. As long as you don't swallow it.
32:03 - 32:06
(Whispers) All right.
Synchronise your watches.
32:06 - 32:15
You, you, you and you.
Paint him red and then kill him.
32:15 - 32:17
Kaili.
32:17 - 32:20
Kaili. Kaili.
32:20 - 32:25
I promise you
the effect is purely transitory.
32:25 - 32:26
It wears off very quickly.
32:26 - 32:31
(Doorbell rings)
(Ahme) Don't answer it! It's Clang.
32:31 - 32:33
(Hollering and knocking)
32:33 - 32:37
- Perhaps it won't take...
- This is a dreadful miscarriage.
32:37 - 32:38
(Hollering)
32:38 - 32:41
(Ringo) Come on, my finger!
32:41 - 32:43
Where's Paul?
32:43 - 32:48
Where's Paul? Come on, Paul,
stop messing about.
32:48 - 32:50
Where's he gone?
32:50 - 33:13
- Where are you, Paul?
- It's his best suit.
33:13 - 33:19
Don't look right or left. They might take
us for innocent bystanders.
33:19 - 33:24
(Baby crying)
33:24 - 33:26
- Standby.
- (Whispers) Standby.
33:26 - 33:29
Look out!
They're coming through the door!
33:29 - 33:35
(Knocking)
33:35 - 33:41
- Go!
- Go!
33:41 - 33:49
(Yells) Kaili!
33:49 - 33:55
Kaili... Oh!
33:55 - 34:00
- Sorry, I hit him.
- Oh!
34:00 - 34:03
Get me the home office.
He's wrecking my home.
34:03 - 34:08
Kaili! Kaili!
34:08 - 34:13
(Gasps) Get off!
34:13 - 34:16
- It's me, you fool.
- Oh, sorry.
34:16 - 34:21
Well, stop it!
34:21 - 35:02
Feet! Feet, you fool!
35:02 - 35:13
(Growls)
35:13 - 35:19
(Sobs)
35:19 - 35:25
Kaili! He's red! Kill him!
35:25 - 35:34
(Gunshot)
35:34 - 35:37
Oh, my goodness gosh!
Withdraw! Withdraw!
35:37 - 35:40
Up!
35:40 - 35:42
Up, up, up!
35:42 - 35:44
- You!
- Which one has the ring?
35:44 - 35:46
That one with the large ned.
35:46 - 35:48
Neb!
And its yours.
35:48 - 35:54
- Keep your hands up.
- How can I get it off with my hands up?
35:54 - 35:56
In the name of science
I demand that ring.
35:56 - 35:57
It's yours!
35:57 - 36:01
- It's worth something.
- A couple of bob, at least.
36:01 - 36:05
Had to do all this myself... Backward
Britain they call us on Wall Street.
36:05 - 36:09
With a ring like that
could I interest the military?
36:09 - 36:11
No, I could not.
36:11 - 36:15
I can't get it off.
36:15 - 36:18
(Squelch)
36:18 - 36:20
- Paul?
- Look, what you've done.
36:20 - 36:24
- Hey, is that Paul?
- Algernon, my little black bag.
36:24 - 36:27
I shall have to operate.
36:27 - 36:29
It'll be on the National Health,
won't it?
36:29 - 36:33
- (Whooshing)
- Look!
36:33 - 36:36
Ugh! I'm all sticky. You're all red!
36:36 - 36:39
- We thought that was you.
- No that's not me.
36:39 - 36:43
I'm glad it wore off quickly.
36:43 - 36:46
What are you doing here?
36:46 - 36:51
- (Hammer clicks)
- Get out!
36:51 - 36:55
British, you see! Useless.
If I had a Luger...
36:55 - 36:59
Their scientists are properly equipped.
Think on it.
36:59 - 37:09
The remedy is in your hands...
you, the voters.
37:09 - 37:15
- Where's Ahme?
- I don't know.
37:15 - 37:23
(Speaks in Eastern language)
37:23 - 37:28
(Continues speaking
in Eastern language)
37:28 - 37:31
- Hai?
- What? Yes... Hai.
37:31 - 37:34
(Continues speaking
in Eastern language)
37:34 - 37:37
I don't understand a word.
I don't speak the language.
37:37 - 37:40
Latin, yes. But this Eastern babble, no.
37:40 - 37:58
Ah, the ring! Come on, we go.
