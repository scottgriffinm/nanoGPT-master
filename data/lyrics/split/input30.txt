g's for certain, two things fa' sho'
I might be hurting but I won't even complain, you know
I keep my head to the sky save the crying for the cowards
Keep your face dry, better do it in the showers
Wipe it off with a towel, no emotions to show
Keep the windows closed to the soul you know
It's all G

[Chorus]

Remember first God with you, you done seen worst
Just know there gotta be a purpose don't think he ain't working
Sometimes he gotta sit you down and do some soul searching
Listen, hear, answer, learn that from an old person
He can show you things you use to take for granted
Then give it back again better than you had it then
And reveal to you your real friends then
You reach a hand out to him he'll extend his
Now you feel like you can carry the load
Somehow you feel like you can get through what was scary before
It's all G, it's like I've never been scared before
A long time ago I shoulda been dead, you know
Threw a middle finger to the reaper when he took shots at me
He got my best friend and he still not happy
He want me in a casket? Well let him come and catch me
Tell whoever asking man, I feel fantastic
It's all G

[Chorus]

I just wonder what got him so upset
Guess cause I'm the best that's what I get
Maybe cause when I talk more than all of Atlanta listen
They want to see me suffer, won't give him the ammunition (Ha!)
No pun intended I don't mean to be long winded
But I gotta ask this question ya'll before this songs ended
Would you let 'em see you sweat or let 'em see a vet
Who ready for whatever, they can never disrespect
I got through out it all I keep my chest up out my head high
Although the haters threw they best as they said, I
Was a done dollar, but I just come harder
I went through all that just to become smarter
And tomorrow I can see it in the headlines
T.I. not guilty, wave goodbye to the bad guy
The kind of man that they done seldom seen
Even though they wanted me in jail, all hail the king
It's all G

[Chorus]
DMX:"

[I'm boxing for] every black person who has been done wrong in the system.

"I am going to beat the living f**k out him … I am breaking every rule in boxing to make sure I f**k him right up. Once I am done with him, I am going to whip my d**k out and piss on him ... right in his muthaf**kin face. Zimmerman is a piece of s**t and that’s what he needs to drink."GAME:If you could do it and it was legal, and there was no repercussions for knocking Zimmerman out, why not?

[TMZ: Is this justice you feel was denied?]

It's not really about that for me because, again, the Trayvon Martin story was sad enough. Justice needs to be served for his mother and his father and his family. I just think that how Zimmerman is playing it and being a media whore and looking for all this attention that he shouldn't be getting...If there's a chance to box him then I want in.

[TMZ: Could you knock him out?]

Man I believe I could knock Thor out.

All you need from Game is a YES. Draw it up and let's fight...I'll get in there and Zimmerman won't last three minutes.

[Verse 1: Gambino]

Look sharp, homie give yourself a face-lift
High brow, eyebrows on a spaceship
Take sips of that Ace of Spades
I'm savin' all my money just to waste on a bracelet
Can't see them haters, we don't give a fuck though
Charge into the game, keep a lame so cut-throat
Never slip a fast one, the game is so in front of me
Travel 'round the globe spendin', make about a hundred G's
Pack them crowds up, Boss like Bowser
Deep pocket poetry, my custom trousers
Thank god they found us, the game was starvin'
I'm cleanin concrete, you assin' Charmin
Bobby digital, Do you really think these niggas know shit?
Shoppin' in Manhattan and I ran into my old chick
Pride is a bitch, I am not a grown up
Tweetin' when I'm 70 these half dead followers
She look like she spelman, Secretly she hofstra
Put her in the club all she wanna hear is Waka
Put her in the crib all she wanna hear is Waka
She jerk when I move like an old boy popped her
Home is that outcast, Soul is that Fonté
Old school J's like Beyoncé's fiancé
Back on my dumb shit, nigga we the stupidest
Gave them niggas real shit they don't know what do with it
I did what I did man, did you see it though?
'Bino hard and fast, nigga sweet and low
American royalty, family loyalty
We cream of the crop, why the fuck would we stop?
Yo, she had two sons, both of 'em good grades
Both of 'em rap songs, where did she go wrong?
Man, nowhere mama we just go where the money at
Royalty nigga, where the fuck you niggas at?

[Verse 1]
Your letters wait at home
In their bright red coats
Under a midnight storm
I hear four words you wrote
"I can't be sad"
Sad, sad, sad
I can't make you mine

[Verse 2]
Now you're on your own
Even they can't stand
But I said before
And you know that

[Chorus]
I can't take my eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes off you

[Bridge]
And I bathed in the light you gave
But it's dark in another way
Yes, you gave me the light today
But it's dark in another way
And I bathed in the light you gave
But it's dark in another way
Yes, you gave me the light today
But it's dark, it's dark, it's dark

[Refrain]
I can't be sad
I can't be sad
I can't be sad
I can't be sad

[Chorus]
I can't take my eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes off you

[Verse 1]
I can feel it now that you've gone
I have made you all that I want
I know you're keeping to your own sound
You're running out of sight when the light goes down
Said you'll be waiting 'till the night's done but there's no one
And the world went on but I always knew you'd come

[Chorus]
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling

[Verse 2]
I can feel it coming so clear
I can feel you already there
And I can see you with my eyes shut
You're running in my head and I can't keep up
Said you'll be waiting for the next one
But I always knew, I always knew you'd come

[Chorus]
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling

[Bridge]
Our love was long so long
And then forgotten like an old song
You said your life went on
But I always knew I always knew you'd come

[Chorus]
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling then I know
Just one feeling, just one feeling
Just one feeling, just one feeling

[Intro]
Out of sight
The way you come alive when you are all alone

[Refrain]
Whenever you want it, wherever you want it
Whenever you want it, wherever you want it
Whenever you want it, wherever you want it
Whenever you want it, wherever you want it

[Verse 1]
Anywhere you are, my love
Let me comfort you, your eyes dripping blue
I'll be the night fly looking for a sin
You be the bright light drawing me in
No room for doubt, so just stubbornly keep on
But for how long?
But for how long?
To be here alone tonight, tonight
To be here alone tonight, tonight
To be here alone tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
And I can't say no
Not until I reap the seeds I've sown
Not until I take that long walk home
And stare you down
Words that appeased you
Words were always, dressed up to please you
Promising "someday"
Whispered to you so desperately all night
Walk out the door, get rid of the tales
You say it's okay, but we're kidding ourselves
Trick me to thinking that you could be all mine

[Bridge 1]
All mine
All mine
To be here alone tonight
(Whenever you want it, wherever you want it)
(Whenever you want it, wherever you want it)
(Whenever you want it, wherever you want it)
(Whenever you want it, wherever you want it)
To be here alone tonight
(Whenever you want it, wherever you want it)
(Whenever you want it, wherever you want it)
(Whenever you want it, wherever you want it)
(Whenever you want it, wherever you want it)

[Bridge 2]
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
(Whenever you want it, wherever you want it)
Tonight, tonight
(Whenever you want it, wherever you want it)
Tonight, tonight
(Whenever you want it, wherever you want it)
(Whenever you want it, wherever you want it)

[Outro]
All the time, the way you are alone
The way you hold it all
I, I stalled, I watched you come down
Oh lord, I tried
And still it's not enough

[Intro]
If you wanna ride, you can come out and see me
I could be home by now

[Verse 1]
When the whistle blows
And we pull out slow
This is where I build my home
And I wait for you so patiently
Letting you find your own

[Chorus]
If you wanna try, you can come out and see me
I could be home by now
But anywhere I am, tell me you're waiting for me
I could be home by now

[Verse 2]
When I am old, let the tension flee
I was born crying out and it's come back to me
When everyone else is setting up to fall
I'll just think back on it all

[Verse 3]
I'll remember long drives, sitting in the back
Looking out and endless snow, waiting in the silence
If you won't spill your heart, I'll chase you for the words you owe
And you and you know and they're begging "come home"

[Verse 1]
Here comes the doubt to shut the sunlight out
I feel the brunt
And I keep the world away
To be asleep throughout the day, it's all I want

[Chorus]
I sit and pine for wasted time
My feet were strong
My head was numb
I feel it come, I'm overdone

[Verse 2]
And I keep the world away
To be asleep throughout the day, it's all I need
Tell me, was it enough when we were first in love
To plant the seed and just leave?

[Chorus]
I sit and pine for wasted time
My feet were strong
My head was numb
I feel it come, I'm overdone

[Verse 1]
Free that's all that she could bleed that's why she'll never stay
White bare naked in the night and lookin' for some play
Just another girl that wants to rule the world any time or place
And when she gets into your head, you know she's there to stay

[Chorus]
You want it, she's got it
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind
She's got your, your pistol
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind

[Verse 2]
Slow she's burnin' in your soul with whispers in your ear
It's okay, I'll give it anyway, just get me out of here
You'll plead, you'll get down on your knees for just another taste
And when you think she's let you in that's when she fades away

[Chorus]
You want it, she's got it
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind
She's got your, your pistol
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You want it, well, she's got it
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind
She's got your, your pistol
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind
You want it, she's got it
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind
She's got your, your pistol

[Intro]
Cause I'm tight, cause I'm tight
Tighter than American Apparel
I mean
Yo! I'm a monkey, I'm a unicorn
And your bitch, she tryna touch my dick

[Verse 1]
You rap game weak, said "I'm rap game me"
Now who the fuck gonna stop a girl? I'm kickstand free
And they ask me, "Where them ratchets?" I say, "That ain't me"
But you know that I've been down for all that ass, blame these
Silly hoes, mad booty when they clap, rain G
And I'm sippin' you know what, it gave me mad brain freeze
Hot pink, blunted, burning, British bitch, bitch I'm nothing beats
So they clownin', yeah they clownin'
Give a bitch a boost, yeah I'm tippin' on this juice
Mama hop up out the Nissan, sit up in them 22s
See these nookie niggas fake when your kitty ain't the same
See I be up in your city, mind flooded and I'm sank
I'm a shark without a tank, think I'm starving, want some bait
And I love it when they hate, and I love it when they hate
And I love it when they hate, yeah I love it when they hate
Said "I love it when they hate," yeah I love it when they hate
Yeah!

[Chorus]
I'm gone, might be on
Where's the Visine? I'm mean, en garde
Baby I'm throwed, I'm throwed
I could tell you throwed, I could tell you throwed
I could tell you gone, might be on
Where's the Visine? I'm mean, en garde
I'm throwed, baby I'm throwed
I could tell you throwed, I could tell you throwed
I could tell you throwed, I could tell you throwed
I could tell you, I-I-I could tell you throwed
Where's the Visine? I'm mean, en garde
I'm throwed, baby I'm throwed
Baby I'm throwed
I'm throwed, I'm throwed, I'm throwed
I'm throwed, I'm throwed
I'm gone, might be on
Yeah!

[Intro: Juicy J & Pitbull]
Oh, no
Yeah
Ya'll know what it is
Katy Perry
Juicy J
Mr. Worldwide
Aha
Let's rage

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy (enemy)
Your enemy (your enemy), your enemy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away (walk away)
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
I'm an outcast, I got that
Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
And that's just a start
My life I took it from the back to the front
Rosa parks
Who cares what they blink or they bought
Who cares what they think or they thought
Baby we can do it in the car
In the kitchen, on the floor
In the middle of the park
I'm here to play with that little bitty thing
I pump blood through your veins, your heart
And all these little players, acting like they can hate
But they can not
Can't, won't, don't, never will, be real
One, two, three, four times, Cypress hill
Hey Ms. Perry
Looking sexy with your fine self
Want a little bit of magic, I'm maverick, top gun
If you look and look no further you got one
I got 'em confused
Is he Hispanic or is he Caucasian?
Don't worry about where I'm from
Just know one thing, I'm amazing

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (you should know)
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse (like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for (ready for)
A perfect storm, perfect storm? (a perfect storm)
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Target practice, baby
Only thing is
I'm not the shooter
I'm the bullet bitch

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They say your attitude determines your latitude
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But can't, because you love what I make
Now ain't that about a bitch
And I'ma talk shit until I'm out of hits
They don't want to turn they speakers up they claim I ain't deep enough
All that talkin' I feed off of, keep it up
I'm relaxin' my feet is up, I'm leavin' you haters
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to Heat it up
I state the stats to stunt, I don't need to front
Make black history e'ry day, I don't need a month
The survey says, by the streets according
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan
Was to the NBA when he was scorin'
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and..

[Hook]
You ain't neva gotta ask again
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
Wake and stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, what you want
And if you strapped, we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, i'm on that dry cush
And when it comes to that paper i stack books
Yeah, You heard what i said
I can put you on your feet or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap, you're better off dead
If you can't pay the fee, shoutout my nigga Fee
See every muthafucka at the door don't get a key
You outside lookin in, so tell me what you see
Its about money, it's bigger than me
I told my homies, "Don't kill him, bring the nigga to me," yeah
Don't miss, you fuckin with the hitmen
Kidnap a nigga, make him feel like a kid again

[Hook]
You ain't neva gotta ask again
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
Wake and stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Now, e'rybody wanna be the king of the South
When, they ain't runnin a damn thing but they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin y'all opinion
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without sayin
It's a given, and ain't because of what I'm doin for a livin
It's more because of what I do and how I'm livin
Not to mention when I'm rappin I'm just hurtin niggas feelings
(Niggas feelings) And still chillin on somethin that's into healing
Made provisions for the clique to continue keepin it pimpin
Whether crack was in the house or record sales was through the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun, I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggas'll come and look for you if ya sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way, you better do what the song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day

[Hook]
You ain't neva gotta ask again
How we got the world to listen
It ain't easy to pretend
I know you lost your cool
And it starting to come back again
Wake and stop it's just the beginning
You ain't never gotta ask again
Baby this is what we do

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight
And two wrongs don't make a right
But when you been wrong and you know all along that it's just one life
At what point does one fight? (Good question right?)
'Fore you knock the boy, try to put your dogs in his
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half
Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block, niggas standin tight, there's limits on the ave
Tryin to cop or shot-call theyself cleansin in the cash
But can't put they name on paper cause, then you on blast
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up
(Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up)
You can look me in my face (I ain't got no worries)x3
See the sh-rooms keep me up (I ain't got no worries)x3
You see money right there, yeah that's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there we ain't got no worries

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi in this bitch, errybody should be worried
Them pussy niggas be purring, bitches be diggin' me I feel buried
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear’ll have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleep
All these bitches think they’re the shit, I’ll send them up shit’s creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It's ok if you turn up just don't turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I'm smoking I grew it
B’s up, Blood Gang; Piru it, and all rats gotta die even Stuart
On my private jet and my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch Nigga
I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers
You don't get dissed, you get disfigured
She say sorry I didn't shave so that pussy a little furry
I put that pussy in my face: I ain't got no worries
Tunechi

[Hook: Detail]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
We ain't got no worries
She bad as a hooker, so she ain't got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar, I say "Why you in a hurry?"
She say "Why you asking questions?" I say "Bitch you trynna be funny!"
Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see that Donkey Kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bar
That camel toe that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show
I swear I saw my ho, I swear she was with my ho
You know I fuck them both, sore pussy and sore throat
Bitch it's Tunechi and I'm out chea, no worries no worries
I would talk about my dick, but man that shit be a long story
YEAHHH, OHH SHIT, UH HUH, YEAHH, YOUNG MULA BABY!

[Produced by Boris Dluglosch]

Last night I had a dream about you
In this dream I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
The kind of feeling I've waited so long

Don't stop come a little closer
As we jam the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little little fun
We were dancing all night long

The time is right to put my arms around you
You're feeling right
You wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it this dream was all gone

Ooh I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true
Ooh I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true

Why don't you play the game?
Why don't you play the game?

[Intro]
Me, bitch I’m me, I'm the goddamn reason you ain't VIP CEO
I’m young wild and strapped like Charlie

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
Catch me posted on 1 40 if you’re…
My … is all about the buisness
Ice in my grill, my jeweler is my dentist
Got a neck full of carrots and a pocket full of spinach
But tell me what’s for dinner, y’all niggas is beginners
You fucking with them losers and my team full of winners
D’s on that bitch, we never ride spinners
My birds down south even if it ain’t winter
And I’m a skinny nigga, but to see if my show’s real
Walk to the club, ugly mug like hell rell
Mike’s in my palm on my arm like ll
I’ma put the city on my back like…
King kong in the trunk beat you 12-12
That’s a 12 gauge handed by the 12th grade
And I’m from Harlem so you know we fly high
Buckle up ma you rollin' with a fly guy, cause
Bitch I’m me, bitch I’m me, bitch I’m me
I’m ceo, I’m ceo
I’m young wild and strapped like Charlie
Bitch I’m me, bitch I’m me, bitch I’m me
I’m ceo, I’m ceo

[Verse 1]
It's been much too long
I feel it coming on
The feeling is getting strong
It's been much too long
I feel it coming on
The feeling is in my bones

[Chorus]
Too long
Can you feel it?
Too long
Oh can you feel it
Too long

[Verse 2]
At last the long wait is over
The weight is off my shoulders
I'm taking all control
My mind, my mind is set so free
I'm where I want to be
To get the best of me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I see, you feel the way I do
The feeling so, so true
The good feelings coming through
My, my mind is set so free
I'm where I want to be
To get the best of me

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 x2]
You know you need it
I need it too
You know you need it
It's good for you

[Outro x3]
Too long

[Verse 1]
Faded and worn at the seams
A psychotropic wanderlust sick and laughing
Their words bared their teeth into the wall
I promised I would rid the world of feral animals

[Pre-Chorus]
I see you smiling with your feet up like your heroes
You'd off yourself to save your reputation
Strong and fearless and deprived just like your heroes
Are you sharpening your sword?
Well, you'll fade out anyway

[Chorus]
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my faith?
All the promises you made never realized
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my strength?
All the promises you made never realized

[Verse 2]
Fill the air with what you like
Another weekend massacre of opinion
Don't be afraid of the knife
Sometimes you have to cut the limb to survive

[Pre-Chorus]
I see you smiling with your feet up like your heroes
You'd off yourself to save your reputation
Strong and fearless and deprived just like your heroes
Are you sharpening your sword?
Well, you'll bleed out anyway

[Chorus]
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my faith?
All the promises you made never realized
Why'd you say
Why'd you say that you'd come right back for my love, for my strength?
All the promises you made never realized

[Outro]
You got to love the madness of the feeling
Don't have to rush the freshness of beginning
You got to get back up and face your demons
Don't ever be afraid of starting over

[Chorus]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
Yeah, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

[Verse 1]
Feelings sleeping in the field again
But I can feel, I can feel, I can feel it's beginning to end
Yeah, premonitions smiling in the dark
Well, I can see, I can see, I can see the story's starting to arc

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It dries up
I've been a spoken word, I've been a riverbed
I've been a rabid force and let it flow out from within
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
And color's so, oh

[Chorus]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
You say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
(With your feet up in the clouds)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

[Verse 2]
Waves in theta slipping into dreams
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel the celestial beings
Wilted pleasures leave you with a breath
I can see, I can see, I can see the beauty in the mess

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It dries up
I've been a riverbed, I tried to salt the wound
I've carried more than I can, I feel I've got a lot to prove
Sometimes I feel like I only dream in black and white
And color's so, oh

[Chorus]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
You say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
(With your feet up in the clouds)
You oughta know that I'm here no matter where you go
(With your head hanging upside down)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

[Bridge]
I am here
No matter where you are
I'm waiting here with open arms
No matter where you are
Sometimes you have to wait until it passes by
Like a satellite or star
No matter where you are

[Outro]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You know it, ooh, ooh
(With your feet up in the clouds)
Oh yeah, you know it, ooh, ooh
(When your best friend's all strung out)
Oh yeah, you know it
You oughta know that I'm here no matter where you go
(With your head hanging upside down)
Oh yeah, you know it
That's how you know that your best friend's all strung out

[Verse]
What if I told you
The dreams on the other side
The dreams on the other side
Go there with me tonight

[Chorus: T.I]
All we really know a kid pimpin', all we do is get fly
VVS shine like the sun outside
Somebody tryna tell you Hustle Gang ain't gettin' to the money
Tell that nigga "You a mothafuckin' lie"
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you thought? Fuck you thought?
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you talm 'bout? Fuck you talm 'bout?
Nigga hell you sayin'?

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
I make rainy days, it's a drought for you
Y'all ain't crusin' my altitude
I'm a boss bitch, I let you spread the rumors
Yea you talkin' shit but not an ounce true
Million dollar misfit, my money pilin'
All over the lettuce like Thousand Island
My dough runnin' like a broken faucet
I'm the landlord, you in the housing projects
In the drive-thru, makin' bank deposits
Crazy money, insane asylum
Boss Chase, got her taxes filed
And then I blow the rest while I’m at Saks shopping
Amsterdam, Germany and Holland
Changing your currency to dollars
It's Iggy bitch, and this boss shit
Where the pounds at?
No trending topic

[Chorus: T.I]
All we really know a kid pimpin', all we do is get fly
VVS shine like the sun outside
Somebody tryna tell you Hustle Gang ain't gettin' to the money
Tell that nigga "You a mothafuckin' lie"
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you thought? Fuck you thought?
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you talm 'bout? Fuck you talm 'bout?
Nigga hell you sayin'?

[Verse 2: T.I.]
All I talk is money, ye ain't got it, ain't nothin'
I'm on the grind, shinin' like an elevator button
Wanna talk? Nigga lissen, call me 

[?]
You got a bad bitch? I gotta have that buddy
Bein' broke? Nigga please, you can have that, buddy
This nigga say he doin' numbers, where yo math at buddy?
I'm in a mothafuckin' socket, can't unplug it
Think I'm mothafuckin' lyin', try and take somethin' from me
Bitch I'm plugged to the max, pay a dub for a pack
Take it back to the trap, make it jump right back
Break it down into O's, sell quarters of those
If I ain't got it on me, it's some more at the store
I know a thousand mothafuckin' niggas in the city
Say T.I.P. 'bout you, shawty anybody get it
So 'fore you get robbed, get trapped by 80
Just know Hustle Gang thug a hella lot

[Chorus: T.I]
All we really know a kid pimpin', all we do is get fly
VVS shine like the sun outside
Somebody tryna tell you Hustle Gang ain't gettin' to the money
Tell that nigga "You a mothafuckin' lie"
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you thought? Fuck you thought?
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you talm 'bout? Fuck you talm 'bout?
Nigga hell you sayin'?

[Verse 3: Young Dro]
We got them niggas over there dead
Coupe Benz, no roof, I'm without head
New shoes, you ain't got this pair yet
Your broad late, kinda on cause I had that
She in the driveway, tryna fix her hair back
I had a dick marathon and she ran that
Lapped that, after that, when her care better
Killed her with the pole, then let her hang half mast
Fuck them, I'm still hoppin' out of foreign cars
I'm a born star and I'm a porn star
I catch you slippin' with triggers and really hit a nigga
By myself, I ain't gotta go get a nigga
Trap Biggie, on track verbally killin' niggas
Sick flow, might need Penicillin, nigga
I do the impossible like I oughta do
And y'all pussy niggas smaller than a molecule
Out!

[Verse 4: Travi$ Scott]
I left my passport overseas
Where it get dark after 3
Never leave the house 'less I'm awfully flee
Always leave the show with somethin' soft to squeeze
Take a little dab of this, a little drag of this
Then she reached down my pants, grabbed my shaggy dick
Left that mothafucka's home covered in my kids
She bossy, get this grip, straight flossin'
Smoke the piece with little coffee
Fresh as hell, no coffin'
I let her talk the shit
Leave the crib, can't walk for shit shit
Buck the dome, Milwaukee shit
Mind so big, gettin' lost and shit
Bossin', hit the club they heed caution
Drunk as hell feelin' nauseous
High as hell, hittin' comets
I’m raunchy, your niggas rock Givenchy
I ain't gotta say it, I ain't gotta wear it
I ain't gotta pay it cause you know it don't cost me

[Chorus: T.I]
All we really know a kid pimpin', all we do is get fly
VVS shine like the sun outside
Somebody tryna tell you Hustle Gang ain't gettin' to the money
Tell that nigga "You a mothafuckin' lie"
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you thought? Fuck you thought?
Nigga hell you sayin'? Nigga hell you sayin'?
Fuck you talm 'bout? Fuck you talm 'bout?
Nigga hell you sayin'?

[Intro - Meek Mill]
Yea... You can be here one day gone any minute
That's why I live everyday likes it's my last

[Hook - B.o.B]
Well, you could be here one day, gone in a minute
Cause life is so short but as long as a minute
See I'm, I'm just living at the speed of light
Just living at the speed of light
And I would never waste a minute
I'm never giving up and I'm breaking every limit
Cause I'm, I'm just living at the speed of light
I'm just living at the speed of light

[Verse 1 - Meek Mill]
Speeding in the fast lane watching through my rearview
Thinking about the past man and all the shit I did do
Shit that could've took my life from me, that I lived through
Cases that I could've caught, cracks that I done slid through
The bids too, struggles I done came from, the main one
Was the day my dad died, I never been the same son
Turned into a man young, cause I ain't understand something
Changes I was brought through, streets that I was forced to
You could be here one day, gone in a minute
That's why I get that money, spend it like I print it
Ball till I fall, till the day I diminish
I ain't never gon stop, I push it to the limit

[Hook - B.o.B]
Well, you could be here one day, gone in a minute
Cause life is so short but as long as a minute
See I'm, I'm just living at the speed of light
Just living at the speed of light
And I would never waste a minute
I'm never giving up and I'm breaking every limit
Cause I'm, I'm just living at the speed of light
I'm just living at the speed of light

[Verse 2 - Meek Mill]
They gave my nigga twenty years, man that wasn't even right
Got him in the hell hole living at the speed of light
Praying that the time fly by so he can see the light
See his kids, meet a wife, all over a key of white
But why you think they take that time from you
Cause you need it right, and you can't get it back
So how they giving niggas life
Like you gon live again, grow up, be a kid again
That's why I never waste time I cherish every minute in
Pray to god faithful though, man half that shit I make, I blow
I don't even take it slow, cause any given day could go
And I can meet my death date, feel my last breath take
That's why I go and get it now, I be like fuck waiting

[Hook - B.o.B]
Well, you could be here one day, gone in a minute
Cause life is so short but as long as a minute
See I'm, I'm just living at the speed of light
Just living at the speed of light
And I would never waste a minute
I'm never giving up and I'm breaking every limit
Cause I'm, I'm just living at the speed of light
I'm just living at the speed of light

[Verse 3 - Meek Mill]
From where the good die young, and the bad don't even last at
Where the young niggas 16 and over die fast at
I was made there and raised there, but moved past that
Living at the speed of light, it look like a flashback
I done got money, went broke and got the cash back
Had it I was cool though, lost it I got laughed at
That's why I never ever cherish nothing I can have back
Thankful for my life though, I wish that I can stash that
Yeah, shit I'm just living at the speed of light
Balling hard to see the light, be here today decease the night
I just hope when god come arrest me that he read my rights
Read my wrongs, keep me right, send me home but leave me right

[Hook - B.o.B]
Well, you could be here one day, gone in a minute
Cause life is so short but as long as a minute
See I'm, I'm just living at the speed of light
Just living at the speed of light
And I would never waste a minute
I'm never giving up and I'm breaking every limit
Cause I'm, I'm just living at the speed of light
I'm just living at the speed of light

What's on my feet? Say it with me baby, Balenciaga
Yeah, your nigga on that basic shit, Red Lobster

So I'm really like fuck that bitch
Franck Mueller probably wonder what it cost
But man I'm like fuck that shit

She don't know me, but I know her
I met plenty of her type before
Love a nigga with a fancy car
Live your life like a movie star
Got a thing for expensive clothing
Fuck with it if it's frozen
You got it all
And worry 'bout a thing, no not at all
The music was on, had that sour smoke in the air
Her nigga was jockin', I told her 'come over here'
To my section, he make sure the runway is clear
Then we take off, leave the extra baggage girl so we can float on

Illa dilla, I'ma killer
Snoopy Dogg with the Gorillaz
Layin low, on the floor
My hands up high, I'm full of dro
Girlies tryin to kiss me slow
I'm leaning like a sixty-four
This life I live's incredible
These trees I breeze are medical
Take a look, in my eyes
Hold on tight, enjoy the ride
If you don't feel good then you out of place
My universe, is outer space
My look, my style, my Prada case
Lil' daddy get out our face
Trip this, sip this, hit that, now sit on back
And let Dogg go and get on that
Party people you invited

[Chorus: 2D & Noodle]
If you never tried it... something like this
I can try to smoke wit'chu, something like this
If you never tried it... something like this
I can try to smoke wit'chu, something like this
Something like this, something like this
Something like this light, something like this night

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
What a night to get involved
Everybody have a ball
Celebrate and fill your cup
Drink until you get enough
How you feel, I got that feeling
Disco lights hang from the ceiling
Ain't nobody on the wall
Pop it, drop it, let that fall
Hey DJ, play my song
Step back, let it bang all night long
I need your attention, no hoping or wishing
Come in, in high-definition
Said I do, right that I do
Get up and get money, yep that I do
Rode it, ride it, lick it
Bite it, roll it, light it
Party people you invited

[Chorus: 2D & Noodle]
If you never tried it... something like this
I can try to smoke wit'chu, something like this
If you never tried it... something like this
I can try to smoke wit'chu, something like this night

[Verse 1]
Download me
Make up for the time you've wasted
Come slowly
And claim back the boy you left behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
'Cause it's time to wipe out
To the stars, get on the fame

[Chorus]
The song is not the same when we're
All played out, played out, all played out
They said the memories
All fade out, fade out, all played out
Tell me did you feel that?

[Verse 2]
Don't slow down
Even if it's only to escape
Just download, now
Before somebody steals your place, man

[Pre-Chorus]
Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
'Cause it's time to wipe out
To the stars, get on the fame
And the conversation's over

[Chorus]
We're all played out, played out, all played out
(Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
You see the memories
All fade out, fade out, all played out
(Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
Tell me did you feel that?
Doncamatic

[Verse 3]
Download me
Make up for the time you wasted
Come slowly
Claim back the boy you left behind and

[Pre-Chorus]
Close the white book
Unplug the brain from the game
It's time to wipe out
To the bar, get on the fame

[Chorus]
The song is not the same when we're
All played out, played out, all played out
(Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
You see the memories
All fade out, fade out, all played out
(Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)

[Chorus]
The song is not the same when we're
All played out, played out, all played tonight
(Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
The song is not the same when we're
All played out, played out, played out, played out
(Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me)
Tell me did you feel that?

In the club and I'm smoking Mary Jane
Chains on my neck and they know my name
Rep what I claim, that's that money game
Turn up, see, I be swaging hard, ain't no one like me
I can cook the dope with no recipe
If you ask about Soulja then they know my name
I be hustling hard, I do it for the fame
Took the rap game and I made it bump
If you come to west side that's my zone one
Everybody know me be turning up
Whole lot of kush we be burning up
Kill shit like Jackie Chan, kill shit like Jackie Chan
I got a lot of cash, I got a lot of fame
Day that I retire they gonna miss me, man
Until that day I'm flexing hard with 30 chains
Turn up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Them niggas got mad when I got some money
Made a million dollars, now they looking at me funny
Riding through my hood in a Maserati
When I hop up out that car got snapped by paparazzi
Word around town Soulja De Biasi
Right pocket clean but my little pocket sloppy
I be making money like Illuminati
Fresh airways with tattoos on my body
Your girl look at me, turn up in a party
I be sipping lean, popping bottles of Bacardi
All the white boys say that I am naughty
My line stay short just like Stevie Harvey
I smoke a lot of dope, roll a lot of molly
Sip a lot of lean, pop a lot of Xanax
All the girls on me, hard to grow steady
SOD gang, SOD party

[Hook]
Kill shit like Jackie Chan, kill shit like Jackie Chan

Soulja, Soulja
Damn man it's a movie man
You already know, S.O.D catch up

[Hook]
A million, A million A million
A million A million, money to the ceiling
A million A million A million, A million
A million A million, A million A million

A million stacked up, money by the case
Got them m's up, baught a house by the lake
Dared a fuck nigga to get used to this guap
Thumbing through the check and this shit won't stop
Thumbing through the check, riding in a foreign whip
Fuck all these fake niggas cause them niggas ain't shit
Riding with a bad bitch, she jocking on my whip
Forty band cash with a pistol on my hip
This bitch flexing and she acting like she know me
I just touchdown in Dubai, me and my nigga Kobe
The chain love water whip, bad bitches on the strip
Got ten bitches in my bed and all them strip
Swagging out the porche, money that's of course
Drop top panorama, my roof it got the voice
Think against the soulja and the choppa is my force
23 million, my name is on the forbes
Know I love Jordan so the bitch want me to fork
Lamborghini doors, pull up on a horse
Swagging out the panorama, but I want more
Rocking Michael Kors, walking through the doors
Scarface mansion and it came with marble floors
I'm swagging out the store, selling out the tour
Pouring up the activist, the lean it made me snore
And everywhere I go they say "Soulja the world is yours"

[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
Step out of your skin
Put it in a jar
I thought they were my friends
But they were cannibals

Where should I begin?
Tell you what I am?
I'm a normal alien

[Chorus]
We thought we were alone
But we had just started
We thought we left home
But we never departed
There's poison in the air
But we don't care

[Verse 2]
Tell you what I'll do
We could fall in love
Take me home with you
I'll do what you want
Put me in a lab
Splice all of my genes
We can fall in love again

[Chorus]
We thought we were alone
But we had just started
We thought we left home
But we never departed
There's poison in the air
But we don't care

We thought we were alone
But we had just started
We thought we left home
But we never departed
There's poison in the air
But we don't care

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
We thought we were alone
But we had just started
We thought we left home
But we never departed
There's poison in the air
But we don't care
We thought we were alone
But we had just started
We thought we left home
But we never departed
There's poison in the air
But we don't care

[Outro]
We don't care
We don't care
We don't care
We don't care

We don't care, don't care
We don't care, don't care
We don't care, don't care
We don't care, don't care
We don't

[Hook]
Performance

And they looking at the diamonds inside of my chain
Performance

Now go and run and tell 'em boys that we ain't backing down, nope

Buckhead yellow diamond shawty drop top range

[Hook]
On the time he compared himself to reality star Ray J:

I think it's just niggas man. You ever notice how homophobic niggas is all the time? It's like, dude if you ain't gay, then gay things shouldn't bother you, gay people shouldn't bother you. You ain't going to get your ass pumped dude, ain't nobody trying to look for you my nigga. You can say gay things but not be seen as gay. You don't gotta say, 'No homo.' You ain't gotta say, 'I want a hot dog, no homo...' Be comfortable with your manhood. We know you fuck bitches my nigga

On his assistant, who is gay:

I can see people not fucking with me because he's there. It's like, bro, you ain't even got bitches, why do you think this gay dude going to like you? Bitches don't even like you

On Frank Ocean:

I think the radio is getting more gay-friendly. I don't think urban music is getting more gay-friendly because if that was the case, Frank Ocean would be on a lot more songs. I know niggas that will not do a song with Frank Ocean just because he gay, but they need him on the fucking song and that's so terrible to me man... What I do ain't going to affect nothing that you got going on

[Intro]

And mother's givin' me a free bowl of beef barley (Yup)
Ridin' in the back, back, back on the car seat (Chyeah)
Gettin' out, then pocketin' the car keys
Young and I'm reckless, with blunts with my breakfast
And I'm rockin' more dunks than Garnett gets
Yes, it's Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac

[Chorus]
Get down, get up, get down, get up
Get down, get up, get down, get up
And move around (Round), like it was musical chairs

Get down, get up, get down, get up
Get down, get up, get down, get up
And move around (Round), like it was musical chairs
Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair (Chyeah)

[Verse 3]
And I'ma get my diploma (What?)
You need to notice I'm a scholar
Runnin' through the streets ever since I was a toddler (Uh)
Playin' cops and robbers (Uh), always was a robber (Uh)
In my neighborhood all day like Mr. Rogers (Chyeah)
Now a little taller, hip hop monster
Eight-legged flow, you can call me Peter Parker (Peter Parker)
I know you see it, boy, I'm weeded and spittin' it real (Real)
To match my style, kid, you best be equipped with some steel (Steel)
My swagger mean, dress fresh and so clean
In a flash, gettin' change like a vendin' machine (Chyeah)
Then I'm out, pocket of piff, hop in the whip
Head to the first dip at the top of the list (Ayo)
Roll in easy, got you drinks for the free
On lean and my eyes still chink from the tree (From the tree)
Hoes out the playpen, eyes behind some Rayban's
It's mayhem livin' in this teenage wasteland (Chyeah)

[Chorus]
Get down, get up, get down, get up
Get down, get up, get down, get up
And move around (Round), like it was musical chairs
Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair
Get down, get up, get down, get up
Get down, get up, get down, get up
And move around (Round), like it was musical chairs
Get ya ass off your seat, find yourself a new chair (Chyeah)
Get down, get up, get down, get up
Get down, get up, get down, get up

This is a public service announcement from Mac Miller

[Hook: Gemini]
I don't know what they said to you but
But this the way that gangstas move
And get on down to this gangsta groove uh-huh
I don't know what they said to you but
But this the way that gangstas move
And get on down to this gangsta groove uh-huh

[Verse  1: Lupe Fiasco]
He don’t care, he gon’ put the freeze on the charm
See through them frames with the C’s on the arm
South beach, light breeze through the palms
Two or three dames, Nikes on the lawn
With, wrist watch, crown on the face
Big Glock, pound on the waist and
Him in drop, lines on the wheels
Him can’t stop, flying when I peel
With insects, dying on the grill
And French sweats, gliding to a still
In the drivers seat
Bout to make this jump Bounce like drier sheets
I don’t know what you been told but this how a rider speaks
This is how it comes out when I arrive in beat
I’m the focal point at play
When I come through all the old folks will point and say

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Well spoken when I spit
20 inch Daytons right well spoking when I whip
Everything I sit on, the game coupe’d up
Sunny where you gon sit the money too lizzong
It’s the chip flosser
Quick to piss off a
Chick who friends thought her
Pimp was gon’ alter
It will not falter
It’s the limp walker
Food and liq author
Mister slick talker
Just sit, click, you fixed to slip offa
Promise never to quit, flip, or get softer
It was just GC, I, and a roof
Now I gotta keep TV Guides in the coupe
Its over, once the shoes on surface
And I throw this game like lose on purpose
For the perch I never purchase purses
You’ll never get him you’ll never hit him, perfect

[Hook]

[Instrumental]

[Lupe Fiasco]
Bring it back!

[Hook]

[Outro: Gemini]
I don't know what you've been told but
This the way that gangstas move
Now gangstas come and gangsta go
I don't know what you've been told but
This the way that players roll
Players come and players go uh-huh
I know you don’t love me (uh huh)
You ain’t the same whenever Drake’s around
I know you don’t love me (uh huh)
You scream and holla when CB’s in town

Now I got a Hollywood girl, she stay on McCadden
Think she selling ass on the side (ass on the side)
Got a New York City, big titty, pretty thang
Catch the train to a nigga, she don’t drive (don’t drive)
I’m that nigga, I’m that nigga (I’m that nigga)
I’m that nigga in yo city but a nigga from Virginia (from Virginia)
I’m that nigga, I’m that nigga (I’m that nigga)
And if you niggas done forgot
You niggas bout to remember
You niggas better remember losers never love a winner
Bitches never love a loser, beggars never can be choosers (uh huh)
I’m in the crib playin 2K
New bitch got loose lips, told her like Lupe
You can kick and push babe, why you acting "boojie"?
Free kush, liquor pills its a movie (its a movie)
Call her best friend, skin like D'usse
She got a booty and I made them tell me who they?
Who do you love?
(Ho I know yo type)
You ain’t the same whenever YG’s around
Bitch, who do you love?
(Know you wanna act a fool when you see that nigga Dolla $ign)
Bitch, who do you love?
Aha, I bet you be a freak for my nigga Meek
Who do you love?
I bet that you go low for that nigga Loso
Who do you love?
I bet you let your panties fall quick for that nigga August
On the road to Rishikesh
I was dreaming more or less
And the dream I had was true
Yes, the dream I had was true

I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just child of nature
I'm one of nature's children

Sunlight shining in your eyes
As I face the desert skies
And my thoughts return to home
Yes, my thoughts return to home

I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one nature's children

Underneath the mountain ranges
Where the wind that never changes
Touch the windows of my soul
Touch the windows of my soul
I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one of nature's children

[Verse 1]
If your life's not right, doesn't satisfy you
Don't get the breaks like some of us do
Better work it out, find where you've gone wrong
Better do it soon, you don't have long

[Chorus 1]
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there

[Verse 2]
If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all it makes you more aware
Very simple process takes you there

[Chorus 2]
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there
Do-do-doo
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do

[Verse 3]
Looking for release from limitation
There's nothing much without illumination
Can fool around with every different cult
There's only one way really brings results

[Chorus 3]
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there
Standing in the garden waiting for the sun to shine
Hand me my umbrella when she says she wish she was mine
Everybody does think a thing it didn't come
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some

Standing in the garden waiting for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Looking at the bench of next door neighbors
Crying to my mom of diamond tooth sabers
Everybody's got to have something hard to hold
Well instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son and make you one
You gotta get out son and make you one

Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry cry I know
Shoot big
Shoot big

Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody to get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big
You gotta shoot big
Until you shoot big
I can't stand it

[Verse 1]
How'd did you get so young? I heard that you were born today
Heard that you came from the sky and I just wanna say
Welcome, the world is glad you're here to stay
Have fun, it's time to give another day

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes a fire can get in your way
But that ain't nothing you can't blow away

[Chorus]
So make a wish, I have one too
I wish that I could stay with you
Wish you knew how much I want all your wishes to come true
It's all about you-ou-ou
It's all about you-ou-ou-ou today, today
It's all about you-ou-ou
It's all about you-ou-ou-ou, today, today

[Verse 2]
Girl, what do you want? I swear I'll give you everything
New car parked out front, flowers, bags and wedding rings
Well done, the world is glad you're here to stay
Have fun, it's time to give another day

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes a fire can get in the way
But that ain't nothing you can't blow away

[Chorus]
So make a wish, I have one too (Oh)
I wish that I could stay with you (Oh)
Wish you knew how much I want all your wishes to come true
It's all about you-ou-ou
It's all about you-ou-ou-ou today, today
It's all about you-ou-ou
It's all about you-ou-ou-ou, today, today

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Rap diablo
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's the rap diablo, macho when I drop flows
The bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rappin' head honcho, rockin' shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow
Follow me, I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my G-pass? None of your fuckin' beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish 'em
Tryna find a balance, reachin' from my equilibrium
Fools I pity 'em, I'm not a human, I'm amphibian
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men, I ain't savin' nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'til the angels comin', skippin' all the famous functions
How do the famous function? The A-list can't be trusted
I strong-arm 'em like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society
I tell my bitch if she don't love me, then just lie to me
I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich, this is piracy (Piracy)
Finally, I don't even need my fuckin' eyes to see
Come and die with me

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Vince Staples]
'Cause everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Yeah, said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies

[Verse 2]
Yeah, um
Okay, my mind is Yoda, I'm on Ayatollah
These other rappers just a diet soda
I find Jehovah in the darkest places, empty as apartment basements
This a marathon, gentlemen, go 'head and start the races
Save the coffin spaces
You'll come up missin', tell your bitch that you been trippin', now you on vacation
Rappin' like it's automated, lights I keep 'em on like Vegas
Lava makin', so hot I'm turnin' hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star, I'm way farther with the constellations
Contemplatin' suicide like it's a DVD
Lost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch, I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke
Gordon Bombay in these streets, ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete
Been a beast, every word I spit rewritin' history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Run into the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle, I'm the show, you the commercial
I been poppin' like a kernel, readin' Justin Bieber's journal
Treat you like a urinal

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Vince Staples]
'Cause everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Yeah, said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Said everybody got dead homies
On the dead homies
Ten years ago today we finally released what had been my life's work up to that point: The College Dropout

I say "finally" because it was a long road, a constant struggle, and a true labor of love

To not only convince my peers and the public that I could be an artist, but to actually get that art out for the world to hear

I am extremely grateful to each and every person along that road who helped, lent an ear, lent their voice

Gave of their heart to that project, and to all the projects that followed, and are to come

I am honored and humbled by my fans, for the unwavering support and love over the past ten years

I wake up every day trying to give something back to you that you can rock to and be proud of

Ten years later I am still the same kid from Chicago, still dreaming out loud, still banging on the door

The doors may be heavier, but I promise you WE WILL BREAK THEM

Yeaaahhh
When I ride
You ride
And your girlfriends can follow my guys
If we lose
Them they will find us
Either way it's gonna get so exciting
My mind it's about time
To hit the lights and start carressing those thighs
She love it cause she wanna do me with the lights on

[Hook]
She want sex with the lights onn
She want sex with the lights onnn
She want sex with the lights on
She want sex with the lights onn
It's what she say while I'm jumping her boat
It's what she say while I'm jumping her boat
It's what she say while I'm jumping her boat
It's what she say while I'm jumping her boat
Tell me oh why am I lookin at a woman so fine
Oh me oh my never thought that id be staring at a goddess
My ego my pride won't let me leave without her tonight
Can you believe it once I got her to the crib she turned the lights on

[Hook]
She want sex with the lights onn
She want sex with the lights onnn
She want sex with the lights on
She want sex with the lights onn
It's what she say while I'm jumping her boat
It's what she say while I'm jumping her boat
It's what she say while I'm jumping her boat
It's what she say while I'm jumping her boat

Red Light stops
Green Lights go
Switch on the yellow like when you want it slow
Red Light stops
Green Lights go
Switch on the yellow line when you want it slow

[Hook]
She want sex with the lights onn
She want sex with the lights onnn
She want sex with the lights on
She want sex with the lights onn
It's what she say while I'm jumping her boat
It's what she say while I'm jumping her boat
It's what she say while I'm jumping her boat
It's what she say while I'm jumping her boat

[Verse 1]
I don't mean to disrespect you
But I noticed from afar
I spend my job singing song in front of people
I'm still nervous where you are, oh

[Bridge]
At the risk of sounding cliché
I would like to know your name
Please forgive me
If I'm speaking very strangely
I'm not good at these sorts of things, no

[Hook]
I know that I really don't deserve you
And I know you could probably take your pick
But I hope I'm the one that gets to be there
On the very end of your fingertip, fingertip

[Verse 2]
I don't know know which words impress you
So i'll only say a few
Like I'd really like to get to know you better
But you already knew that, oh

[Bridge]
I don't mean this as an insult
But your curves are something else
I don't want to have to share them with your body
I keep them all to myself, darlin

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

[Verse 1]
I do my hair up, all high and wide
White flowers tied
Green swimming pool, pink flamingo, high Christmas lights
Blue bed spread and silver tinsel
My heart's delight

[Chorus]
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

[Verse 2]
Do you like my fake nails daddy?
Black palm tree, pink tiger stripes
Used to go to the Palm Parade, yeah
Where you'd buy me a slice of cherry pie
We didn't know much, just worked at night
Sweet trailer life
One, two

[Chorus]
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

[Verse 3]
He said, "Lana Rey, will you serve me lemonade?"
I said, "Yes Bill, I will, it's the day of the parade"
And you look even more handsome than you did the day that I left you"
How do you spend your nights, honey, still watching TV?
I long to be in your arms, honey
Come back to me, please

[Chorus]
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

[Bridge]
All I want is to feel good
All I want is to feel good
All I want is to feel good
You know, hmmm
Come on now, if you want to
If you want to
If you want to
If you want to
It's been a long time

[Chorus]
Boy you wanna come to my motel honey?
Boy you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
(In my motel, honey)
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
(I said god-damn!)

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Dawg you gotta feel me on this one
What it be like dawg? I'm on some, some adult grown up type shit
Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga
Jeezy, Juvie, Turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Age is nothing but some digits, nigga trust me on this
Cause I think I speak for everyone when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L in the C L, gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every whip cause haters likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip
She end up catching rights to her lip behind diapers and shit
But I like me a spliff drink henny without the ice when I'm pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinking I'm Tyson and shit
But I'm a man so I'm able to handle my situations correctly
And I know I might be young but nigga gone definitely respect me
But in the mean while I'm fighting gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like I'm never happy now
Except for the fact my daughter saying I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up, but I smoke bout 3 blunts
And puff a cooler boost me up
And say a prayer for everyday
Just so I get through the stuff, but I be like

[Chorus]
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up
And usually I'm fed up thinking everything's a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And I get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff, just trust me it's tough
But I maintain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray there's a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when things get awful
And I'm often on the edge stuck without a solution
Someway I still pick it out and shuffle out the confusion
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and just doubt me
Cause y'all cats don't really know me, y'all just know about me
But my dawgs be on my side they keep me covered with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watching and my mothers the dearest
And I ain't never say I thought they ain't appreciate what I do
But just know if I wasn't a man we wouldn't make it through, but I be like

[Chorus]
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Who would have known that this was someday turn out so hectic?
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
And I'm influenced and effected by the way it became
And I don't play with it at all so I don't say its a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully changed
I'm always street so I'll forever be facing a change
And I'll keep the slang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm wasting a man
And if I want it, then I get, and if I need it, I have it
Take care of them family first, plus the liquor and weed is a habit
And ever so often I'm congratulated for the succeeding at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leading my path
And I ain't ask for you to like me, I don't care if you hate me
But don't mistake me, no other man can never make me or break me
Now I be faithfully inspired by the hood til I'm gone
And I dawg I do believe I'm grown so I'll be good on my own, but I be like

[Chorus]
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man
Awww man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
Being responsible for everyone in ya home man
And when you feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a grown man

[Outro]
Believe Dat

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Beg your pardon but let me smoke
And my squad they be gettin' that dough
Gettin paid and we smoke
Taking them planes everywhere we go
Don't gotta ask cus you already know

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
Heard you niggas was ballin'
We ain't nothing alike
Dug some crack in my palm, on them cold nights
Now it's just champagne, on cold ice
And expensive cars and all the women that we like
You never had conversations with bad bitches
Who don't need you
Give them the up all night and they gon' feed you
You be living fast, but the pays right
You ain't ready you short still gettin' stage fright
Bout a dollar, twistin' that marijuana
The car older than me, I'm sliding in that Impala
Got niggas actin' like bitches, bitches realer than niggas
Pussy that shit ain't knew I been hustlin' with killers
Seen so much when that trunk pop
See them red and blue lights and we don't stop
Damn, that's just what a nigga been through
What the fuck you want me to do? Real shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Hoppin' out that mofuckin'
Gettin' out that mofuckin'
I got so much mofuckin'
That I don't even mofuckin'
Why you niggas even mad at me
I'll gladly teach you niggas how to rap
You probably should be mad at the fact that you can't stack and you ass backwards
And that's when something bad happens
You be with, mad actors, mad slackers, you mad average
You niggas lookin' like mad rappers
Pull up in the Porsche, skirt up, smokin' that murda
Illest that you've heard of
Doin' shows with my shirt off
Problems with any of my dogs then they squared off
Hurt all, feelings cus of the dollars I've been getting
Smoking joints with your women
And we all chillin', Taylor Gang

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Berner]
20 grand in each ear
Space Jam 11 got three pair
Weed so strong I don't need clear
My cuddys locked up and I ain't seen him in three years
The world keeps turning, and my girls keep working
Hundred pack flipper, your team still hurting
Last minute trips to masterpiece don't tick
The rims on the whip all chrome clipse
I'm fly really, I don't try
Red eyes while cooking pies who am I? Dice guy
Big dog stacker, punk bitch slap a bitch trappin'
And I ain't never gonna switch up
I brought my new bitch with me to the pickup
And if they hit us they gon' leave blood with us
Drug dealers please pull my mud thicker
Pardon me for smoking

[Hook]

[Verse 1: 2-D]
Try to see myself what goes on
Make it up myself, I'll never
Always told my thoughts aloud
Then another day I shut up

[Hook 1: 2-D]
Back to the sand
Doing what you can
Bound to be gone
Damned a loser

[Bridge 1: 2-D]
Found out right then they were fed up
Cause everybody said to shut up

[Interlude]
Yeah!

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Thought that you might care what goes on
Try to say "what up?"; I'm fed up
Everybody said I shoot up
But I just gotta tell them what up?

[Hook 2: 2-D]
Down with the sun
I knew that I was done
Did it to my self
Did it to my self, and then

[Bridge 2: 2-D]
Everybody's stirring shit up
Cause everybody tells me "shut up"

[Intro]
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes man, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free

[Verse 1]
From Senegal, West Africa
To St. Louis, Missouri
Thanks to Katherine Dunham
For giving my pops his glory
He came down with his drum
And a dream to change the world
In a free uplifting world
And that's all he ever want
Mom came a little after
Gave birth to my brother
Then all of the pressure
Made 'em fight one another
See the pain would never last
Did the best with what they had
He knew the world was out for grabs
And he searched to find his

[Hook]
Freedom (x4)
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes man, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free
So I search to find my
Freedom (x4)
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes girl, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free, yea

[Verse 2]
As a kid I never knew
I'd have to hustle just to make it through
So I found myself skipping school
Cause the girls don't think I'm cool
And because of that I didn't care
Whether or not I went to jail
I just wanna be treated fair
Cause that's all I ever knew
Telling me I need to slow down
Cause everybody in the whole town
Cause they know how I get down
Foreigner from another town
Can you believe we still around?
After so many hit the ground
And we ain't gone stop now
Until we get that

[Hook]
Freedom (x4)
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes man, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free
Won't stop 'til I find my
Freedom (x4)
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes girl, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free

[Bridge]
If you wanna be free, and the land is drug free
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, from all your misery
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, with plenty money
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, just praise G O D
Put your hands up, put your hands up

[Hook]
Freedom (x4)
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes girl, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free, yea (echo...)

[Intro: Meek Mill]

And my queens niggas spent 200,000 on the tank
So it's bulletproof when I roll through nigga
Everytime I come through nigga

Shit my party was a zoo nigga
You don't even have a clue nigga

Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up

[Chorus: Meek Mill]

Runnin' round town with these lame ass niggas
She don't know no better, know no better
Nigga don't know no better
Runnin' round talkin like he gonna rob me
He don't know no better

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Wake up in the morning and I'm looking at 

[a mountain]
Young nigga 5 million dollar house
Still on that hood shit fucked around misplaced a whole million dollars
Fired my accountant
Bitch want a bag what you gon do for it
Meek she gotta fuck me or fuck you for it
Ho fucking up the brand, she don’t know no better
Fuck a real nigga it don't get no better
No stones on the Rollie theres a new sky dweller

Two doors on the ghost with the stars in the ceiling
Pay attention gotta school these niggas
Fuck a lame nigga then you a lame bitch

[Flawgin' ass] niggas keep gold digging bitches

Pound, These hoes be acting up

But tell them pussies we choppered up

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I remember smoking dope and fucking hoes
Dodging d's and poppin' pistols on the corner sellin' o's
For the love of Birkin bitches sellin' souls
Now I wake up and I fuck my dream girl and tell her whoa
Know no better, bitch don't know no better
Runnin' round town with these lame ass niggas
She don't know no better, know no better
Nigga don't know no better
Runnin' round talkin like he gonna rob me
He don't know no better

[Verse 1]
What you did to me made me see myself
Something different
And though I try to talk sense to myself
But I just won't listen

Won't you go away, turn yourself in
You're no good at confession
Before the image that you burned me in
Tries to teach you a lesson

[Verse 2]
What you did to me made me see myself
Something awful
A voice once stentorian is now again
Meek and muffled

It took me such a long time to get back up
The first time you did it
I spent all I had to get it back, and now it seems
I've been out-bidded

[Chorus 1]
My peace and quiet was stolen from me
When I was looking with calm affection
You were searching out my imperfections
What wasted unconditional love
On somebody
Who doesn't believe in the stuff

[Verse 3]
You came upon me like a hypnic jerk
When I was just about settled
And when it counts, you recoil with a cryptic word
And leave a love belittled

[Chorus 2]
Oh what a cold and common old way to go
When I was feeding on the need for you to know me
Devastated at the rate you fell below me
What wasted unconditional love
On somebody
Who doesn't believe in the stuff
Oh, well

[Verse 1]
I don't understand about complementary colors
And what they say
Side by side they both get bright
Together, they both get gray

[Chorus 1]
But he's been pretty much yellow
And I've been kind of blue
But all I can see is
Red, red, red, red, red
Now, what am I gonna do?

[Verse 2]
I don't understand about diamonds
And why men buy them
What's so impressive about a diamond
Except the mining?

[Chorus 2]
But it's dangerous work
Trying to get to you, too
And I think if I didn't have to kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill myself doing it
Maybe I wouldn't think so much of you

[Bridge]
I've been watching all the time
And I still can't find the tack
But I wanna know is, is it okay?
Is it just fine?
Or is it my fault?
Is it my lack?

[Verse 3]
I don't understand about
The weather outside
Or the harmony in a tune
Or why somebody lied

[Chorus 3]
But there's solace a bit in submitting
To the fitfully, cryptically true
What's happened, has happened
What's coming is already on its way
With a role for me to play

[Outro]
And I don't understand
I never understand
But I'll try to understand
There's nothing else I can do

[Verse 1]
One man, he disappoint me
He give me the gouge and he take my glee
Now every other man I see
Remind me of the one man who disappointed me

[Chorus 1]
Wait till I get him back
He won't have a back to scratch
Yeah, keep turning that chin
And you will see my face
As I figure how to kill what I cannot catch

[Post-Chorus]
So I say, and on I go
To another one who disappoint me so

[Verse 2]
Next one up, a contemptible snob
He lived to put things in their place
He did a commendable job
He put himself so low
He can hardly even look me in the face

[Chorus]
So wait till I get him back
He won't have a back to scratch
Yeah, keep turning that chin
And you will see my face
As I figure how to kill what I cannot catch

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, he made my blood just burn
I flipped so far, I thought that I would not return

[Verse 3]
But the last one I had who was getting my hopes up
I might've been a little fast to dismiss
I think he let me down, when he didn't disappoint me
He didn't always guess right, but he usually got my gist

[Chorus]
So wait till I get him back
I'm gonna bring him home and I'll watch him unpack
Yeah, keep turning that chin
And you will see my face is fixed on the one
I'm gonna get back

[Outro]
I'm gonna get him back, I am
I'm gonna get him back
I really am
I'm gonna get him back
I'm gonna get him back
I am, I'm gonna get him back, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Those boon times went bust, my feet of clay, they dried to dust
The red isn't the red we painted, it's just rust
And that signature thing that used to bring a following
I have trouble now even remembering

[Chorus]
So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night?
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I'm either so sick in the head, I need to be bled dry to quit
Or I just really used to love him, I sure hope that's it

[Verse 2]
I knew that to keep in touch, would do me deep in dutch
Cause it isn't the rush of remembering, it's just mush
And that signature thing is only growing harrowing
I should have no trouble now to keep from following

[Chorus]
So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night?
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I'm either so sick in the head, I need to be bled dry to quit
Or I just really used to love him, I sure hope that's it

[Verse 3]
Those boon times went bust, my feet of clay, they dried to dust
The red isn't the red we painted, it's just rust
And that signature thing that used to bring a following
I have trouble now even remembering

[Modified Chorus]
So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night?
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I'm either so sick in the head, I need to be bled dry to quit
Or I just really used to love him
Or I just really used to love him
Or I just really used to love him, I sure hope that's it

[Verse 1]
I opened my eyes while you were kissing me once
More than once
And you looked as sincere as a dog
Just as sincere as a dog does
When it's the food on your lips with which it's in love

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you could never tell
That I knew you didn't know me that well
It is my fault you see
You never learned that much from me

[Chorus]
Oh, you silly stupid pastime of mine
You were always good for a rhyme
And from the first to the last time
The sign said stop
But we went on wholehearted
It ended bad but I love what we started
It said stop
But we went on wholehearted
It ended bad but I love what we started

[Verse 2]
I took off my glasses while you were yelling at me once
More than once
So as not to see you see me react
Should've put 'em, should've put 'em on again
So I could see you see me sincerely yelling back

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet your fortress face
Belied your fort of lace
It is by the grace of me
You never learned what I could see

[Chorus]
Oh, you silly stupid pastime of mine
You were always good for a rhyme
And from the first to all the last times
All the signs said stop
But we went on wholehearted
It ended bad but I love what we started
It said stop
But we went on wholehearted
It ended bad but I love what we started
I know that it is freezing but I think we have to walk
Waving at the taxis; they keep turning their lights off
But Julie knows a party at some actor's west side loft
Supplies are endless in the evening; by the morning they'll be gone

When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend
I get a coffee and the paper; have my own conversations
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit

And I know you have a heavy heart; I can feel it when we kiss
So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
But me I'm not a gamble you can count on me to split
The love I sell you in the evening, by the morning won't exist

You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
You just keep going to the bathroom always say you'll be right back
Well it takes one to know one, kid, I think you've got it bad
But what's so easy in the evening, by the morning is such a drag

I've got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train
If you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same
We might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
But what was normal in the evening, by the morning seems insane
And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this
The reasons all have run away but the feeling never did
It's not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live
Cause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning never is

Why y'all keep on worrying 'bout what Flocka doin'

Good playin' but bad intentions
Talkin' long but the man didn't listen

Why you worry bout Gucci business like groupie bitches you all on my dick

That shit was wack as fuck

I was like, 'You won. Why are you posting your text message? Just chill. Take your W, and if you feel you didn't deserve it, go get better — make better music. It felt cheap. It didn't feel genuine. Why do that? Why feel guilt? You think those guys would pay homage to you if they won?

This is how the world works: He made a brand of music that appealed to more people than me, Hov, Kanye and Kendrick. Whether people wanna say it's racial, or whether it's just the fact that he tapped into something we can't tap into. That's just how the cards fall. Own your shit

To name just Kendrick? That shit made me feel funny. No, in that case, you robbed everybody. We all need text messages!

[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Intro: Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg]

I never commented on Yeezus for my interview portion of Rolling Stone. They also took my cover from me last minute and ran the issue

(Since deleted)
I'm disgusted with that. RIP to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. All respect due. But the press is evil

I'm done doing interviews for magazines. I just want to give my music to the people. That's the only way my message gets across accurately

[Verse 1]
If I had a pair of wings
I’d pick you up and fly you far away from here
And you’d put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can’t save you from the troubles of the world
And this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings

[Verse 2]
And if I had a pair of wings
I’d pick you and fly you far away from here
And we’d fly so high up in the sky
Where the stars are so clear
And then I could save you
From the troubles of the world
And all you’d have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big ol’ pair of wings

[Chorus]
We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It’s so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
But if I had one wish, I know what I’d wish for
There’s only one thing that will do
I’d fly away on this pair of wings with you

[Verse 3]
If I had a pair of wings
I’d scoop you up, we’d fly away and disappear
Then you could put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can’t save you from the troubles of the world
I know this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could, I’d fly you away
On a big old pair of wings

[Verse 4]
And if I had a pair of wings
I’d pick you up fly you far away from here
And I could stay right by your side and keep you so near
And then I could save you from the troubles of the world
And all you’d have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big ol' pair of wings

[Chorus]
We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It’s so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
But if I had one wish, I know what I’d wish for
There’s only one thing that will do
I’d fly away on this pair of wings with you

[Outro]
If I had one wish I know what I’d wish for
There’s only one thing that’ll do
I’d fly away on this pair of wings with you
If I had one wish I know what I’d wish for
There’s only one thing that’ll do
I’d fly away on this pair of wings with you

Roaming, zoning for them fancy hoes

Sprinkled with a little bit of fan girls
Pick one, slang a bit of chit chat
Let me see where this motherfucking shit's at
You got a boyfriend? Don't worry, I won't tell

Sorry guy, chicks dig big dicks
Here we go girl, room 6-6-6

[Verse 2: Ninja]
We keep it gangsta, put your fucking hands up
Rolling in a matte black Subaru
Met dik getinted vensters

Vodka in my OJ keep me warm
My lifestyle's wild, I party in the ghetto
Don't fuck with me, they'll find your body in a meadow
Got friends in low places, dark friends with no faces
Who rock sneaks with no laces
Rou chappies, no front teeth
Ninja's a mother fucking bad boy
The lucky fan girls know what I'm speaking about
Here we go girl, don't start chickening out

With today being the 5th anniversary of So Far Gone I figured it's fitting to return to it's place of its origin in order to clear the air about an extremely emotional day. I completely support and agree with Rolling Stone replacing me on the cover with the legendary Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He is one of the most incredible actors of our time and a man that deserves to be immortalized by this publication. My frustration stemmed from the way it was executed. The circumstances at hand are completely justifiable (on the magazines behalf), but I was not able to salvage my story or my photos and that was devastating. They ran the issue without giving me a choice to be in it or not. I would have waited until it was my time because I understand the magnitude of the cover they chose but I just wasn't given that option and that made me feel violated. I apologize to anybody who took my initial comments out of context because in no way would I ever want to offend the Hoffman family or see myself as bigger than that moment. I am still the same person. Today I was forced out of my character and felt the need to react swiftly. These days are the worst ones. Waking up after a great night in the studio and it's your day to be picked apart. After dwelling on it for a few hours or days you will come to the conclusion that you brought it on yourself almost every time. So here I am having that moment. I once again apologize to everybody who took my cover comments the wrong way. I respect Rolling Stone for being willing to give a kid from Toronto a shot at the cover. I guess this is a day to learn and grow.

Sincerely,

The Boy

Starting out with Berkeley Free Speech
And later on at People's Park
The winds of change fanned into flames
Student demonstrations spark
Down to Isla Vista where police felt so harassed
They called the special riot squad of the L. A. County Sheriff

Well there's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
Student demonstration time

The violence spread down South to where Jackson State brothers
Learned not to say nasty things about Southern policemen's mothers
Nothing much was said about it and really next to nothing done
The pen is mightier than the sword, but no match for a gun

Well there's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
Well there's a riot going on
Cause it's student demonstration time
America was stunned on May 4, 1970
When rally turned to riot up at Kent State University
They said the students scared the Guard
Though the troops were battle dressed
Four martyrs earned a new degree
The Bachelor of Bullets
I know we're all fed up with useless wars and racial strife
But next time there's a riot, well, you best stay out of sight

Well there's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
Well there's a riot going on
Student demonstration time

Stay away when there's a riot going on
Student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
Student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
Student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
It's student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
Student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
Student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
It's student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
Student demonstration

I don't know the way you do it, but you do it to me though
And you always told your girlfriends you need you a TV show
Now you got your own money, you don't need nobody else
But far as handlin' all that ass, I think you gon' need some help
Let me remind you, you got a, you got a great future behind you
You gotta tell me what we tryna do

I know good pussy when I see it, I'm a visionary
I know them haters talkin', always had us very wary
Yup! On the 35th of Nevuary
Yup! You love the way I'm turnt
After all the money you earned, still show daddy what you learned
That cowgirl, you reverse that cowgirl
You reverse, you reverse, and I impregnated your mouth, girl
Ooooh, that's when I knew you could be my spouse, girl
We fuckin' all over the house, girl
We just messed up a brand new couch, girl
If you ain't on site, then you on Skype
I put you on that bike, you bound, girl
We too wild, won't turn down
We drunk in love, fuck them

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club, drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wear it out
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin', grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin', swervin' on that
Big body Benz servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club, drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm nice right now... hold up!

[Verse 4: JAY-Z]
That D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve
Uh, foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge, I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
Ayo
Planes, trains, automobiles
The G500s with the auto-roll wheels
Pinot Grigio, got 'em on chill
See now, see me ho? I got that deal
If you tryna build, I bet you'd like to know that
My father was a Black Panther with Geronimo Pratt
And back in college, I ain't run with no frat
I just ran with the track that put the Chi on the map
Now the Roc in the buildin', UIC Pavilion
Two years ago I was just a civilian
Now every chick in here swear I got millions
In area codes with unidentified children

Hold up, I'm fuckin' up the rap

Every chick in here swear I got millions
In area codes with unidentified children
Put my hoodie on, blend in like a chameleon
Hear barbershop talk, niggas try to kill him
Take my hoodie off, they like "Ye waddup, you chillin'!"
Swear to god they just like children
Just like high school, back at my school
Just like Halloween minus the costumes
The niggas that's flickin' was the ones that's trickin'
The girls two seatin' was the ones that's treatin'
Do a test on relationship, everybody cheatin'
I used to want the Jordans that's most recent
Now I throw Jordans on the whip just to look decent
Just to get pulled over by the precinct, so frequent
It's like I'm back bein' a delinquent
They wanna know where I live, stay, and work
Why a young black nigga get all these perks
How I stack my paper, got Adidas in every flavor
Excuse me officer, I don't know Rod Laver
Or Stan Smith, what they don't understand is
How I got that color in canvas

[Intro]
Really no need for friends to call tonight
So, I’m…there’s really no need for friends to call tonight

[Verse 1]
Shawty, you my favorite
Please do me a favor, break this nature down to bacon bits
I ain't tryna argue when I tell you girl, "Just take that shit", problems that can wait and shit
Girl, quit actin' like it ain't more ain't money to be made and shit
Rock them heels and twerk up in the mirror to your dance song
Go and take a picture, shawty, get your Instagram on
I'm so interested in something you got
Got that type of pretty that should be up in a news spot, now do you want it?

[Chorus]

[2X]
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout how you put it down on a nigga
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout how you put it down on a nigga
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it

[Verse 2]
Know your man be fuckin' with your feelings girl
I got somethin' for you, somethin' for you, you can feel it girl
When you drop it down, that's that killer, girl
Let me get behind your lights, like plates up at the dealer, girl
Don't know what you heard, but shawty 5 for you,and 10 for me
Heard that you from T.O., but that ass looks like it's Tennessee
Can you take it round, after round, after round?
Throw it at me like you at the mound, at the mound oh, put it down

[Chorus]

[2X]
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout how you put it down on a nigga
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout how you put it down on a nigga
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it

[Verse 3]
Uh, drop it like it's for your favorite nigga though
Drop that shit like I just cut that check for seven figures though
Jacket back in '92, my daddy was that nigga though
I just need some time to do to exactly what that nigga do
We all back to ballin', someone please go let them strippers know
Fargo in the buildin' and he throwin' out tuition's hoe
All y'all don't even know I'm Mr. Round After Round
Throw it at me like you standin' at the mound, at the mound, get it now

[Chorus]

[2X]
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout how you put it down on a nigga
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout how you put it down on a nigga

A Glock a magnum & a rusty M3
Rom pom pom pom we don't want no rom pom pom pom

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Welcome to hell I let em burn
Momma told me don't play with them choppas I never learn

Killas hold court in the street court is adjourned
These niggas sleepin hope they keep it in they napsack
Watch me while I'm creepin leave em leakin like a flap jack
Hustle all day like we eatin on the last stack
We play with ak's boy you need to bring that mac back
Hand gun, me no want no hand gun
Tote a shotty with a bass drum
Say somethin I'm from where them niggas can't come
We die rich & young
We die handsome and

The streets can see what you can't see
You ain't safe, you ain't free

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Survival of the fittest
It is well known there's no water like my city's
Some of us are killers some of them are jus swimmers
Niggas got choppas niggas got trimmers
Niggas got problems niggas got business
Niggas got children niggas got bitches
Bitches got bitches
I know bitches realer then you
Nigga I done seen keys bigger then you
Yeah nigga you ain't on shit
Cut off a nigga head make him suck his own dick
No he don't want that & he don't want this
I shoot a hundred times I be blind if I miss
You know I gotta put the dollar sign before the bitch
Every movie gotta end but I'm just stickin to the script
Addicted to the chips commited to my clique
Cash money mother fucker get the pistol to your lips

[Verse 1]
I've been mixin', I've been sippin'
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number
I'll call you back if that head right baby
I won't love you, I can't love you
Unless that pussy got some super powers
I want you, now now
I'm not trying to fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now

[Chorus]
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night
The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love

[Verse 2]
Wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
She the one in the back, nose running from the blow
And we did it on the floor, that's why she walkin' kind of funny
Should've never put us on, bitch I'm only 24
And everybody salty, niggas stop your bitchin'
Everybody makin' money, we don't need to kick it
I'm chillin' with my niggas, everybody got a crib
Did an album just to do it, droppin' albums like a pill
Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
Faded for a week, I don't sleep, fuck my enemies
Try to stay sane is like a full-time hobby
Everything I do, fake niggas always copy
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
Dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers
I woke up in the mornin', models passed out in the shower

[Chorus]
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night

Where are you going, Thug?
To her spot
When she get out the shower, drink her bathtub
Inside the club, shoot his ass up
Play with me - get hit with these bucks
Pass me the pump
Leave him short like a stump
Feel like Donald Trump
I made Forbes List this month
But come here, babygirl
I know you want go to Thug's world
I buy you diamonds and pearls
You've got the best of both worlds

[Hook]
Babygirl, I miss you

Oh yeah, I miss you

You turned up to the max
These niggas can't diss you
Ain't talking about no deed
But you know I miss you

Ric Flair

[Verse 1]
Wake up, it's a beautiful morning
Honey, while the sun is still shining
Wake up, would you like to go with me?
Honey, take a run down to the beach

[Chorus]
Oh, mama, I wanna go surfing
Oh, mama, I don't care about nothing

[Verse 2]
Wake up, there's a new kid in the town
Honey, he's moving into the big house
Remember when I was so very hopeless?
Darling, he's gonna make it all better

[Chorus]
Oh, mama, I wanna go surfing
Oh, mama, I don't care about nothing

Sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go
Down, down, baby, down by the roller coaster

Down, down, baby, down by the roller coaster
Sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go
Down, down, baby, down by the roller coaster
Sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go

[Verse 1]
You'd think I would know
All the answers to the questions before I get old
But I've spent too much time thinking
And I've spent too much time doing
It's time to go

[Chorus]
And I need fun
In my life
And I need life
In my fun

[Verse 2]
Oh, I took a walk yesterday all around New York City
And I saw something written on a car
It said "The less you own the more freedom you have"
The less you own the more freedom you have
So I went home and I threw it all away

[Chorus]
And I need fun
In my life
And I need life
In my fun
Celebration
You know we're gonna do it right
Tonight

Music's got me feelin' the need

Celebrate and dance so free
One more time

Music's got me feelin' so free
We're gonna celebrate
Celebrate and dance so free
One more time

[Verse 1]
Told me, darling, you had to go
Find somebody, I don't care no more, baby
Although you're happy, you better try to get along
(Get along without me)

[Chorus]
Money won't change you
I said money won't change you (Hey, hey)
No, money won't change you
But time is taking you on (Uh-huh)
Yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
There have been times that I've been hurt (Hurt)
I sure know what it is to be treated just like dirt
Hold me, baby, and tell the world
Tell them I'm your sweetie, I'm your only girl

[Chorus]
Money won't change you (No, no)
I said money won't change you
But time is taking you on (Time)
Yes, it is (Time)
Oh

But money won't change you
I say money won't change you (No)
Oh, money won't change you, no no

Money won't change you (Hey, hey)
I tell you money won't change you
But time will take you on (Time)

They say the soul snatcher's coming
To snatch our spirits from the club so we can
Get away, get away, get away
For all those caught up in the hatrix
And not tryin' to practice love, we can
Get away, get away, get away
Gotta build our records stronger
Make them faster for the show, we can
Get away, get away, get away
Come on let's fly to Paris
The city in the bubble, so we can
Get away, get away, get away

[Produced by Cosmo Vitelli]

What's going on?
Could this be my understanding?
It's not your fault I was being too demanding
I must admit it's my pride that made me distant
All because I hoped that you'd be someone different
There's not much I know about you
Fear will always make you blind
But the answer is in clear view
It's amazing what you'll find face to face

I turned away because I thought you were the problem
Tried to forget until I hit the bottom
But when I faced you in my blank confusion
I realized you weren't wrong, it was a mere illusion

It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you're finally gettin' involved face to face

[Produced by Demon]

There's not much I know about you
Fear will always make you blind
It's not hard to go the distance
It's amazing what you'll find face to face

There's not much I know about you
Fear will always make you blind
It's not hard to go the distance
It's amazing what you'll find face to face

Still it's all I think of

[Chorus]
Just one more time
One more time, babe
One more time

[Verse 2]
You know I give my all to you
I just can’t help myself
Now I’m gonna comfort you
Until there’s nothing left

[Chorus]
Just one more time
One more time, babe
Let's make love
Good love, so good love

[Bridge]
Now listen
One more time
We can celebrate
And love so free
The music got me
Feelin' the need, the need, babe
One more time
We can celebrate
And dance so free
Love has got me feelin' the need
The need, babe, need, babe
Uh, Listen

[Verse 3]
You wanna know if it's real
The feelin' that you feel
You wanna know if it's finally
Do it one more time, baby
It’s all, it's all good
Just one more time
One more time, baby
Let's make that love
Oh, you go to work
I make it hurt, hurt

The Grid
A digital frontier
I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer
What do they look like?
Ships? Motorcycles?
Were the circuits like freeways?
I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see
And then, one day, I got in

[Hook] x2
I'm the shit bitch, I'm the shit bitch
I'm the shit bitch, I'm the shit bitch
Look at my neck, DAMN
Look at my wrist, DAMN
Look at my bitch, DAMN
Look at my fit, DAMN

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane you think I'm handsome huh
Prolly cuz I got dat phantom huh
I'll ride your ass through east Atlanta skate
I'll make your girlfriend start to hate
Now I can't make you any promises
But I might buy a couple outfits
Make you look like you supposed to look
Gucci shoes, matching pocketbooks

[Hook] x2
I'm the shit bitch, I'm the shit bitch
I'm the shit bitch, I'm the shit bitch
Look at my neck, DAMN
Look at my wrist, DAMN
Look at my bitch, DAMN
Look at my fit, DAMN

[Verse 2 - Black Magic]
It's Black Magic nigga we keep the waves and
Walk like I'm floating on air I'm so amazing
And make sure my bullets go through you, fuck grazing
I'm itching just to shoot one of you fuck niggas hating
And you could be a hustler, I'm used to taking
Hockey mask, all black down just like I'm Jason
Too much time wasting, put em on the pavement
Next day see his bitchass on front pages

[Hook] x2
I'm the shit bitch, I'm the shit bitch
I'm the shit bitch, I'm the shit bitch
Look at my neck, DAMN
Look at my wrist, DAMN

[Verse 3 - Gucci Mane]
I'll make you envied by another chick
Make you wanna fight another bitch
Make you wanna suck a nigga dick
Make you wanna eat another bitch
Now I'm gon' take you out to eat and shit

[Intro]
My cold cold sailor heart says get on your way
I ain't to proud to say but that's how I'm made
I'll be that person till my dying day
I try so awful hard but I can't change

[Verse 1]
From runways to the road I ramble alone
This thumbnail size of heart is as black as coal
Through beauty it still brings me to my knees
Don't waste a tear on me it's my disease

[Chorus 1]
Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I'll blow off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me

[Verse 2]
Those preppy boys in blue they make fun of us
So we take it to the street 'cause we are an ornery curse
But we're not here to make your children bleed
We're here to cover ground with a tumbleweed

[Chorus 2]
Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I'll blow off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me

Now guitar, go get her

[Verse 3]
Don't take these boots off me when you think that I'm dead
I'll still be running from the demon in my head
I'll be that person till my dying day
I try so awful hard but I can't change

[Chorus 3]
Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I'll blow off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no, no smell

[Verse 1]
Hoffman don't take no nonsense
He's here to rectify
He's got his black belt buckle
And the red man's fire in his eye

[Chorus]
You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cock fight
Four kicks, who's strutting now?

[Verse 2]
This party's overrated
But there ain't shit else to do
She's-a loving on the boy from the city
I'll be loving him under my shoe

[Chorus]
You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cock fight
Four kicks, who's strutting now?
You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cock fight
Four kicks, who's strutting now?

[Verse 1]
Caught up in a blizzard yesterday
Ought to be alone, or so I say
I needed a change of scenery
She was really starting to annoy me

[Verse 2]
I went out shopping and planned to go to all them vintage stores
Then I got tired and ended up in some lame department store
And that's okay, cause I found a really cool belt and..

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

[Verse 3]
I have a commitment Friday night
First I say my prayer then I'm alright
I sit in my chair, you dim the light
When I look I stare with inner sight

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

[Bridge]
Met up with some friends for Thai food
I liked it but wasn't in the mood
Can't you see that I'm just feeling blue?
What I do’s got nothing to do with you

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you
Part I: "Soul On Ice (Diamond D Remix)" - Ras Kass

[Verse]
The final problem is solved by throwin' sulfuric acid all over your back to see your spinal column dissolve
Droppin' bodies like it was domino season
My phenomenal legion will shoot out
Your fuckin' abdominal region
Slim Shady, responsible for your permanent stillness
Just escaped from the hospital with terminal illness
Itchin' to rip your fuckin' frame out
'Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
Like that movie that just came out
Callin' your name out, first, last and your middle initial
Your mom, your dad, and your pregnant widow will miss you
And anybody else poppin' some shit'll go with you
'Cause I ain't tryna hear it like a political issue
So until I can leave with enough funds
I'mma shove guns up in the mouths of your loved ones
Drown 'em face down in the bath while the tub runs
Got a rap sheet that's longer than Tubby's sub buns
Part II

[Verse]
And I'ma kill it, just so y'all think that I can't come off the top
And I'll be forced to rock unorthodox styles from off the top of the dome with a popular poem
Forget a damn team, I can stop you alone
Rappers thinkin' they puttin' out they records 'cause they sell
But they can't't fuck with what me– we doin' here with A.L
Y'all don't wanna do it when we kick it
When we kick the fluid, rappers don't wanna get into it
Y'all knew it 'cause the feds want me
They headhunt me, I'm Ted Bundy
"I ain't dead, I just fled country"
Said bluntly, a cannibal, animal, fed monthly
Eating bread crunchy, cement bed's comfy
Head's lumpy, funky like a dead skunk be
Med flunkie, jump off cliffs with thread bungie
Wearin' red undies and a black cape
Rollin' through the hood cracked out bumpin' your whack tape
I'm comin' through dumpin'
Change your rap name to Richard Jewell
Cause you ain't blowing up nothing
I'm showin' up puffin'
Throwin' up, drinkin'
Killin' braincells 'til I'm slow and not thinkin'
Growin' up stinkin', born with bad odor
Give me Hennessy, but please don't add soda
Now who's doper? You couldn't beat me when I'm sober
I'm off my fuckin' rocker like your grandma tippin' over, Slim Shady

"Son, where you from son?"
"Yo, I'm from Detroit city"
"Uh huh"
"I'm bout to do a little something like this
A little something like this."
"Ok, drop that shit."
"Bust it, bust it"

Yo, I hang with a bunch of hippies
And wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz baby, and we suin' the courts
Cause we dope as fuck and only get a two in the Source
Yo, they never shoulda booted me outta reform school
Deformed fool, taking a shit in a warm pool
Till they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin
(Oh my God, it's you! Not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cause I murdered my guinea pig
And stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the forty ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Forget the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said "Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is phys-ed"
Maybe true, 'til I told this girl in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps she need a Slim Fast
(Who? Me?) Yeah, girl you so big
You stepped, walked into Vic Tanny's
And stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin'
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Picked that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground
And threw her up to the highest
Diving board to toss her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this girl face down and watch her belly flop, cause it's like that
And I come in and I start wildin' and shit
Then I be busting a lyric
And rappers don't believe I'm freestyling it
Well here it goes when I'm kicking lyrical flows
From your head to your toes
So that every rapper in this place knows
Cause when it comes to the freestyle
Coming off of the top of the dome
I'm knocking your mouth and ya off, so who you copying off?
Stop being soft, I'm standing on top of your loft
Killing you off slowly, like Roberta Flack
I've never heard of wack
MCs that try to step to me, I'll break your verta-back
Or vertebrae, increase the murder rates
In 79 states... Yo, check it
I'm bout to pass the mic to the next
MC who wanna step up and flex
With the techs, but make sure your shit is fresh
Come on, wreck it, who wanna be next?

It goes like this:
Broke the rubber, busted a nut up in your mother
So how do you feel about having another little brother
Nasty motherfucker, talking trash like a trucker
Snatch your bitch up out your track
I'll smack her up and fucked her
Always talk shit high, smoking chocolate Thai
So y'all can die, just for walking by giving an awkward eye
I've lost my motherfucking marbles
Smelling like a brewery
Droolin' at the way your jewelery sparkles
Head full of charcoal, smoked out brain particles
Burning holes in clothes articles
A retarded fool since I started school
Burned the weed before I learned to read, disregarded rules
Skip the classes to blaze the blunt ashes
Kissing front dashes from smashing up
Cars like stunt crashes
Hall passes for restrooms, chewing mushrooms
Doing rush fumes in the lunch room
Looking nervous, liquor in my thermos
Hung with hermits that carry guns without permits
Staring at the bitch with firm tits
Jacking off, aiming straight for both lips when my sperm spits


Set it off
Rappers get beheaded if they soft
Yo they get they wires crossed
Rappers try to step to me but I'm so ill I'll fire your boss
And this is all freestyle, killing it
While I'm filling it with adrenaline, rappers be feeling it
Like it was braille, so y'all can touch me anywhere
Cause I want you to feel me
Rappers wanna kill me, but they don't thrill me
So check it, I'm bout to wreck when I make the record
Cause I'm, skinny like an anorexic girl headed for the exit
Running butt naked away from just being date raped
Rappers? I twist 'em into a great shape
And throw 'em in the Great Lakes
'Cause I'm from the Michigan state
For fishermans' sake, I throw 'em and toss 'em in
Rappers try to step to me
But this is the Holocaust and you'll never win
Cause I've forever been bent, forever demented
Rappers try to step to me but their shit is sweet-scented
And I'm demented, and if I said it I meant it
Killin' any MC cause I'm Infinite, and when it
Comes to the way that I'm spittin' lyrical infinite ammunition
And putting a clip in this lyrical track that I just be rippin'
Crushing it, killing it, taking your best line and hushing it
Taking your shit and flushing it down the toilet
Taking your biggest plot and foil it
Rappers can't uncoil it, I'll take my shit and aluminum foil it
Then throw it in the microwave and watch burn up
'Cause I'mma blow up
Rappers? I make 'em ill enough to throw up
Don't show up if you come to the battle


"Can I speed it up? Just a little bit?
Alright that's cool. Alright
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
This one for Quest."

Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit changed
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O' that I sniffed of 'caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science
Motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
You getting spun backwards
Like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stopping your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your
Ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in the hospital and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit
And do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'mma no a head-butt so hard, I knock us both out
No doubt

[Intro: Big Sean]
Big Sean
Can't get to the phone right now
So make sure you leave your name, number and a brief message
I'll make sure I'll return your call soon, take care

[Verse: Big Sean]
This has been pre-meditated
Dedicated to them hella haters, said I'd never make it
Would've never made it if they didn't prescribe
Hella hating like a medication
Now they feel dumb like they uneducated
Cause they estimated no benefits
I should prolly call 'em all "Benedict"
Cause they been a dick since I been in in it
Now I'm finna run this bitch like Emmitt did
So ahead can't picture me, they primitive, dawg
You paid for my penmanship, dawg
Wanna be my apprentice, uh naw
Cause they didn't think I'd be good, now I be G.O.O.D
So they wanna call me like Tweet would
Saying "Get this money like we should!"
Like we should, nigga?
Ain't you that same hating ass nigga
Faking ass, two-facing ass nigga
Had my songs, didn't play 'em ass nigga
Talking 'bout "We gon' make it", ass nigga?
Well, now I got the beat right
Produced by my nigga B. Wright
To all of my fam and friends
Leave a message at the beep, aight?
One

[Verse 1]
We don't have no plastic L.A. friends
We aren't on the edge of no popular trends
Have never seen the inside of that magazine GQ
We don't care if your a lawyer, or a Texas oil man
Or some waitress busting ass at some liquor stand
But if you got soul, we hang out with people just like you

[Chorus]
And my hair's turning white, my neck's always been red, my collar's still blue
We've always been here, just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say, we've always been red white and blue

[Verse 2]
We ride our own bikes to Sturgis
Pay our own dues
Smoking Camels and drinking domestic brews
If you want to know where I've been, just look at my hands
Yeah I've driven by the White House, spent some time in jail
Mama cried all night but she still wouldn't pay my bail
I have been no angel, but even God he understands!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well my Daddy worked hard, and so have I
We payed our taxes and gave our lives to serve this great country
So what are they complaining about?
Yeah, we love our families, we love our kids
Don't you know its love that makes us all so rich
That's where it's at, if they don't like it they can just, get the Hell out!

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Intro]
Classic, Young Gotti
Gangsta, gangsta

[Verse 1]
Look, swallow your pride and then eat a dick
Make the Ruler's apologize you ain't ruling the shit
I'm Rick Rubin in 85 with the beard thick
Dick bitch tight the movie and slanted eyes that squinch
I tell you that I'm one up, sun down then sun up
Son, I son niggas I probably fucked up your mama
No condom, it's good pussy
Pussy, tell it to your honor that this trauma is Jeffrey Dahmer
Took me too many moons set up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kicked, pushed with push broom
Man look, your man, look like sweet water
Corn bread to break under pressure if he's caught up
Big homie said I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off
I'm just a  young boss with a bat cave
Back against the wall closer my back came back with them back pains, whoa
Tell em put my name on the blimp
Ball like I'm Derrick Rose you should know my gym
You playa's not allowed I'm sparking your game towels
And spikn' your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul
I'm in the crowd like Artest and them
I move the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not this basket but rather the good pussy that I'm in
I assassin you niggas I make you wait shake in
Blank tapes in your deck, niggas still break their neck
They hear it you need plans with the label just to spin
I need to clear it with the bank just to win
Club accounts go 15 racks when you wet like that shit
It's gotta be a sin. Hm. so Lord forgive me I'm a sinner
Hm. These hoes squeeze me cause I'm a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner, I coat food and the..tools make my agenda
I show fools I'm nasty like tofu I wish a
Motherfucker would get your whole career injured
This assault what a deadly weapon
Guilt your favourite rapper, favourite rapper last record
We fucked your baby actress on the map just what a blessing
Make that pussy ante up she call my dick anti-depressive
I'm really not depressed with, none of you niggas stressing
That's some of you niggas bless with the gift to carry the presence
A big in Pac and pop with..and with investments
15 minutes come up with 60 seconds
Last month I've been six hours inside of session
Came up with shit writers block niggas up in this stressing
Like who the fuck cares? who the fuck cares? Even if you get drunk up
Still be a millionaire
You could play a Santa Claus and make sure you're the whole dear
Every verse I put that bitch in the hearse, while boy stear
Uh Church to your pussy and push me get pack..
Verse that you cookie I read it my foot is here big boy
Alright
And you don't stop, and it don't stop
And you don't stop
And it don't stop
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop

[Verse 2]
This be that shit that make real niggas grab they dick
And bitches rubbin' on they tits as if they think this monkeys rich
Monkey see what monkey do, you monkeys never make no tips
Climbup the tree shit on you
Paranoid the shit and bricks that can build the castle
Hastle and breaking your picket fence
I know pterodactyls that still exist
Clappin if you resist to cooperate, go home and see their daughters go..
You at risk if you wear bracelet, we want your wrist
We can taste it from planet pluto
Dog Gonnit you panic just like a poodle rip out your culo then kudos
Two door Regals, El Caminos, and two more
Sevilles with the whitewalls, wipe it off with my shoe ho
I feel you just menthol, meant to get smoked and sent off to your maker
Trace your..with no the ..coach
Mean ain't no hood high up in California and G watches snoops
Ladies press down I bet you dog watchin, west coast what's up?
Gangsta, gangsta you don't stop

And you don't, and you don't and you don't
And you don't, and you don't and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't stop
Yeah, ah
1 2, LA what's at it with it
Kendrick Lamar
You dig that, we out here

[Verse 3]
Me while I'm in Compon stomping through the swamp to swap meet
Going back to L.A. ya'll
Tryin to see what's poppin
You cannot stop me
Jay Rock, SchoolBoy, Top Dog Entertainment
We the best, with the west
Who can blame me
I've been put up on all the OG's
Dre Snoop, Quick Easy E
DJ Quick and now it's me
Then you see game, now we finna change
The whole fucking game smash it know you lames
Compton you should already know the name yeah we pop it
I shout out the whole westside because I got it like that
And if we had it once then we got it right back
And if you ever had it you won't have it no more
And if we see the back though we to the front door
Taking your bread, crucifying everybody off with their head
This is freestyle of the top of the dome
And you know Big Boi that's my home
What's up?
And you do stop, and you do stop, and you do stop
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do stop

[Intro]
Oh baby, I don't know what to do with myself
Oh honey, I don't know what to do with myself
I'm sleeping in the kitchen (Sleeping in the kitchen)
I'm eating in the bedroom (Eating in the bedroom)
And everything is backwards (And everything is backwards)
I wish I never met you (I wish I never met you)

[Chorus]
And I don't know what to do
When I see you holding someone else's hand
And I don't know what to say
Cause when I open my mouth I always sound so stupid
How am I gonna make you mine?
How am I gonna make you mine?

[Verse 1]
Oh baby, I don't know how you live with yourself
Sweet honey, you know I don't want nobody else
I'm sleeping through the day (Sleeping through the day)
Oh, I'm moping through the night (Moping through the night)
I hope you love me some day (You love me some day)
So I can hold you through the night (Can hold you through the night)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And I don't know what to do
When I see you holding someone else's hand
And I don't know what to say
Cause when I open my mouth I always sound so stupid

[Chorus]

[Juelz Santana:]
Ay yo Weezy--you ready to get at these niggas, man?

[Lil Wayne:]
You already got em

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Who you? Weezy Baby
I do what the fuck I wanna come from the corner they call (what?)
Apple and Eagle where your mama didn't want you at all (yep!)
Packing them heaters in the heat of the morning
Strapping them kilos in that seat of that Honda--we armored!
Back in the geo-quarter key was the normal
Jack a nigga if he hurtin' not believing in karma but
What if he armed and what if he ready to shoot?
We strap up shut the fuck up and dippity do what we gotta
Who we gotta,when we gotta
It's murder murder mur murder murder, don't think about it
One thing about it them niggas hoes they ain't about it
Complain about it and ain't around it, shame on 'em
I gain honor, fame, power, money, bitches
More problems and more guns, simple addition
Plus, I got choppers on the hog
Homie on bed rest head doctor on call
I got a masseuse who'd rather seduce me
Now everytime she hear my name she salute me
Bitch nigga do you cause I know Imma do me
Born from New Orleans you gon have to shoot me

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Streets my heart I love her to the core
But she just like a bitch, man she fucking with them all
So, I'm strapped up never coming in the raw
Magnum when I'm coming through the door, whats it for? (you know)
And I ain't talkin condom, nigga, I'm talkin 45 palm a nigga, launch a nigga back
Send him back home with his back blown to the point where you can see his back bone stickin out
I stick it out when it's drought time, too
Make it work like the first I'm about mines dude (ya know)
I get it crackin I'm about my moves
Don't step on these Gators I'm about my shoes (boy!)
And you don't want me to step out my shoes and step out my groove and let out my tools
The hammer kill, the hammer will make you stop, drop and roll like you slipped on a banana peel
Live by the code and honor honor the code
Stop snitchin, be a man nigga honor your role
I stick by the stove, when I'm on it it's on
You see that coke turn to oil it's on, nigga it's on
You see that hard base and the water is soft
Gimme that ice lemme show you it's on, nigga it's on
I'm sellin heavy things, down to anything
Bricks, half quarters, I got everything ya digg?
Aye

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Come equipped with them sizzlers for the blizzard
Here's a sick sickle for you and your lil niggas
Elz, Imma get em--they bitches they just bitches
Just bought a new Glock 40 shots hair trigger
Shots through the driver side that mean the driver died
Car crash kill the passenger double homicide
We in all black like Amistad
They call my crew old school cause we walk around with 99s
Millimeters red dot find the spot
Head shot body drop
Two fingers I'm out
Gunslinger Hollygrove, Fireman kinda hot
Tie yo ass up and leave ya body in the loadin docks
New Orleans rollin rock Syrup in the soda pop
I can get rich all I need is a stove
And I'll stand over that bitch til them thangs get swole
And I'll work that corner in the heat or the cold
I'm good

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah

[Intro]
Now this could only happen to a guy like me
And only happen in a town like this
So may I say to each of you most gratefully
As I throw each one of you a kiss, this is...

[Verse 1]
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of people, too
People who smile at you
And each time I roam, Chicago is
Calling me home, Chicago is
Why I just grin like a clown
It's my kind of town

[Verse 2]
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of razzmatazz
And it has all that jazz
And each time I leave, Chicago is
Tuggin' my sleeve, Chicago is
The Wrigley Building, Chicago is
The Union Stockyard, Chicago is
One town that won't let you down
It's my kind of town!

[Hook]
The childhood part of my life
It wasn't very pretty
You see, I was born and raised
In the slums of the city
It was a one room shack that slept
Ten other children beside me
We hardly had enough food
Or room to sleep

It was hard times
Needed something to ease
My troubled mind

Mmm, listen
My father didn't know
The meaning of work
He disrespected Mama
And treated us like dirt
I left home seeking a job
That I never did find
Depressed and downhearted
I took to Cloud Nine
I'm doing fine
Up here, on Cloud Nine
Listen, one more time
I'm doing fine
Up here, on Cloud Nine

Folks down there tell me
They say, "Give yourself a chance, son
Don't let life pass you by
But the world of reality is a rat race
Where only the strongest survive
It's a dog-eat-dog world
And that ain't no lie
Listen, it ain't even safe no more
To walk the streets at night"

I'm doing fine on Cloud Nine
Let me tell you about Cloud Nine

(Cloud Nine)
You can be what you wanna be
(Cloud Nine)
You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud Nine)
And every man, every man is free
(Cloud Nine)
And you're a million miles from reality
(Reality) I wanna sail upper, higher
Upper, up, up, and away
Cloud Nine
I wanna say I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love
Up here on Cloud Nine
I-I-I-I-I, I'm riding high

(On Cloud Nine)
You're as free as a bird in flight
(Cloud Nine)
There's no difference between day and night
(Cloud Nine)
It's a world of love and harmony
(Cloud Nine)
You're a million miles from reality
(Reality) I wanna sail upper, higher
Upper, up, up, and away

(Cloud Nine)
You can be what you wanna be
(Cloud Nine)
You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud Nine)
Every man in his mind is free
(Cloud Nine)
You're a million miles from reality
(Cloud Nine)
You can be what you wanna be

[Verse 1]
Many lovers has come, and
Many lovers have gone
Similar to an old fashion song
(A thousand years from now
We'll be still putting it down my baby)
You can change the frame
But the picture remains the same
Similar to the sun after the rain
(Thousand years from now, we'll
Be still puttin' it down my baby)

[Pre hook]
Baby girl in other words for ever more
I'll be here. (I'll be here)

[Hook]
My whole world goes around
Because you spin me yeah (spin me)
And every time we're done making love girl

[Verse 2]
Some believes in love
And some people don't
Similar to a story, when it's told
A thousand years from now
We'll be still puttin' down my baby
Some have cross the finish line and some gave up
It's like moving a mountain
Love can be just that tough yeah
(A thousand years from now)
(We'll be still putting it down, my baby)
Baby girl in other words for ever more
I'll be here. (I'll be here.)
Cause my whole has been full of joy since
You came here...Girl

[Hook]
My whole world goes around
Because you spin me yeah (spin me)
And every time we're done making love girl

Know how to follow the rules of this game. Aight?
Listen. When I sing, I want everybody out there
To do what ever I sing. Aight? Come on

[Bridge]
Step Step Side to side
Round and round, Dip it now
Separate, bring it back...
Let me see you do the
Love slide

Step Step Side to side
Round and round, Dip it now
Separate, bring it back...
Let me see you do the

[Hook]

And every time we're done making love girl

And every time we're done making love girl
You makes me wanna

[Outro]
Listen, Love brought us together
So keep on steppin' because
Love's gonna last forever
Clap in the name of love
Let's step out, hit the club
DJ's rockin' that song for us
If anybody ask, why we're steppin'
Tell them that:
We did it for love

Dedicated to Uncle Henry Love:Thank you!
Ohh, I love you Thank you

[Intro]

Do you understand? Forever

We will be here forever, do you understand that?
Get what I'm saying, forever

Very fancy when I do my thing to the drum

Can't let you get the best of me
Amateur ? ?
Leave his ass in bandages
My homeboy doing 40 years, I don't know how he manages
All you niggas tryna handle me, but I know how to handle it
Hit the block, shoot 50 shots

Chopper shoot a thousand rounds when you're war ready
Just another mama cryin' cause we're war ready

A coward dies a thousand deaths, a real nigga dies but one

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Box Chevy hit the block, run the whole 50 shots

And these mothafuckas think you can't drop 'em no more
All right, a nigga put some change on your head
Damn right, fuck around, clear my safe out
I got a few digi scales and a couple Denzels
And you mothafuckin' right, this a safe house
Give me the K and a shovel, I'll bury that nigga
Be his pallbearer, so I can carry that nigga
What you gonna hit him with, the Glock or the chop?
Look I wouldn't give a fuck if they were sharin' that nigga
You mothafuckas out here always talkin' 'bout what another mothafucka said
Yeah I got that FNH when that mothafucka finna hostin'

Tomorrow ain't promised, nigga roll up that weed
Gotta stay strapped to live the life I lead
Start your own alphabet with all them G's
Open up a hundred doors with all them keys

Missed his court date, now my nigga on the run
Big shit poppin' in his pocket like a lighter

Darling, you can be so unforgiving
You can be so unloving
You can be misunderstanding
But I don't know how to feel without your love

So tell me what to do

[Chorus]
It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky
It's a lovely night with that look in your eye
But you still sleep with your back to me
Is it me and you or is it me and the moon?

[Verse 2]
Oh baby, I thought that you forgave me
I thought that you still loved me
Don't you need me?

I want it forever
(Forever, forever, forever)
(Forever, forever, forever)
(Forever, forever, forever)

[Chorus]
It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky
It's a lovely night with that look in your eye
But you still sleep with your back to me
Is it me and you or is it me and the moon?

It's a lovely night with the moon in the sky
It's a lovely night with that look in your eye
But you still sleep with your back to me
Is it me and you?

It's another night with the moon in the sky
It's another night with that look in your eye
But you still sleep with your back to me
Is it me and you? Or is it me and the moon?

[Verse 1]
Before I die, I'd like to do something nice
Take my hand, and I'll take it for a ride
You hit me yesterday, because I made you cry
So before we die, I'd like to do something nice

[Chorus]
I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money
I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money

[Verse 2]
And if I had a car I would trade in my car
If I had a gun I would trade in my gun
Honey, we ran from the country when we rushed to the city
And now there's nothin' to be done
There's nothin' to be done
There's nothin' to be done
There's nothin' to be done

[Chorus]
I want to buy you somethin'
But I don't have any money

[Verse: Eminem]
Come in spittin', with not writtin', non-fiction
Rappers try to step to this, with no prediction
It doesn't matter cause I'm smashin' and bashin' and crashin'
I hate rappers with a passion when I'm chilling with DJ Fashion
Yo, I need a frickin' kleenex, so I die like River Phoenix
When I'm chillin with Phoneix, with two Coronas
I'm on the microphone and I'm a own this
Yo, and I'm a bone this in Arizona
Yo, rappers that ain't able
That can't stay stable, I'm on two turn tables
With my man, but he doesn't matter cause he kicks lyrics galore
And he's only five foot four
Yo check it out I bust rhymes and get, groovy
My man got carded at a rated R movie
But it really didn't matter, he wasn't insulted
He said I'm 27 years old, yo, I'm an adult, kid
But, yo still, Slim Shady gets ill with the skill
And I'm a always bill and kill, my baby's mama
Just to piss the world off, just to piss the girls off
Yo I earl off
The top of the building, kill women and children
And then it hit me
Suddenly my wrists tried to slit me
Couldn't believe it, yo, ya'll can't conceive it
It's Slim Shady, I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage
Bleep that out, and you can keep it, just bleep it
Yo, y'all keep it a secret
I'm top secret, like pop secret
Rappers they don't wanna see
Slim Shady, I'm from the motherfucking, D
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha-ha-ha
Yo, yo Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I guess they want a reaction
But I ain't gonna give it to 'em
Yeah they tryna get at me yeah but I ain't gonna feed into it
Ooh they been persistent tryna break me down

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
They can’t take what’s mine
Someone like me is hard to find
Ooh I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hoping

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Hoping you would change me, hoping you would make me lose my mind)
Way too strong for that, you know you were wrong for that
So keep on chasing that 458 as I cruise on the smooth highway
I ain't even tryna' get away, I'm good, they try to break me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Blake Kelly]
Hoping and praying I really won't make it, all of these dreams, they tried to forsake me
How you gon' play me? How you gon' break me? I've been in this ish since diapers and babies
All my life, been driving them crazy, there go the Blakey, thought of them ladies
Dreaming of Benz, and kissing Mercedes, living the life, the life is so crazy
I need some cameras, hundreds and ladies, how you expect me not to go crazy?
Never been lazy, never been shady, lost a few friends, the monies still gravy
We the new stars, that's why they still hating, money up front, we never be waiting
Save some and invest some, just let my money be patient
It's a cold world we that we live in, diamonds all in my pendant
They wish Satan tellers was in itthen they'd prey for me to be finished
Them haters gon' start tripping when you don't pay them no attention
And the obstacle I might face, I guarantee that I kill it

[Chorus]

[Hook]
And when they hear that new Weezy
All the dough boys go crazy
And watch the dough boys go crazy

Yea but now i'm rockin ya speakers
I'm all grown up now i'm rockin with divas yea
I could rock 'em to sleep
But I rather be at home straight rockin the kibeler
I'm up in traffic bobbin and weavin
I'm in and out like pussy and penis
It's lunch time I'm a cook up genious(yea)
20 for Serena 10 for the Venus
Yea i can get ya higher then a tennis skirt
Never filled out a application got plenty work

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm lookin at 24 bricks on the counter
I'll make them dissapear in 24 hours (gone)
(yea) i'm really so honest that hot boy shit it's really so behind us
We on some new shit you niggas can't find us
That's like lookin in the rough for a diamond
We might hook a nigga up on consignment
And for the rest his life we keep an eye on 'em
Bussiness bad, fuck you pay me
Oh you had a fire, fuck u pay me
I'm might run through 80 in a week
But i can make a quarter million dollars off 1 street
Top in the game off one feet
Then i landed on two and i walked on through
What can you do when you living like me
Get fly in the house leave the pimpin in the street
As quiet as a mouse when you dippin through the street
If you lookin for some work you probably run into me
And on the humble the number still cheap
But the judge got numbers for a nigga to steep
Yea from a youngin to a g
Weezy baby from bundle to a key

[Hook]
And when they hear that new weezy all the dough boys go crazy
And watch the dough boys go crazy
Weezy f. ya heard yea i do it for the money baby that's my word
And when they hear that new weezy it remind them of that old baby
93 94 baby yea before the stunna yea the real bird man

[Verse 3: Birdman]

And jumped in this game upon one roll
And got the game off the floor got the game on the low

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't need no niggas in my section
All bitches, all bitches, all bitches, all bitches, ah
I don't need no niggas in my section
All bitches, all bitches, all bitches, all bitches, ah (Hahaha, look)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Higher than the moon, nigga, what up?
I hear 'em wolfin', a nigga need to shut up
While I'm in the pussy, face down and the butt up
You ain't shit to her and me, I'm just a fuck up
Fuck a hand shake, nigga, we ain't brothers
On that West side where they reppin' for they colors
Talkin' big shit 'cause my dick will make you stutter
All up in your face like it's butter, nutter
Right now, make her scream my name and pipe her right down
Nasty on the dick, bitch, give a nigga a wipe down
Twenty four inches, I'm rollin' on chrome, my niggas are smokin' on that loud
Bitches try to flaunt, huh, I'ma blow they back out
I ain't thinkin' 'bout a nigga, walk past you
Bitch stole my blunt and said she like my tattoos
I'm that dude, I slang wood, that bamboo
But when she drop it on that dick, she a damn fool

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't need no niggas in my section
All bitches, all bitches, all bitches, all bitches, ah
I don't need no niggas in my section
All bitches, all bitches, all bitches, all bitches, ah
All these bitches, I don't wanna see no niggas
All these bitches, I don't wanna see no niggas
Really, really though, all these bitches, I don't want no niggas
'Cause the real niggas posted up already with us (Huh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It's a habit, in the club, bottle magic
Fuckin' with these ratchets, no purses, they got baskets
It's a hand out, these bitches high fienin', guess they addicts
And I ask them, "Are you in like Patrick?"
Playin' with the pussy like it's Madden, fire like a dragon
The one say she like me, then they all bandwagon
Cheerleadin' ass hoes, but they pretty like a pageant
She said she'd let me cut, I got to stab it, for real though

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't need no niggas in my section
All bitches, all bitches, all bitches, all bitches, ah
I don't need no niggas in my section
All bitches, all bitches, all bitches, all bitches, ah
All these bitches, I don't wanna see no niggas
All these bitches, I don't wanna see no niggas
Really, really though, all these bitches, I don't want no niggas
'Cause the real niggas posted up already with us

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Ha! Audemars, big bitch, big tipper
Supperclub, 20,000 for the liquor
See the bitch I'm with, prolly never get her
No comp' bottles, they for broke niggas
Been the corner posted up with the dome giver
Money flowin' like wet pussy, that's a long river
So you got your bitch on lock, I slim jim her
It's that time of the month, fucktember
All my niggas got a bottle with a blunt lit up
'Fore you cup up, throw your set up
Hop in this bitch 'til the club lights lit up
Leave with her, big spender, a bitch shut up (Ha!)
T-Killa illuminati all through your body
She blow me like a twelve gauge, shawty, you feel me
Pull up in the 'rari, the fucking life of the party
I'm gettin' hoes regardless, before this rap shit, I'm honest

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
I don't need no niggas in my section (Ha)
All bitches, all bitches, all bitches, all bitches, ah (Yeah)
I don't need no niggas in my section
All bitches, all bitches, all bitches, all bitches, ah
All these bitches, I don't wanna see no niggas
All these bitches, I don't wanna see no niggas
Really, really though, all these bitches, I don't want no niggas
'Cause the real niggas posted up already with us

Oh, no
Dark Horse
Juicy J
Katy Perry
Yeah, ya'll know what it is
Katy Perry
Juicy J
Yeah, uh-uh
It's remix!

[Verse 1: Juicy J & Girl]
Suit and tie, kinda knight, I'mma be her Prince Charming
Let's get trippy and go missing like we on the milk carton
Baby girl, you already know, I spoil you like sour milk (Milk)
And give you keys to the crib and let you drive the whip
But you gotta make up your mind, you gon' have the pay in to win
'Cause soon as you do it in that's what'll betray it, she back for revenge
This is more than a case of friends with benefits
She’s Cinderella 'til you lead her on
From a good girl to a wicked witch

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away (Walk away)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Katy Perry]
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
She's a beast, I call her Karma (Come back)
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer (Woo!)
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her (Meet her)
If you get the chance, you better keep her (Keep her)
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer (Freezer)
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo!)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair (A fair)
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (You should know)
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse (Like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for (Ready for)
A perfect storm, perfect storm? (A perfect storm)
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
Can’t even look her in the face
Too busy staring at her waist line (waist line)
And I ain’t too proud to chase
Knowing the chances are, she’ll take mine
Behind the smile and the laughter
There’s danger, I know (I know)
I know I’ll end up her capture
Caught in the rapture
But I won’t let go

Oh, why, mi amor?
What you doing take my heart for?
Why, mi amor?
You took it knowing that it’s not yours
Why, mi amor?
You caught me from the door, whoa
So tell me why, mi amor?
You’re so easy to adore
Left my heart on the floor
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Why, mi amor?
What you doing take my heart for?
Why, mi amor?
You took my heart on the floor
Behind the smile and the laughter
There’s danger, I know
I know I’ll end up her capture
Caught in a rapture
But I won’t let go

Woah, why, mi amor?
What you doing take my heart for?
Why, mi amor?
You took it knowing that it’s not yours
Why, mi amor?
You caught me from the door, whoa
So tell me why, mi amor?
You’re so easy to adore?
Left my heart on the floor

Cuff yo' chick
DJ Ill Will

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Was it something I said?
Was it something I did, oh?
Looking for an answer
'Cause I don't even know
Why you're so upset with me
Girl, what is this about?
Them other shawties
I don't care about

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, sit down
Only when we sexing is when I wanna hear you yelling out loud
Count down backwards from 10
Now ain't that much better?
Break down every little word
She said this, he said that
Don't believe none of them lies, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Wasting time fighting over shit that don't really matter
Wish I could start on a brand new chapter (Oh)
I done see this type of thing before
I already know how story unfolds
All I wanna do is love you right
Take my time
Read between the lines, girl (Read between the)
Read between the lines, girl

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
Here we go again, heard it all before
It's getting us nowhere fast
So let's we retrace our steps and figure out where we went wrong, girl
Let's talk this through, woah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby, sit down
Only when we sexing is when I want to hear you yelling out loud
Count down backwards from 10
Now ain't that much better?
Break down every little word
She said this, he said that
Don't believe none of them lies, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Wasting time fighting over shit that don't really matter
Wish I could start on a brand new chapter (Oh)
I done see this type of thing before
I already know how story unfolds
All I wanna do is love you right
Take my time
Read between the lines, girl (Read between the)
Read between the lines, girl

[Verse 1]
Girl, I double dare you
To keep it all the way one hunnid with me if I'm your man
I'm not gon' lie, I'm scared too
I know you got something to tell me 'cause you're fuckin' up your speech
So, baby, tell me where you were
I'm sick and tired, I know you saw me callin'
I think our shit has been over for a while now

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel so confused when you say that you don't need me, oh-woah
It's only you that's making you wanna leave me, oh
Where is this trust? I lost it when you let him fuck
Yeah, you did, yup
Said, girl, I lost it, I lost it, how could you give it up?

[Chorus]
'Cause, girl, you did that one thing
It's fucked up the way you did that one thing (Oh)
And I don't care if you was drinkin', smokin' with your girls or feelin' it
How could you consider it? You so inconsiderate
Already made your bed, now lay it down and live in it
Stop actin' so innocent 'cause you be on that other shit (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Baby, how can I compare you to a queen or a diamond in the rough?
I'm scared too, can't even recognize you
Don't wanna look at your face, you make me sick, I'ma throw up
When roses turn blueish, that means your garden ain't true, yeah, true, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I know you let them eat it, yes, you did, yup, takin' food off my plate

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel so confused when you say that you don't need me, oh-woah
It's only you that's making you wanna leave me, oh
Where is this trust? I lost it when you let him fuck
Yeah, you did, yup
Said, girl, I lost it, I lost it, how could you give it up? (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause, girl, you did that one thing
It's fucked up the way you did that one thing
And I don't care if you was drinkin', smokin' with your girls or feelin' it
How could you consider it? You so inconsiderate
Already made your bed, now lay it down and live in it
Stop actin' so innocent 'cause you be on that other shit

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, you be on that other shit
Ooh, ooh (Oh, oh)
You be on that other shit
Ooh-ooh
Oh, yeah, you be on that other shit
Ooh-ooh (Oh, oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause, girl, you did that one thing
It's fucked up the way you did that one thing (I don't care)
And I don't care if you was drinkin', smokin' with your girls or feelin' it
How could you consider it? You so inconsiderate
Already made your bed, now lay it down and live in it
Stop actin' so innocent 'cause you be on that other shit

[Verse 1]
Everybody said that it wasn’t love
I was dumb
I was getting high on your sugar rush
For too long
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, what the hell?
We were in heaven then we fell
I believed you, said I’d never leave you
I-

[Chorus]
I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Livin' with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re postin' pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, havin' fun, havin' fun

[Verse 2]
Everybody said: “Careful of that guy”
Baby couldn’t stop, it was suicide
Headed for a cliff, eyes open wide
You were feignin' love by holdin' tight
But I need you, don’t want to, but need to
I-

[Chorus]
I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Livin' with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re postin' pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, havin' fun, havin' fun

[Bridge]
You been messin' around with my beating heart
You should be ashamed
Boy, you never loved me from the start
Such a wicked game
I told you I needed somebody
I never used you for love or for money, boy
I feel like I can’t trust nobody
Beat on my heart and you left it all bloody, now

[Chorus]
I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Livin' with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re postin' pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, havin' fun, havin' fun

[Verse 1]
Walk in, lay down, you stay right here
It's my night to do you right
I want us to stay here forever
Give you studio loving tonight, tonight, oh
If we don't stop this music we'll be dancing babe
And through them tights you wear, I see your lingerie
So shawty, press the playback
Now come here and lay back, I'm about to blow you away

[Chorus]
Come lay here for me
Lay you out like an accordion
Let me press your keys
You can feel me touch 'em
Up and down
Up and down, down
Up and down
Up and down
Up and down
Up, up, up, up, down
Up, up, down
Up, up, up, down

[Verse 2]
Played it right
Stay the night, say you like me too
Likes to rub, likes to touch
Like it rough, me too
I'm gon' tell you, why we should be
You know I got just what you need

[Chorus]
Come lay here for me
Lay you out like an accordion
Let me press your keys
You can feel me touch 'em
Up and down
Up and down, down
Up and down
Up and down
Up and down
Up, up, up, up, down
Up, up, down
Up, up, up, down

[Bridge]
Baby girl, I can play you louder, louder
Hit them keys, that's gon' make you wilder, wilder
Baby girl, I can play you louder, louder
Hit them keys, that's gon' make you wilder, wilder
Go ahead, wild out
I hit it 'til it fall out
Show me what you all 'bout
And we gon' do it all out

[Chorus]
Down

Why? Cause most these niggas is no go
Oh, no. I see y'all ho shit!
I believe my train of thought is cuckoo
I've got a locomotive
Baby girl I be the dopest, please then roll me up, I'll be good
Y'all see us, and y'all see them
If y'all compare, y'all not serious
I've got that tzz-tzz, Tom Ford
I've got that tzz-tzz, black orchid
I've got that tzz-tzz, Bob Mar
With that Jumanji decor
And I record, out of this world
Danny's gon' cop

Fellow, where's my dope?
In Atlanta where, so much damn Versace
How could I not be stoned?

If you a roller, I'm a roller so come over!
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner!
'less you police, don't look too deep beneath the corner
I'm a motherfucking stoner! Tell somebody bring the roll up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Run it, run it, up, like a dark trial
When you beat it, turn it, in a stone trial
We don't stay in line, get your shoes up your feet
Everybody stoned

Everytime I walk inside the club I see everybody looking
Oh, no, I'm a stoner, I can't love you...
Now, you can start my banana, but I won't eat your pudding
So come a little closer, I might know you
Andale, andale!
How the fuck I ... when there is a runway?
My thought is a match from the blood on my chest
She put up my dinner, she well like a fish
I took up a T-Rex stake, T-Rex

[Hook]
Gettin' money is the hobby I'm so sorry
Gettin' money is the hobby I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
Got a bad bitch running through the lobby
I'm so sorry X8
Gettin' money is the hobby I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
Got a bad bitch running through the lobby
I'm so sorry X8
Gettin' money is the hobby I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
Got a bad bitch running through the lobby
I'm so sorry

[Verse: Meek Mill]
Uh, pockets all fat like Terio
Cus we sellin' O's like cheerios
Off the rope on your ho Rey Mysterio
Let the beat build bitch now here we go
Hol' up, it ain’t even drop yet
But I'm ridin' in the coupe with the top back
Got that slidin' round with the seat dropped back
Gettin' head till I tell the ho to stop that
Catch me club lib with a 34
Naw you ain't ready though
Hoes tryin to hit the bank like set it off
Spit crack while eyes already raw
Rock ready, ready rock ho let it pause
Nigga you don't ever ball
Ho changed for the money like menopause
So what I do treat the ho like Santa Clause
Hey ho, Meek Milly got gifts for a
I heard homie got this for ya
They got that so I'ma give the dick to ya
And if you do it good I'ma give a tip to ya
Drip to ya bust it open on the eyelid
You clocked out right around the time I signed in
Now shorty wanna kick it like Chi Lin
Cus I pull strings like a violin

[Hook]

[Verse: Meek Mill]
I used to pray to get a hundred grand
Now it's cartiers for the rubber bands
And that uzi sounded just like 

[?]
Did I, did I, did I, did I stutter fam
Bad bitch lookin' like J-Lo
And she gone do whatever I say so

[Verse 1: Stack Bundles]

[?]
Got the fishscale
Rubber grip pistol
Pop, like it’s Cristal
Rich lip wow, 

[?] with the 

[?]
Had to struggle to get my weight up
Left lane, left lane now they want me to wait up
Can’t slow my pace, no time to waste

[?] who the fuck face to face
Gotta embrace the hate with this life of mine
Y’all wanna raise the stakes put your life on the line
Mine’s is real
Stack Bun’ signed and sealed
Got a mean watch game, keep the ice real

[?] I don’t like talking
And I keep some hot wheels
Bitches catch feelings when I’m walking
Bop too gangster, Glock too heavy
No more turnovers I got Far Rock steady

[Hook]
I keep it gutter like
I keep it gutter like
I keep it gutter like
I keep it gutter like

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
You can see me, low key in a Ford
No keys, the doors open like grocery stores
Or see me four-fifthin
I had you niggas pourin liquor out like it’s prohibition
The piece that speaks for itself
And the row I gotta mention the flow that’s tension
No flinching
Pop benching with them 245s
Or 

[?] moving pies like FOIs
Y’all don't know though
I’m the illest crime caught on tape since Caine and O-Dog
And I won’t talk, even if I’m caught red-handed
Like don’t walk, I flip it with no thoughts
Shit on, everything you big on
The 

[?] with no 

[?]

[?] clips ons
You can talk until you blue in the face
But you can pause it, if you ain’t 

[?] in the face

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Stack Bundles]
Red niggas got hate in they veins
I clap niggas leave hate in they brain
Let me teach ya
The hood niggas call me Roger
Cause I’m flooded in carrots
And I floss every day like it’s Easter
The beats the reason I ryhyme
Streets the reason I grind
And I don’t need heat to shine
Cause I didn’t when y’all oppress me
End up dead or missing like Elvis Presley

[Verse 4: Lupe Fiasco]
You know I keep a chick topless, keep my whip topless
Keep my spit toxic
You keep it in the closet

[?] things can get un-pretty
Like bars left from Chili
For the sake I hope I keep everything quaker oats, real gritty
Or 3-0-50
On the rocks like Whitney
Filthy, and 

[?] like spittin dutch and gillie
Close, but no Philly

[Hook] x2

[Verse 1]
Once, there was this kid who
Took a trip to Singapore and brought along his spray paint
And when he finally came back
He had cane marks all over his bottom
He said that it was from when
The warden whacked it so hard

Mmm mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm mmm

(flogging, screams)

[Verse 2]
Once there was this girl who
Swore that one day she would be a figure skating champion
And when she finally made it
She saw some other girl who was better
And so she hired some guy to
Club her in the knee cap

[Chorus]
(thwacking, screams)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They got paid for their sound bytes
And sold their TV movie rights

[Verse 3]
And then, there was this guy who
Made his wife so mad one night that she cut off his weiner
And when he finally came to
He found that Mr. Happy was missing
He couldn't quite explain it
It'd always just been there

[Chorus]

Ahh ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh, ahh ahh ahh ahh

[Verse 1]
Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with the words that cry
How I still try to stay inside

[Chorus]
Hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts

[Verse 2]
Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd have made
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest

[Chorus]
Hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts

[Outro]
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here

[Intro]
Mmmmhmmmmm, yeah, mmmhmmmhmmm

[Chorus]
People talk shit' bout me
Deep down they knowin’ they ain’t right
When I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes
When I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes
People talk shit 'bout me, and they know that I know
And they also knowing they ain’t right
When I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes
Cause when I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes

[Verse]
Rejuvenated, recreated, rebooted, in a new program
Prada calf’s, black skinnies, T and hoody
Y’all niggas know the brand, GQ mustachin’ I’m in LA
Soaking up the sun and I’m laughing, what can I say?
I love the way the fans say they love me
I know it’s all because my God above me
But damn I’m feeling like Sam
Except my daddy ain’t stuck up no video game
Things changed, for the good
He watched my back until the world started knowin’ my name
This should be in the Bible
Middle finger up to the people who don’t like you
Who have no valid reason to say they never liked you
We don’t give a fuck fam
So what?! We never liked you niggas anyway
Pardon my wizard talk, but I’m elevated
No drank, no tree and I’m levitated
I got my own empire, I’m the baby
I ain’t taking care of nobody but my daughter and my mom
Places to go cause I need to build a travel log
I travel while you jake niggas run a blog
Now run along, I got some shit that needs posting
While I’m winnin’ livin’ life, skippin’ grinnin’ on em
All hail King Wizard in the fuckin’ house
Been chill for a minute quiet as a mouse
Now I got the juice, call me Bishop when you see me round
I be showin’ love, showin’ love baby, dap and pound

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, mmmhmmmmm, yeah, mmmhmmmhmmm

[Chorus]
People talk shit' bout me
Deep down they knowin’ they ain’t right
When I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes
When I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes
People talk shit 'bout me, and they know that I know
And they also knowing they ain’t right
When I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes
Cause when I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes

[Bridge]
Truth comes to the light all the time
You can’t hide from fate, you can’t hide
Truth comes to the light all the time
You can’t hide from fate, you can’t hide
Truth comes to the light all the time
You can’t hide from fate, you can’t hide

[Outro]
Thought you were my brother, I thought you were
Thought you were my sister, I thought you were
Thought you were my homie, I thought you were
So absurd
Thought you were my brother, I thought you were
Thought you were my sister, I thought you were
Thought you were my homie, I thought you were
So absurd
I am a person with powers, I possess the power
You can’t hide, see me shine

[Verse]
Cut me down, slice me deep, I dare you
Burn my crown, spit on my grave, I’ll make you
See my face, see my face, I’ll haunt you
Deep in the dark, behind your eyes, I’m on you
Salt of the Earth, bird of the Heavens, you hear them
All in the hell, the hollowest halls, don’t fear them
Here I am, the warrior man
Here I stand, the warrior man

[Chorus]
But I done tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can’t stop this internal bleeding
My heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
I done tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can’t stop this internal bleeding
And my heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
And it hurts me

But bleed from thorns

In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on

Don't know, don't know, don't know...

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Kelly Osbourne]
In honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it
We say thank you, and we take it back

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
Wished so hard, I wished so hard that it came true
Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon
I put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you
Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Dear diary (oh, dear diary), it's happenin' again (happenin' again)
This energy (oh the energy), like I'm 'bout to win (I'm 'bout to win)
I just close my eyes (I close my eyes) and visions appear (visions appear)
She's everything I want (everything I want), and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe (Marilyn Monroe)
Who? Cleopatra? Please (Cleopatra, please)
Not even Joan of Arc (Joan of Arc)
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, girl on girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough

[Pre-Chorus]
What planet are you from, girl?
And are there others like you there?
And could you do that magic trick again?
Poppin' up from nowhere
Though my planet's full of warfare
You make it feel like a dream
Man I hope they never find you

[Chorus]
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Hot sex and gold, shiny things
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Remind you that you are a lost queen
I think you are a lost queen

[Verse 1]
I don't have a problem with multi-taskin'
Takin' care of you is my number one passion
Put it before my eyes, you know I'ma smash it
Only if you want it, want it
You don't have to ever think about askin'
I can read your mind, girl, of course I have it
Can I start you up? It's automatic
Get your motor runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom
I'm never too busy to tell you that you're pretty
Ain't gotta ask me to
Surprise you in the city when your day is goin' shitty
Ain't gotta ask me to

[Pre-Chorus]
What planet are you from, girl?
And are there others like you there?
And could you do that magic trick again?
Poppin' up from nowhere
Though my planet's full of warfare
You make it feel like a dream
Man I hope they never find you

[Chorus]
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Hot sex and gold, shiny things
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Remind you that you are a lost queen
I think you are a lost queen

[Verse 2]
I don’t have a problem meeting mommy and daddy
Honey and sugar, man I bet they're so classy
Half of me is good, the other half nasty
Can't help it if I want it, want it
Sure I meet your friends on my best behavior
Talk about relationships, I used to be a player
And like GEICO, the time I saved 'em
And get their motors runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom
Lift your head when you're down so you don't drop your crown
Ain't gotta ask me to
And right before we finish, I'll ask you did you get it
Ain't gotta ask me to

[Pre-Chorus]
What planet are you from, girl?
And are there others like you there?
And could you do that magic trick again?
Poppin' up from nowhere
Though my planet's full of warfare
You make it feel like a dream
Man I hope they never find you

[Chorus]
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Hot sex and gold, shiny things
I think you are a lost queen
Let me serve you, serve you
Remind you that you are a lost queen
I think you are a lost queen

Come get eaten by the damn mirage

Well, hold up baby, what's goin' on?
Tell the truth, I wanna know
What you're doin' when you go

I'm imagining things
Do you wanna try?
Take off your halo and wings
Girl, I can make her fly

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know, what's come over me
My momma didn't raise me that way
You lit a fire, from inside of me
That'd light your seat ablaze, girl
(that would leave those panties in flame)
Light that ass on fire

[Chorus]
I could be the guy to treat you
To a nice movie, feed you
But I don't wanna mislead you
Tonight I think I wanna be dirty, girl
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on
Light that ass on fire
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Let's go

[Bridge]
Girl the world's watchin'
From sunset to moonrise
They're tryna catch a glimpse (intimacy)

My heart is filled, with love and care
Not an ounce of gas, I would get up there
The answer's simple
You lift me up
The view up here, I see all the stars
There go Venus, and there go Mars
Somethin' you been through
You're from above, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
When I first saw you, I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it
But I didn't know
I didn't let go
Then it occurred to me while tryna fight it
Just like a kite, you learn to ride it
But I didn't know
You s'posed to let it go

[Chorus: Daft Punk]
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in
The air I need to power my sail

[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
With your love, I can board the skies
Riding away that electrified mothership other
Can I stow away? (Can I stow away girl, girl?)
Colourful winds of the northern sky
Is the closest thing, and here is why
Cause we're color
You blow me away (blow me away girl, girl)

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I need it like I breathe it
Music and colors can make one hover
Who cares if they don't see you?
Don't you know that they're the same?
I need it like I breathe it
If you never discover, forever you'll suffer
Who cares if they don't see you?
You gotta tap in and learn the way

[Chorus: Daft Punk]
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind

[Pre-Chorus: Pharell Wiliams]
When I first saw you, I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it

Just so they can learn to ride it
But I didn't know, oh
I had to let it go

[Chorus: Daft Punk and Pharrell Williams]
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes

Finger, pointin', but they, they depend on you
Inhale, exhale, in and out, like a sail
No no, aw yes, smile honey, no stress

[Hook: Pharrell]
When your environment seems to get brighter

Can you imagine this started with a lighter?
You know it's good
Perception that you never had
You know it's good

And girl don't let them tell you that you don't deserve to unwind

We just shake our heads, and dance, the moment so surreal
Isn't it sad? There's people in this world that don't know how this feels

[Refrain: Both]

I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'

[Instrumental Outro]

[Meyers]: Fashion is obviously very important to you. You’re designing again, in fashion. Tell me, what’s the difference in how you approach fashion to how you approach music? Is it similar, is it completely different?

[West]: Everything in the world is exactly the same.

[Meyers]: Alright, great. I don’t think we’re done but I think I’m going to sign off.

[West]: Meaning like, you can do comparable people like - who would you compare Daniel Day-Lewis or Phillip Seymour Hoffman to musically, or in fashion, directing, architecturally? Who was your favorite teacher when you were growing up? It’s certain people that when - that teacher when you’re in eighth grade, that this person really cared and you knew this person cared about you as a student and gave everything they had and they were meant to do that. It’s other people that were just like getting a check or something. It’s all the same. You know, for me I give you paintings, sonic paintings. I have synesthesia; I can see sound in front of me. So, when I want to do fashion, I just want to give you sculptures. So it’s like Michelangelo; the church wanted him to paint, and he just wanted to do sculptures. So the hard – the difficult thing for me that everyone doesn’t understand, I just want to be able to use marble and make sculptures. But, due to the fact that I’m a celebrity, all these different things they’re like “no, you can’t do this, you have to do this kind of line.”

So, it’s kind of the first of its kind so that’s the reason why there’s been a lot of confusion as to why I want to do it, to why is he getting so frustrated about it. It’s like: why don’t you just do music? It’s an overall creative expression. Like I have a friend, Yves Béhar, that designed the Jawbone wristband and stuff, and the Jambox and everything. As a designer, you know, he's not in a box to only design, you know, a speaker. He can design whatever he wants and I'm like, that's the type of creative expression and freedom any creative, you know, wants.

And as, you know, get really successful at one thing you start to grow, and you're like - you feel like you can do more things, and your shoe starts to get a little bit tight, and you do everything you can to get a bigger shoe so you can walk further and run faster. And people are like now in this day and age, if you don't believe it, it's like they're like "No, Kanye, you can't run faster. This is the limit that was made. This is the walls that Michael Jackson broke down for you, and Jay Z and Russell Simmons broke down for you. This is the end of it. So I'm in the process, 2013 all of the controversy about why - I'm in the process of breaking down walls that people will understand 10 years from now - 20 years from now.

[Verse 1: John Frusciante & Anthony Kiedis]
Never too soon to be through
Bein' cool too much, too soon
Too much for me, too much for you
You're gonna lose in time
Don't be afraid to show your friends
That you hurt inside, inside
Pain's part of life, don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie, your lie

[Chorus: John Frusciante, Anthony Kiedis, & Vicki Calhoun]
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Ooh)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life

[Verse 2: John Frusciante & Anthony Kiedis]
I'm tired of bein' untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you, and you're part of me
Why did you go away?
Findin' what you're lookin' for can end up bein'
Bein' such a bore
I pray for you, most every day, my love's with you
Now fly away

[Chorus: John Frusciante, Anthony Kiedis, & Vicki Calhoun]
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Ooh)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: John Frusciante, Anthony Kiedis, & Vicki Calhoun]
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Ooh)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Knock me, knock me, knock me)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Knock me, knock me, knock me)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life

[Chorus: John Frusciante, Anthony Kiedis, & Vicki Calhoun]
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

[Break: Vicki Calhoun]
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, hey, aah-aah-aah-aah, yeah, yeah
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, hey, aah-aah-aah-aah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: John Frusciante, Anthony Kiedis, & Vicki Calhoun]
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself (Aah-aah, oh, oh, oh, hey, yeah)
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself (Oh, oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh, yeah)
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely

[Intro]
Rrah!

[Verse 1]
All you slingers and fiends hide behind your rocks
Put down your guard, I'm not here to box
This is no showdown so throw down your guns
You see it doesn't matter where you come from
You could be from Park Ave or from a park bench
You could be a politician or a bitchy princess
But if you're lookin' for a fist and you're lookin' to unite
Put your knuckleheads together, make a fist and fight
Not to your death and not to your grave
I'm talkin' 'bout that freedom, fight like a brave

[Chorus]
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you, you've got to be afraid

[Verse 2]
If you're sick-a-sick 'n' tired of being sick and tired
If you're sick of all the bullshit and you're sick of all the lies
It's better late than never to set-a-set it straight
You know the lie is dead so give yourself a break
Or get it through your head and get it off your chest
Or get it out your arm because it's time to start fresh
You want to stop dying, the life you could be livin'
I'm here to tell a story but I'm also here to listen
No I'm not your preacher and I'm not your physician
I'm just a-trying to reach you, I'm a rebel with a mission

[Chorus]
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

[Interlude]
I am here today to talk about the Uplift Mofo Party Plan
A plan based on a band, a band based on a plan
There shall be no slaves in the land of lands
It's a Hollywood jam

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You say you're running and you're running and you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet but you couldn't get away
The fire in your brain was driving you insane
You were looking for a day in a life that never came
So don't tell me that, I've got to take a number
'Cause I've been to that doctor and believe me, that's a bummer
He's one of a kind, convention of the mind
And don't forget to mention that it doesn't cost a dime
Come as you like and leave at any time
And one more thing, you know it doesn't have to rhyme

[Outro]
Fight like a brave (fight like a brave) don't be a slave (another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave (fight like a brave) don't be a slave (another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave (fight like a brave) don't be a slave (another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave (fight like a brave) don't be a slave (another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave (fight like a brave) don't be a slave (another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

[Kanye West]
The problem I have with the paparazzi is if they’re right in front of you and you’re like, “Can you please not take a picture of me?” And they’re like, “Dude I’m not really taking a picture,” and they just keep on doing it like they’re talking to me like I’m stupid and stuff, and then, with arm sprints, I’m going to grab the camera, that just happens, and you don’t expect that to happen with a celebrity, cause you think they’re like a museum animal and stuff, but it’s like, don’t shoot the animals, then, maybe, I don’t know.

[Conan O’Brien]
What’s interesting, though, the problem is that once you do something like that, the word’s out. And these guys know that a shot of you losing your temper is worth ten times more then a shot of you remaining calm. So it’s kind of a no-win situation a little bit.

[Kanye West]
Well except for the fact that I’m going to do something about it. You know, I’m going to make a change. I think it’s my responsibility. My mom, she got arrested for being in the sit-ins at age 6. My grandfather drove the first car at the marches leaving out of Oklahoma. My father was an activist, so I think they just like, messed with the wrong celebrity just now.

[Conan O’Brien]
Right. Okay so you’re letting them know, leave me alone.

She's down with ya, wore the crown with ya
They roped her in with some old shit
Credit card fraud back in '06
She was telling them that she ain't know shit
She was gettin mad and unfocused
Their trump card is some ho shit
They told her that they take kids
And that's when she folded
Exploded, exposed it
Everything that she noticed
Prosecutors was watching
Through the mirror while she told this
That's the case nigga, let's close this
Still gave her time and that's bogus
She was in the car when they pulled up
And popped trunk and unloaded like

There's good niggas, bad weakness
He's talking bout who they sleep with
He killed a nigga in a heartbeat
But he couldn't keep no secrets
He's no good for your defenses
He's steady with that chopper
When them cops got him in that precinct
That's when he fell to pieces
Name all in those papers
Signed a recording deal with them majors
He's confirming all of your capers
While you's dropping down all that data
Tryna get right with his saviours
He was giving life to his neighbors
Just like CPR, oh my god
Goodness, gracious

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
In the stripclub with them agents
Not the ones that was taking pictures
But that main one that you came with
Showin off all his entertainment
He was recording all of your statements
He was taking all of your payments
Right back to the evidence room
While you was booing all in his faces
You was losing all of your cases, losing all of your cases
You was winning with them bitches but you was losing all of your cases
Ain't no rules at all in the Matrix
Ain't no truth and ain't nothin sacred
Know you're the only one with that paper

Made me wonder how you spend them nights
Me, I spend them looking for men I like
Like you, like you, like you

But, baby, if you love me
Take me to the gas station
Take me to the gas station

[Verse 3]
Gimme coffee, Utah love
I'm the kind of girl you dream of
And I'm trying to tell you what I dream of
And that's gas stations
With Slurpee machines and organs playing
Preferably with smokin' inside
If you can swing it (Swing it, swing it, swing it)
And I'd be real pleased if we could find one just like it
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again, again, again, again

I don't play a good guitar but
What do you want from me? It's just a stupid bar
And I didn't promise anythin'
No, mmm-mmm
You think I'm pretty and you like the way I talk
I like your music and you like the way I walk
So I think we're gonna get along, mmm-hmm

[Pre-Chorus]
I like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair come down, it make you look older
How you get that so handsome, my boy?
Oh, mmm

The way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows

Use that voice, sing that song
And tell me to come on, to come on, come on
You won't hear no, you won't hear no
Mmm-mmm

Preface

In this conversation, Kanye West and Pharrell Williams candidly explore the rewards and perils of a lifelong, perfectionist ethic. Best likened to a child's insatiable curiosity, they impute their compulsive, insistent tinkering to much lived experience, and even to obscure neurological phenomena. Their exchange lends precious – and comic – insight into a frightening capacity for invention, and a knowing approach to craft that is at once sure and relentlessly self-critical. They spoke in the wake of a minor controversy that followed the online launch of the single “Theraflu”, which Kanye released through his G.O.O.D Music label (in collaboration with DJ Khaled, DJ Pharris and the producer Hit Boy). Predictably, the pharmaceutical combine Novartis objected to the title. The track also featured the lyric “someone tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor,” which drew immediate fire from the animal-rights group

Kanye West: Yo yo, what’s good?!

Pharrell Williams: What up, killer?!

KW: Shit, chillin’, vibin’ about changing the name of that song and trying to figure out what the name of the song should be. You know, the “Theraflu” song?

PW: Yeah

KW: Yeah, we’re about to give it a new name

PW: It’s getting that big – they’re going that crazy about it?

KW: Oh, yeah they have an issue. Just the title and here’s still a window of opportunity for us to change it. “Oh, well, I don’t want to call it ‘Theraflu’. I’m calling the song this…” And then people are like, “oh, he changed the song to this”, and then that’s what it is, because when I did the song, I actually did not know that it would get to the point that grandmothers are talking about it, you know? Like why did I give them that level of promotion?

PW: Yeah, trust me, they’re thankful. No matter what, they’re thankful. This segues perfectly into what I wanted to talk to you about. Which is what is it like to be – and I know how I feel about it – but you’re definitely one of my peers, and one that I look at and say “He gets it, but I’d love to hear his take on why we aspire to be.” It’s almost a disease to be a perfectionist. Nothing is ever quite good enough. What is it like to look at things and say to yourself, “I know that they don’t get it but maybe one day they will.”

KW: It is so funny this is such an example of being a perfectionist, right? This song is out and I’m going to change the name, like I want to perfect this moment some more. Well, I think it’s just if you’re a perfectionist, that’s just what you do. You know, there are slackers there are people who are satisfied by delivering everything they have – with their knowledge, their financial situation, their level of exposure – to deliver the best product possible. I respect, look up to, and look to Walt Disney and Steve Jobs who dedicated their time, soul and energy to delivering the best product that they knew they could. There’s a lot of psychology that goes into it. What can you give to human existence? How can you push the culture forward? And when you’re a perfectionist, at a certain point you feel a responsibility in what you put out, and what could trickle down from it. If you put out things that are so over-the-top and magnificent, what trickles down from it could at least be good because there are more followers than there are leaders
PW: Yeah I agree…You know what the funny thing is that we’ve never done it on a Kanye West album, it might be time for that

KW: Yeah!

PW: It might be time for that

KW: Yeah, we started on that shit for 

[Watch] The Throne

PW: Oh yeah! That was a very serious moment…

KW: Yes!

PW: I’ll never forget going to you and Jay’s show, and just seeing those laser lights. You addressed all the sensations, with the exception of smell and taste, I guess. Anything that you could control, the auditory and the visual, you curated – you made sure that it was a curated moment. And I’ll never forget when the first bars of “Gotta Have It” started playing, that minor chord. It just hits you anyway but it was just y’all talking on top of the track as it starts to come on, and the crowd start going nuts! And it’s really because at the end of the day, as great as the track is as it is and as great as all of the stuff you guys did on top of it, it was how the moment was so set up. It was like an incredible layup, an alley-oop. Do people even say that word anymore, alley-oop?

KW: Yeah, it’s only ‘cause it happens

PW: 

[laughs] yeah, you know I don’t know anything about basketball, but it was an amazing set-up. That was crazy, just to see the reaction to what a visual and music could do together, and those people going absolutely crazy I was like “oh, ok, well done man, well done.”

KW: Yeah I definitely wanted to dial into that sound and mixing those textures together. I just want to dial into that more, I just want to set the note, like playing a few textures that I got for this new shit for the G.O.O.D. Music joint we opened up the album with this joint that me and Skrillex did together

PW: Mmmmm. I like that!

KW: Just like that!

PW: Wow, I can’t wait to hear what that sounds like. I know we are all shaped and moulded by all that we’ve gone through, and by having spirituality – in whatever way you define it – it allows us to be bigger than our bodies, to be bigger than our essence. 

[But] there is something to be said for experience, being told “no” the entire time, when you wanted to get into an industry that you love. So let me ask you, how much has this experience contributed to who you became as a person?
KW: Yeah, you know, I had to realize at what point to put off the real South Side Chicago mentality, that is what built me to deal with the amount of “no’s” and deal with the amount of pressure and aggression, like I talked about on this Chicago song, “mink is draggin’ on the floor.” That’s one of my ideas for it 

[renaming ‘Theraflu’]. “Swag King Cole, mink is dragin’ on the floor, fo’ I embarrass you, but I don’t like to embarrass you…’I Don’t Like To Embarrass You” as the title

PW: Anticipating PETA

KW: Yeah, so…when I say “I’m from where shorty’s fucked up, double-cupped up. Might even kill some-body and YouTube it, so whoever thinks their words affect me is too stupid, and if you think you can do it better than me, then you do it.”

PW: Yeah, “you do it!”

PW: 

[laughs]

KW: “I’m from Chicago.” And that was just one of the best things to prepare me for anything. If you can make it out of Chicago, you can make it anywhere. That’s what I’m talking about on this new song, that’s what I’m talking about when I’m dealing with any business or creative processes. That’s the stuff I’m talking about when I was dealing with people, from not wanting me to rap, to 

[not] doing the tour with Jay, and being able to do the light show for it It was like sit-ins, when we were going out to Paris. You know when we were wearing the outfits and people on the blogs were calling us names and all that, right? But then, once they got that Givenchy cover, and everybody’s wearing Givenchy they’re all like “oh this is cool.”

PW: Right

KW: But it wasn’t cool with South Park was using the photo and dissing us and everything. And so many people dress like that now

PW: 

[Laughs in agreement] Yeah, that’s what we do

KW: That was before everybody said swag, or when we were out in Japan. How could you communicate through people? We’re not even understanding the language but we knew the visual language, we knew the spirit, we knew the ideas, we knew the reference points

PW: Yeah, that’s the thing, man. That’s what separates us from a lot of folk, and not because we’re better but because we’ve dedicated to listen to that inner voice, and a lot of people don’t. A lot of people go “man!” they do something and they go “shit you know what, and I’m totally not da-da-da-da 

[fill in the blanks].” People fail a lot of times doing that. Whereas we just trained ourselves to say “you know what, let me entertain this idea” and exhaust all the possibilities to make sure that it doesn’t make sense because something good may come out of that and for every time that someone has ever told you no, you’ve always had that willingness to explore it. Um, and I’ve watched that by the way, it’s been cool to see. How are you enjoying that…

KW: - Enjoying what?

PW: I’m thinking of a way to put it…How are you enjoying this whole fame thing?
KW: 

[gasp] You know its just a process of separating things, it’s understanding how to exploit it to display things, it’s understanding how to exploit it to display amazing art. You know the whole trick is that I am a visual artist. To this day I can’t play piano. I’ve taken it up a couple of times and I forget how to play the piano. And when I first wanted to rap, before I rapped, the first thing I did was actually draw my tape covers because that’s back when people had tapes. I drew the cover before I even thought about doing music. Let’s put this information in Vegas to music. So ina  way I’ll get the music but it was always about the fountain. It was always about the light show. It was always about the fashion show, it was always about that. Whether it is the font that we pick for a single cover, or a video – I’m going to Qatar later tonight to shoot the film for “Cruel Summer,” which is basically my second pop fairytale, like how “Runaway” was – it creates that kind of opportunity. When you see me design, and I’m not saying it’s the best design or whatever, but you know, 

[in “Runaway”] I had my idea of how I wanted Selita 

[Ebanks] to look, and I wanted it to be Selita. I wanted to juxtapose minimalist, Vanessa Beecroft like high art against unrealistic Victoria Secret-level beauty.  They don’t crash, those words are not in the same place. You’ve been to art parties before? It’s different from a Victoria Secret’s party. You know what I’m talking about!

PW: Right!

KW: That’s right. Due to exposure, I’m able to have these things be seen by so many people. If Matthew Barney were more famous, then more people would see what Matthew Barney did. So it’s that. When it comes down to it, what I enjoy about it is the opportunity to express art in high volume, literally

PW: Did you know that you’re a synesthete? That you have synesthesia?

KW: That’s what it’s called, that’s what the film is about! You’re talking about seeing sounds right?

PW: There are many different forms of synesthesia. There are grapheme synethetes, people who see colors in numbers, letters in colours. But I believe most musicians and most artists are synesthetes

KW: You know that’s what this film in Qatar is about!

PW: Oh wow!

KW: It’s called Cruel Summer: The Legend of the Lamborghini Dons  and it’s basically the G.O.O.D Music Lamborghini Dons. 

[Kid] Cudi, he’s the main character and I’m just this boy, and in the beginning we’re car thieves. There’s this part where one character teaches another to see colours through sound

PW: Oh wow!

KW: Yeah, the shit is dope. Matter of fact, if we could do work with you on the soundtrack. I mean I’ve got eight tracks for it, I just want to give it twelve. Basically it’s the G.O.O.D Music soundtrack that “Mercy” is the first single for. You’re like next level with this type of shit like 

[sings] “Take me far away, as long as it’s fun, fun, fun, I wanna go.” I’m talking to actually a film scorer at this point so –

PW: No! But dude….Nah man! It’s funny that you picked that out 

[“Fun, Fun Fun”]. That’s funny, wow!

KW: I play that song real normal in the car

PW: No way?!

KW: Yeah!

PW: That’s crazy, that’s crazy. ‘Aight well say no more. I’mma holla at you soon. And you have a good time out there in Qatar. My man!

KW: Alright, thanks! Love

[Verse 1]
Gotten too far off the map
Not so sure I can get back
Was I the one who drifted off?
Did I take advantage of good love?
'Cause I swear I did everything I could've done
But what good is love without the trust?
Does anybody wanna...

[Chorus]
Put me back, put me back
On the map
I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked
'Cause, honestly, I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

[Verse 2]
Something steady, something good
It's probably closer than I thought it could be
All this off the grid, it's getting old
And my compass says I'm getting close
But I don't know, it's hard to read
So I'll just keep moving, hoping someone out there's gonna

[Chorus]
Put me back, put me back
On the map
I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked
'Cause, honestly, I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

[Bridge]
S.O.S., it's out of hand
Just holding out for a love again
I'm sending signals, find me fast
I know, I know there's gotta be somebody who can

[Chorus]
Put me back, put me back
On the map
'Cause I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked
'Cause, honestly, I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

[Outro]
On the map
On the map

[Verse 1]
Woke up on the wrong side of rock bottom
You're all out of pennies, and the well, it done run dry
You'd light 'em up and smoke 'em if you had 'em, but you just ain't got 'em
Yeah, ain't we always looking for a bluer sky?

[Chorus 1]
But if you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day
It's gotta be a cloudy day
If you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning
You're gonna have to stand in the rain
You're gonna have to stand in the rain

[Post-Chorus]
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo

[Verse 2]
Lemonade keeps turning into lemons
And you wear your heart on a ripped, unraveled sleeve
Been run through the wringer and pushed plum to your limit
You say you're just unlucky, but luck ain't what you need

[Chorus 2]
'Cause if you're ever gonna find a four-leaf clover
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
And if you wanna find a head that fits your shoulder
You're gonna have to go to the dance
You're gonna have to go to the dance

[Bridge]
If you wanna find the honey
You can't be scared of the bees
And if you wanna see the forest
You're gonna have to look past the trees

[Chorus 1]
If you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day
Yeah, it's gotta be a cloudy day
Ooh, and if you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning
You're gonna have to stand in the rain
You're gonna have to stand in the rain

[Post-Chorus]
Hoo-hoo-hooo
Hoo-hoo-hooo
Hoo-hoo-hooo
Hoo, yeah

[Outro]
Hoo-hoo-hooo
Hoo-hoo-hooo
Hoo-hoo-hooo
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Intro]
Come to

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I'm kneeling down to get closer to the sign
And you're breaking my back every time

[Chorus]
It's hard to see it for all the rust
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us

[Verse 2]
Don't need to tell me
You know this ain't nothing new
Of course I love you
Of course I do
But to outplay is not to love
And yet I keep on coming back to call your bluff

[Chorus]
It's hard to see it for all the rust
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us

[Interlude]
Come to
(Get me, get me)
Come to
(Get me, get me)
Come to
(Get me, get me)
Come to
(Get me, get me)

[Outro]
Your evening eyes
The rain outside
The way I know
No fear that I'll
Be fading out alone

It's hard to see it for all the rust
But I saw it fading and I have some faith in us

[Intro]
Ah-one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Who needs a house up on a hill
When you can have one on four wheels
And take it anywhere the wind might blow?
You don't ever have to mow the yard
Just hang a map and throw a dart
And pray to God the engine starts and go

[Chorus 1]
Water and electric
And a place to drain the septic
Any K.O.A. is A-OK as long as I'm with you
So come on hitch your wagon
To the living room I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you

[Verse 2]
Parking lots and county lines
And counting mile marker signs
Where the buffalo and antelope all roam
Greetings from Niagara Falls
One more postcard for the wall
Off in our own sweet home away from home

[Chorus 1]
Water and electric
And a place to drain the septic
Any K.O.A. is A-OK as long as I'm with you
So come on hitch your wagon
To the living room I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you

[Bridge]
In Washington, in Idaho
In Oregon, and away we go
To Tennessee and Arkansas
No, we won't stop 'til we've seen 'em all
'Til we've seen 'em all

[Chorus 2]
So what else could you ask for?
You don't even need a passport
To see the whole world from our living room
So come on hitch your wagon
To the happiness I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you

[Outro]
It don't matter where we go
We'll never be alone
Anywhere beside you is a place that I'll call home
It don't matter where we go
We'll never be alone
Anywhere beside you is a place that I'll call home

[Verse 1]
Picked you out and picked you up
Hoping that my luck would change
I let the summer fill my lungs
And superstition fill my brain

[Chorus]
Dandelion
A million little wishes
Blow across the sky
But it's a waste of breath
And it's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion

[Verse 2]
Sent you dancing on the breeze
And like a stupid little girl
I spent my wishes on a weed
Thinkin' it could change my world

[Chorus]
Dandelion
A million little wishes
Blow across the sky
But it's a waste of breath
And it's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion

[Bridge]
Falling stars and lucky pennies
Have let me down so many times before
And you're just one more
Oh, dandelion

[Chorus]
(Oh) Oh, dandelion
I'm always blowing kisses
Out across the sky
But it's a waste of breath
And it's a waste of time, I know
'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dandelion
Dandelion

[Verse 1]
Shout to my migo who do what I tell him
Pull up in that 'rari, and you know I kill him
AP on my wrist, so you know I'm shitting
Catch me in that 'rari, and I'm going 50
Smoking on that loud, keys to the city
Dancing in the video, just like I'm Diddy
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, I'm the new 50
AK47 or I use the semi

[Hook]
Migo 

[2x]
Shout out to my
Migo

Shout out to my

[Verse 2]
Call my migo Pablo, he pull up quick
Catch me in that foreign, with that mop stick
Hop up out that whip, with like 60 racks
Niggas hating up on me cause I'm where it's at
Shout out to my fucking migo
Smoking dope like Beanie Sigel
In a Rolls-Royce or the Regal
I got bitches screaming ???

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Oh my God, it's you
I never thought
I'd see you here

[Verse 2]
Looks like all is well
Like you're having
A hell of a good time
Me? I'm not gonna lie

[Chorus]
Got the sunshine on my shoulders
Got a fistful of four-leaf clovers
Yeah, my cup runneth over
My sky is blue
Been kissed by Lady Luck
The stars are all lined up
Every arrow that I aim is true
But I miss you

[Verse 3]
You can't have your cake
And eat it too
I should have known

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause what good is good anyway?
And having it all is just a state of mind
And I, I got no reason to cry

[Chorus]
Got the sunshine on my shoulders
Got a fistful of four-leaf clovers
Yeah, my cup runneth over
My sky is blue
Been kissed by Lady Luck
The stars are all lined up
Every arrow that I aim is true
But I miss you

[Outro]
Been kissed by Lady Luck
The stars are all lined up
Every arrow that I aim is true
I got a big smile on my face
It's the best one I can fake
I'm as happy as half a heart can do
But I miss you

[Verse 1]
You sure look real pretty in your glass house
You probably think you’re too good to take the trash out
Well, are you dumb? Are you blind?
'Cause it’s a real fine line
Between telling a joke and turning the knife
Don't wreck my reputation
Let me wreck my own

[Chorus]
Step off, step off
Yeah, you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just try to make a little difference
Here's why you gotta interfere
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks
When you finally get to the top
Step off
Yeah–

[Verse 2]
You screwed everybody over in this town
There ain't nothing between you and the cold, hard ground
Keep running your mouth and stretching the truth
You just might find a hole in your parachute
'Cause whatever gets you high
Will always bring you down

[Chorus]
So step off, step off
Yeah, you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just try to make a little difference
Here's why you gotta interfere
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks, yeah
And when you finally get to the top
Mmm, step off

[Bridge]
Sticks and stones
May build a throne
But you'll be up there all alone
So step off
Yeah, yeah, step off

[Outro]
And keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks, yeah
When you finally get to the top
Step off
Mmm, just step off
Step off

[Verse 1]
You turn on the light, then you turn it back off
’Cause sleeping alone, yeah, it ain't what you thought
It's the drip of the sink, it's the click of the clock
And you're wondering if I'm sleeping
You heard from your friends that I'm doing okay
And you're thinking that maybe you made a mistake
And you want me to know, but I don't wanna know
How you're feeling

[Chorus 1]
Keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Keep it to yourself

[Verse 2]
If you see me out and I'm standing alone
Well, it don't mean that I'm gonna need a ride home
If you walk up to me like it ain't what it is
I know that it ain't gonna end with a kiss

[Chorus 1]
So keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Yeah, keep it to yourself

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, when you're drunk, and it's late
And you're sad, and you hate going home alone
'Cause you're missing me like hell
Keep it to yourself
Yeah, keep it to yourself

[Outro]
Hmm
Yeah, keep it to yourself
Hmm

[Verse 1]
Plays you like a fiddle, shakes you like a rattle
Takes away your gun and sends you into battle
Huffs and it puffs 'til it blows your house down
And you don't know your heart from a hole in the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

[Chorus]
Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid
Stupid

[Verse 2]
Girl meets boy and, boy, he's a looker
Can't separate the salt from the sugar
There's nothing in your pockets, there's footprints on your face
You can't tell anymore if you're the rabbit or the snake (Hey!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

[Chorus]
Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid
Stupid

[Bridge]
I drink to feel
I smoke to breathe
Just look what love
Has done to me

[Chorus]
Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking so damn
Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid
Stupid

[Verse 1]
I think we're thinking too hard
So put on your shoes and get in your car
Put it in drive and point it this way
We don't have to talk, you don't have to stay

[Chorus]
But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore

[Verse 2]
We've tried being apart
But the truth is we are who we are
We're so much alike, it ain't a good thing
Too dumb to give up, too stubborn to change

[Chorus]
But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore

[Bridge]
'Til something better comes along
'Til whatever we have is gone

[Chorus]
But I ain't got no one sleeping with me
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be
Maybe I love you, maybe I'm just kind of bored
It is what it is 'til it ain't anymore
Yeah, it is what it is 'til it ain't anymore

[Verse 1]
They say in chess you've got to kill the queen and then you've made it
Oh, I, do you?
A funny thing, a king who gets himself assassinated
Hey now, every time I lose altitude

[Verse 2]
You took a town by storm, the mess you made was nominated
Oh, I, do you?
Now put away your welcome, soon you'll find you've overstayed it
Hey now, every time I lose altitude

[Chorus]
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded

[Verse 3]
The medicated state of mind you've found is overrated
Oh, I, do you?
You saw it all come down and now it's time to imitate it
Hey now, every time I lose altitude

[Chorus]
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded

[Bridge]
Come on, God, do I seem bulletproof?

[Chorus]
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
I'm something out this world, nothing like the rest
Nigga, win the fair game, fuck with the best
Just a kid with the grown men, rep to protect
Since it's so rare so there's a whole land left in distress

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I'm coming for your neck, hey, I ain't indirect
They in debt, pay respect, now I'm coming to collect
They regret what they said, that's when I become a threat
Make a bet that the next time you niggas come correct
This the type of music make a nigga flex
Start so gangster, move it throwing up the set
All the pretty niggas feeling only breasts
And the government are cutting only checks
Everybody stressed

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
If knowledge is power and power is knowledge
And then you divide and conquer, I devoured and conquered
The youth is my environment, inspire responsibly
But they rather drop it like it's hot, that wobbity wobbity
If you ever thought of robbing me, my mob on me probably
I believe this highway robbery, get the fuck out the driver's seat
Honestly part of the problem, you deprived of your privacy
This is private property, you part of the poverty
You forced just like the prophecy, that's part of the policy
Obviously just plain technology, democracy's mockery
My doc made a hypothesis, he said that I'm obsolete
The power of the God in me, no telling what I'mma be

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Intro: Gotye]
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Verse 1: Akon]
Go on take 'er, I don't need 'er
Kickin' back in my 2 seater
I'm through with ya, I don't remember
Nothin' 'bout ya, amnesia
I moved on, adios
Pop your bottles, make a toast
B-both pockets, filled up
Nothin' but dead folks
You thought that I was gonna save you
Tried to play but I played you
Louie V, D&G
Look at your weave which I made you
I'm cold hearted, no feelings
My McLaren got no ceiling
Fast life, care down
I'm made of fire, three wheelin'
Panamera, new Ferrari
Paint job, caucasian
Two hoes, half asian
Two mo', Venezuelan
Through with ya, now kick rocks
S1's in my pick top
10 bricks for this wrist watch
It's over babe, straight drop

[Hook: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Verse 2: Money J]
Money money money man
I got DC's, crockodiles
On both feet, Kai Peters
Livin' life, screwed up
Jump lane for 100 meters
You spreadin' rumors, tellin' lies
But that's bullshit, I'm too fly
My heart cold, I don't feel
Nothin' in it, it paralyzed
Deep and under, I cut 'er off
She know how to treat a boss
I move pounds like Boston George
Get high before I was record
Mark Jacobs on my face
Gator heads on my waist
Makin' more, B-O-T
I pop the trunk but there's lil space
Goin' in on everything
Head first, divin' for it
You playin' games, changin' numbers
And I ain't got time for it
Drop the top, I need head room
Flat screens in my bathroom
I got a red ho with long weave
With Money Man on her tattoos

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Black Frost]
Ai-ain't in love with him, blood sucka
Bleed his Pockets, then burn rubba
You can look, never let him touch it
Think about it all day – Mothafucka
Run over niggas, road kill
Need room to breathe like fishy gills
Get em' new? What's the use
Give them away, goodwill
High heels, TG's
Got that ass movin' in 3D
The riding cure everything's so Breezy
Gotta fight him for me like Rhi Rhi
Black frost, heart cold
Thawed out, heart froze
Armpits, tagged toes
Beauty and the beast, don't love hoes
That shit, I don't like it
Do anything for a Klondike
Ice-cream but my ice clean
And my cake feels, bon appetite
Devious, French too
Bitch cost, whole thang
Twenty cake in my bustier
38 in my vera wang

[Outro]
Consider this Evil Empire thing as a threat

[Spoken Word: Drake]
You see the difference between me and you: is that I just hit rock bottom. After this, I don't have a choice. I got people to provide for, promises I've made, and goals to meet. Hmm. What you got?Comeback

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Locker room they getting ready, all jury called, getting heavy
Fish nets and them high heels, we team Louis, we team Gucci
No Pelle, all Bentley's, no Chevy's, all titties
No bellies, all yella's, black tats and they ass clapping
Looking deadly and that pole clean, stage name and a nose ring
Shoeboxes like four weeks from four blocks, bring the whole thing
Basketball money is so long, rap money only lasts four songs
Dope money, still a king here and they cornered us so they go home
Killers lurk and they chillin', camera man, he feel me
Feeling good, I'm feeling, my mama watch my children
Security know that we dealing, lights all in that ceiling
DJ let them hoes know, dope money in the building

[Hook: Gizzle & Lupe Fiasco]
They ain't really out here getting paid
But these niggas out here rapping my life
I been in the trap all day but your hoes be on the back all night
Dope money in the building, dope money in the building
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope money in the building
Dope money in the building, dope money in the building
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope money in the building
Dope money in the building

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now rap boy come show respect to that lifestyle that he rap 'bout
Basketball player don't know it yet but that car came from that trap house
That platinum card mean good credit, but street credit don't max out
A elegant little strip tease, and when you ask some tricks they lapse out
Bentley trunk in that raffle, call the troops and let the city shine
Send a bottle to my rival and then we send a bottle back over to mine
She super loose, she super fine, doing loopty-loops in those pole climbs
And rap come through get a song drop, and the real shit play, all the way
Them hood girls know the whole rhyme, connect here and we chilling
D.A. they filming, I ain't going cause I'm brilliant
Kilo, quarter million, no free throws, no spinach
Such a feeling when it's dope money in the building

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
It's so sick, you can feel the presence when you here
Basketball player 'bout to fall in love with that little girl
But that's her job, head over here
Do it, don't interfere with these lights and music help engineer
These money motivated romances that a pay your rent for like a whole year
What you thought it was lil' nigga, what you thought was the goal here
Devil all up in this bitch, that's why I ain't bring my soul here
My partner happy on parole here, I stand up and get a cold stare
Byproduct of them drug times, if we leave then the club dies
Girls don't want us going nowhere, coat check cause it's cold here
Girls don't want us going nowhere, coat check cause it's cold here
Now they gotta just kick it with the lames
And maybe pop it for some tickets to the game
Damn, drogas

[Intro]
Change is coming, change is here

[Verse 1]
Holla if you hear me
In the memory of 2Pac sincerely
Been a G, since standing four feet on the monkey bars
Steal a nigga's box like it was ours
Cars roll up, Nah we don't fold up
We just hold up our guns like championship cigars
Mama hold the porch sipping OE out of a straw
I remember it all, them early Compton days
Shit, I put my all in them high school hallways
Montgomery never saw the dime bags
Finshed my work, finished a sale right before class was over
Now what's over I'm old enough to put the world on my shoulders without a massage
Never came in the truck no more, we back seat
Times is rough, the only time your pledge your allegiance
If you're shot in the heart bleeding
Ouch

[Verse 2]
It's gutter when the sun come up
When the sun go down
Nothing but tears, no onions
Under the ungodly functions, 187s and robbery will come
Don't go looking for it
Don't look like you hard
You're better off looking foreign, I'm warnin' ya
Before that warm temperature warmin' up
Your blood temperature, that corner filled with coroners
The neighbors is listeners
I'm the future of the new west for you visitors
Never mind them other niggas
I'm talkin' in particular
Just cause you got the flu don't mean you're sick enough
I'm igloo cold with it
If California snows then I did it
The 21st of June I'll make a blizzard
The OG aim they guns at the moon
Bullets break through the atmosphere
Fear no man but God, the God of rap is here
And I can see you scared (whew)

[Verse 3]
Real gangsters either dead or in jail
And you don't look like a zombie and I don't see no cells
I sink niggas blackships, he won't sail
And his album really ain't shit, he won't sell
And I had that mind state since twelve
No skates on my feet just running the turf for life like football cleats
5 hours asleep, nigga you do the math
That's 19 hours lost, I got insomnia bad
But, I can't complain or happen to think it too much, came passion Albert Einstien gained
Had to hold my stomach for hunger pains over looking ?
This business got too many villians
Superman is back
The cape ain't red, it's black
That's a trench coat
And the note for your information if we was dead this recarnation
Watch your heads

[Verse 1: Da$H]
(Sparking and exhaust tear, yeah so)
Fuck you and everything you fucking represent
(You know the rest nigga)
You piece of shit
I mean it
Swim in Fallopian's of Ethiopian women
The wheels are spinning, moon is glistening, view exquisite
Now viewing witness, a youth that's twisted
Off purple liquid made to cure the sickness
Feel like my vision took a pitch shift
Smoking that Samson got me lifted
I'm the one who gave your girl cousin them drugs
Your little brother's plug, spit inside your mother's mug
Take her finest bottle, pour the liquor out for all my one's above
The last shot is for the homie's locked
Lit the crop, hit the lot
Double spin into the Guinness drop, pull off in fourth gear
Put it in park, the whores, they see me, say the Lord's here
My voice is hoarse from them 'Ports dear
Over here we don't support fear
Road to the riches and the course clear
I'm riding 'til the tires sparking and exhaust tear, it's on, yeah
Yeah so, nigga

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
We couldn't come up with a hook so we gon' just use this
I don't like ad-libs
Amen
Actavis in cactus cooler
I bit the Apple on the Mac computer, you a loser
There ain't a subject I can't tackle, either now or sooner
Ain't got no shoulder pads, but collateral pass to her
Running back, running rap, I bet you wish she knew ya'
Black Lip Pastor, hallelujah (Soulo, Soulo)
Soulo in this ho, that mean this church up in this bitch
Gave her a sermon then I hit, God
I'm an entity into titties, a fat ass, some clean pussy, and some good weed
Knowledge and wisdom in abundance, infinite energy
And I'll be sure to write night and day, literally
Deadline snapback, Backwoods in my backpack
Xan with that lean nigga, shit you never seen nigga
Put that on my team nigga, 3 i's, you see me bruh
Careful, you know the game's T-D-E, us
Amen

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
I heard they out there praying for the death of me
I been down to knock, it's my destiny
I been 'round the block, it's no testing me
We been ran the north, it's no extra key
So whatchu' got on lock my nigga?
I tried to tell him, they ain't gon' get it
I been prolific, been on this shit
You can check mo millie, that was like 08's
You niggas ain't no factors, just come around cause we ain't no actors
It's no scenes cut, just checks
Don't want 25, but I'll take my time
If a nigga come around, tryna take what's mine
Tryna take my life? good luck with that
We got guns for that, you not coming back
I got Fade in the bushes, lurking & looking
Bout' that life, don't get your's took quick
Just a story of some kids left stranded
Couple of the homies and a couple automatics
Come to the hood, get a good pack out
Tombstone read RIP, with your hood whacked out
You know what he about, at Ramona Park 'til after dark
They drain they pool, we swam with sharks
We shooting fools off 7th street
You make the bed in which you sleep
I stay awake like visiting dead
With the hammer sitting indiscreet, in the streets

[Verse 4: RetcH]
(So sinister, so sinister, so sinister, the lone visitor)
Lo God nigga, coming through your motherfucking speakers, bitch ass nigga
Sold drugs in your granny building, in front the children
A piece of shit, I'll be considered the most
Baby hen on the dinner plate, I start the meal with a toast
Three assorted cheeses, they garnish the loaf
Cut the slices even
Distribute them to my assemblage of these fucking heathens
A bunch of demons in these Polo fleeces
I clutch the reefers and evade polices
I burn the Priest and vanish in the breezes
I talk to Jesus, reconsidered features
Rain dance on black sanded beaches
Pick from the tree that bare the fruit of peaches
Slaying these skeezers in the field of Eden
These backwoods got me with the heavy breathing
Connecting Venus and the shit the cheapest
I hit the party with the Sherm perm, ear-rings look like strobe lights
I cop the goldfish platforms for the cold price
Hop out the V in all sequence, bitch is Swedish
Suede Fedora, yeah my shit the meanest, you need it
And I'm the founder of the shit
On the forty-sixth floor, eating flounder with the shrimp
Got a awfully thick splore and I just pound her with the dick
Get the dope from out abroad, destroy the county with the shit
Piece of shit records, where dreams come true
You saying fuck me? nah, fuck you
And fuck your moms and 'em
Go fuck your Aunts daughter
You piece of shit, you're disgusting, I hate you

What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for a girl birthday
Ok, they

They ordered champagne why they look thirsty?

Walk-around-always-mad reputation

It's like the first time back in the basement

Doo doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo

[Verse 1]
You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey, babe, your hair's alright
Hey, babe, let's go out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast

[Pre-Chorus]
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

[Chorus]
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so
{Bridge}
Don't ya?
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo

[Verse 2]
You've got your mother in a whirl
'Cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey, babe, your hair's alright
Hey, babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast

[Pre-Chorus]
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

[Bridge]

[Outro]
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chi, chi-chi
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like I've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooh, your face is a mess
Ooh, ooh, so how could they know?
Ah, ah, how could they know?
Ah, ah

[Verse 1]
We’re sippin' cocktails, lookin' down upon the riot
You whisper “Baby, love the way you look tonight
I wanna save you, save you from the world outside."
I know it seems you’re all I wanted and much more
But then, to tell the truth, I’ve been through this before
They say “I’ll save you, save you”, but they never do

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I think you know I want to believe you
But in my heart, I know that I’ll leave you
It’s sort of sad how instincts deceive you, or does it please you?
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run

[Chorus]
I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walkin' out the door but I already miss you
Thinkin' about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I make the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're callin', it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies

[Verse 2]
Well back in high school, in the yard, we used to fight
But you would sneak in through my window every night
“I wanna take you, take you to the world outside”
Well, I assume it’s what I wanted at the time *(oh, at the time)*
But your eyes were like a constant warning sign *(oh, warning sign)*
“I wanna take you, take you” and I didn’t mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And even then I didn’t believe you *(no)*
You had a smile so easy to see through
I know a little part of me will always need you *(yes)*
Try to reach you, try to please you *(what?)*
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you done makes me wanna run, run

[Chorus]
I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walkin' out the door but I already miss you
Thinkin' about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I make the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're callin', it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies

[Bridge]
I know, I know, I know, we aren't good together
I can’t let go, I’m sure that we should be forever

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I look around, there’s no one above you
I think you know that I’ll always love you
And baby, I’m bad too, it’s not just you
But I can’t wait forever to trust you
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you’ve done makes me wanna run, run

[Chorus]
I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walkin' out the door but I already miss you
Thinkin' about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I make the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're callin', it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies

[Verse 1]
I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
And that ain't hard
Just me and my own two feet
In the heat, I got myself to meet
A detective of perspective, I
Need to try and get a bigger eye
Open wide
Bloodwood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout in a sunny daze
Do me now

[Hook]
On a walkabout

[Verse 2]
You can do it in the city, you can do it in a zone
You can do it in the desert, you can do the unknown
On a walkabout
High desert skies are what I spy
So fly, you gotta wonder why, hmm
The stingrays must be fat this year
They're moving slow in my lowest gear
The didgeridoo original man with a dream
I believe the Aborigine

[Hook]
On a walkabout

[Verse 3]
You could do it with a shuffle, you could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride, you could do the unknown
On a walkabout, mmm hmm
A walk could cure most all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
One, two

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 4]
I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
Can't hurt to try
Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side

[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus]
Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die, we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

[Verse 1]
It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinking about everything that we've become, and I hate it
I thought we could make it, but I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinking you were out wit' your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I, see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said

[Chorus]
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."

[Verse 2]
Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimming, in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playing when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses and my loving
But ain't nobody better than us
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I, see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but you said

[Chorus]
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."

[Bridge]
I guess it’s over indefinitely
But you and I know it’s not that easy to let go
Of everything, that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won’t forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow
Wanna believe you and me, we can figure it out, oh

[Chorus]
Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

[Verse 3]
Gonna make me say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(when we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(when we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)

[Chorus]
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
When we ride, we ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
We ride

[Intro - The Weeknd]
They wanna threesome, then some
Spend whatever come in, fucking income
Me and my niggas we're never going broke
And you, have to, do it all
Just to know where it get to
Living dreams we can never afford
Now we sitting in the backseat
Backseat 

[x17]

[Verse - Soulja Boy]
I got tattoos all over me, and she fuck with that
I pull up in foreign whips, and she fuck with that
A boss nigga, all the lame niggas copy cat
I pull up in that phantom, and she in that jag
Tattoos all up on my chest, on my neck and back
I'm getting money sipping lean, nothing but act
A million dollars, that's nothing but taxes
I ball out everyday, I don't know how to act
I'm dropping the top on my 'rari
They stare at me when I'm in the party
I said "baby we made it", she said "baby we did"
I'm stunting on these fuck niggas, they know what it is
Now we in the backseat, turning up
And she high off the kush, we burning up
She roll one and smoke it, and we rolling
You already know, you know how this shit go

[Outro - The Weeknd]

Riding to Jaipur
Riding through the night

[Verse 1]
Call it magic, call it true
I call it magic when I'm with you
And I just got broken, broken into two
Still I call it magic, when I'm next to you

[Chorus]
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
Oooh ooh ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Call it magic, cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still, I call it magic, such a precious jewel

[Chorus]
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

[Bridge]
Wanna fall, fall so far
I wanna fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
I call it ma-, ma-ma-magic
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
"Still believe in magic?"
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Of course, I do

[Verse 1]
You say that you’re watching the birds out the window
Well I’ve got a bird you can watch
You ain’t gotta act like you’re borrowing eggs
Just to see if my dishes are washed
And what’s it to you if it’s Wednesday at noon
And I’ve traded my iced tea for scotch

[Chorus]
Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

[Verse 2]
You ain’t gotta ask what I did to my hair
Or whose underwear’s on the line
They ain’t mine
I ain’t gonna ask who's been mowing your grass
So you ain’t gotta ask who mows mine
Quit judging my job and my car and my clothes
Get your nose out of your mini blinds

[Chorus]
Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer (Oh-oh)

[Bridge]
Don’t ask me if I go to church
I won’t ask if your husband is still out of work
Try and claim high society
We get our mail on the same side of the street

[Chorus]
Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ain’t friends we’re just neighbors
Ain't nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

[Outro]
You nosey bitch
There ain’t nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

[Verse 1]
I'm so in love
I'm still in love
I never met love quite before
Until I saw your face
And watching stars without you
My soul cries
My heaving heart
Is full of pain
When we're apart
The aching

[Chorus]
I'm kissing you
Oh
I'm kissing you, oh

[Verse 2]
You're my father, you're my soldier
You protect me
Boy you saved me
You're best friend
You're my husband
You are my doctor, counselor, provider, professor, my everything
And I love you, I love you, I love you, yes, I love you

[Verse 3]
I, I need you, I need you, I need you
I can't live without you
I trust you, I trust you with every ounce of me
Just teach me boy teach me just take me
When we make love I can feel all your spirits
Deep inside of me yea
Baby you're so pure, oh

[Chorus 2]
I'm kissing you forever and ever and ever
I love kissing you, kissing you, kissing you
I love everything about you, baby
It's been so many years since we found love
You got something special, baby

[Verse 4]
We can cry together
We can grow together
Be ourselves together
And I love you
More than music
Yes, I love you more than music

[Outro]
I rather be kissing you, oh
I'm kissing you, oh
Kissing you
Kissing you

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Read my lips, clarinet, talk that walk, pair of steps
Two shots, parachutes, two drops, pair of troops
New drops, wearin' roofs, full bloom, bearin' fruits
Full moon put the where in wolves’, apparently put it in the air and shoot
Heirlooms that's what I leave, heirlooms that's how I weave
They don't care to you and that's hair to you, this what I breathe
I'm the heir apparent from a pair of parents
Taught me that sharin's carin' so I spread the bread out
That's what I need
To get in heaven that's when I bleed, get in hell when I breathe...
Get it? Inhale, when I breathe
Maybe you'll get it when I bereave, there's levels to this shit
And there's devils on the level of this bitch
We all ball even the devil gotta pitch
You fly so that's red bull and a fish
You can have that, that's complimentary
True story, documentary
Ninja Turtle, sewer side
Though continentally West Side

I'm King James with a blunt lit, my name ring like a phone call
It's only right that you meet defeat, I guess that's protocol
Soulo ho, oh God, Lord knows like you never said yes
Success, I'm on the verge-in, like I never had sex
You upset as fake breasts, but don't stress, it looks good on you
He couldn't get it understood, so I stood on him
Food and liquor, in my belly, of the beast but you knew already
I used to complain until planes I flew already
Now I'm ready, amen, like one guy I'm so heavy
Let's say tons, that's blasphemy, with eight guns, keep your machete
Young mind, fuck the world, that's an orgy with an OG
Ironically, when you're high as me, you won't need floor seats
This flow here for King Rich I won't stop 'till my team's richer
Mind, body and spirit on top of the dollar, spinnin'
My optimism is why I'm in this position
You pray, I prey, it's just that I'm a lion bitin' his victim

Pay homage, I ain't gotta plan it to play with comets
Save your comments, (trigger finger make you vomit)
(Egghead just makin' omelets to move the chickens like Reaganomics)
This world so damn ugly I won't put make-up on it, just bein' honest
Keys on us like dope dealers, open doors for the lost souls
(Ring on keys like Swizz Beatz, to make sure a nigga never lost those)
(Amateurs get locked out, we janitors with the mops out)
Clean house, I used to wanna be the GOAT but I'm the Ox now
Rap like I went to Oxford with bastards, threw Glocks on 'em
Red and blue, now the cops on 'em, (ayy nigga)
(Hell yeah, you, with them dots on him, infraredin' you)
(Intellectual like Inspectah Deck, protect your neck from Lu)
Cause we the children of the night!
Of the livin' dead lookin' for some light
I got some lean up in my Sprite
I call it the Jesus Juice, Lu, what would Jesus do? Whoo!

Got those women that are pretty
Some that are fine
And when you put all that together
That's when you got you a bad girl

Bad girl, mala mala, si no te veo hoy yo te veo mañana (¿cómo?)
Bad girl, mala mala, coje los hombres y lo deja cambiada (dale)

Bad girls in the house, ay mi madre, dancing
And this chico right here is dangerous
Mami like Wall Street, looking for 
No treat, I skeet, then I ...
Not this one, she bad as hell
Mami , ain't hard to tell
So I chill with her, get it real with her
Next thing you know, I was cutting deals with her
I-N-D-P-E-aaah
Don't mind me, independent, spending
Moves so great I might bend them
Rule as I end them
She the Queen with no England
Now mami, what you into
If you got an open mind, go ahead and bring your kin, too
Like Barack, bring some hope to this bad world
Go ahead you bad girl

Calling all the bad girls, aaoeaa, give it to me, let's go
Calling all the bad girls, aaoeaa, give it to me, let's go

I don't know if it's a basic instinct
I don't know if it's a fatal attraction
But I like to hit 'em in threes, like taxing
I want another 48 hours of action (bad girl)
I'm gon' ride with her (bad girl)
And that's for sure (bad girl)
That's cause I tried it once (bad girl)
And now I want some more (bad girl)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
You gonna love me, baby!

Fresh checkerboard Vans and a T-shirt
And it's going down but she first
My flow sweet, make my teeth hurt
I spit ice cream bars, that's dessert
To me there's no such thing as a G-1st
Yea, my feature price high like a mink purse
I smoke a whole reef of the reefer
Drugs are bad but I beg to defer, sir
I just take a look at her face
So she can see that
My shades are Versace and she purr
Cause I'm a cool cat per say
So I give her my life and now I got eight, word
She asked me to go over her place, I said sure
She said shes been horny all day, I got the cure
I'm on her like turf
Now bring that ass, bring that ass
Bring that ass hurr, ya digg?
I, I, I don't know that you been told
But I can tell you something 'bout me
I smoke weed, I drink and I roll
Now is you fucking with me
Now I can't tell you shit 'bout the next man
But he ain't got nothing on me
Cause after a pill and half and a shot of Patrón
I'm a pussy MVP

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flatscreen
Plasma
"Hey Nicki, hey Nicki," asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' Fraggle Rock, beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I feel pretty, I feel pretty
I feel pretty, and witty, and gay
And I pity any girl who isn't me tonight

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fucking pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering "Why, God?" He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fucking face and called me a fucking tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)

[Chorus: Eminem]
I feel ugly, I feel ugly
Slut don't touch me, or hug me, I'm mad
And I pity any girl who gets with me tonight

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas getting buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches calling me Manning Eli
I hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling
I got 'em scared, shook, panicking
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin

[Verse 4: Eminem]
All you lil' faggots can suck it, no homo
But I'mma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you assdicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash!
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fucking balcony
'fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash, it's (high class) meets (white trash)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I feel pretty, I feel pretty
I feel pretty, and witty, and gay
And I pity any girl who isn't me tonight

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Look up, it's me in the sky
A king, a pharaoh, a beast is alive
You all in my space, you gettin' too close just lookin' to fuck up my vibe
I came with some models, they on the front page
Just business, and bullshit aside
So please keep your nose in your business
And the bullshit all out of mine
Real figure and figures don't lie
I'm a killa just look at my life
I gave you a lot to aspire, but you'd rather sit and type bullshit online
Okay I'm done with this shit
At your party and shit, we's getting high
Tropic your ocean, you boastin', you bold
I'll really show you 'bout crime
My day goes, go on ho
You A-holes just hate though
I celebrate to champagne in Tokyo
Ooh I kill 'em, I kill 'em, I did it
Last king on the finish
If time is money, these bitches gon' have to start payin' for all of my minutes

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Look up, it's me in the sky
A king, a pharaoh, a beast is alive
I'm high as Rasta, you an imposter
I just imported my ride
SLR I bought in Milan
Versace, I did it all now
I post it a lot, I post it a lot, she post on my jock it's cause
Times, times, time my Rollie price, don't fuck up my vibe
I go so hard knock out these lines
They copy and post in on Vine
Who you entitled to
Too many love for you
I don't want cuff for you
I just want tongue in you
Party have fun with you
This I'm supposed to do
Touch you and change your life
You A-holes just hate though (2x)
I celebrate to champagne in Tokyo (Tokyo)
Champagne in Tokyo (Tokyo)
I celebrate to champagne in Tokyo (Tokyo)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Hol up, hol up, hol up, pop a bottle
Hol up, hol up, hol up, if you suck then swallow
Smell that marijuana, they gon' follow
Throwin money on her like she won the lotto
Pussy must be serious
Scared of heights come face your fears
Do it just like Nicki gon' and bend it over
Say she never smoked I turned her to a stoner
Young nigga but I'm ready
Oh, foreign girls call me sexy
And white girls gimme becky
But first I gotta roll this joint, baby hol' up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Hol up, hol up, had to check the rollie
You know what time it is, bad bitches only
My nigga caught a case bailed out in the morning
Cause we got dollars bitch, so dont you dial The Police

[?]
I'm repping and mixing my time like nigga what is you saying
Come fly to LA and i'll show you 

[?]
We at the story, now the star island
Mianmi and mollys, the young rich king im wildin'
Hol up, hol up, hol up, tryna' be so fucking bout it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Hol up, hol up, hol up, you drive me crazy

Leave the club these hoes be tryin to chase me
You got a ass so fat lets make a baby
Damn, Im smokin weed in my mercedes
Hol up, these niggas broke, these niggas lazy
Man they money slim, they actin shady
Im in my brand new car, who wanna race
Ho, bitch you ain't call my phone so why you showin up
Im takin them shots all my niggas stay loaded up
Man on the low all these hoes be actin so material
Hol up, man did you see her interior

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I was just walking that day, aimlessly (Oh, oh, no)
You picked a perfect day to bump into me (Perfect day)
Probably should've watched the stars in the sky the night before
But for some reason, we still met at your store (You, baby)
Your eyes have a story that they wish to tell
And I have my whole life and I listen well (Hey)
Look, I'll be your confidant
Tell me anything
But please start it off with how you tuck your wings
Oh

[Chorus]
There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me

[Verse 2]
All my friends meet you and say you're the one
(You're the one, you're the one, yeah)
And all my meaningless friendships should be done
(I should just leave them alone)
You had a friend, but he did you wrong
But I'm a God sent sign that reads "Please move on with me"
You taught me to use my heart and forget my eyes
(Use my heart, forget my eyes)
And that's the way to his kingdom of eternal life
Since you're an angel, baby your job's never done
Too bad the world won't see you when they dial 9-1-1

[Chorus]
There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me
There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me

[Bridge]
There's nothin' else in this world
Like you
So why is it so complicated?
What are you afraid of?

[Verse 3]
I've been asking everybody what they think
But I don't know why because they don't know you
I'm even asking other guys what would they say
But I don't know why 'cause they don't do what I do
Girl, I say an ultimatum's for you
But you'd probably take that and just run
Now I gotta decide if I'ma help raise your mind
Seems like the ultimatum's on me; that's no fun

[Outro]
I was just walking that day, aimlessly
Da, da, da-dum
Da, da, da-dum
Da, da, da-dum
Da, da, dum-dum-dum-dum, oh, ooh
Da, da da-dum, ooh, ooh

I can moon walk, make her ass talk
I'm a cash vault, 

[?] then spark, hear my trunk bump
We go dumb dumb, dumb dumb, I'ma do it some
Now watch me stunt, I'ma leave with one
Though I came with none, now watch me cum
I'm a pimp with a gold stripper ho from the soul be the game I run
It was shots through the cot giddy up, put it on your tongue

[Hook]
We be the illest
We be the illest in here
I know you feel us

We so muthafuckin' ill!

[Verse 2: Kev Nish]
Yeh, I be Illin' out from LA, I be illin' out all the way
Got a v-mail from my K-Town chick that wanna hook up and blaze
I got OG cannabis (can I bust?), girl, one puff will put you in your grave
Got three pills and four jimmy hats, cause we don't kid and play
Popov, yo, guess who's getting drunk, no muthafuckas can't out-drink us
If you sipping that hate, don't get drowned, so cold polar bears on my nuts
Y'all know who we be, I hold it down for the East
Cause I keeps it pimpin', Peter Griffin, yellow tinted on Z's

[Bridge: J-Splif]
Drippin' on yo couches
Drippin' on yo couches
Sippin' Tanqueray with Orange Bang we on that Tropicana
Drippin' on yo couches
From the hills to public housing
If you feelin' ill then damn you ill
Be the illest on a thousand

[Hook]

[Verse 3: RiFF RAFF]
Yeah, nice chain, what a nice night
My ice bright, I play the wall like a night-light
Tangerine tambourine from the West Wing
The best thing about my room? Versace bed springs
I'm in the building, more gold than Rumpelstiltskin
Aw shit, look who it is: the white Russell Simmons
Jody Highroller, Far East Movement
We so ill, I think I need some codeine fluid

[Verse 4: B.o.B.]
Badaboom badabambi
Every day in her hair like Pantene
Pro B, ain't ready for a family
Fuck family, so she better have a Plan B
Plan B, never mind what the rumors say
Rumors say, never mind what the rumors say
Rumors say, when I walk into a room they say
Bobby Ray, boomaye, boomaye
I'm faded, my eyes are glazin', dialated
You hate that that nigga made it so you jaded
Your momma, your baby momma, and your lady
Be bumpin' my music naked while they're shavin'
Thots be like "Bobby save me, Bobby save me"
But this ain't no bank for checkin', ain't no savin'
I'm never known to accept a limitation
You want it with me well here's the invitation
Bands, Bobby, there's no more debatin', wow I'm just amazin'
Damn, she started 

[?] 'till her panties start wavin'
Man, man I'm so sick, I'm so ill
Thermometers cannot monitor my level of chill
Grippin' the grain, whippin' the wheel

[Hook]

[Outro: Prohgress]
"I" is for the way these beezies love how I bang
And "double L" is for the way I blow that smoke in ya face
We roll on "E's" and we be easy rollin that bank
And "ST" is for the Illest shit we rep every day
As 'Dark Horse' reigns for a fourth week, Perry rewrites the mark for the most total weeks (46) at No. 1 in the airplay chart's archives

Katy Perry claims the record for the most weeks at No. 1 in the 21-year history of Billboard's Pop Songs radio airplay chart all to herself, as "Dark Horse," featuring Juicy J, spends a fourth week on top, upping her career count to 46 weeks at No. 1. With her latest frame in the lead, Perry passes Mariah Carey, who's totaled 45 weeks at No. 1

Here's an updated look at the acts to spend the most time at No. 1 dating to the Oct. 3, 1992, launch of the Nielsen BDS-based tally, which measures the most weekly plays at mainstream top 40 stations:

Weeks at No. 1, Artist
46, Katy Perry
45, Mariah Carey
32, P!nk
32, Rihanna
29, Ace of Base
26, Maroon 5
25, Christina Aguilera
23, Beyonce
23, Boyz II Men
23, Nelly

Perry has earned her record-breaking feat courtesy of 11 Pop Songs No. 1s, also a chart best-sum, which she shares with Rihanna. (Notably, the careers of artists like Carey and Boyz II Men pre-date the Pop Songs chart's inception.) Of Perry's 11 leaders, "Horse" is the eighth to rule for at least four weeks. She set a personal best when "California Gurls," featuring Snoop Dogg, dominated for seven weeks in 2010

On its way to granting Perry her latest piece of Pop Songs history, "Horse" last week set the mark for the most weekly plays (16,151) in the chart's archives. It passed the 16,065 plays that her prior topper, "Roar," drew on the Oct. 19, 2013, chart
In addition to its pop airplay success, "Horse" topped the all-format airplay/sales/streaming-based Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it's her ninth career No. 1. It's sold 3.5 million downloads, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The song continues to build at multiple radio formats, bulleting at No. 2 on Rhythmic Songs, No. 8 on Adult Pop Songs and No. 28 on Adult Contemporary

All charts, including Pop Songs, will refresh on Thursday (March 6) on Billboard.com

[Intro: Betty Wright]
There's a few million angels movin' around me
I just worship thee, for all he's done for me
It's a new day, I have been born again
I've been born again, I've been born again
In His spirit, and His name, I'm sanctified!
Lord I testify, he's right by my side
I believe it be His word is so clear to me
Yeah, yeah

[Hook: Big Sean]
All I want's 100 million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status

[Verse: Big Sean]
Only real niggas so I know that you still gon' be absent
I feel like I'm the black Brad Pitt
When I wake up to fuckin' an actress
We just shot a movie last night on the couch
And I swear that that shit is a classic
If I want it, I need it, I need it, I have it, hit so much it's a habit
I'm greedy, I'm greedy, man fuck it, I'm greedy
Her titties so big that I nicknamed them DeeDee
I know that the devil is callin'
Man fuck that weak-ass nigga, let it keep ringin'
Right now I'm connected with Jesus, on threeway with Yeezus
We just signed a treaty, I'm on the couch like "Free my niggas!"
But niggas cannot get a freebie
If I'm in the field then you know that I TD
Overtime, all the time, man I repeat it
I need some good pussy and Posturepedic
Stressin' so hard think my hairline receded
I say how I say and I feel how I feel
And I won't take it back, it's no need to recede it
You stuck on a bitch?
Well I stuck to the script all my life, ain't no need to re-read it
If you got my email, you's a millionaire
If you got my cellphone, you's a realionare
I ain't been home in months but bitch I'm still the mayor
That Detroit nigga gettin' married but I'm still a player

[Bridge: Betty Wright]
I can feel his blessings wash away my sins
I'm sanctified and, I have been born again
Now I proclaim, hallowed be thy name
Ohhh
Holiday, Holiday, slow that shit down!
Come on now, they done, they know I do it
They know when I do it it get done, two sticks in my bun
But, but first of all, when I say "two sticks in my bun"
I mean that, when I put a bun in my hair
Like, when I put my hair in a ponytail and I wrap my hair in a bun
I put two Chinese sticks in my bun with the Chinese bang
'Cause y'all, y'all minds is in the gutter
That's what two sticks in my bun mean, okay?
But Holiday, you already know, y'knahmsayin?
They heard that hard spittin', they heard that fast shit
Now, you know, you gotta slow it down for them, you know?
Um, they wanna hear me sing
You know, behind every bad bitch there's a really sweet girly girl
There's a really sweet Harajuku Barbie, and, um
Now it's time for them to hear me get all nice and soft and moist
I mean, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that
I meant, this is the portion of the tape where
I just wanna be more, you know, delicate and wet (splash)
I'm, I'm, I'm so... I, I didn't mean to say that
I meant that, you know, Holiday, just slow it down, daddy!
Okay so I'm gonna just, you know, briefly run down my shoutouts
Shoutout to all of the DJs that's ever showed Nicki Minaj love
I love you right back
Shoutout to DJ Holiday, um, you know
Just 'cause he has really nice eyes
And, you know, he's really sexy and all that
Um, shout out to my baby Big Mike and Trapaholics
And Sticks Malone and DJ Infamous and DJ Drama
Um, I also have a very crazy manager

Speed it up slow ma, throw it back, toma (Haa)
Rock-rock Gators like my Detroit players

[Verse 1]
Boys, workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love I could barely eat
There's nothin' sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She give me toothaches just from kissin' me

[Chorus]
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

[Verse 2]
Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
And I was burning up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear, I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

[Chorus]
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

[Bridge]
My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
When I was kissin' on my baby
And she'd put her love down, soft and sweet
In the low lamplight, I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

[Chorus]
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Do you love me? Do you swear?
Am I still the one? Even when I'm not there (Woah)
'Cause you know how it go and go
When you wanna go and go
Have you seen what's her face? (Who?)
Is her number in your phone?
And your answer's yes and yes
But you still say no and no
Even though I know you know
I know I know you know I know
You know? It sound dumb-de-dumb-dumb
They say what we want's wrong, fuck it
Least know what we want
And it sucks to see you cry
Know a brokenhearted girl could make the whole world drown (Drown)
And even though your makeup smears
Man I'm the one that's been the clown, why the fuck we around?
'Cause girl, you know I got that jaw drop shit (Yeah)
Plus I know your insecurities, that mall cop shit (Oh God)
I give you that screwface shit (Freaky)
Bring the ugly side out, two-faced shit (Woah)
Tryin' all new ways shit (Mmmhmm)
One night turn into a few days shit (JLo)

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez & Big Sean]
I think I love just who you are (Hahaha, yup)
We haven't grown apart, this is just the start
Where life begin, all the way to the end (Oh, yup)

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Tell us all again what you think we should be
What the answers are, what it is we can't see
Tell us all again how to do what you say
How to fall in line, how there's no other way
But oh, we all know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Show us all again, that our hands are unclean
That we're unprepared, that you have what we need
Show us all again 'cause we cannot be saved
'Cause the end is near, now there's no other way
And oh, you will know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
You're guilty all the same

[Verse 3: Rakim]
Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of being rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split is nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowing as soon as the dough or the deal peak
They say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain drained, manipulated like artists
It's real deep until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock
Till pop and radio and record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
You feel me, we'll see that green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
TV or a name, the Media, the game, to me you're all the same
You're guilty

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same

[Intro]
Shit

[Verse 1]
You’re no better off
Living your life
Than dreaming at night
This much is true
But it’s still up to you
To take my advice

[Chorus]
To take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go
Go home, go home
Go home, go home

[Verse 2]
You’re better off dead
When your mind’s been set
From nine until five
How could it be true
Well, it’s happened to you
So take my advice

[Chorus]
And take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go
Go home, go home
Go home, go home
Go home, go home
Go home, go home

I'm getting money like I'm Macklemore
Got a lot of money, it's coming through the door
I got a hundred bands on the floor
I got Louie V, and I got Michael Kors
I'm getting money like I'm Macklemore
I got a hundred bands, coming straight through the door
I got money all across the floor
I got versace trench coats and I got Michael Kors

[Verse 1]
I be riding in that foreign whip
Hop up in the whip, I'm walking in the whip
Thirty bands and that's on my hip

I got a dirty gun in that hummer, and your girl want me to ask for her number

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We make it rain when we hit the club
My rims so big, it make my tires scrub

I got my gang on now, we going fucking ham
I got a fucking bad bitch, we got a lot money
I got a lot of fuck niggas, they be hating on me

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Murder, murder she wrote
My blood spills all over the pages
And my last breath is a quote
I say that I love you, my dying wish, girl, can you hold me close?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going six feet underground, where you left me
I'm going deep hope I don't drown 'cause you're air, baby
Girl, you a stone cold killer
I'ma need a body bag, pulling on my zipper

[Chorus]
Now I'm floating to the other side, with all the lies in your eyes
All these tears are coming down, now you realize, you committed a homicide
Baby, you had the gun and then you pulled the trigger, one shot put me down
So now I'm floating on the other side (Other side, other side), for you I'd do or die (Oh)
I'd drink, I'd smoke, I'd cry, I'd die for you
Drink, I'd smoke, I'd cry, I'd die for you
I'd drink, I'd smoke, I'd cry, I'd die for you
Drink, I'd smoke, I'd cry, I'd die for you

[Verse 2]
Baby, don't hold back, don't hold back
It's your chance, if you can, let you take my life away
It's my life in your hands
And girl, I need mouth to mouth, baby, I need CPR

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going six feet underground (Yeah), where you left me (Six feet)
I'm going deep hope I don't drown (Oh) 'cause you're air, baby (Air, babe)
Girl, you a stone cold killer (Yeah, girl)
And I'ma need a body bag, pulling on my zipper
(And now, I'm floating to the other side)

[Chorus]
Now I'm floating to the other side, with all the lies in your eyes (Ayy)
All these tears are coming down (Coming down), now you realize, you committed a homicide
Baby, you had the gun and then you pulled the trigger, one shot put me down
So now I'm floating on the other side (Other side, other side), for you I'd do or die (Oh)
I'd drink, I'd smoke, I'd cry, I'd die for you
Drink, I'd smoke, I'd cry, I'd die for you
Girl, I'd drink, I'd smoke, I'd cry, I'd die for you
Drink (I'd die for you), I'd smoke, I'd cry, I'd die for you (Ow!)

[Bridge]
Hold on, heavenly father, let me get back to my love
I wanna hold on, I don't wanna leave
Girl, I want to stay here 'til the end of life until for me
Girl, I wanna learn to love, how to love, deep in the clouds tryna come down, now, my love

[Chorus]
Now I'm floating to the other side (Floating), with all the lies in your eyes (Lies)
All these tears are coming down, now you realize, you committed a homicide
Baby, you had the gun and then you pulled the trigger (Ooh), one shot put me down
So now I'm floating on the other side (Other side, other side), for you I'd do or die (Oh)
I'd drink, I'd smoke, I'd cry, girl, I'd die for you
Drink, I'd smoke, I'd cry, I'd die for you
I'd drink, I'd smoke, I'd cry, I'd die for you (Oh woah)
Drink, I'd smoke, I'd cry, I'd die for you (Woah)

[Intro]
Turn the music on
They say baby how you do it
Never question greatness, never question greatness
Tell 'em never question greatness
I just do it
I'm so high I feel weightless
All my shooters are courageous, and

[Hook]
Ain't a moment 'til I make it
It ain't a moment 'til I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
Don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'
They got niggas catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
(Shoot it if I wave it)
Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah

[Verse 1]
Know you see me in that Rolls Royce, glass house, that nigga, hands down
No givin' up, no layin' down, all red, ant pile
My oldest son just turned five, I said "Lil nigga, you a man now"
Ride around with that strap out cause my Rolls Royce, glass house
I just got a text that said "Baby I just cashed out"
Whack weed get ashed out, put Persian rugs in the crack house
All y'all that lashed out, I'll come see what that's 'bout
But you don't need to call the fireman, to put a mothafuckin' match out
I can't remember my last drought, all my niggas' smashmouth
Got pure coke, brand new birds, we get 'em as soon as they hatch, slime
And you know the driveway too big when you ain't gotta back out
Paper chase like cat mouse, my nigga it

[Hook]
Ain't a moment 'till I make it
It ain't a moment 'till I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'

I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'
They got niggas catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah

[Verse 2]
Know you see me cause my roof all in my trunk
Know he dead when the horn honk
Niggas say they kings, they lyin', boy you talkin' to a card shark
I already made my mark, please don't think I just pop corks
Got these voices in my head screamin', can't believe they're not hoarse
Bitch I've been a beast since cartoon sheets
It's real on the field, I need new cleats, outgrew these
Catch you while you sleep, turn your sheets to maroon sheets
Them choppers turn your homeboys into amputees
And that's not a good look, momma was a chef, but daddy cooked the work
Said "I know it stank but it's good"
Look, we treat them triggers like repeat buttons
Leave it all out there, or leave nothin'
Like the world a crystal ball, I keep rubbin' it

[Hook]
Ain't a moment 'till I make it
It ain't a moment 'till I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
I don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'
They got people catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah

[Verse 3]
Can't nobody save yah
New Orleans pride and savior
Nigga this that Carter 5
I feel like, feel like I'm on my final caper
Uh, and I'm about to smoke one, pass out, OG kush, hashed out
She only want alcohol and trees, fuck that, you gotta branch out
I camp out by a rat house, wait 'till he turn the lamp out
Still drownin' in the fuckin' money, y'all niggas look like y'all swam out
In this bitch, gats out in this bitch
She say she can come and help my fat wallet get fit
I told her that's not in this script, I don't see that in the script
I'm smokin', gettin' head, lookin' down tryna read lips

[Hook]
Ain't a moment 'till I make it
It ain't a moment 'till I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
Don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'
Niggas I had you catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
(Shoot it if I wave it)
I tell myself

Ain't a moment 'till I make it
It ain't a moment 'till I make it
Have my cake and eat it too, I want a bakery
And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
Don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'

[Chorus: Tame Impala]
Only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
And we'll be screamin' out no rules, no rules
Feel the energy we go through, I told you
Pump my fist like I'm supposed to, I showed you
My vision of the unsocial, it's so cool
Look around me and you'll see the scene, who to blame?
See my generation has no shame, I play the game
How I see it this is inside the future, this is nothin' that you're used to
I refuse to play the victim, my religion is to move ya
Out your power position, my army head-on collision
Can't harm me out of my own skin, government need assistance
Every time that I zone in, nothing is more convincin'
Than tellin' you that I won't bend, break or fake partition
I can't, this is my life design, this is me taking mine's
This is what I live for, this is me takin' yours
This is more than C4, this is what happens when
We ready to build and destroy, I hope that you enjoy

[Chorus: Tame Impala]
It feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I live my life a rebel, a vigilante, devils try to get at me
Pedal through this underworld, undertakers won't catch me
System ain't no system for justice if you would ask me
I'll tell you everything is corrupted, don't you walk past me
With the condescended look I can tell you're pretendin'
Like you my friends and you just a henchman, I feel relentless
I feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
Or cut you with it, I'm cut from a cloth that bred a nuisance
Trespass on your property I am properly aimin' to go against ya democracy
This is me changing faces 'cause I can stand alone and die alone as long as I got pride
The victory of fight is all in my eyes
The night is young and I can see your demise, I'm waitin' for it
You can’t ignore it, you live dormant, I die enormous
Big as the lies you tell I can tell that you feel defeated
The truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason, capisce?

[Chorus: Tame Impala]
It feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
It feels

[Directed by SZA & APLUSFILMZ]

[Refrain]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

[Verse 1: SZA]
I can't recall the last time I took, advice from anyone
Shaped like a figure eight, who trusts pretty girls anyway?
And I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
I'm sure I'll be the death of me
And I can't recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy, who's got one anyway? Not me
Are you hating yourself? Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?

[Chorus: SZA]
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired (of) always making amends? Oh
I know you hate me now (Here)
I bet you hate me now (Here)
Bring on the thorny crown (Here)
Crucify me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Cross my heart then I hope to die
With a peace of mind (A peace of mind)
Piece together my brain
Soon as this beat rewind (Beat rewind)
Nitrogen and propane
I spike your drink at times (Turn up, turn up)
I make it hard to swallow this game
You throw up every line (Every line)
I notice people got Napoleon complexes
That's my confession (Yeah, that)
You said that we're equal but I know you're beyond guessing
That I'm beyond desperate (Yeah, that)
6AM on a Friday morning, my darkest hours
Them heartless hours, my apartment is lost in a coffin
I'm dead to the world like I popped me a couple downers
Down & Out on my luck
Salt water all on my tux and I call, she don't pick up
Then I fall when summer is ending
I mean, there's no pretending
I'm stuck in my ways and you're offended, that's life
That's you, this me, that vice
You're wrong, I'm right, that's right
I belong somewhere on ice
I'm cold, and my new blood type?
Even colder, cold shoulder
Born Sinner, you know? Cole showed us!
I have nothing to lose
My dark side been well in-tuned
A Gemini gon' show them faces
And this here just one of my moods, Babylon

[Chorus: SZA]
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)
Crucify me

[Refrain: SZA]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

[Verse 3: SZA]
I'm really over the cryin' thing, wipin' my tears
Who cries anyway? Spread like disease all over me
We did ungodly ghastly things, last night I mean
Who's God anyway? You're mine any day
It's burning, take me
I wanna feel your power, this final hour, tell me
Are you losing yourself? Will you lose it for me?
Are you losing yourself?

[Chorus: SZA]
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now (Here)
I bet you hate me now (Here)
Bring on the thorny crown (Here)
Crucify me

[Refrain: SZA]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
My flag is American, but I love some Queen
I'm young enough to vote, and toke the trees
I'll be playing concerts in the mud, until the sequel
I'll be finding subjects to paint in the buff, behind the easel
Tryna fuck, I'm a bad boy
I'm a punk, I'm a black man, I could dunk

[Pre-Hook]
And I'm hanging low, and I'm swinging far
Home, home

[Hook]
What you say
You need a hero
Heard 'em say
You need a save, hey

[Verse 2]
How high, tell me how high shall we jump
How far, really how far have we come
I've been wondering if we'd be better off without it
I was wondering were we better off before

[Outro]
Who needs you?, Who needs you?
Who loves you? Who doesn't?
What you say
You need a save, hey

[Verse 1]
I know summer time, down south, girls wear white tee's
All my New York, up-state girls in the Nikes
But all my T.O. girls, you know I got you
And they lyin' if they ever say I'm not the truth
I only want to make you mine
And take it slow and take my time
So this one here is just for you
You slidin' by later shawty, me and my crew

[Chorus]
Pull up on them girls and we swinging on fo', uh
Pull up on them girls and we swinging on fo', uh

[Verse 2]
This for my Houston girl, my New York Girl
And T.O. girl, my Creole girl

And don't think a nigga forgot
About my B. More girls
That rock them weaves and see them curls
Say fuck a hater, she don't care
So this one represents my heart
Even though I had you from the start
So this one here is just for you
I'm slidin' by later shawty, me and my crew

[Chorus]
Pull up on them girls and we swinging on fo', uh

[Chorus]
Work your thing out
Work your thing out
Work your thing out
Work your thing out

[Verse 1]
There's so many girls I hear you been running
From the beautiful queen that you could be becoming
You can look at my palm and see the storm coming
Read the book of my life and see I've overcome it
(I don't want the drama, get lost)
Just because the length of your hair ain't long
And they often criticize you for your skin tone
Wanna hold your head high 'cause you're a pretty woman
Get your runway stride on and keep going
Girl, live your life

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be myself (Yeah yeah)
Don't sweat, girl, be yourself
Follow me, follow me, follow me
Girl, be yourself
That's why I be myself
And I grew to love it

[Chorus]
Work your thing out
(Let 'em get mad, they gonna hate anyway)
Work your thing out
(Don't you get that?)
Work your thing out
(Doesn't matter if you're going on with their plan)
Work your thing out
(They'll never be happy
'Cause they're not happy with themselves)

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah yeah, work what you got
I'm talking 'bout things that I know
Yeah yeah, work what you got
It's okay, show yourself some love
Yeah yeah, work what you got
Don't worry 'bout who's saying what
It's gonna be fine, work what you got
Work what you got

[Verse 2]
Feelin' great because the light's on me
Celebrating the things that everyone told me
Would never happen but God has put His hands on me
And ain't a man alive could ever take it from me
Working with what I got, I gotta keep on (Keep on)
Taking care of myself I wanna live long (Live long)
Ain't never ashamed what life did to me
Wasn't afraid to change 'cause it was good for me
I wanna...

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be myself (I just wanna be)
Don't sweat, girl, be yourself (Don't sweat, girl)
Follow me, follow me, follow me
Girl, be yourself
That's why I be myself
And I grew to love it

[Chorus]
Work your thing out
(Let 'em get mad, they gonna hate anyway)
Work your thing out
(Don't you get that?)
Work your thing out
(Doesn't matter if you're going on with their plan)
Work your thing out
(They'll never be happy
'Cause they're not happy with themselves)

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah yeah, work what you got
I'm talking 'bout things that I know
Yeah yeah, work what you got
It's okay, show yourself some love
Yeah yeah, work what you got
Don't worry 'bout who's saying what

[Bridge]
Work that, work that, work that

You just work that, work that, work that
Girl, don't hold back, you just be yourself
Work that, work that, work that
Girl, don't hold back, you just be yourself

[Outro]
Work that thing out

[Intro]
Did you know, did you know, did you know, did you know
Did you know, did you know, did you know
That I love you
Did you know, did you know, did you know, did you know
And I want you

[Verse 1]
I'll admit things ain't been the way I thought they would be
Didn't expect so much stress to develop between me and you
I knew that it wasn't easy
But sometimes when we fight it don't seems like God's design
But then I hear words you said, and I promised I would
Stand for you and be true throughout the bad and the good
And I know what it means to be committed
So here's a word for you but you just ain't with it

[Chorus]
Stay down
(We're almost to the very best part)
Stay down
(You'll always be the pride in my heart)
Stay down
(We too can pass the test)
Stay down
(Yeah, we gotta lot of work)
Stay down
(I know it ain't been the best but it certainly ain't been the worst)
Stay down
(The drama will not last forever)
Stay down
(We'll beat it long as we're together)
One day we'll look back on this (Yeah)
We'll be like "Remember this"? (Remember this)
And it's gonna make us smile (Make us smile)
'Cause in the end we stayed down

[Verse 2]
I ain't gon' lie, at times you amaze me
You be talking and I swear that you're crazy
But, I learned a long time ago
That pride don't help, it only hurts
And I just want you to know
I need you, baby (I need you)
I'm just like Weezy, baby (Baby)
Not Weezy like the son of Baby
But the wife of George and we're moving on up
Ten years strong and we're looking like a plan
I'm looking like your woman and you're looking like my man
We looking like real and the haters look fake
Especially when they hear me say

[Chorus]
Stay down
(We're almost to the very best part)
Stay down
(You'll always have a place in my heart)
Stay down
(We too can pass the test)
Stay down
(You know we gotta lot of work)
Stay down
(I know it ain't been the best but it certainly ain't been the worst)
Stay down
(The drama will not last forever)
Stay down
(We'll beat it long as we're together)
One day we'll look back on this
We'll be like "Remember this"?
And it's gonna make us smile (Make us smile)
'Cause in the end we stayed down (Stayed down)

[Bridge]
Understand you are the one in my heart
And I'm holding yours so we can't live apart
When things stop making sense we'll figure it out
I walked into this and I don't wanna walk out no, no
Everything ain't gonna be how we like
And what is worth keeping if it didn't take a fight?
Your healing is in me, and my healing is in you
So get your mind right 'cause here's what we're gonna do

[Chorus]
Stay down
(We're almost to the very best part)
Stay down
(You'll always be the pride in my heart)
Stay down
(We too can pass the test)
Stay down
(You know we gotta lot of work)
Stay down
(I know it ain't been the best but it certainly ain't been the worst)
Stay down
(The drama will not last forever)
Stay down
(We'll beat it long as we're together)
One day we'll look back on this
We'll be like "Remember this"?
And it's gonna make us smile. (Make us smile)
Cause in the end we stayed down (Stay down)

[Outro]
Did you know, did you know, did you know, did you know
Did you know, did you know, did you know
That I love you
Did you know, did you know, did you know, did you know
Time got me feeling emotions
Why you always digging on my nerve?
I feel weak, when I say "please" you keep on
Does breaking me make you feel more strong?
Does breaking me make you feel more strong?

I go give show you how low I go
Playa boy go 'head and be that macho
Power up that blade on that chainsaw
Go cut me down and I'm still gon grow
Go cut me down and I'm still gon grow

Ahh ahhh ahh
Yeah, he left me, yeah
To go far far away

Cause ahh ahhh ahh
Yeah, he left me, yeah
To go far far away

Coz yesterday I met a girl from Warsaw
She walked like a turtle with a saw paw
Why don't they make some kinda new law
That stops making a religion out of war?
Yeah, happy you know lots of useless info
Keep ticking like a brain on a robot
But I do know some things you don't know
That people you hate come back for more
Ahh ahhh ahh
Yeah, he left me, yeah
To go far far away

Cause Ahh ahhh ahh
Yeah, he left me, yeah
To go far far away

A tug of war with me and he was called for
Like he was iced tea, I was always palmer
But you broke me when you act like you want war
Coz my strength makes you feel insecure

Now here we go, we bouncing like a pinball
I let him go so he can go paint time gold
Why don't we live for that love though?
Or does money still drive you a whole lot more?
Or does money still drive you a whole lot more?

[Verse 1]
So you think you're lonely
You think that you're the only one
Baby, listen closely
Don't let me be another one

The city's getting colder
The streets are turning into ice
So baby hold me closer
And let me stay for one more night

[Chorus]
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas

[Verse 2]
So baby take my hand
Walking down the avenue
I know you wanted Paris
I guess that this'll have to do
So come on quit your dreaming
Girl I got the master plan
City isn't so bad
When you're with your lover man

[Chorus]
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas

[Intro]
Ruff Ryders! You know!

[DMX]
(Here we go again, baby)
Here we go again, fucking right
Dark Man X baby, dog for life

[Hook: Swizz Beats & DMX](5x)
When I say D-M, y'all say X
D-M (X!), D-M (X!)

[Verse: DMX]
I don't fuck with what you sayin', 'cause your raps weak
I'll take the back streets and y'all can run a track meet
The full length of my rap sheets, see that be
The flow that's crushin' them on the L
Jumpin' on they fuckin' shit, bustin' them until they swell
Then tell ya mother next time she see her son is never
And I'd be on your dick if my name was "No Pussy Ever"
Like the Hulk but they can't fix me
Doom-doom-doom-doom-doom, slide like Bill Bixby
This shit be having niggas in the emergency
Undergoing surgery wanting to murder me
When you go, you know you heard of me
And your last thought is what you did
Wasn't worth your life, that's what your ass bought
Caught up in some shit and I had to let you feel the steel
They found his faggot ass slumped over the steering wheel
You still feeling real, nah nigga you looking tired
Go on and sleep baby, 'cause your shit has just expired

[Hook: Swizz Beats and DMX](2x)

[Al Pacino Vocal Sample]
Okay, I'm reloaded!

[Young Thug]

Thugger, Thugger, swag
Young Thugger swag

I'm from the jungle for real
These niggas flexin' right here for real, Swamp
Nigga, I'm solo dolo
I'm with who?
Nah, nigga, they with me

[Intro: TLC]
Also known as a busta

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Fuck it, I admit it, I did it to get it
I wrote you a song and then did you wrong
I hit it and quit it, forget that I did it
You'll probably call me a busta by the end of this song
But I ain't gon' act like there wasn't a time when I wasn't that guy
And you treated me like a nigga that's just on the passenger side
You and girls were screamin' that y'all don't wan't no scrubs
I was the nigga that wanted you but ain't get no love
Then I made a decision, I'm with it, it's written
When I catch you slippin', I'm gon' do you wrong
So I done came up now, I got my cake up now
But I cannot forget all the times you used to say to me

[Chorus: TLC & Tory Lanez]
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
You see I was the nigga that was all on the side of his best friend's ride
See my pockets were thinner and my dollars were slimmer
When I asked for your digits, you simply replied, "No scrubs"
So I finally waited, I waited for you
Plottin' the way I'm gon' do it and waitin' for you to fall through
I pulled up on you in that rental but you thought that shit was my own
And that's when you came up and gave me your number, it's sick just to know
But I ain't playin' timid, it's guaranteed that we did it
The first night I came over, she had me in her room
And all that I'm thinkin' is look what a car can do
It got me gettin' you outside your pants and you used to say

[Chorus: TLC & Tory Lanez]
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
Fuck it, let's take this shit deeper, back to the day that I seen ya
First time we fucked, you knew I was schemin'
You knew I was leavin', so who's to believe in?
You're back with a vengeance, I was a brand new Beamer
You bust the windows out my car ,fuckin' you
Jasmine Sullivan attitude, Jimmy Choo's, gettin' rude
Eyes attitude passin' by with your different dudes, different crews
Used to see shit eye to eye, we got different views, different views

[Intro]
Okay. Okay. Nicki Minaj. Dirty Money. I don't think ya'll understand what I'm about to do, I'm 'bout to master these bitches, man. Chea! Chin checker

[Verse 1]
I used to dilly dally, now I dilly to Cali
Used to push a pink Denali, now it's Chevy Impalis
I used to be broker than them niggas in alleys
Now I get my work it out like Biggity-Bally
I used to go hard, used to cock the brim
Used to take the dollar car, used to shop at Vim
Now I take it real easy, the hood believe me
I don't mean Cover Girl when I say "easy breezy."
Jiminy Cricket, let the master in
When it come to bad bitches, I'm the last of kin
I'm bringing S-E-X-Y B-A-C-K
If Nicki ain't the best, suck a D-I-C-K
I'm Young Nicholas, my style ridiculous
I heard your money funny, and mommy, I'm ticklish
I gotta laugh. I gotta laugh at it
I always got crack, I guess I'm a crack addict

[Interlude]
I don't know man. I think these bitches is real scared right now, like. Damn. I got these bitches shaking in they boots, man. Dirty money. Ayo, Pre'. Bring the next verse in, my nigga. Chea! Chea! Chea! One time

[Verse 2]
I used to make a dollar stretch like a Pilate
Now I gotta play the potty in Giuseppe Zanotti
Gotta push the Maserati, candy paint on the body
Making money off the hobby, taking flicks in the lobby
Look, I'm in the future, I'm ahead of my time
And you can't duplicate it, I'm a one-of-a-kind
They think I'm making fun of them, when I be like: "Na-Na-Na-Na!"
That's the track, little mama. Look: "Na-Na-Na-Na!"
Do what I do it, like I do it for the T.V
Bitches must be blind, cause these bitches can't see me
Do it all for GP, tell 'em to suck a pee-pee
Monday, LA, Tuesday, I'm in DC
Get a ticket, or you only get a snippet
If you write your lyrics,  little mama, I can dig it
I show you how to do it, what I do is really magic
Abracadab' tricks are for kids, silly rabbit

[Outro]
Yes sir. If I ain't the one, who is, nigga? I mean damn, I don't mean to toot my own goddamn horn, but toot-toot, nigga! Fuck! I'm that bitch. Nicki Minaj. Dirty Money. Yes sir. Uh-huh. Uh-huh

[Verse 1: SkyBlu]
I feel like, I just seen the sun for the first time
You make my life bright cause you shine
It's me and you baby, it's our time
I'm livin' my dream girl, cause you mine
You got me skippin' down the street and singing love songs all out of key
I didn't smoke nothing, but I feel so high, and I know why:
It's a love thing, it's got to be, your heart's all locked and I got the key
It feels like I just won the lottery, cause I got my girl, and she got me

[Chorus: LMFAO]
You my new obsession, all I want to do
You my new obsession, girl
I feel on top of the world with you, baby
I want to dance and party tonight

[Verse 2: Redfoo]
I can't get you out of my mind
Everything you do is feeling right
Remember that way you caught my eye?
I remember that way you was walking by
Ooh, girl, watch out now
You looked at me, turned around and smiled
Gave me eyes, my heart went wild
Hypnotized, this love starts now
And how do I know you're real?
It really doesn't matter, it's the way I feel
You make me feel super like the Man of Steel
You got me going stupid picking daffodils

[Chorus: LMFAO]
You my new obsession, all I want to do
You my new obsession, girl
I feel on top of the world with you, baby
I want to dance and party tonight
I feel on top of the world with my lady

The secret life of Arabia
Secret secrets, never seen
Secret secrets, evergreen

[Verse 1]
I was running at the speed of life
Through morning's thoughts and fantasies
Then I saw your eyes at the cross fades

[Chorus]
Secret secrets, never seen
Secret secrets, evergreen
The secret life of Arabia
Never here, never seen
Secret life, evergreen
The secret life of Arabia

[Verse 2]
You must see the movie, the sand in my eyes
I walk through a desert song when the heroine dies

[Chorus]
Arabia
Secret, secret
Arabia
Secret, secret
Arabia
Secret, secret
The secret life of Arabia
Never here, never seen
Secret life, evergreen

[Intro]
Little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got (You don't know what I got)
Little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm not bragging babe so don't put me down (deuce coupe)
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town (deuce coupe)
When something comes up to me, he don't even try (deuce coupe)
'Cause if I had a set of wings, man I know she could fly

[Chorus]
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)

[Verse 2]
Just a little deuce coupe with a flathead mill (deuce coupe)
But she'll walk a Thunderbird like she's standing still (deuce coupe)
She's ported and relieved and she's stroked and bored
She'll do a hundred and forty with the top end floored

[Chorus]
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)

[Bridge]
She's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
And she purrs like a kitten 'till the lake pipes roar
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing, I got the pink slip, daddy

[Verse 3]
And coming off the line when the light turns green (deuce coupe)
Well, she blows them out of the water like you never seen (deuce coupe)
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer (deuce coupe)
When I get rubber in all four gears

[Outro]
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)

[Verse 1]
Sipping on this drink, got some time to think
About where I was, and where am I'm at today
I'm getting everything I ask for
Flying the world, filling up my passport
I'm in the zone, martini's strong, my time is short, but my money long
I'm getting everything I ask for, In the club, always keep my glass full

[Chorus]
Money in the bank, my car brand new
I got everything I want but you
I might get you one day
I might get you one day
House on the hill, Hollywood view
I got everything I want but you
I might get you one day
I might get you one day

[Verse 2]
Hey, everybody came to play
I love it when the DJ plays all my favorite songs
And everybody sings along
I see the pretty babies at the pool, but all I can think about is you

[Chorus]
Money in the bank, my car brand new
I got everything I want but you
I might get you one day
I might get you one day
House on the hill, Hollywood view
I got everything I want but you
I might get you one day
I might get you one day

[Outro]
When I get you girl, you gonna be so in love with me
Every day, we're gonna play, what's your fantasy?
Every night I think of you in every way
And when I get you, I'mma celebrate
Hey, I'mma celebrate

'Cause I'm gonna get you one day

[Verse]
I'm good like G double O-D
OG kush by the motherfuckin' oz
Hoes wanna roll with a young nigga so street
You ain't fuckin' Tory 'less you tryna hit the whole team
Fuck it she a groupie, stuntin' nigga, we do beat
Even in the hoopty, niggas can't over hoop me
Play the verse twice, these niggas can't overloop me
You can lost like loose leaf, we too deep
Uh, I put the ice on, my nigga
Keep it 2G iPhone, my nigga
That's why your wife got her eyes on my nigga
I'm talkin 'bout my penis, got a condo on Venus
We ballin' on the court but we ain't got a subpeona
I'm fuckin' bad bitches, ask Venus and Serena
Add Trina with some Tina, a lil bit of Serena
Now you got your self a fuckin' bad bitch martini
Ridin' in the reptar, this shit my step car
Married to the Bentley, broke niggas would wrench it
Tryna keep the peace but hoe niggas prevent me
Rich shit nigga, y'all 99 cent cheap
I don't give a fuck boy, all my thot niggas
Wassup nigga, fuck boy
We ridin' up in the cut with the buck
No he's player hatin' 'cause we up nigga, what boy?
Nigga everythin' swaved out, bottles of the aesop
Ask J. Lo get my peso ASAP
Lookin' with her face out, what the fuck you spaced out?
You don't get the picture, well I gotta get it traced out
We are in a league that she aren't
But she ain't in that 013 G4in
I don't need Melissa, take her sister, keep Lauren
Ralph on me the garments, play like K. Garnett
I stay fly like hornets, important as, an orphan's dad
Been scorchin' as a Tim Hortons ad
With the coffee, chew me like toffee
Tint color is off streak
Sin of a rubber when I fuck her in the car seat
Man I had that pussy drippin' like a frickin' car leak
Rockstar head, had to call that bitch gnarly
And let her ride on a nigga dick like a Harley
Y'all niggas tryna cop some liquor when you party
Pack niggas always got they blickies when they party
Y'all wearin' camo, we the real army
I'm the young Rambo, back full of ammo
Money so tall, make a tall nigga stand low
Power and respect, shit I'm 'bout to take a handfull
I will play these hoes like banjos
And hit bad model broads like Leeann Rose
I'm just sayin' ride with it
Came 5 minutes and came for 5 minutes
Take that chick in, explain why I said it
Take a nigga bitch and swipe like I debit
I bet it on a greater day
Got a price on your head that's layaway
Flow ghost and these hoes can't stay away
I make this shit swave, got paper to make
I'm makin' this beat, these bitches on me
And I'm gettin' this shit for the free
Rhyme, freestylin' off the mind
Just out friend, hoes wanna be in
The Jeep that we in, the Beam that we in
See me on the CN tower 'cause I got that power
And I'm from the Toronto
And them hoes know every nigga that I know
And they fuckin' us all and I'll say that you rhino
And I'm back on this shit, fuckin' hoes from Cubano
And I'm back all you want, please to exit this shit
Sunny stop do not record this

Everythin' that I got on, my back shit is ordered
And them hoes gettin' mad, them bitches wanna quote us
They just come and record us
Put me down on they bed
Bitches lay me down down, gimme all of they head
I mean membrane
I'm talkin' 'bout the left brain

And I blow like a land mine
I fuck these hoes two times
I'm 2-9
That mean I'm twenty nined
And I fucked your bitch 20 times, yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, I've tried to live like the way that you wanted me to
Never needed the proof, just followed the rules
Well, I pick up all the paces and move my feet as fast as I can
I'm always falling behind, just float in the lines
And you want more and ambition's taken its toll on you
Well, hey, your confidence is fading with your youth

[Chorus]
If you say that dreamers always get what they desire
Well, I've found the more I want, the less I've got
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?

[Verse 2]
You're coughing blood again
I know 'cause I clean up the mess every now and then
Just fold the line along the seam
Force a smile and never say what you mean
You're in the promised land in someone else's dream
If you want more and you'll get there
Throw a quarter in the well
It's okay, you're fine, ambition's not a crime

[Chorus]
If you say that dreamers always get what they desire
Well, I've found the more I want, the less I've got
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?
Well, ask yourself

[Bridge]
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Well, ask yourself
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Well, ask yourself

[Outro]
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?
Well, ask yourself
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?
Well, ask yourself

[Verse 1]
Now if you get in a fight
And someone calls the PoPo, oh oh
You gotta love it cause you got all of your friends round
You gotta love it cause you got all of your friends round

[Verse 2]
Get off of George's drive
Cause if the Jag gets scratched oh no, oh no
You gotta love it cause you got all of your friends round
You gotta love it cause you got all of your friends

[Bridge]
Yeah ooh, I gotta give it to you
Yeah ooh, I gotta give it to you

[Verse 3]
And now you've moved to Spain
Down to the Costa Del Sol
Costa Del Sol so loco

Get your shit out our minibus

Her game face, getting why so serious, child
You're like a boy, delirious when you say
"Is this town worth livin' in, livin' in?"
Is this town worth livin' in?
'Cause all the girls with boys in the city, well
Just care about things like, "How does my hair look?" (Very good, Very good)
Sayin', "How does my hair look?" (Very good)

[Hook]
Because we’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you (Woo)

[Verse 2]
Did you remember when we spotted him?
All suited and booted she said
"You’re living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving"
"You're living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving"
She said, "Use your fangs and my spare time
Come on in the car, you'll have a great time"
You say, "Is this town worth living in, living in?"
Is this town worth living in?

[Hook]
Because we’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you
We’re oh so scared of you

[Breakdown]

Living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving
Living in a cellophane house, you're never leaving, well you're
You’re in a cellophane house, you're never leaving
Living in a cellophane, cellophane
You’re in a cellophane, cellophane (We're oh so scared of you)
You're in a cellophane, cellophane (We're oh so scared of you)
Living in a cellophane, cellophane (We're oh so scared of you)
You're in a cellophane, cellophane house
(Cellophane House)

I'm a cash vault, trigger then spark, hear my trunk bump
We go dumb dumb, dumb dumb, I'ma do it some
Now watch me stunt, I'ma leave with one
Though I came with none, now watch me come
I'm a pimp with a gold stripper ho from the soul be the game I run
It was shots through the cot giddy up, put it on your tongue

[Chorus]

Got three pills, and four jimmy hats cause we don't kid and play
Popov, yo, guess who's getting drunk, no muthafuckas can't out-drink us

Yeah, nice chain, what a nice night

Aw shit, look who it is: the white Russell Simmons
Jody Highroller, Far East Movement
We so ill, I think I need some codeine fluid
Riff!

[Verse 4: B.o.B]

Fuck family, so she better have a Plan B
Plan B, never mind what the rumors say
Rumors say, never mind what the rumors say
Rumors say, when I walk into a room they say
Bobby Ray, bomaye, bomaye
I'm faded, my eyes are glazin', di-a-lated
You hate that that nigga made it so you jaded
Your momma, your baby momma, and your lady
Be bumpin' my music naked while they're shavin'
Thots be like "Bobby save me, Bobby save me"
But this ain't no bank for checkin', ain't no savin'
I'm never known to accept a limitation
You want it with me well here's the invitation
Bands, Bobby, there's no more debatin', wow I'm just amazin'
Damn, she started gettin' naked 'till her panties start wavin'
Man, man I'm so sick, I'm so ill
Thermometers cannot monitor my level of chill
Grippin' the grain, whippin' the wheel

[Chorus]
We be the illest
We be the illest in here
I know you feel us
We be the illest in here
Illest in here
Illest in here
We so muthafuckin' ill

BIEBER: Is this an interview or a deposition? I’m confused.

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning at the hotel
Rolled up a blunt got high as hell
Fucked another groupie name in my cell
Hell, oh well, it's time to bail
Walking to the van with my suitcase
Driving cross country to a new place
Exit 420 get something to eat
Greet who I meet
Smoke a sweet
Climb back on to the interstate
Yes got a date, can't be late
Pulled up to the club get a sound check
Walk up to the bar get a longneck
Shooting some pool, act real cool
Look at her ass but please don't drool
I look at my watch, start thinking
Yeah it's time for me to start drinking

[Hook x2]
My name is Afroman
I live in the back of a Chevrolet van
Everynight I'm somewhere new
Smoking weed, drinking brew

[Verse 2]
Dressing room, 

[?]
I get fucked up before the show
Ride to the club smoking a dub
Hopping out the van with the woofers on sub
It's time to go on
I'm drunk I'm high come on
How's everybody doing?
Which of you ladies feel like screwing?
Women on stage
Security in rage
Guitar solo
Colt 45 kickin' in, oh no
Uh oh I'm playing it right
What? shit sound tight
Encore
We want more
Yeah, break that shit down

[Hook x2]
My name is Afroman
I live in the back of a Chevrolet van
Everynight I'm somewhere new
Smoking weed, drinking brew

[Verse 3]
Shake the hand of the fan
Introduce to the band
Sign autographs, take pictures
Try to be polite to these fake bitches
One of these bitches just might
Kick it with an internet rapper tonight
Best case scenario
We get high and fuck very slow
Pass out with her ass out
So I can rub it, man I love it
Early in the morning yes, yes I know
Hug my neck kiss my cheek, yes she gots to go
I do too, I do too
Smoke some more weed
Drink some more brew
I love my life
Peace
No stress to strife

[Hook x3]
My name is Afroman
I live in the back of a Chevrolet van
Everynight I'm somewhere new
Smoking weed, drinking brew
You know, a lot of people ask me why I feel that, you know, I've gotten a lot of notoriety so quickly. And I don’t know, people seem to be under the impression that I’ve made it to this point fast
And, you know, obviously for me, I don’t feel like that. 'Cause it's me, you know? I feel like I’ve been doing it for ten billion years
But every time someone says something like that to me. I remember to just thank God for you know getting me this far. 'Cause sometimes you don’t realize how far you’ve gotten
Until you look around and look at the people who are still trailing so far behind you. And I know that no matter what, in the end, it's not gonna be about my talent, you know? It's not gonna be about connections. It’s not gonna be about my looks. It's gonna be about who wants it the most. And I want it the most

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
She says I'm cold
Only time I'm comfortable kissing is sending X and Os
I send a message back to dispute this fact, but this I know
I hope to find my love, like we used to before dial-up
Whatever happened to our phone sex?
Right now, can't think of anything we don't text
I broke her heart on the email
I'm so cold, I'ma just spare y'all the details
I can't even tell y'all whats real
I got an iTouch, but I can't feel

Start mackin' on my black berry
She got jealous I was tappin' on my Blackberry
So she didn't keep in touch
And I can't tell the difference
We ain't see each other much
Aside from some late night texts
A couple Os, a few Xs
My current feels just like my exes
Different characters, same letters
Red light, another message
Spilling her heart out, what a mess this is
P.S., this is B.S., I can't even spell it out
Am I that unaffectionate?

She said it got better and worser
And it's supposed to be vice-versa
I don't know, I kinda like this surf stuff
We used to see tears when we hurt stuff
I guess it got faster but colder
We iChat, that's how she comes over
That's better than not seeing her
And I'm so glad I'm serving her like Serena
She can YouTube in the arena
And we close, no matter how many miles between us
I told her, "Welcome to the future"
That's just how it is, I'm a user

Sweet wonderful you
You make me happy with the things you do
Oh, can it be so?
This feeling follows me wherever I go

[Chorus]
I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why

[Verse 2]
Don't, don't break the spell

You, you make loving fun
And I don't have to tell you but you're the only one

[Outro]
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)

You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)

[Verse 1]
The world is turning
I hope it don't turn away
The world is turning
I hope it don't turn away
All my pictures are falling
From the wall where I placed them yesterday
The world is turning
I hope it don't turn away

[Verse 2]
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face them day to day
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face 'em day to day
Though my problems are meaningless
That don't make them go away
I need a crowd of people
I can't face them day to day

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
I went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
Now I'm living out here on the beach
But those seagulls are still out of reach
Went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone

[Verse 4]
Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
I head for the sticks with my bus and friends
I follow the road though I don't know where it ends
Get out of town, get out of town
Think I'll get out of town

[Outro]
Because the world is turning
I don't wanna see it turn away

[Intro]
Come on let's get it
Ya nigga my album comin'
Dreams worth more than money nigga
This mother fuckin' summer
I been gettin' so much mofuckin' money nigga
Fuckin' all these bitches
I think I done took a year off
Still snappin' though
A lot of niggas fallin' off
We ain't doing nothin' but gettin' stronger nigga
New deals, new money, double M G Dreamchaser
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
My man got booked with a stone of white
If they make his bail a 'mil, he coming home tonight
I went from standing on them corners, jumping on them flights
Talking jumping out of Bentleys, jumping on them bikes
Middle of the jungle no strap, ice on
Niggas pussy in the dark, let's turn them lights on
I used to sleep on the same floors the mice on
Now it's Italian marble, moon walking like Mike doing
Rest in peace to Mike, I rest in peace the mic
I pop a couple percs, I drink that Easter Sprite
Its levels to this shit, dog you won't believe my life
Peanut butter jelly on a french toast, eating right
Champagne gargling, everything is marvelous
62 Maybach, I can barely park the shit
Got these rappers scared see em' shaking like it's Parkinsons
If they said my name they got flamed, I'm the arsonist
A man don't eat he gonna starve, a man gonna starve he gonna die
I know that they gonna try, that's why I stay strapped with a brand new mac and it's 45
So when they jump fast, better whistle like off-sides
Cause I'm from Philly, we'll eat your cheese steak
I told Diddy, I ain't walking for no cheesecake
Cause the jeweller making the band with the freeze face
I'm on now, I got neighbors like in 3 states

[Verse 2]
Do it for the vine, I ain't gonna do it
Lets talk about the time when I use to go through it
Nappy ass braids, with the cold shooters
We was playing with razors before they had the little scooters
Shit I walked in with my Pumas on, you ain't even know it
These a million dollar pair of sneaks nigga, you ain't even know it
Said Reebok dropped Ross, we ain't even know it
Cause he went and brought that Bentley Brookland, he ain't even show it
At 21 I wanted to pop a bottle
At 22 I wanted the hottest model
At 23 I wanted the Rolls-Royce
So what you think I did, I went and fucking got it
I hit my hood, niggas looking fucking sour
They see me rolling and I be like you fucking coward
I just want to ball, spending the quarter on y'all
Just take a look at my car, you don't remember I starved
I want it all
Back in the day, packing the K
All that hate I made that go away
I do you dirty go you back to the A
Put in the verse like that Mac hit ya face
And Philly nigga, I'm mac in the bay
I'm off beat still killing shit, I'm speaking all street still killing shit
Hurricane the first week, I still killed the shit
Intro been out like a year and it's still killing shit

[Verse 1]
Seize upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time...so gold

[Verse 2]
Still away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever...and be in time
Stay gold

[Verse 3]
But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory
And yes you say
So must the day
Too, fade away
And leave a ray of sun
So gold

[Verse 4]
Life is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined
All things that happen
Will age too old
Though gold

[Intro]
Woah, oh yeah, ohh

Just give me the green light
Oh girl
Give me the green light
And I'll go

[Verse 1]
I'm at your door, don't cry no more
Now what was you sayin' he don't do for you?
Listen to me, cause I do those things, yeah
See what he's not to you, I'll be and more
Now I'm not trying to player hate
Girl I'm just tired of hearing you say
That he don't be there for you
Well I make a hell of a substitute

[Hook]
Just give me the green light, Oh girl
Green light, baby girl give me the green light
Give the green light, And I'll go
Green light, go, go, go, go
Lada, ladadadadada
And lada, ladadada

[Verse 2]
Now he keep you down and he don't show you no love
Let's get out this house, yeah, And hit a club
I'll take you for some drinks, yeah, laughter and conversation
See I know what you need is a little stimulation, girl
Now I'm not trying to player hate
Girl I'm just tired of hearing you say
That he don't be there for you
Well I make a hell of a substitute

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's obvious that he don't know what to do with you
When it comes to satisfying your body girl
That's why I'm standin' by, give me a chance
Girl I wanna ride but the light is red, yeah
I wanna satisfy your body from feet to head

[Hook] x3

Baby Say the word and I'll be there
Runnin' my fingers through your hair
All you gotta whisper in my ear is yeah

[Chorus]
When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come

[Verse]
You're packing up, packing up
I won't see you again
But you have made, you have made it up

You're packing up, packing up
I won't see you again
But you have made, you have made it up

[Chorus]
When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come

[Outro]
When you reign it down, lights come
When you reign it down, lights come
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round
Keep going round and round and round

And round and round and round and round
But I love you
But I love you

[Skit Unleashed (Intro)]

[Skit: Pitbull]
This is Pitbull, slash Q-Bon
You're listening to Unleashed, the official bootleg

Expect the unexpected...
We're about to take over this industry, I'm telling you
It's about to get ugly
And anybody that want it... ¡Qué bolá'! ¡Qué vuelta, que volón!
Fuck ya, haters!

[Verse 1]
I made you look
It's Pitbull spitting hard like a gangsta crook
I'm a crook, Imma thief'em, robbing streets
I'm robbin' hoods, it's like Robbin Givings
When i'm robbin' you're givin up all your goods
I made robbin' a livin', i made robbin' a hobby
I rob you in the kitchen, i rob you in the lobby
I rob you while you're shittin'
And if these choppers feel choppy ain't nothing gonna stop me
*****(Free Agent Mixtape Version Only)*****
I made you look
It's Pitbull spitting hard like a gansta crook
I'm a crook, Imma thief'em, robbing streets
I'm robbin' hoods, it's like Robbin Givings
When i'm robbin' you're givin up all your goods
I made robbin' a livin', i made robbin' a hobby
I rob you in the kitchen, i rob you in the lobby
I rob you while you're shittin'
And if these choppers feel choppy ain't nothing gonna stop me
******************************************************
Pitbull but mamis call me papi
When i'm dressed in lennen with a splash at Issey Miyake
I wax ass like Mr. "Miyaki"
Pit's modest but my dick is "cocky"
I think some of y'all are in the wrong game
Cuz all ya do is rap about ice man
Y'all should play hockey
My stocks are on a steady climb
So i guess that's why i feel kinda "stocky"
When guns pop they'll leave you like sloppy joe's
I fuck down bitches and i fuck sloppy hoes
She wanted me to fuck her brains out
So i stuck my dick through her nose
Pit's ready for war like if there's a storm
But no one had a clue that the only Pit allowed in Miami spits guerrilla warfare like Vietnam
So bring'em on, now everybody sing along

[Hook]
Every time i spit a rhyme you may not know who i am
But maybe this uh, made you remember
Pitbull... now ready
Concentration camp..

[Verse 1]
I spit it the best like pregnant pussy
Stand on the ledge and they're there to push me
I'm over the top, i'm over those fully automatics
I'm over the Glock, bitches like "uh ah Pit is hot"
I on the track or I in her asshole
Or ah when i pull out and let that nuts splash her
Like Mike "Peosa" Pitbull will catch you
Niggers wanna hurt me cuz i spread like herpes
Contagious with the flow... Danger! hit the floor
One in the chamber, oh and there's plenty more
But that just came from jaw just they ain't ready for
The serious; seriously you're gonna die
And like a coward no more that you ain't ready to ride
I'm tryin' to get ready you guys
Fuck youre family ties
Over an onion these niggas'll make you really cry

[Hook] (x2)
I'm too smart, too cool
Too grimy, too dirty, too rude
Too street, too snake, too smooth
A Pitbull is too stupid to loose

[Verse 2]
Get some baked soda and some pure coke
A bitch to cook and you gon' smell with the rock is cookin'
I'm from the state that's shaped like a gun
That's how we gon' step to the war so when it's hot ya better duck or run
Here goes another one
Now that the bottom is properly represented
Off that plate you better save me some
I'm starvin' to eat
I'm carvin' your meat with a fully auto
And greet y'all teflon niggas with nothin' but hollows
My mottos are hard to follow
After the DUI's it's hard to  catch me in the VIP poppin' a bottle, no
Poppin' a model, yes
Once i get that chance I'll holla at ya niggers so that you can run to her next
Like C. Wallace, is there life after death?
Now that puzzles
Me like the Bay of Pigs ima shit on the US
"targs" ya can't muscle me

[Hook] (x2)
I'm too smart, too cool
Too grimy, too dirty, too rude
Too street, too snake, too smooth
A Pitbull is too stupid to loose

[Verse 3]
When i drop your albums are gettin' push back
Like convos lettin' bitches gon' ask "Who's dat?"
Quien es ese blanco como la leche ojos azules
There becomes on the with beat con mas "roz que un gandile"
Like the 1st n 15th you get cut like checks, or get cut like coke
Or get cut like a bad athlete when this bad ass heat
Spit some bad ass heat at your bad ass niece (whoo)
I wanna see you talk now
And since you talk what you walk i wanna see you walk, now with no knees
See what happens when you and your
"so called cold D's, flossin' blow G's" y'all ain't ready fo' me
I'm too smart, too calm, too cool
Just one bullet to hit three, all y'all fools
Left three hit, two dead and one bruised
3, 2, 1... You loose

[Hook] (x2)
I'm too smart, too cool
Too grimy, too dirty, too rude
Too street, too snake, too smooth
A Pitbull is too stupid to loose

[Verse 1]
Well, let's take off from the start
I know you've tried all this before
And did your best to fight the war and break it off
But if I follow my name
I will calm you in the storm
And breathe you in when you are worn
Be still my love
Would it take a shooting star?
To show you life can bloom when something breaks
And when the pieces fall, I'll catch them all

[Chorus]
Never mind what you're looking for
You'll always find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
But I'll be here smiling when I see your face

Never mind what you're looking for
You're gonna find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
But I'll be here smiling when I see your face

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, it's hard to know the truth
In this post-modernist view
Where absolutes are seen as relics and laughed out of the room
And I'm scared to say your name
I've cried wolf so many times
I'm afraid of what you'd want from me
Yeah, will you find me through the grey?
'Cause my mind's a minefield of the wretched
It's honestly deceptive 'cause

[Chorus]
Never mind what you're looking for
You'll always find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
But I'll be here smiling when I see your face

Never mind what you're looking for
You're gonna find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
But I'll be here smiling when I see your face

What you looking for?
Soul clap your hands and sing

[Outro]
Never mind what you're looking for
You'll always find what you're looking for
Never mind what you're looking for
You'll always find what you're looking for

[Verse 1]
Well, I've been trying to re-learn my name
It seems like a thousand years
That I've been out of frame
And I surrender, the truth is what
It's what I've needed from you
'Cause I've been floating within your walls of opinion
And I'm tired, I only want the truth

[Chorus]
I have tried so hard not to be like them
I have found they don't ever say what they mean
There is a truth, there is a light if you'd follow me there
I've been searching for the directions and
I'm convinced the world doesn't know what it needs
There is a hope for the hopeless, I can promise you that

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well, I've been accosted, the jury's been partial
But I won't surrender to prove to you I won't lie
Under pressure of compromise
Yeah, well, an absolute measure won't change with opinion
No matter how hard you try
It's an immovable thing
Just like the visions in your bed
Or when they're streaming in your head

[Chorus]
I have tried so hard not to be like them
I have found they don't ever say what they mean
There is a truth, there is a light if you'd follow me there
I've been searching for the directions and
I'm convinced the world doesn't know what it needs
There is a hope, and I'll come back

[Post-Chorus]
If you're leading my hand, the world is so broken
I'm tripping my steps, I'm slipping and I know why
I never thought that I'd be here
A blinding call to prayer has touched my feet
Like the call of the prophets
A purpose is needed before you know that you know
To never wonder what you are
And not forget where you've come from

[Bridge]
Yeah, ooh
Mmm, well

Is it really love you've been speaking of?
Oh, what'd you say? What'd you say?
What'd you say? Yeah, what'd you say?
I said that you need me, don't you?

[Chorus]
There is a truth, I can promise you that
I have tried so hard not to be like them
I have found they don't ever say what they mean

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
The truth, the truth stands in the end
While you're deciding what to do
The truth stands in the end
While you're deciding what to do
Pitbull was the name that i gave myself
And it fits me proper cuz i bite and lock ya
I'm tryin' a get with both Tony's touch meanin'
"Tony toca" and Tony Montana
It's bigger than than blocks and towns, Glocks or pounds
Cause these, boys down here got choppers that will (brrrp) chop you down
And if you want that red light, special light, TLC'll show you the spot, and they got you now
From Miami to Bushwick, this is for everybody that push shit, push mix, push bricks
Push the wrong buttons and get your shit pushed back right quick!
I'm a nightmare on any beat, call me Pit slash Kreuger, and my dawg J-dawg won't hesitate to spit that Luger
Oye boricua! Que bola? Soy (Son?) de cubano/mexicano so you know i represent Cuba
But don't get me wrong, i've got love for puertoriqueños, especially for puertoriqueñas
Que le gustan usar la lengua, y en la cama son enfermas
Come on meng, you don't wan't beef with this (timy? or tiny) boy, meaning Tommygun
Timing is everything so imma give y'all time to run, but let's keep it real your time is done
Pitbull, my time will come
Thanks to Teach and his big mouth, i'm coming up like the morning sun
Pero (Tom, or Ton?) no te preocupes, Teach may have a big mouth but he won't drop down, fuck a hot rhyme, just listen to the gun rap
"Csh" "csh", click-clack, nigga, take that, Pitbull's back
For the first time, i'm at the point where Santiero couldn't curse mine (no, no, no), or curse me
I'm starving, and i'm thirsty, and i'm not gonna stop till y'all yell mercy
I want all y'all to eat, but first me
I want all y'all to eat, but first me
Outro:
Hahaha, oye Ton
I appreciate the love meng, muchas gracias
And Teach, Big Mouth Promotions, bet that up baby
Hah, keep looking out for Pitbull slash Q-bon
From the bottom to the top
Ten cuidado

[Verse 1]
I dug a single seed into the ground, I hope it grows, grows
In a year or two if you're around, you'll see a rose, rose
Pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere, that you can find me
On a train to Paris going nowhere, draw the bridge behind me

[Chorus]
Don't be gone too long (Too long)
'Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long (Too long)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone?

[Post-Chorus]
(Mmm-mmm)
(Mmm-mmm-mmm)
When you're, when you're gone
(Mmm-mmm)
(Mmm-mmm-mmm)
When you're gone

[Verse 2]
Golden leaves are dancing on the ground, it's getting cold, cold (Oh-oh)
Safe from time, we'll be forever young, never old, old
See a ball of fire out in space, zooming up behind me
All the wonder written on your face, was there inside me

[Chorus]
Don't be gone too long (Too long)
'Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long (Too long)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone?

[Post-Chorus]
(Mmm-mmm)
Oh, oh-whoa-oh-oh
(Mmm-mmm-mmm)
When you're, when you're gone
(Mmm-mmm)
Oh-oh, oh-whoa
(Mmm-mmm-mmm)
When you're gone

[Bridge]
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over? Yeah
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Woo!

[Chorus]
Don't be gone too long (Too long, don't be gone)
(Is it really over?)
'Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Don't be gone too long (Too long, don't be gone)
(Is it really over?)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone?
Don't be gone too long (Too long)
(Is it really over?)
'Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone (Yeah-yeah, when it's over)
Don't be gone too long (Too long)
(Is it really over?)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone?

[Reversed Intro]
Send in a dollar
Send in a dollar if you want to contribute to the American Health Association

[Verse 1]
Well, the capitalistic feast has been sucking the heat
You're passing up, you're injured for ability
Well, I've been waiting for a compromise but I guess it's more the same
We're separated all the things that we want for gain
You remember your name
Well, they were looking right at you, you forget the face
If the future's sipping all space and food through a straw
And the monster's finally flipped on its back
Well, the static is a worthy test to help you brush aside the rest

[Chorus]
Is this something that you'd ever need?
Well, I'm okay
Are you scared to take what they've taken from you?
Well, yeah, I'm afraid
We've sold our names
Send in a dollar if you want to contribute to the American Health Association

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of being accosted by the ghost in the street
Your magazine-looking backward-thinking junkies are just fodder for the global elite
Do you think you had a choice
When you're eating and sleeping in all the noise?
Let the moneymakers keep the politicians afloat
We're biting everything that we're told
Well, then a smile and a couple of jokes will be enough to convince the good folks

[Outro]
Well, is this something that you'd ever need?
Well, I'm okay
Are you waiting for a minute to fight for what they've taken from you?
Yeah, I'm afraid
We've sold our names

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I woke up on Champs-Élysées to the Djembe of Ghana
Yeah, a fine lady from Belize said "You got the spirit of Fela"
Yeah, the young one dripping make-up lift her hands up to holla
Well, I gave her what I got but couldn't handle her broken heart

The right words in the hands of dissidents with the fire
Yeah, will rip apart the marrow from the bone of the liars
Yeah, well, I'm afraid of saying too much and ending a martyr
But even more so I'm afraid to face God and say I was a coward, yeah

[Chorus]
With all these things I wait for revelation
These things make me want to duck for cover
With all these things I wait for revolution
These things ask the biggest question to me
And it's "are you what you want to be?"
Well, are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
The war machine will put out both its hands for a dollar
It's drinking at the table with the chrome hand guerrillas
And the young one dripping make-up lift her leg up to holla
Well, I told her what she's got should be protected in the arms of love

The right things in the hands of dissidents with the fire
Yeah, will rip apart the marrow from the bone of the liars
And, well, I'm afraid of saying too much and ending a martyr
But even more so I'm afraid to face God and say I was a coward, yeah

[Chorus]
With all these things I wait for revelation
These things make me want to duck for cover
With all these things I wait for revolution
These things ask the biggest question to me
And it's "are you what you want to be?"
Well, are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
So are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Zooey Deschanel]
Don’t, don’t you wanna
Fall in love tonight
She said, don’t, don’t you wanna
Fall in love tonight

[Verse 1: Prince]
Special night, my favorite crew
The moon threatened to dance her out of her shoes
In his ear, he was about to hear
An offer that he could not refuse

She said...

[Chorus: Prince]
Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love tonight
(She said)
Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love tonight
She said...

[Verse 2: Prince]
Underneath the taffeta
There ain’t no better hiding place
If I see the moon, I’ll just laugh at her
Wanna wake up to your, your pretty face

[Chorus: Prince & Zooey Deschanel]
Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love tonight
(She said)
Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna do it till the morning light

She said...

[Verse 3: Prince]
We can sleep all day tomorrow
Dream about this fantasy, fantasy
We don’t have to backspin, apologize, or borrow
Uh, ’bout to go hard, y’all ready for me

[Chorus: Prince & Zooey Deschanel]
Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love tonight
(She said)
Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna do it till the morning light
Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna fall in love tonight
(She said)
Don’t, don’t you wanna
Don't you wanna do it till the morning light

[Verse 1:Snoop Dogg]
It's like this, yeah, and it don't stop
Now stand up on ya feet and peep the beats
Snoop Doggy Dogg's on the mic I'd like to speak, preach
To each and all, I don't stall
Y'all know who the dopest rapper is his name is Doggy Dogg
I freak and speak and preach to you
Cos' I'm on the microphone sportin' grey and blue
I'm true to what I do, I don't bang at all
I'm the smooth macadamia. Snoop Doggy Dogg, I
Make you jump, pump, pump, grab your gat but you might find yourself slump, hump
You can't see me, you wanna' be me
I got a message to the CPT- Wassup' Eazy?
I'm getting kind of greasy with curl on your neck
You can't see the Dogg 'cos I'm out to chin check
They call me the super-duper, superb
Hit 'em up, Get 'em up, Spit 'em up, word

[Verse 1]
Is it my turn, to wish you were lying here?
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world?
Even imagine your emotions, tell myself anything

Is it my turn, to hold you by your hands?
Tell you I love you and I hear you
Is it my turn to totally understand?
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing

[Hook]
If I have to give away the feeling that I feel
If I have to sacrifice, whatever baby, whatever baby
If I have to take apart all that I am
Is there anything that I would not do
‘Cause inside i’d die without you
Oh Oh baby I’d die without you
Die without you

[Verse 2]
Oh, I apologize for all the things I’ve done
But now I’m underwater and I’m drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry
Isn’t it amazing how some things completely turn around
So take every little piece of my heart
Piece of my heart
Take every little piece of my soul
Piece of it
Take every little piece of my mind
Cause if you don't
Inside

[Hook]
I’d die without you
Die without you
Yeah baby
Die without you

[Verse 3]
If I have to give away
The feeling that I feel
Yeah If I have to sacrifice
Oh, whatever baby, whatever baby
If I have to take apart
All that I am
Is there anything that I would not do
‘Cause inside

I’d die without you
Die without you
Cause inside
I’d die without you
Die without you
Oh no
Die without you
Oh, I apologize for all the things I’ve done
But now I’m underwater and I’m drowning

Thanks

[Hook: 2D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on

[Verse 1: Del]
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual
Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless to know the definition for what life is
Priceless to you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Psychic among those, possess you with one go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Del]
The essence, the basics, without it you make it
Allow me to make this, childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sprouting tree, every child o' peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (that's right)
From this fucking enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles, but the percussion he provides
With me as a guide, y'all can see me now cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner, so I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, and remember: that it's all in your head

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I’m a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hanging out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah that’s the Crip side
Ain’t no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much, you thought I was a DJ
2, ippy-ippy 1 yo, 3
I'm S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can’t fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See I specialize in making all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don’t change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a living room full of fine dime brizzles
Waiting on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Chizzle
G’s to the bizzack, now ladies here we gizzo

[Hook x3]

How many people say nothing, one idiot says it all?
How many people get frustrated waiting for Bush to fall?
How many soldiers are ready to fight, how many ready for war?
How many niggas get locked up for drugs, the government slinging that oil
How many billions does it take before the troops are home?
How many banks gotta collapse to know what you doing is wrong?
Gotta get Bush out the chair (yeah)

Fuck it! Let's bring back Reagan
At least he was getting that raw
These politicians don't give a shit

How much we continue to move the white

[Outro]
Oh gosh it's the new warlord!
Big wolf
Big
Big wolf
Big

Big bad wolf came over to my ranch
Took all my land, left me with a branch
That's how I feel about the loving that I had
That's how I know about the girls he had

Bring her to my door now
Bring me that ho
I'll put her on the table
And I'll put her in my claw
I'll put her down my jaw
To my belly, to my toe
I'll shit on that ho
And I'll drop her to the floor

Big, big, big branch
Big branch
I'll hit her with the motherfucking branch
Big, big, big
I'll hit her with the motherfucking branch
Men are like pearls, they look good with my curls
I string em to get the best necklace in the world
In the state of the world all women wanna lay
It's a man's world but I keep him at bay
You can fuck a man, mack a man, tell 'em that you're gay
Tell him real love ain't on BET
Sex is so cheap, I get it at KFC
When its meaningless why they do R&B

Bring her to my door now
Bring me that ho
I'll put her on the table
And I'll put her in my claw
I'll put her down my jaw
To my belly, to my toe
I'll shit on that ho
And I'll drop her to the floor

Big, big, big branch
Big branch
I'll hit her with the motherfucking branch
Big, big, big
I'll hit her with the motherfucking branch

Eat my chips and I wash that plate
Thought about women that take that bait
Men with stamina or money on the plate
Can get a woman thinking her period is late
Thanks to Jesus, I got my own estate
If I let you in, will you run off with my maid?
All men are just so fickle these days
To find a really good one I keep on getting laid
Bring her to my door now
Bring me that ho
I'll put her on the table
And I'll put her in my claw
I'll put her down my jaw
To my belly, to my toe
I'll shit on that ho
And I'll drop her to the floor

Big, big, big branch
Big branch
I'll hit her with the motherfucking branch

Big wolf
Big
Big wolf
Big

[Verse 1]
Mommy's in the kitchen, cooking up something good
And daddy's on the sofa, pride of the neighborhood
My brother's in the ballet, it seems he's got it set
And I'll be up at midnight with my cigarette

[Chorus]
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go

[Verse 2]
Daddy's in the basement, cooking up something fine
While Rick's out on the pavement, flipping it for dimes
If there's anything redeeming, I haven't seen it yet
And I'm still up at midnight, chewing nicorette

[Chorus]
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go
Ooh when life moves this slowly
Ooh just try and let it go

[Verse 1]
I always thought it was you
You always thought it was me
We always thought we were it
Seemed like a real perfect fit
Those Brooklyn nights set us free
I always thought even though
We were so young, we could grow
Up in the end, it'd be us
We'd take the F by the bus
Where Brooklyn nights set us free

[Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

[Verse 2]
I missed our cheap chandelier
'Member when dad hung it there?
And we would watch Rocky IV
The one where the Russians scored?
I love Briggite Nielsen's hair
I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
And cracked open the last beer
Falling asleep in our tears
Those Brooklyn nights set us free

[Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

[Bridge]
I found an old pair of keys in my purse
That opened the walk up we shared
How did they get there, jerk?
I wanna see you there, I wanna make it work (Make it work)
I didn't brush my hair and my lashes are falling off
Of seven years of our bad luck dating
I want our last night there, a Brooklyn night affair
A Brooklyn night affair

[Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you (Wanna love you)
It's not that I'm really over it, you know (You know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be Brooklyn nights happy

[Outro]
It's not that I don't wanna love you 'cause I really tried and I
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu
Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'll both tell the truth
For just one Brooklyn night, adieu

[Verse 1]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Jai guru de va om

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 2]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
Tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai guru deva om

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 3]
Sounds of laughter, shades of earth are ringing
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a
Million suns and calls me on and on
Across the universe
Jai guru deva om

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Outro]
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva

I'm the man in my city ain't nobody fucking wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the Beretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stole the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices' try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, you should've seen me before I had children
Give dick to your daddy's daughter and dare her to have children
Hope he got some insurance cause death her ass is enduring
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping

[Hook]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back

If a fuck nigga start, bet his heart I bust
Got your partners and the broad in your car fucked up
What, you're under estimation thought a star wouldn't bust
I got the heart and the guts on this purp I blow
Move 10 bricks daily trying to twerk 5 mo'
Ya see the Cadillac swerving down Hollywood Road
Or the fliest Spur in Cali fucking Hollywood Ho's
On a pill and half with my partner Young Dro
Bumping Goodie Mob Soul Food number fo'
Other rappers' old news, told dudes I'ma pro
With a loaded fo' fo' and a quarter brick of blow
Hey, nigga don't you hit me less you buying 6 or mo
My 24 blades glistening and my 808 kicking

[Verse 3]
I wear the crown down under man somebody better tell 'em
'Fore I spit a hundred rounds and have everybody bailing
I got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy
And now we riding Giovanni's and Asani's on Pirellis
If you ever think of trying to run up on me just forget it
The clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded
Pistol way in the truck got my knife on tuck
You think he ain't getting stuck, you got life fucked up
A couple stitches in ya hip will have your night fucked up
Will he live? Will he die? Guess he might luck up
Meanwhile, I'm racing my Ferrari like a light for a buck
Against Lamborghini Gallardos every time I get a car

[Hook]

Ayy holla if you like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him

Your girlfriend push a Prius, she giving me that genius

[Pharrell & DJ Drama]
I mean, you know what it is. You see it, man
I was inspired by Slick Rick, you know? Like, he used to just come on TV and just shit on niggas real quick. Like... just shit, like, you know? And just wave his fingers around the world and call us "crumbs" and shit
I was hurt, stunned, astounded, amazed, and dazed, and confused as a child when the nigga did the "Young World" video, the "Hey Young World" shit. That shit changed my life. So, you know, when you see me rolling around here, you know, looking like Slick Rick, you know where the fuck it's coming from. You know what I'm saying?
So, for me, I wanted to, you know—I wanted to have a conversation to all my fans, you know what I'm saying, that's on the water in the hood, doing what they do, on that grind every day, 'cause I know that—I know what that is, you know what I'm saying? (Uh-huh) And who's the grimiest nigga in the street?  (Uh-huh) You know what I mean? (Uh-huh) DJ Drama (Ill!)
And especial—I mean, it's my first mixtape and shit, know what I mean? There's more to come, so, we 'gon do what it is we gotta do.

Eat how you supposed to, sleep how you supposed to
Sit in the motherfucking back seat like you supposed to
This for certain we totally urk 'em
Put down the window but leave up the curtain
Fuck with their minds and do the reversing
Open up the boat with your grill just smirkin'
Gangsta Grizzil bright light like a vigil
The watch full of water but I guess it's on chizzil
Don't get izzil cause if it get for real
The AK-47 assault rifle
Don't get up for more cause I'll hit you with a refill
Or hit you in the spine and leave that ass cripple
All of you is dizzil or, or cat pizzil
Bubble in the heat so they temperature sizzle

Nigga, I ain't gotta lie, square business
She's my shawty, my tenderoni

And the way she be screaming my name (Oh)
And the way she be giving me brain (Oh)
And when it's all over, she say (Oh)

Stunting hard, looking like about a hundred grand
Ready to spend it all; so shawty, take it off

B-i-itch, this is just a freestyle (Hahaha)
Whoa, yeah (Ayy)

Home of the Crips, yeah, cuh, that's us
Relatives gotta live, what it do, blood?
On the grind, one time, yeah, that's the pigs
Better get some heat when you're creepin' through the Beach
To each his own, the Beach is Long
Turn it up and get your T.C on
And tell 'em Snoop Dogg sent him to the block
Let it rock while it knock
Motherfucker, show you how to West Coast

You can't fuck with this homie with heart and niggas scary
I popped her cherry, and she gave it up in a flash
We wanna bang with Snoop, we wanna bang with Daz
Hop inside a G-ride and glide, take a voyage
Back to the Eastside, Eastside's where we're going
Where the hustlers, bangers, jackers run with no worries at all
Where you learn to C-walk before you learn to crawl, so I'ma, uh

See it's funny right?
I had a real good day yesterday
And then today, I had an even better day
('Sup L.A? Haha)
But the thing is, AMG we signed another deal today
(Skateboard P)
So tomorrow is gon' be great

[Verse 1]
Yo
Me and a few shorties
Landed on a tour met Paris Hilton right before me
Long Beach, where skinny niggas carry strong heat
And take giant steps like King Kong's feet

[Break]
It's Gangsta Grillz ya bastards

[Verse 1]
Yo
Me and a few shorties
Landed on a tour met Paris Hilton right before me
Long Beach, where skinny niggas carry strong heat
And take giant steps like King Kong's feet
I'm in the 'Burban, the window's down I'm feelin' fervent
Where palm trees and trash clash, I'm so observant
Got my connections to I-C-E
So no matter what sets we on it's like TV
The bitches got hay fever, their face turn red
Because they say "Hi" with their eyes, but I'm not a hay reader
This ain't a game and there ain't no play meter
I can read her mind and, it says "Feed her"
We go to Matsuhisa's where it ain't a lot of people
Where they look at your watch, and proper they will treat you
Me and my niggas toast we seen the best of the boats
Next year in Aspen, we gon' ski the rest of the slopes
Mind your business that's just a note
And don't be flexin' your coat 'less you expect to float
That ain't no threat, and it's less than a joke
These niggas mark men, marksmen professional
They from the jungle where baking soda dress the coke
And uphill addicts watch their skin just float
Huh, but today was a good day

[Verse 2]
In my chain I got the pink Laffy Taffy, the white Laffy Taffy
The blue Laffy Taffy, the yellow is so flashy
But it wasn't always like this exactly
Niggas laughed at me, the bitches treated me nasty
I was a backpacker, now the gat-grabber
The only elevation seemed like the crack ladder
But then I heard Del, and the Hieroglyphics
And The Pharcyde and the Tribe "Can I Kick" shit
Got my backpack, started raisin' my knees
Stompin' in place while my niggas makin' G's
Rapping to myself man even making beats
And the milli's keep my chilly man I keep makin' heat
I'm like a vato you ain't takin' shit
And since I was about 9 I've been skatin' please
Now I'm in the hills with some US Magazine ho
Tellin' me to call her on ICECREAMs her dream clothes
Game like a tendril, money like a spin wheel
And retarded is my pencil don't give the nigga one inch he'll
Go yard, I rock Goyard, "What's that?" Oh god
I deal with LV but that's so hard
But I stick with LV cause I get it no charge

[Intro: Pharrell, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
In My Mind's coming soon
It's so real
But in the meantime, we have some other shit to handle
So real (The Aphilliates, nigga, pay attention!)
This the music for the—
Skateboard P been paying a lot of dues (Dr— Dr— Dr—)
So real
And I don't know if y'all niggas been paying attention
It's so real (Dr— Dr— Dr—)
Well, if not, this what I'ma do for 'em

[Verse 1 (false starts): Pharrell & DJ drops]
This that music for the most realest, blow dealers
Who by the way are Mo' spillers
Surrounded by go-rillas, yeah
It's Skateboard, over "Trap or Die"
From Virginia, AKA "Hustler's Paradise" (Dramatic, nigga!)
Yeah, it's Skateboard, over "Trap or Die"
Yeah, it's Skateboard, over "Trap or Die" (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

[Verse 1: Pharrell & DJ drops]
—the most realest, blow dealers
Who, by the way, are Mo' spillers
Surrounded by go-rillas, yeah (Gangsta!)
It's Skateboard, over "Trap or Die"
From Virginia, AKA "Hustler's Paradise"
But don't get it twisted, they be kidnapping guys
Caught you slippin' your fault, the unmastered eye
The only math-ma-tic is drug traff-a-ic
Get it cook it cut it nigga then wrap it quick
Get yourself a white one, get your man a matching 6
The whiteys call him "hip-hop," but they can't rap a lick
Niggas tryna case 'em, the Feds is tryna chase 'em
But they got it all designed like the mind of a Mason
Fresh Ice Creams, I know you ain't plan to fall
Turn that white tee red like Santa Claus
It's almost sacrilegious, the way they practice business (Gangsta!)
We call it package-risen the way that drug wakes up the dead
Just for sports cars, it's lipstick-red
On chrome deep-dishes; the face of the rim is red like Swedish Fishes
Put the car and the rims together and get the sweetest kisses
Clear your head for a second, leave the weed restricted
I know you think I'm rapping fly, but I know niggas that rap and fly
While I rap in fly jets, banging that "Trap or Die"
I'm a great rapper, right?

[Interlude: Young Dro & DJ Drama]
Yeah, yeah (Young Dro), yeah, yeah
Shout to Grand Hustle!
For real, fuck with me
My nigga, Young Dro!
Young Dro, check this
Talk to 'em!

[Verse 2: Young Dro, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Young Dro, ayy, I could turn time a day back (Gangsta)
June the First (What?), I could whip up and bring May back (Oh!)
Play that, I am a Yugoslavian killer
German bricks: I am a Yugoslavian dealer (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Painkiller, blue-green Chevy, Navy Seal, marine-ready
Dope same color spaghetti—you know, off-white, noodle yay'
Flying Spur, super great
Forty-five caliber to your chest, super-pray (Hard)
Fruit whips, deuce-trey, 'bout to blow my roof away (Get 'em)
Japanese torpedo (Choing-yoing), 'bout to blow your coupe away (Ah)
I hustle where I used to stay

[Break: Young Dro]
Nah, I ain't gon' tell em all that

I'ma stop right here, and I'ma come back here, like, here
Ayy, look, ayy (Dr— Dr— Dramatic!)

Dice for eight days (Yes), ocean-black waves (Yes)
Ocean-green Jaguar (Yes), total-black 'yays (Yes)
Tote a black gauge (AP), Benz Four-Door Class 8 (Yuh)
Mercedes 900, nigga, fuck a 500
Big rocks in my ear—look like a muscadine, don’t it?
Oh, that rhyme don't it? (Yes!) Gotta believe us
'Frigerator rocks, I was born in the freezer (Brrr-r-r)
Ayy, I was born in the freezer (Gangsta!)
(Hold up, man, what's up, y'all?)

[Verse 3: T.I. & DJ drops]
Nigga, my pistol fully loaded, and my cheese in stacks
You can keep the baking soda—ain't no need for that (Gangsta!)
Cook crack, money fast, off-white money long
We ball in Bowen Homes 'til all the money gone (Ayy!)
Forty-cal' leave you numb like you bumped your funny bone
What the fuck you laughing for? Ain't a damn thing funny, homes (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Live the dangerous life, I could show you the skull and bones
Smooth as Frank Sinatra, but gangster like Al Capone
It's well-known where we from and all the shit that we done
Whether we proud of it or not, speaking loud of it or not (Dr— Dr— Dramatic!)
I take a scoop out the block and then drop it into the pot
Distribute it to the block—it's easy, believe it or not
Niggas come all shapes and sizes, but pistols even 'em out
It's plain to see he was shot, but nobody speaking to cops
He seized, the gun dropped, they squeeze and none stopped
I miss them, double back, and kill them all in one wop, nigga

[Outro: T.I. & DJ Drama]
Simple as that, man
Now that's what quality street music's supposed to sound like!
Ain't nothing to it in the hood
You never there; we there often
DJ Drama!
Dro, P, let's get it!
Oh! Ayy!

Your affiant is Austin Police Detective W. Lyons #5936 who is employed by the Austin Police Department and has approximately 7 years of law enforcement experience. Information contained in this affidavit was obtained from Officer Perez #6676 and Officer O'Farrell #5948 and contained in the Austin Police offense report 14-0721336

Officer Perez and Officer O'Farrell both stated to Det Lyons that they were assigned to a Unified Command Public Assembly Code Enforcement (PACE) Team for escort during SXSW events taking place in Downtown Austin, TX. The officers stated they were assigned to assist the PACE team with enforcing city code on occupants inside establishments for public safety reasons in the entertainment district

Officers stated to Det Lyons that the Pace team received a call for service at the Scoot Inn located at 1308 E 4th St due to a possible overcrowding. Officer Perez and O'Farrell stated to Det Lyons that they arrived on the scene with the Pace team and observed a large crowd. Officers stated the establishment was at capacity with 999 people inside. Officers stated to Det Lyons that the employees who were assigned to work the door for the Scoot Inn were allowing 1 person inside as 1 person exited the establishment. At this time, Officer Perez and O'Farrell walked inside of the establishment to check the area and observed the performer "TYLER THE CREATOR" onstage. The officers stated to Det Lyons that at that moment "TYLER THE CREATOR" yelled out to the large crowd of people waiting in line outside the building "ALL YALL OUTSIDE THE GATES YALL PUSH THROUGH." At that time, Officers Perez and O'Farrell stated the crowd waiting in line outside started to try and push the employees working the door out of the way, but hesitated. The officers also stated the employees working the door then immediately attempted to secure the doors and close them and that is when "TYLER THE CREATOR" yelled out again to the large crowd who were now becoming unruly and enraged "YALL PUSH THROUGH GET IN COME ON." At this time, the Officers stated they observed the large crowd push through the employees working the door which created an immediate danger of injury to persons. Officers then stated the performer "TYLER THE CREATOR" began apologizing then cursing at employees working the door before he exited the stage. Officers stated after the "riot" dispersed, they made contact with a bartender who is an employee of the Scoot Inn and he was identified as: Mylan, Thomas. Officers stated Thomas made a statement to them that during the "Riot" he held several people back so one girl who fell to the ground would not get trampled. Officers stated Thomas then told them that while he was trying to protect the girls who fell he was punched by an unknown male subject to the left side of his face which caused him pain. Officers stated they could not locate the suspect due to the large amount of people at the establishment. Officer Perez and O'Farrell stated they called for more officers to respond to the scene and that is when the crowd dispersed

(F) an offense under this section is an offense of the same classification as any offense of a higher grade committed by anyone engaged in the riot of the offense was: (1) in furtherance of the purpose of the  assembly. In this caste the bartender: Mylan, Thomas who is an employee of the Scoot Inn was punched to the left side of his face which caused him pain.

[Intro: DJ Drama & Pharrell]
Okay this today's lecture
On how it should be done
Yessir
Why I keep having to school y'all niggas?

[Verse 1]
Yo
Behind the door there was Gatman, who was also known for robbin'
Aquaman cooked the coke and kept the Superman saucy
A dirty nigga that wasn't known for washin'

[?] he didn't care what it cost him
Eventually the nigga started cookin' cre-ation nothing but the reverse of 12-B
The tumultuous life of Skateboard P
I hang with white people but you don't know me
I seen, niggas run down stood over and gunned down
One shot up in his arm, then he spun 'round
Now how does in front of his son sound?
And get his dog it was just one round
For the ready rock they smoke that shit on cans
I was rockin' flattops and rockin' slip-on Vans
Screamin' "Killa dude!", and rolling my pants up
As the ghetto bitches mixed the neighbourhood dances up
But this wasn't a soft place
Friendship villages threw the smile off ya face
Trainin' em young, they were schoolin' 'em mane
Fifteen killer niggas face cool as a fan
Told them "The right bullet hole will free one's soul
Let you control the block and get a ve-hicle"
So I, started pacin' the X of my situation
Then I became the bases of, see style's translation
Sure I'm on that brothership but I started thinking color-less
Like my favorite watch but I had to get the other wrist
Reporters like "Yo, so what you done good?"
Fall back bitch, I brought computers to the hood

[Hook]
Whether you ride or you above the law
Make money money, make money money money
Don't even try if you afraid to fall
Nigga make money money, make money money money
Keep your mommies that'll ride with the dice taped with the raw
Make money money, make money money money
Ask police state-fly keep your gangstas on call
So we make money money, make money money money

[Verse 2]
I got
Model bitches to drive me on sixes
Condos in Paris with million-dollar pictures
Smoke like a sailor, drink tushy two-up
Suckin' my dick because she love the way I grew up
Huh? You talkin' to me?
You gon' do what? Yes he's got the gat and he can pull two-up
Them shits is mind-blowing
Where he grew up they wear rags with they eyes showin'
Four in the morning you hear the nines blowin'
Armour all on they cars to keep the shine goin'
We order cars with special features
The two-tone rose the bitch got alopecia
Who got vitiligo, intended color cycle
White and tan and brown, call it Michael
I just might go down to the beach
Absorb the heat pick up a couple freaks
Eyes lead them between my sheets
Then eyes lead them right beneath
Downstairs right in the lobby
I'm not being cocky
But snugglin' is not me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Kilos, C-notes, speedboats pe coastal
See low we smoke chocha tre ochos
That's what eighty-five percent of niggas envision
While the real ten percent get caught and go to prison
The other five percent them niggas end up missing
Probably on the coastal bellies deep sea fishing
Blowin' perfect rings out the Cuban cigar
Their daughters turn 16 get 'em Italian cars
The world is yours fuck it how 'bout Mars?
I know your mother told ya "Aim for the stars"
Let's get right nigga cut short the laugh and
Get in touch with high B with the half hand
The dope is opium comes from Afghan
So let's make millions and blow up like a gas can
You wanna shine don't you? Like the rocks glisten
But you ain't tryna listen, you on a fuckin' mission

[Hook]

[Intro]

Balling overseas, nigga I'm heavy there
Leaning to the side, mixing all drinks

I'm off the wall bitch, I'm full of that shit

[Hook]

Pour some more in, cause I can handle that

Bitch you got me fucked up

Spend some time alone
Understand that soon you'll run with better men
Alone again

[Toro Y Moi]:
Tie down my hands and run away
So you won't be so afraid
Of what I'm gonna try to do

It found my pulse in the mist
I'm gonna get you back from this
You'll see
You'll see

Adding up all the things left
And bring them back to where they were
So bad
So bad

I'm better off than what it looks
To be, to be, to be
Stationary

Follow my path and trust my words
Don't stay too long while I'm with you
While I'm with you
Black forest into the night
Take you into the other side of endless movements
Of endless movements

Check my peaceful eyes
Check if I'm alright
Check my peaceful eyes
Check if I'm alright

Check Check Check Check 

[Repeats]
Check if I'm alright

Now full of cotton and drowns
Me into to something that she'd love
That she'd love

I'm shaking in my sleep and
I am too into the street

Check my peaceful eyes
Check if I'm alright
Check my peaceful eyes
Check if I'm alright

Check Check Check Check
Check Check Check Check 

[Repeats]

My whole body gets weak
When you're standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud

[Refrain]
Girl, do I do

Baby

[Chorus]

My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, love, love

[Verse 3]
From the time that I awake
I'm imagining the good love that we'll make
If to me your vibe can do all this
Just imagine how it's going to feel when we hug and kiss

I know the record's about to end
But we're just going to play and play until it goes away
So, if you don’t like the groove you can turn the record off
It won't cost you nothing but a penny and you'll have a cough
I know I cannot rhyme cause I ain't like a friend of mine
But I ha ha ha ha h-ha ha ha

[Verse 1]
Distorted, ordered by the court to be aborted
Snorted, right before these vocals were recorded
Morbid, too perverted, stay alerted
Went to the club, murdered the first slut that flirted
Deserted, abandoned by my mama and it hurted
The worst nut my daddy ever squirted
Screamin, cussin, buzzin when I'm bustin, open sores pussin
I need another dose of Robitussin
Fussin' over nothing, an army couldn't calm me
Bitching like a lady, shady like a palm tree
What the fuck you call me, who you calling soft?
I'm still fresher than you and bitch, I'm fallin off
I'm horny, and corny girls won't even cross my path
I'm so dirty, I don't even wash my ass
Never took a shower, cower from a scower
Prowler, clean your house out in half an hour
What's your flavor, how you want it, ripe or sour?
Rifle power, snipe you from the Eiffel Tower
Too much weed, I'm bout to malfunction
Style's drunken, carjacking Al Duncan
Slim Shady, peace

[Verse 2]
Spray and wreck, with my man Sway & Tech
Freestylin' on the mic, rappers ain't know what's comin' next
Yo, I'm in a 'Vette breakin' necks
Cashin' checks, whiplashin' necks, smashin' decks
Freestyle right off the top, rappers ain't ready
Cut 'em like a machete
The Freddy of rap, hold it steady
Bustin' rhymes off the top of the dome wit' a popular poem
Forget a team, man, I can stop you alone
Killin' rappers, rappers ain't ready for the way I do it

[Lost Verse]
Fluent when I be kickin' these rhymes, ain't nothin' to it
'Cause I be bustin' 'em
Rappers ain't ready, ain't got no stamina
And I be bustin' rhymes on Sway & Tech in front of the camera
Damage ya like Ja Rule
Hey you, I'll mess up your debut
Rappers ain't ready for the way you can't save you
They can't save you, you're gone, you're finished
You're done, you're diminished
Rappers will never replenish
'Cause I'm Infinite, and when I step in it
In a minute, I'ma kill it when I bust rhymes
Rappers ain't ready, 'cause I don't feel it
Yo...

[Verse 1]
Won't you give me something I need
Won't you peel me off of the street
Go and wet my tongue
Spit me up and break me a fever
Give me something I can believe in
Give me something, to walk me away
I'm a waste of time
And all in all waste of a living
Waste of a living
Can't you see me walking alone
I've been down to the horns and back
And I'm way too tired
Of blowing out the burning candles

[Chorus]
I got no money, but I want you so 

[x2]
I got so much I cannot handle
Cannot handle
I cannot handle

[Verse 2]
And all this pissing around
Cut loose in this fucking town
I ain't coming back
I got my ticket on to the next one

[Chorus]
I got no money, but I want you so 

[x2]
And I want 

[x3]
And I want it

[Verse]
To lead a better life, I need a love of my own
Here
Making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to meet her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I will be here, there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
In yellow shoes I get the blues
Though I walk the streets with my plastic feet
With my blue velvet trousers, make me feel pink
There's a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers
In my paisley shirt I look a jerk
And my turquoise waistcoat is quite out of sight
But oh oh my haircut looks so bad
Vegetable man, where are you?

So I've changed my gear, and I find my knees
And I covered them up with the latest cut
And my pants and socks all point in a box
They don't make long of my nylon socks
The watch, black watch
My watch with a black face
And a big pin, a little hole
And all the lot is what I got
It's what I wear, it's what you see
It must be me, it's what I am
Vegetable man
I've been looking all over the place for a place for me
But it ain't anywhere, it just ain't anywhere
Vegetable man, vegetable man
He's the kind of person, you just gonna see him if you can
Vegetable man
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers
Waddle with apples to crunchy Mrs. Stores
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket

Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter
Flat tops of houses, mouses, houses
Fiddle and Diddle sitting bat tat tat
Watching the telly till all hours - telly time!
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter

Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers
Waddle with apples to crunchy Mrs. Stores
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket

Calling out your name
Calling out your name

[Verse 1: Christine McVie]
Can you hear me calling

Everybody wakes, and in the morning
Hot tea and can't stop yawning
Pass the butter please
Have you ever read the Daily Standard?
Reading all about the plane that's landed
Upside down?

[Bridge]
And no one knows what I did today
There can be no other way
But I would just like to say

[Chorus]
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime

[Verse 2]
Everybody cares about the weather
And everybody should know better
What a waste of time
Everybody lives beneath the ceiling
Living out a dream that sends them reeling
To a distant place

[Bridge]
But no one knows what I did today
There can be no other way
But I would just like to say

[Chorus]
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime

[Toro Y Moi]:
I really wanna try to help you out
And if you knew I didn't why did you never try to settle down
And time is lost, now you'll never know what's after now
But I know it doesn't matter cause this is not important
What should you be learning?

Right from wrong, good from bad
Safe from harm, and out of doubt

Yeah I gotta few mistakes and I wanna shake em off to you
No I didn't mean it
That's cause I wouldn't even
For a light to hold on
Please forgive a giver and replace a ticket, cause of you its gone
You know how it is
You simply replace you gotta know what you've learned

Right from wrong, good from bad
Safe from harm, and out of doubt

Yellow rims, yellow big booty, yellow bones
Yellow Lambs, yellow MP's, yellow watch
Yellow charm ring chain, yellow living room set (Chiquita!)
Lemonade Gucci shoes for my girl, it’s Gucci

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My Phantom sitting on sixes, no twenties in my denim
Your Cutlass motor knocking because it is a lemon
I like them Georgia peaches but you look more like a lemon
These sour apple bitter bitches I'm not fucking with 'em
I'm truly stupid paid, that's just how I feel today
I'm moving slow cause codeine syrup's in my lemonade
I'm standing in the shade and I'm selling lemonade
Six hundred a pint, the going rate off in the A
Lemonade diamond bracelet, put it in your face
Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday
I'm pimping wearing lemon, that's just how I'm chilling
I'm smoking grits and selling chickens, Corvette painted lemons (Gucci)

[Chorus: Choir & Gucci Mane]
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts (Yeah)
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts (Brr)
Lemonade and shade with my feet up (What?)

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Better than the rest, it's the bestest
Only cause they expect nothinh lesser

Fresh as watermelon so they sour like a lemon
Looking for my baby, i'm just trying get my slim on
First is on roids i been tryna get my gym on
Notoriously big so she tryna get her Kim on

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Uhh, and who the hell said they was cheaper to keep
Cause if you ain't getting money when you call you get the beeep
She can't pick up the phone, your broke ass should leave a message
And my guess is, if she never call well you get the message
You like "whaaaat, you can't call nobody?
I've been trying to find you like Waldo shawty"
She said she bout her paper if it's there she gon' get it
When the money gone she gon' be the fuck gone with it
Hey, I mean come on, she love Louis Vuitton
Yorkie in her speedy bag that she name Milan
Hair stay did like she live in a salon
Her and money go hand in hand yeah like a baton
I swear on a stack of holy Bible's and Qur'an's
We could be the Dream team baby, Kobe and LeBron
Only if you gold, I never do the bronze
Cause if you could have Beyonce would you take Solange?

[Chorus: Choir & Gucci Mane]
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts (Yeah)
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts (Brr)

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
I'm in a tricky little mood
I trick these little dudes
I tell 'em that I love 'em but I never really do
See I like pretty shoes
And I like pretty minx
And I like site seein'
The pyramids and the sphinx
He cop Italian pieces so I do the fist pump
And I can only push it if the trunk is in the front
If the trunk is in the back, then you gotta take it back
You can hit me on the jack
I chat on the Mac
See I am who I am
Nicki M. motherfucker
If she say she not a fan
She a lyin' motherfucker
Always shoppin' in Paris
So I speak a little French
Oui Oui rag-a-de
Time for you to hit the bench

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Cashing off of pussy, cause money ain't a thing
Stripper bitches love to work on us

I love flexing money, Milwaukee off the chain
Ohio girls, make the pussy work the same way

Fucked a new stripper, man and the pussy off the chain
Caught her in my trap, bitch that money don't play
Money don't play bitch, money don't play
Shake your ass for the money, girl the same way
Money don't play bitch, money don't play
Shake your ass girl, for the money the same way

Trying to cash out, bitch I know Lil Wayne
If you selling pussy, say my name say my name

[Chorus: Lil B]

Walked in the club, bitch you know I got that sack

[Intro]
Many rivers to cross (you ain't got to ask me what I do this for)
But I can't seem to find my way over (I do this for my city)

[Verse 1]
Constantly on the come up, constantly on the come up
But I always get this feeling and it's constantly on my stomach
I learned to always follow my instinct, when you come from where I come from
They try to make a nigga feel like King Kong in the concrete jungle
Damn, cause they don't teach niggas how to deal with anger
Nah, they only teach niggas there ain't nothin' real but danger
Politics will not swing in our favor
Cause all of us are rappers or entertainers
But I still woke up and said, "Young nigga, get it"
Cause this is your life you can choose how you live it

[Hook]
Are we just lost in the city of madness?
Or do the powers that be just lack human compassion?
I don't know...

[Interlude 1]
And they don't want you to speak the truth, man
See when you speak the truth they like to make you feel crazy
But you ain't crazy, don't let them lie to you
Whoever you are, you out there
Keep doing you, man, fuck the haters
Let 'em hate, let 'em hate

[Verse 2]
You only get one life, you know
And this life ain't in my control
When you talk about politics, it's a rod for a lightning bolt
Tell me how do you fight a war when the price is for your soul?
When you gambling with your life, that's a hell of a pair of dice to roll
They say, "Bobby Ray where you went? All you talk about is whips"
I say you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it take a sip
Yeah, everybody got their own two pennies
But what does that mean if it don't make sense?
I see the crowd, their hands up high
But what does that mean? What do they get?
At the end of the day what I get paid and they go home what do they think?
How can we ever be free if policies don't ever change?

[Hook]

[Interlude 2]
You know, sometimes it feels like it's just against the world, man
Who really got our best interests, man?
Don't, don't, don't let 'em take your soul, man
Don't, don't, don't let 'em take your soul, don't take your soul

[Intro]

[Outro]
No Genre
People ask me what No Genre means
You know, I once did a mixtape called No Genre
I didn't realize that no genre man, like no genre really described my career
People started, like, gravitating toward No Genre and, you know, I was like, "Fuck it, let's do a part two"
It really can't be defined by any genre, so
Fuck it man, No Genre

[Chorus: Fam]
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks

[Interlude 1: Childish Gambino]
Young nigga in an old whip
Whole clique is in Zone 6, oh shit
Hold on a second

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Old money flow yeah I did mine bigger
Ape shit flow so King Kong nigga
You got big money, man? How long nigga?
Can't talk right now, I'm in Hong Kong nigga
My Polo rounds, fuck her for only a photo now
Skin is so cinnamon, Cocoa Brown
Wanna be me but they don't know how
So profound
Who cares what they be on, I'm in the sun with aviators
I'm my favorite song, I came to ball
And aim at y'all, you know the semi-automatic with no safety on
Bow down, ladies want a shout-out
Take her, flip her over, lower back I leave that blah-dow
Ass backwards, Kriss Kross
T-Rex, Chris Bosh
Nigga we eating so Rick Ross
Brown rice, fish sauce
Fly as a kite, man I must be
Claiming to be where them thugs be
My niggas is making it dusty
Cause I'm aiming at you like I just sneezed (like I just sneezed)

[Chorus: Fam]
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
Them white folks at the front of the crowd
Yeah, they're my niggas
In the time that I’m around
Nigga you can ?
?
Shoutout to the Migos (amigos)
?
Bought 100 pairs of J's with last years taxes

[Verse]
When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse]
When I met you in the summer (Summer)
To my heartbeat's sound (Yeah, yeah)

You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon (Yeah, yeah)
When I met you in the summer
Summer

[Bridge]
When I met you in the summer (Summer)

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Chorus: Oobie]
Get Yo Ass on the floor

Bitch what u waitn for get yo ass on the floor

[Verse 1]
You know that night was good
When you wake up in the mornin with that cloudy piss
You know how i do work

I'm at the bar feelin 50 takin bout 9 shots
I got like 9 broads takin them with me, why stop?
Now I'm bouncin from broad to broad
My thang be thick from wall to wall
I've read the book but its like i mastered the art of war
So if anybody thinks they can take advantage cuz i had a couple of drinks
Think again, I'll have you like Kanye West with a brand new jaw and a metal chin

[Chorus: Oobie]
Get Yo Ass on the floor
Girl you betta (stop, stop playin)
Bitch what u waitn for get yo ass on the floor

[Verse 2]
Excuse me, I'm takin over
I'm sick like ebola

Most of these bustas fold up when its time to thug out
Ima take it to the club where them freaks be takin it off and backin it up
Ima make it so hot that when these mamis walk in they ready to fuck
Every (every)
Body(body)

[Chorus: Oobie]

[Intro: Lil'Jon]
What, What, Oh let's go!! (It's the nasty beatmakers!)
Reeeemix, Yeah!
Pitbull and it's bitch... Me!
It's suburban Joe chekin' in, Scrabby
All my chicos there (Fat Joe!)
Let's go!

[Hook: Scrabby & Lil'Jon] (x4)
When i hit mami you know nasty (That's nasty)

[Verse 1]
Pitbull and Joe crack on the same track, that's a problem
We'll get more money than rich poor in "asi" get in Harlem
Rob from the rich, give to the poor, welcome to the bottom
Where the cocaine in the old school chevy game is more than hobby
I'm tellin you this boys down here'r very heavy mayn
The're "out of pit study sex ous" but really is a number game
A 2 point 2 thang
But look what happen
I think the braggadocio--the money, cash, hoes thing--needs to be deaded. I feel like that’s holding us back as a culture, as black people; it doesn’t advance us in any way, shape or form. We’ve been doing that same thing for years now, it’s like like, what, four decades of the same old 

[expletive]. Sorry for my language. And I feel like, you know, if you’re gonna be an artist, there’s a time when you just have to embrace the responsibility and understand that the power of music is something so special, and to be able to do in on this magnitude where you reach millions of people, it’s like why not use that for good, why not tell kids something that they can connect with in their life.

And really, my mission statement since day one - And I'm getting so worked up talking about this. All I wanted to do was help kids not feel alone and stop kids from comitting suicide. *Applause* Thank you.

And I'm never trying to be political, and I'm actually like shaking, I can't believe I'm saying this, but- *Arsenio interrupts*

Arsenio: Those two specific things, where does that come from?

Cudi: Well, I've dealt with suicide for the past 5 years, you know? Like, it wasn't a week or day that didn't go by where I was just like "You know? I want to check out" You know? I know what that feels like, and I know it comes from loneliness. I know it comes from not having self-worth, not loving yourself. And these are things that - you know, kids don't have music that can coach them and give them that guidance.

I didn't have that. I had to listen to Jay-Z and take certain things from it and the other shit, I just didn't know what he was talking about. *laughter* And like, now I'm 30  and I'm like, "Oh! that's what Hov was talking about, I get it now"

But what about the kids who- you never really had an artist where you connected with them all across the board. And I think that that's my job, I'm just really trying to guide people and help people, cause loneliness is a terrible, terrible thing man, and if you don't know how to conquer it, it can eat you alive.

Arsenio: How are you right now?

Cudi: I'm good, I'm alright.

[Verse 1]
Bend, little willow
Wind's going to blow you hard and cold tonight
Life, as it happens
Nobody warns you, willow, hold on tight

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna shake your love
Take your love away
No one's out to break your heart
It only seems that way, hey

[Verse 2]
Sleep little willow, peace going to follow
Time will heal your wounds
Grow to the heavens, now and forever
Always came too soon

Little willow

[Chorus]
Nothing's going to shake your love
Take your love away
No one's out to break your heart
It only seems that way, hey

[Verse 1]
Bend, little willow
Wind's going to blow you hard and cold tonight
Life, as it happens
Nobody warns you, willow, hold on tight

[Outro]
(Willow)
Ah, little willow
(Willow)
Ah, little willow

[Verse 1]
Because I lied with all my heart
Because it's time to change my life

[Chorus]
'Cause you won't be missing that part of me
It's all you need when telling everyone that you're free
Hold on, you'll see, it won't be that hard to forget me
I hope you won't

[Verse 2]
I ruined your endearing soul
Wish you knew I was too young

[Verse 3]
Because you cried, doesn't mean you can talk to me
When you decide

[Chorus]
At least you won't be missing that part of me
It's all you need when telling everyone that you're free
Hold on, you'll see, it won't be that hard to forget me
I hope you won't

[Outro]
Will you forgive that I left?
Should've predicted why you would hate

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
I know why they fuck with Bricksquad
Real recognize real, it's Gucc'

[Chorus: Quavo]

Nigga wanna hit my phone bout some marijuana
I wrap the pack up and get that shit to Tijuana
My daddy died, I miss you
But still nigga I'm 'aight (Aight?)
You niggas is fake, you niggas is snake

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Every time you see me nigga I be with a thousand
Young niggas that's wildin', all my dogs be growlin'
All my wolves be howlin', all my shooters prowlin'
Goin' hard in the paint on these pussy ass niggas
Cause a fuck nigga tried to foul me
Bitch get the fuck from 'round me
Crown me cause I'm royalty
All my niggas loyal to me, all my hoes they spoil me
You are not a plug if you don't charge what I'm charging
Caught a murder charge, thanks to God I beat the charges
Shooters jumpin' out the van when the van park
In East Atlanta my house is a landmark
Your favorite rapper in the Gucci Mane fan club
I had to run out just to run my bands up
You wanna be a CEO then get your grands up
You wanna jack me you better change your plan up
Broke into my house and they keep bringin' your name up
Decapitation now you can't put your hands up
It's Gucc'

[Chorus: Quavo]
My momma, my sisters are 'aight
My money, my pockets are 'aight
I'm straight, I'm cool, 'aight
Don't need to worry about me, 'aight?
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, 'aight
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, I'm straight
My momma, my sisters are 'aight
My money, my pockets are 'aight
I'm straight, I'm cool, 'aight
Don't need to worry about me, 'aight?
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, fuck nigga
I'mma get mine by any means

[Verse 1]
I'm rocking retros with the cargos
I sell so many bricks, I need a barcode
All the vatos in the hood they call me Pablo
Cause I can cook a half a kilo with my eyes closed
I'm in a Lambo' Murcielago
But what's ironic to me is the fact I drive slow
I try to put my dick so deep it touched her tonsils
I'm just an OG in the hood just like your uncle
And I'm shittin' on these niggas like a portable potty
And a brand new Bugatti, mixing Sprite in narcotics
Young nigga super cocky and my verse is melodic
Crazy paint on the Bentley it look like Henn' & Hpnotiq

[Hook]
The bitches on the stage I'mma keep tipping
The pints on deck I'mma keep sipping
Roll up, roll up, hold up, hold up
I'm so froze up, I might throw up
Crack a seal and pour a four up
Kill that cup and pour some more

[Verse 2]
Cooking dope at Trestle Tree yeah I got the recipe
East Atlanta nigga so I never let you handle me
Hotter than a candle be, straight A, new Jeep Cherokee
My new girlfriend is blackanese, and I run with a bunch of thieves
Your baby momma seen me in Lenox and tried to tackle me
I done got so famous, I can't even eat at Applebee's
I don't give a damn 'bout no nigga say he out rapping me
50 pints of drank in the trap, I want a stack a piece
Three naked hoes in the room, they want a stack a piece
It's twenty thousand just so my goons can sip some Ace with me
Two Ferraris parked at my house, who wanna race with me?
Pick a ticket, let's see who wins to have a date with me
It's Gucci

[Hook]
The bitches on the stage I'mma keep tipping
The pints on deck I'mma keep sipping
Roll up, roll up, hold up, hold up
I'm so froze up, I might throw up
Crack a seal and pour a four up
Kill that cup and pour some more

[Verse]
Got a good reason for taking the easy way out
Got a good reason for taking the easy way out now
She was a day tripper, a one way ticket yeah
It took me so long to find out, and I found out
She's a big teaser, she took me half the way there
She's a big teaser, she took me half the way there now
She was a day tripper, a one way ticket yeah
It took me so long to find out, and I found out
Tried to please her, she only played one night stands
Tried to please her, she only played one night stands now
She was a day tripper, a Sunday driver yeah
It took me so long to find out, and I found out

[Outro]
Day tripper

And now I believe

[Chorus]
Mother Mary pray for me
Cause I know not what I've done

At times when I need you
I feel like I'm bleeding from my eyes
And I cry, save me Jesus Christ

Mother Mary pray for me

Cherry pound like that, but it's all in them raps
Stop lying to the people acting like you got the pack right now

[?] it's how you act a real round
Got a ticket on your head, let my homie hit the lotto
Big niggas, I don't fight it, see the boom or a bottle
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Helicopter too now, I'm a subject
Face on the news nigga, for the public
Gotta hide at my cousins at the projects
Smoking weed with the Crips in the complex
Twisting OG's with the Bloods in the commons
Cause only colour they see is green
And they're gonna do anything for the commas
TGOD, now they wanna call the feds
I'm a keep smoking all this, all this grass
What you smoking on, nigga? That's a bag full of trash
I was in the 9th grade smoking weed after class
Just a tilt door looking like the car on fire
This the weed mix, you gon' need a few lighters
You ain't never smoke no fucking KK, nigga
And we don't smoke no motherfucking AK, nigga
Word on the street buy whole one
Get good with the plug, you gon' throw one
Serve your homie who ain't never gon' say shit
Chef it up in the face like a shogun

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
What you smoking, nigga ?
I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG
I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG, I'm smoking OG
God damn - what you smoking, nigga ?

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Realest shit you ever seen
This the realest shit you ever seen

[Chorus: All Star]
This the realest shit you ever seen, yeah
Ride hard so clean with my seat back
Blowing money like I never even seen that
Blowing money like I never even seen that
This the realest shit you ever seen, yeah
Ride hard so clean with my seat back
Blowing money like I never even seen that
Blowing money like I never even seen that

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, I blow this money like you never seen it
Felony flow, you niggas is misdemeanors
When I was broke I used to walk I had a rich demeanor
Shawty said I make her pussy wet that bitch Katrina
Last week I blew like twenty for the hell of it
Bloodhound, I find that money just from smellin' it
Pick your drug of choice, I bet you I was selling it
Addicted to that money roll a hundred start inhaling it
I'm burning papers like I'm Wiz Khalifa
And if this rapping ever fold I still could get it cheap
You know the feeling when you burn a hundred in a week
Turn a nigga out just like the first time when he hit a freak
Eenie meenie miney moe pick a chick and dick her down
Maybach in the building money everywhere you look
We've been on the top floor
Hater we ain't lookin' down
Lil B up in the kitchen, look at me, I'm cooking now
I'm cooking up and whippin' white the money I'm a spend it now
She said you don't hit it right so she just tryna spend the night
You smoke on the regular but we smoke on that kryptonite
My whip it got paper plate, you ain't got it in your life

[Chorus: All Star]
This the realest shit you ever seen, yeah
Ride hard so clean with my seat back
Blowing money like I never even seen that
Blowing money like I never even seen that
This the realest shit you ever seen, yeah
Ride hard so clean with my seat back
Blowing money like I never even seen that
Blowing money like I never even seen that

[Verse 2: NH]
I'ma stunt until the whole world mad at me
I'm out here killing 'em again that's something sad to see
I take my boys out to the mall they pop and tackle me
Get anything you want my niggas, eatin' what I'm glad to see
Here's where I'm glad to be, I thought I'd let you know
I'm still stuntin' hard fucking bitches, getting dough
You heard me, my pockets sitting high
I buy shit, I don't even know why
Cause I got money
I was born just to shit on niggas
Come through in Maseratis with the kid on niggas
That's light work, Lamborghini bucket seats with the pipework
Now that's tight work
They say money talk, what you try to say?
Dumb kids, I got more Louis than Kanye
I don't know what type of games you tryna play
But I be getting money, is what I'm tryna say

[Chorus: All Star]
This the realest shit you ever seen, yeah
Ride hard so clean with my seat back
Blowing money like I never even seen that
Blowing money like I never even seen that
This the realest shit you ever seen, yeah
Ride hard so clean with my seat back
Blowing money like I never even seen that
Blowing money like I never even seen that

[Verse 1]
Won't need no shadow man
Runnin' the government
Won't need no stinkin' war
Won't need no haircut
Won't need no shoe shine

[Chorus]
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone

What will people do
After the garden is gone?
What will people say
After the garden?

[Verse 2]
Won't need no strong man
Walkin' through the night
To live a weak man's day
Won't need no purple haze
Won't need no sunshine

[Chorus]
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone

Where will people go
After the garden is gone?
What will people know
After the garden?

[Outro]
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone

[Verse 1]
Yeah, why you keep askin' me about... (Why?)
She's not here right now, she's not here right now
Why am I the one you wanna get into it with for the drama?
I've got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now

[Chorus]
Spendin' all my days on the east side, oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now
Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

[Post-Chorus]
I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
You can be the one to take control, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me

[Verse 2]
Why you keep askin' me about... (Why?)
Couple other things I'd rather do than talk about that right now
Told you 'bout givin' him chances on chances on chances
He's not holdin' you down, he's holdin' you back right now

[Chorus]
Spendin' all my days on the east side, oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
Love it when your ass speak the truth to me, oh
Tryna wake up and have you with me, oh
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

[Post-Chorus]
I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
You can be the one to take control, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me

[Interlude: Drake & Rihanna]
Yeah, ayy
Yeah
I I threw my hands in the air and said show me somethin', yeah
Ayy

[Verse 3]
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house
She made tea for me
We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, "When that shit is real, you just know"
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me
That my nigga 'til we gone, keep his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Yeah, already...
Girls talkin' 'bout, "You gotta leave already?"
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said "You're mine" I was yours already
22, had the Bentley four-door already
Even as a boy, I was the boy already
So you know that that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get rewards already
Know I do this shit for Third Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time 'cause I lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime say you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, 'nother Xan for your boy
You would prolly fly out to Japan for the boy
You would prolly kill another man for the boy
You would prolly...
You would prolly lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy, yeah
(Why? Fring)

[Verse 1]
I needed a place to go
Yeah, that's what you told me
So I went to your house to try to find you in your room
Why can't I find you now?

[Pre-Chorus]
Walking alone tonight
Wishing you were still here
Wishing things were all right

[Chorus]
We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died
We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died

[Verse 2]
We took down the icicles
The way they melt in your hand
You told me you loved me at an age I didn't understand
I didn't understand

[Pre-Chorus]
Walking alone tonight
Wishing you were still here
Wishing things were alright

[Chorus]
We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died
We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died

[Bridge]
Where will we go when we get old?
Where will we go when we get old, old?

[Chorus]
We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died
We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died
We tried, oh yeah, we tried
And we died, oh yeah, we died
We tried, oh yeah, we tried

[Verse 1]
My dear it seems we're here again
So much for effort
Isn't it clear we're here again
Our thing right where we left it
A delusion is a flight, first class to no where
While a dream is a blueprint, a plane to go there
To go there

[Hook]
And I, I promise on all existence
If it breathes then it is our witness
We have unfinished business
You and I
And so my word is that I'll cross those bridges
With zero regret for limits
And distance, you and I

[Verse 2]
My dear it seems we're here again
Was there a glitch in my method
Isn't it clear we're here again
Let's get new GPSes
So next time you see this place remember we we're alone
We'll bring our children from home
That's right, ohh yeah, I'm gonna go there

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Well, anyone think they can can do it better
Well c'mon, c'mon
But back to you
Hold on girl we can make it
Stack whatever on top I can take it

[Bridge]
It seems we're here again
This is the right trajection

[Hook]
Wouldn't you like to believe
I'm on the edge
I feel your palms on my back
You're murderous, you're murderous

Swept and I fall, euphoria
Breeze in my eyes
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over

So painless, I feel the fall
Power trip, I need it all
I need it all

When you're around, I feel it
When I'm alone, I feel the waves
Crashing, down down
Here in your arms, surround me
I feel your wings
What are you made of
So what are ya, what are ya
Forget I'm alive when you're here
Can lay here for miles
I know you feel me
You're comfortable
I feel your soul

Swept and I fall, euphoria
Breeze in my eyes
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over

In the horizon I see your face
I doubt you live when you say
How could you need me
How could you need me
How could you need me

When you're around, I feel it
When I'm alone, I feel the waves
Crashing, down down
Here in your arms, surround me
I feel your wings
What are you made of
So what are ya, what are ya

When you're around, I feel it
When I'm alone, I feel the waves
Crashing, down down
Here in your arms, surround me
I feel your wings
What are you made of
So what are ya, what are ya

[Verse 1]
Give it up to this time full of strife
Get down, you might be fucking with the song of life
Extend your deeper senses, there will be no fight
At the never-ending ocean of perfect insights
Around your molecule beam with a halo of light
The animated aura will give delight
Soon, your every single worry will be out of sight
With the power of it, we are about to astound
All your preconceptions, they will come unbound
"Listen very close," my inner voice expounds
"We are the human race, and we groove to the sound"
Yes, we deliver the truth to our musical birth
A soul-shocking sound with electrify the earth
People have to know that it's not about money
Cash is not the way to make your life sunny
There is no need if you got the soul seed
Love, life, and peace, it can only begin
When you know in your heart that the change is within
Love all your brothers and love all your sisters
Love all the missus and love all the misses
And don't be shy when you're sharing your kisses
Greed, jealousy gets boos and hisses

[Chorus]
What it is, what it is, so much to be found
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong

[Verse 2]
Balance your life with the right kind of foods
To eat a sad cow, is to eat another you
Well, that's an unfair rap, it's unforgivably rude
It'll put your karma in the worst of moods
Someone drinkin' booze and taking too many ludes
'Cause when you cop, don't you cop an attitude
And that's an ugly thing, it's not the real you
So please, y'all, take some sound advice
Be yourself, clear your mind, make a sacrifice
The always sober you is especially nice

[Verse 3]
Don't loot, don't shout, give comet the boot
I love it kickin' back and playin' my bamboo flute
Refuse to fight wars for political whores
Unsurpassed peace lines the salt water shores
It is my notion that the perfect peace potion
Can be found in the wake of the green sea ocean
Long rocky swells of the mighty blue ocean
Is the cradle of peace, it's the perfect peace potion
There you will find it, with sweet sea creatures
The smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature
We will learn much peace with the whale as your teacher
"Good morning class, how very nice to meet you."

[Chorus]
What it is, what it is, so much to be found
What it is, what it is, groove down to the sounds
What it is, what it is, what it is in a song
What it is, what it is, you can do no wrong

[Verse 4]
Open up your hearts to the planets, to the stars
With your spirit take, a trip from Venus to Mars
You know, Einstein did while Hitler hid
Now Albert lives forever in every single kid
But, with Adolf Hitler, we are permanently rid
Picasso, Mister Dali, and my man, Jimi Hendrix
These cool brothers make the world go 'round
Yeah, they do it with art, and Jimi did it with sound
But, by all these men, it was found
Each and every person can be just as renowned
Don't let the world's racist creeds give your pretty face a frown
Stand up for equal rights, I mean buckle down
Go spread the word from town to town
We are the human race and we groove to the sounds

[Outro]
(Red hot
Red hot, red hot, red hot, red hot)
Now that you've heard what it is in a song
From here on in, you can do no wrong

[Verse 1]
You say that all you want are the simple things
Long walks on lonely beaches, guitars with nylon strings
But underneath you'd rather leap through a hoop of fire
You shy away from lips that want, that want to kiss you
Tongue-tied on formal evenings, wealth don't impress you
But if you ask me you like the heat in a hoop of fire

[Chorus]
And it's hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire 

[x2]

[Verse 2]
No late nights making love in secret places
You feel pressure all around you, mistrust in strangers faces
But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire 

[x2]

[Chorus]

[x2]
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life on stages with ten thousand people watching
But we are alone yeah, and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly many times, but baby can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Baby, baby can't you see through me
We are alone, and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front when I was hiding (but you have nothing to hide)
And now I'm so much better, and if my words, they don't come together
Listen to the melodies (listen to the melodies)
Cause my love, ooh baby, cause my love, cause my love, ooh
Is in there, ooh, is in there hiding
Baby I loved you in a place (in a place, in a place, in a place)
Where there's no space or time
(Baby I loved you) I loved you all my life
You became a friend of mine
And when my life is all over
Remember when we were together, when we were alone
And I was singing this song for you
For only you, only you, ooooooooooooh
I was singing my song for nobody but you

[Intro: Soulja Boy]
Wow, aye
Swag, swag, Soulja

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Ridin' in that 'rari tryna make it work
Bad bitch with me and I make 'em squirt
Catch me in the trap tryna make it work
Catch me on the block tryna make it work
Whippin' up work with my other hand
Fuck niggas hatin' on me cause I got them bands
Yeah you know I'm tryna make it work
Standing on the block tryna make it work

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Packs touch down and they gone
King S Beezy on his fucking throne
Ridin' in that Panamera or the coupe
Double cup of Styrofoam I'm sipping juice
Two chains, money out the roof
In a blue Phantom and I'm hustle loot
Ridin' to the club in a Mase' coupe
Everybody know I got a 'rari roof
Standing on the block tryna make it work
Bad bitch with me and I make 'em squirt
In the trap tryna make it work
Standing on the block tryna make it work
In the trap tryna make it work
Bad bitch ridin' with me and I make 'em squirt
On the block tryna make it work
In the trap tryna make it work

[Verse 2: Offset]
I'm workin for certain the Maybach with curtains I'm servin'
I earned it
The Lamborghini look like Kermit
My niggas'll go to war just like the Persians
My plug is an alien, not from the Earth
Don't come on my turf
Talking bout you got the work, you gon' get hurt
I send the pack to the skirt
No job but I'm trappin' I gotta work

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Hit the block sprayin' with the K
Call Takeoff, hit 'em with the throw away
50 packs came in had to make it work
Age of seventeen I juuged my first pound of purp'

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Send me the skirt I'm makin' it work
All these dead presidents, I need a hearse
Double cup of Mrs Buttersworth
Molly Sand tan, I got Percocets
Stand in the kitchen I whip me a chicken
I post on the block and I fuck up the trenches
If I see 12 then I'm jumpin' them fences
The trap life I live is ridiculous

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Ridin' in that 'rari tryna make it work
Bad bitch with me and I make 'em squirt
Catch me in the trap tryna make it work
Catch me on the block tryna make it work
Whippin' up work with my other hand
Fuck niggas hatin' on me cause I got them bands
Yeah you know I'm tryna make it work
Standing on the block tryna make it work

[Verse]
The weather man he looks confused
Shakes his fist at the sky like you used to do
But you don't remember things like that do you
The balance was uneven but I'm breaking through
Slow rivers run cold
Shallow waters never sank so low
I thought I'd drown and you'd never know
You're a slow river and you run so cold
The winter here don't believe in God
The bitter wind just bites through me like a wild dog
I still see your eyes tonight like headlights through the fog
But one foot in your door oh that's all I ever got
Chances are you'll reappear
Swim my way in a flood of tears
No place to hide your conscience so
You're a sinking ship with no place to go

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by ya, what?

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on

[I bet they wonder how I go on, go on]

[I bet they wonder how I go on, go on]
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken

[When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward]

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Say the work don't stop, cause they don't stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

[Verse]
Some people say you hate me
I don't believe it's true, things that you're going through
Some people say you hate me
I don't believe it's you, things that you're going through
Some people sad I pray for
No one you want to live, the eyes that once were his
Some people sad I pray for
The way you want to live, the eyes you want to give
Some people say you played me
I don't care if it's true, I'm waiting here for you
Some people say you made it
I'm not afraid to know, when things are getting low
Some people say you hate me
I don't believe it's true, things that you're going through
Some people say you hate me
I don't believe it's you, things that you're going through

I've been waiting many hours
By the silent moon
In the wild, the jungle flower
Your toxic perfume
Tell my friends I'm gone, it's true
I've passed on now
To the eyes of a dark, lost blue

I don't believe you
I'm in a parachute
Falling in deep
Sleep
Out of control
Can you feel it?
Is this the end of the road?
Falling in deep
Lost in a dream

And the rains begin to shower
Cover me in bloom
In the wild the watchman's tower
Your perfect monsoon
Tell my friends I'm gone, it's true
Tell my son I've gone away with you
I don't believe you
I'm in a parachute
Falling in deep
Sleep
Out of control
Can you feel it?
Is this the end of the road?
Trick up your sleeve
Breathe

I don't believe
Is this the end of the sea
Staring at me?
I could be free
In a dream

Lay down by the fire light
For all I know it's the last time
Tell my son
Oh

[Intro]
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

But spiritual wickedness in 'igh and low places
So while they fight you down
Stand firm and give Jah thanks and praises
'Cause I'n'I no expect to be justified
By the laws of men - by the laws of men
Oh, true they found me guilty
But through - through Jah proved my innocency

Oh, when the rain fall, fall, fall now
It don't fall on one man's housetop. Remember that:

[Verse 1]
On the city streets, I got the tunes in my box
I'll play the Chili Pepper so the public can rock
Excuse me mister, won't you hear my thought?
I play in a band, yeah, we're called the Red Hots
Out of my way, boy, I'm afraid not
I've got no time to think and talk
But this baby rocked out on the spot
She was a shakin' and a kickin', that itty bitty tot
Her pop said no, but she just couldn't stop
The kid had a case of toddler rock

[Chorus]
But here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky spiel, it makes them squeal
The Chili Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we reel
I'm overjoyed, we got baby appeal
We serve those tots the funk-o-meal
I'm overjoyed, we got baby appeal

[Verse 2]
We stoke the fire, we crank the heat
Four groove dog brothers funkin' out in the streets
Rockin' up a storm when who do we meet
But the hop, skip, jump up bumpin' baby de beat
She was a shaking and a kicking those itty bitty feet
The next thing you know was she called out her fleet
Five thousand babies rocking out in the street
Well, that's a serious sight, I mean golly gee whizz!
I just can't tell you how much we dig
Rocking right out for those itty bitty kids, rock out

[Chorus]
Well here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky spiel, it makes them squeal
The Chili Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we reel
I'm overjoyed, we got baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk-o-meal
I'm overjoyed, we got baby appeal, so get down!

Just jump a jump a jump a jump a jump around
Jump the day away, jump all over town
Because jumping is okay in a jumping kinda way, hey hey

[Verse 1]
Jump a boy, jump a girl, jump a rope, jump for joy
Just don't stop jumping, keep your heart muscle pumping
Hillel be jumping on that little baby Frumpkin
Say what, you got a pumpkin in your pants
When you're just standing or sitting still
Think about the frogs getting a thrill
Take a little lesson from the kangaroos
Don't you know they're jumping foos, jump you
Jump a nun, jump a Jack, jump for fun, jump back
How's about us jumping in the sack?
And now, it's time for a jump attack

Say what, you got a pumpkin in your pants

Mister Mexican jumping bean knows

Christ, how'd you think that he got so lean
Not from sitting on his goddamn spleen, get up
Oh, I be jumping I be jumping I be jumping alone
I be jumping for the phone, I be jumping Mrs. Jones
I really want to jump on Kinski's bones

Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?
Why don't you spot me like you used to do?
When you whisper sweet nothings like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

[Verse 2]
Oh, why don't you be the way you used to be?
How come you find so many faults with me?
Somebody changed, so let me give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
Why don't you say the things you used to say?
How come you treat me like a piece of clay?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

[Bridge]
Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin' in a long, long while
We don't get nearer, further, closer than a country mile
Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin' in a long, long while
We don't get nearer, further, closer than a country mile, let me tell ya boy

[Verse 1]
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?
And why don't you spot me like you used to do?
When you whisper sweet nothings like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

[Verse 2]
Oh, why don't you be the way you used to be?
How come you find so many faults with me?
Somebody changed, so let me give you a clue

Ain't had no lovin' like a huggin' and a kissin' in a long, long while
We don't get nearer, further, closer than a country mile

[Verse 1]
About this planet, there is something I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
A friend, foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow
Here, above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks, and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed, and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention hardcore chemical pollution
If you think a different way, you're in a mental institution
And that's a heart felt shame
'Cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?

[Bridge]
Wow
Ow, ow, ow
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Time now take you to a different place
Where peace-loving whales flow through liquid outer space
A grooving and a gliding as graceful as lace
A never-losing touch with ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at 'em with a gun
They have a lot of love for every livin' creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built-in feature
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm going to meet ya

[Verse 3]
Back to the land of the police man
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new
A trigger-happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke-ridden prisons and sex-sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the American tradition
Along with goin' fishin', apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?

[Intro]
Aw!

[Chorus 1]
Police helicopter sharking through the sky
Police helicopter landin' on my eye
Yeah!

[Chorus 2]
Police helicopter takes a nosedive
Police helicopter, no, he ain't shy
Yeah!

[Chorus 1]
Police helicopter sharking through the sky
Police helicopter landin' on my eye
Yeah!

[Chorus 3]
Police helicopter don't take nosedive
Police helicopter, no, he ain't shy
Yeah!

[Outro]
Aaw!

[Intro]
We're all a bunch of brothers living in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called LA

[Verse 1]
LA is the place, sets my mind ablaze
For me, it's a race through a cotton-picking maze
The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks
Well sure, it's got some chumps, but I still get my kicks
My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick
Alike dump on a thumb, pop hump, hump, hump, pop out
The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be
Because I'm shooting for the top, and my best friend's a Flea
Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls could pop
But he never met the tree, so he never bebopped, hop out

[Verse 2]
Antoine the Swan, from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong
Wore a cold paisley jacket and a hella fine ass
In between his legs was a sweet young lass
Threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to fear that he'd love them all
By the time he got to ninety-nine, he had to stop
'Cause that's when he thought that he heard a fop

[Bridge]
Last night and the night before
I heard a fop outside, then I
Came indoors! Rock out!

[Verse 3]
Now that I told ya somethin' about the Flea
Somethin' 'bout the Tree, a little somethin' 'bout me
I can't leave you hanging 'bout my man Sherm Zee
He swings the ying, he bangs the yang
And now, it's time to hear him do his thang
You better be burnin' Sherman!

[Outro]
We're all a bunch of brothers living in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called LA
Step out!

[Verse 1]
Three miles off the coast of Beirut
New Jersey's guns get ready to shoot
Oh, take a walk down the firing room
Fire one it's shakedown cruise, yeah

[Chorus]
Blow job park
Blow job park

[Verse 2]
Oh, see the sailor boys dressed in blue
Cheer the chance to make the news
Send the shell down the spiral groove
Bombs away it's a shakedown cruise, yeah

[Chorus]
Blow job park
Blow job park

[Verse 1]
Three miles off the coast of Beirut
New Jersey's guns get ready to shoot
Take a walk down the firing room
Fire one it's shakedown cruise, yeah

[Chorus]
Blow job park
Blow job park
Blow job park
(Blow job park)

[Verse]
Loving and touching and laughing and squeezing and
Walking and joking and smiling and teasing
Hugging and kissing and rubbing and scrubbing and
Styling and slumming and rolling and cumming

[Bridge]
I'll hold you a lifetime, I'll love you forever
I'll make you my wife and I'll never forget you
I'll give you my smile on the face of your child
I will give you my love, I will give you my love

[Outro]
Loving and touching and loving and touching and
Loving and touching and loving and touching and
Love

[Chorus]
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule

[Verse 1]
In the class, she's taking notes
Just how deep, deep is my throat
Mother Mary, don't you know
She's got eyes like Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus]
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule

[Verse 2]
From the cross, she's raised her head
This is what the sister said
"Give no love until you wed
Live no life until you're dead"

[Bridge]
The good book says we must suppress
The good book says we must confess
But who cares what the good book says
'Cause now she's taking off her dress

[Chorus]
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule

[Verse 3]
Lead us not into temptation
We are pure divine creation
Talking 'bout my generation
Injected with the seed of emasculation

[Outro]
Catholic

[Verse 1]
Time to swing a little melody
To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're going to get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move
We are pumping that driving bad rhythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum
In the mind is one design
To make you feel fine, sucking on mine with a 69
I'm inclined to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck your brains out
Make her moan, make her groan and make her shout
Push it all in and pull it all out
Pump  that labia 'till it pouts

[Hook]
Sex rap
Sex
Sex rap
Sex

[Verse 2]
Open your legs to the sensual sound
Let the booty bustin' beat pound your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hump the ground
As you're droppin' to your knees and I come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down

[Verse 3]
Our lustful notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady loving a viable stud
Causing what is known as a juicy wet pud
Getting it getting it getting it good

[Hook]
Sex rap
Sex
Sex rap
Sex

[Verse 4]
Wow, in my head, as a jellified hum
I take to rubbing her on the bum
Adjust the lips some on the tongue
With my thumb I strum her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like oozing hot cum

[Outro]
Well I like to make her cum
To the rhythm of the drums
Make her cum, make her cum, cum

[Verse]
Thirty dirty birds sitting on a curb
Chirping and burping and eating dirty earthworms
Along comes Herbie from thirty-third and third
Saw the thirty dirty birds sitting on a curb
Chirping and burping and eating dirty earthworms
Oy, he was disturbed

[Intro]
Look at that turtle go, bro

[Verse 1]
On a far away island of Salamasond
Yertle the turtle was king of the pond
A nice little pond, it was clean, it was neat
The water was warm, there was a-plenty to eat
Until one day the king of them all
Decided the kingdom he ruled was too small
"I'm a ruler of all that I see
But I don't see enough and that's the trouble with me"

[Verse 2]
"With this stone for a throne, I am too low down
I cannot look down upon the places beyond"
So Yertle the turtle king lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king gave a command
He ordered all the turtles onto one another's back
He piled them high into a ten turtle stack
"I'm Yertle the turtle, the things I now rule
I'm king of a cow, I'm king of a mule"

[Interlude]
Look at the turtle go, bro

[Verse 3]
Then down from below in the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne, this burping little turtle
Looked up and said "I beg your pardon, King Yertle"
I've pains in my back, my shoulders, and my knees
How long must we stand, here your majesty
"Silence!" the king of the turtles barked back
To the bad burping little turtle named Mack
"I'm Yertle the turtle, oh marvelous me
For I am ruler of all that I see"

[Bridge]
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Wow!
Look at that turtle go, bro
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle

[Intro]
We're millionaires
Against hunger

[Verse 1]
I'm a millionaire and I got something to say
I got a million more that'll take me away
All the other ones' bills starting to percolate
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay

[Verse 2]
Well I'm a millionaire too, but not like you
As far as I'm concerned, I got a job to do
I've got to pave the way, I've got to save the day
I've got to make it better, I've got to say
You and I, we're millionaires
But we're a million miles away from the saint who stares
Upon the millions who die, every day of the week
Just because they can't get enough to eat
While we the rich dine on all these feasts
And everything's fine, yeah peaches and creme
But it just isn't something you've got to realize
There's something wrong, we've got to open our eyes
When the world cries, we just can't hide
We've got a job to do, we've got to save some lives

[Pre-Chorus]
We're millionaires
Against hunger

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, Mr. Millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey, hey, Mr. Millionaire
A spiritual price do you care
Hey, hey, Mr. Millionaire
Dice the mice when you share
Hey, hey, Mr. Millionaire
Pave the way, take the dare

[Verse 3]
I'm a millionaire and I got something to say
I got three or four yachts on the Chesapeake Bay
All those people starvin' everyday
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay

[Verse 4]
Well I'm a millionaire too, all I know that is true
Is that I've got more cash than I can use
I want anything that I can have
But I don't need nothin' and I never have
Each damn day my heart's set far
But I'll be okay, 'cause I won't starve
Kids from the street losing their emotion
So damn snobby, so out of touch
With two hungry people who die as they stare
At the city at night, you know it gives to share
So listen up, you millionaires
Every woman, every man, help all you can
All races unite, and I will now concern
To the type of problem that helps us learn

[Pre-Chorus]
We're millionaires
Against hunger

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, Mr. Millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey, hey, Mr. Millionaire
A spiritual price do you care
Hey, hey, Mr. Millionaire
Dice the mice when you share
Hey, hey, Mr. Millionaire
Pave the way, take the dare

[Verse 1]
You know you coulda been a wonder
Takin' your circus to the sky
You couldn't take it on the tightrope
No, you had to take it on the side
You always like it undercover
Tucked in between your dirty sheets
But no one's even done nuttin' to ya
In between the hollers and the screams

[Chorus]
And I said, "Nah nah hey hey"
Another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
In the black of the night 'til the red morning light

[Verse 2]
You got your cozy little corner
All night you're jammin' on your feet
Hangin' out just like a street sign
And put a twenty dollar trick
I hear you're blowin' like a feather
And then they rub it in your face
Oh, once they've had all their fun hun
You're at the bottom of the cage

[Chorus]
And I said, "Nah nah hey hey"
Another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
In the black of the night 'til the red morning light
And I said, "Nah nah hey hey"
You're givin' all your cinnamon away
That's not right
Ah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Hey hey, another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
Uh hey, keep on givin' away and givin' it away (Givin' it away)
But, hey hey, you're givin' all your cinnamon away
Hey hey, you're givin' all your cinnamon away

[Chorus]
Ah, hey hey
Another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
In the black of the night 'til the red morning light
And I said, "Nah nah hey hey"
You're givin' all your cinnamon away
That's not right, aow! Come on
And I said, "Nah nah hey hey"
Another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
In the black of the night 'til the red morning light
And I said, "Nah nah hey hey"
You're givin' all your cinnamon away
{Intro}

[Verse 1]
Somebody's gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do

[Verse 2]
Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
Make it come out right

[Chorus]
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Lord, I know

[Verse 3]
Some people like to stay out late
Some folks can't hold out that long
But nobody wants to go home now
There's too much goin' on

[Verse 4]
This night is gonna last forever
Last all, last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song

[Chorus]
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Lord, I know

[Bridge 1]
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon's shinin' bright
So turn out the light and we'll get it right

[Chorus]
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Heartache, baby
{Instrumental Bridge}

[Verse 1]
Somebody's gonna hurt someone (somebody)
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do (everybody)

[Verse 2]
Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
To make it come out right

[Chorus]
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Let's go

[Bridge 2]
We can beat around the bushes
We can get down to the bone
We can leave it in the parkin' lot
But either way

[Chorus]
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know (Lord, I know)
There'll be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Woo-woo!

{Outro}
(Break my heart, baby)

[Chorus]
If you were me
And I was you
If you had to play my part out
What would you do
Two crazy stories
Two different views
If you were me
And I was you

[Verse 1]
If you were me
And I was you
What kind of crazy things
Would I have to do
Who likes to party
Who stays at home
If you were me
And I was you
Never like strangers
Though never the same
Two circus sideshows
That laughed in the rain
You stayed with the full moon
You searched for the stars
Thank God in His heaven
Here we both are

[Chorus]
If you were me and I was you
If you had to play my part out
What would you do?
Two crazy stories
Two different views
If you were me

[X2]
If you were me and I was you

[Outro]
If you were me and I was you

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
And I done see these bitches do it all for the paper
And I done see this paper turn my dog to a hater
For the love of the money, the love of the dough
For the love of the money, them hoes fucking for sure
And I know, And I know
Who said that money isn't everything?
Whoever told you that they a  damn liar
Cause all this money, it can buy you everything
I don't know nothing that money can't buy

[Verse 1: Betrayl]
I ain't never sinned, I ain't ever crossed over
Gotta go to Panama, I don't want it chopped up
Everywhere I go I'm pulling up burners
The first to get the money, drop some, murder something
Defend this code, the feds all delivering
Yeah, I fuck with Papi, but no, I ain't Dominican
For the love of dividends, it's been around the block
I let them know I got it cause he out there round the clock
In the projects jewelry mean you made it
And the body might get you famous
And the key might get you stopped
Fuck with me, I might get you opp
It's no apology, nigga, it's criminology, nigga

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
And I done see these bitches do it all for the paper
And I done see this paper turn my dog to a hater
For the love of the money, the love of the dough
For the love of the money, them hoes fucking for sure
And I know, And I know
Who said that money isn't everything?
Whoever told you that they a  damn liar
Cause all this money, it can buy you everything
I don't know nothing that money can't buy

[Verse 2: Betrayl]
And I ain't never jealous, and I don't get emotional
It's all about familia, I do what I'm supposed to do
Talking over details, tying up the loose ends
Know me from the project, They used to go "yo who that"?
Copped all my mixtapes, you tryna roll up
You heard I was moving shit, wait a second, hold up
Be careful what you say
They tryna get inside, the phones, they got ears
They also got eyes, you know
You break it down and you get a watch
We break it down and we get them blocks
Cause if you play around getting guap
We gonna lay you down, get a mop
We sigh, we grind and we here
No, everywhere, every day, ever route
Every smoke that we light and it's on
Let's go

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
And I done see these bitches do it all for the paper
And I done see this paper turn my dog to a hater
For the love of the money, the love of the dough
For the love of the money, them hoes fucking for sure
And I know, And I know
Who said that money isn't everything?
Whoever told you that they a  damn liar
Cause all this money, it can buy you everything
I don't know nothing that money can't buy

[Intro]
Do it
Yeah, sing it!

Why do you do what you do?
I do what I want to do
Who said you could do what you do?
I told you who told me to
I do what I want to do
I do what I want to do

[Chorus]
A funky crime, funky crime
Don't you know funk's colorblind?
Well, I've committed a funky crime
Against a state of mind
Flea, tell me what's going wrong
Are you okay?

[Verse]
Hey you, Mister Interview
I don't have to answer you
This is what I grew into
Don't judge me and my soul stew
Funk is my attitude
Funk is my attitude

[Chorus]
Funky crime, funky crime
Don't you know funk's colorblind?
Well, I've committed a funky crime
Against a state of mind
(We play funk, punk and rock)
(Anthony, we're truly the best group)
(In Hollywood, my man)

[Bridge]
Barriers of race
In the media take place
Tellin' you there is no room
For what you do, don't budge
There's no groove to your cold gloom
And who made you the judge
Always room for funky tunes
And yes I funk it up, I funk it up, a-ha!

[Interlude]
Funky boy
Meets a funky girl
Make a funky baby
'Cause the funk is crazy

[Refrain]
Why do you do what you do?
I do what I want to do
Who said you could do what you do?
I told you who told me to
I do what I want to do
I do what I want to do

[Chorus]
Funky crime, funky crime
Don't you know funk's colorblind?
Well, I've committed a funky crime
Against a state of mind

[Outro]
Funky crime

Funky, funky crime
The crime is funky

Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends

[Verse 1]
Like two sweet peas in an even sweeter pod
Well, that’s my friend and my friend’s name is Bob
Like the devil knows Hell, I know Bobby well
Well enough to tell you ‘bout his sixty-seven smells
Well enough to tell you he’s a hella swell-a fellow
Well enough to tell you that we know each other better than we know ourselves
Like freaks of a feather, we rock together
I know Bobby well, but I think he knows me better

[Chorus]
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends

[Verse 2]
He’s as close to me as a friend can be
Well, I’ll be standin’ by my buddy, he’ll be standin’ by me
Just another half of the two-headed freak
But I need him like my heart needs to beat
At this point in this friendly verse
I’ve gotta sing a little something that I haven’t rehearsed
It’s about my man and his name is Hillel
For whom my love is soul-brother sacred
Take it Huckleberry, Slim Boy, take it

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Jacky’s eyes are closed but he’s right on course
Because he’s guided by the invisible force
He drives a kooky green Chrysler bad as anybody’s Porsche
He’s a working class drummer, he’s as strong as a horse

[Chorus]
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends

[Verse 1]
Oh, someone spilled blood many years ago, wow!
Someone spilled blood but do you know
That from the backwoods where the Chuck Berrys grow
Come your long tall daddies of rock and roll, oh no

[Chorus]
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now

[Verse 2]
Spinning down from the clouds like a tornado
Spinnin’ out of control like a psychedelic soul
With a rhythm hitting harder than a-Larry Holmes
Come your long tall daddies of rock and roll, oh no

[Chorus]
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Wow!
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Well, Mr. Uplift Mofo, my man Bo Diddley
Hit sipping a bottle of nickel ripple, play the lickity split finger
Lickin’ licks for all you wicked city slick chicks
And all you nitty gritty hicks
He’ll make your nipples ripple
He'll make you wanna dip your dipple
He'll make you wanna soak your hickory stick
That’s right, because my man has a grip on it
And I do mean on it-a
Which brings to mind
A very sinister minister kind of guy
A man named Little Richard
Who was born to make them bitches stir
That’s right, he’ll make the sweet substance drip
From the middle of your hillbilly lips
And like the farmer milks his cow
The Howling Wolf will howl
And since times does allow
You all can take me to your backwoods now
Yo, Slim

[Chorus]
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now, wow

[Outro]
Take me to your backwoods (backwoods, backwoods)

[Verse 1]
Flashing lots of cash and spending lots-o-loot
He’s sitting at the bar – then he’s sitting at the booth
Across the dance floor he does scoot
He’s the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

[Verse 2]
The caboose that could he goes toot toot
Been known to gag and sometimes puke
A very good friend of Granny Goose
He’s the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

[Chorus]
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit (ow!)

[Verse 3]
He’s half man and half cartoon
But a good buddy, don’t be confused
He’s full blooded looney tune
He’s the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

[Verse 4]
Face to face with the man in the moon
His family doctor is Doctor Seuss
If you catch him in your soup please don't shoot
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

[Chorus]
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit

[Bridge]
He was new in town
A free wheelin’ clown
A very funny young duke hanging under the roof
Of a place in time, united sound

[Verse 5]
He’ll play a little guitar, sing a few blues
He’s the kind-a-guy that you can’t refuse
Despite the fact that he’s no brute
He’s the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

[Verse 6]
Strike the magic groove make him jerk and move
Like an eight legged freak in snake skin boots
Coming soon to a theatre near you
It’s the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

[Chorus]
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit, wow!

[Intro]
Hey yeah!
(Yeeeah!)

[Verse 1]
Indeed, it may seem that we have strange ways
But we do it with compassion and don't believe in age
Travel 'round the world, getting naked on the stage
Busting people out of their everyday cage
We like to think we make a sad man happy
And we like to make proud our mami and our papi
Funky young kings, we sing of truth and soul
We're the modern day braves with one strong hold
Through the world of song our boldness is exposed
I'm talking about my buddies, funk it up Fishbone!

[Chorus]
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Our devotion to emotion is more than evident
To the minds that are open, it's you we represent
We hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent
One day the good time boys might just be president
Like a pack of mad hatters who come from outer space
Our swinging's going to shatter every stone cold face
Now you may not know the exact reason why
A band commands attention from the mountains and the sky
Making more than money, more than money can buy
I stop and take a listen to the Monster's "Try"

[Chorus]
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Interlude]
Got me bonin'
I'm gonna try try try try
She's a- she's a- she's a white girl

[Verse 3]
If you don't believe me, you can ask John Doe
'Cause his heart is made of glory and his voice is made of gold
He'll tell you in a minute about the men he knows
He'll tell you about the band called Firehose
To those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit
We play it out loud for everyone to hear it
B-b-building up our brains with the supernatural powers
We take it from the trees and the mighty Watts Towers
Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours
We're the best of the west and the west is ours

[Chorus]
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Let's rock 'em to the bone)?

[Verse 1]
People, keep on learnin'
Soldiers, keep on warrin'
The world, keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long
A-powers will keep on lyin'
While your people will keep on dyin'
The world, keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long

[Chorus]
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on Earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin' 'til I reach the highest ground

[Verse 2]
A-teachers, a-keep on teachin'
A-preachers, a-keep on preachin'
World, keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long (oh no)
Lovers, a-keep on lovin'
While believers keep on believin'
Sleepers, just stop sleepin'
'Cause it won't be too long, oh no

[Chorus]
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on Earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin' 'til I reach the highest ground

[Outro]
And Stevie knows that, uh, nobody's gonna bring me down
('Til I reach the highest ground)
'Cause me and Stevie, see, we're gonna be sailing on the funky funky sound
('Til I reach the highest ground)
Bustin' out, and I'll break you out, 'cause I'm sailing on
('Til I reach the highest ground)
Just, uh, sailin' on, sailin' on to higher ground
('Til I reach the highest ground)

[Verse 1]
Step right up and listen, please
You're gonna get it with the greatest of ease
Well, well, everybody a-gather 'round
All aboard the underground
You gotta get in before you get out
Gettin' out, what it gonna be about
Well if you find that you are blind
Open up your bashful mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Let my band step inside, take you on a cosmic ride
A-let my band step inside, take you on a cosmic ride

[Verse 2]
With honest sounds, I'll paint your brain
For in this song, I do proclaim
That once aboard this moving train
I'll do my best to ease your pain
Slinky as my speech may be
On this trip, you'll ride for free
As we leave, I'll trade us spots
Where outer space is not so dark

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily

[Chorus]
Space is king or so I sing, a subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing, a subway to Venus

[Verse 3]
Once aboard and feeling smooth
Like a liquid, you will ooze
Into a state of mind that soothes
Aw, be my guest inside my grove
'Cause what I got to give to you
Is gonna make you wanna boogalulu
I'll make you wiggle like a wiggly worm
'Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Life's too short to be in a hole so bust into your funkiest stroll
Life's too short to be in a hole so bust into your funkiest stroll

[Chorus]
Space is king or so I sing, a subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing, a subway to Venus

[Bridge]
Oh, what I got to give to you
Is gonna make you wanna boogalulu
I'll make you wiggle like a wiggly worm
'Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll
Well, take your body, a-shake it around
And do the dog on the ground
And if I can't make you dance
I guess I'll just have to make ya piss ya pants

[Chorus]
Space is king or so I sing, subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing, subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing, subway to Venus
Space is king oh, oh, or so I sing, subway to Venus

[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus]
LA Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a badass fact
A claim that remains intact

[Post-Chorus 1]
M-A-G-I-C, see you on the court
Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart
M-A-G-I-C, Magic of the buck
Other teams pray for dreams but he don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
Penetrating the lane like a bullet train
Comes Magic blood, a telepathic brain
Knucklehead suckers better duck when the buck comes through
Like a truck
Scott stops, pops, and drops it in
On his way back, gets a little skin
From the hand of a man named AC Green
Slam so hard, break your TV screen
Worthy's hot with his tomahawk
Take it to the hole, make your mama talk

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is comin' to your town and he's gonna make rubble

[Chorus]
LA Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a badass fact
A claim that remains intact

[Post-Chorus 2]
M-A-G-I-C, I see your purple and gold
You can swim, but you won't get far so you might as well go home
M-A-G-I-C, in Buck we trust
Restoring order to the court, and justice is a must

[Verse 2]
Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly
'Cause they've got more moves than a bowl full of jelly
The buck stops here, pops, then cheers
A roar through the Forum that deafens my ears
The one and only known of his kind sits in a throne
Not for the records that he holds
But for bein' bald and bold
Kareem Abdul Jabbar, all-time great super, superstar

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is comin' to your town and he's gonna make rubble

[Bridge]
Does anybody want some (Magic Johnson?)
Does anybody want some (Magic Johnson?)
Does anybody want some (Magic Johnson?)
Does anybody want some (Magic Johnson?)

[Chorus]
LA Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a badass fact
A claim that remains intact

[Outro]
Do-diddy-do-diddy-do-do-do
Diddy-do-do-diddy-do-do-do

[Intro]
Mm-mm-mm
Gonna eat ya alive
Ooh

[Verse 1]
The freakiest show I know is the show of my own
Livin' my life in and out the twilight zone

[Chorus 1]
Bust my britches, bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature, walkin' totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

[Refrain 1]
Oh, I love ya
And ya love me too

[Verse 2]
Intercourse with a porpoise is a dream for me
Hell-bent on inventing a new species

[Chorus 1]
Bust my britches, bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature, walkin' totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

[Refrain 2]
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Gonna eat ya alive

[Verse 3]
Ridin' down the path on the back a giraffe
Me and the giraffe laughed 'cause I passed some gas

[Chorus 2]
Bust my bitches, bless my ho
I'm a freak of nature, walkin' totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 4]
Enchanted as a rabbit that my life is a dream
Well, everything never just as it seems

[Bridge]
The freakiest show I know is the show of my own
Livin' my life in and out the twilight zone
Yeah, yeah, you for free

[Outro]

[?]

[Emotionally I wanna be a twin bee]?
Open my eyes, the developing sky
The sky is high I do reply
I'm on the way, nobody ask why
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Flat on my back in a lonely sprawl
I stare at the ceiling 'cause I cannot fall
Asleep tonight
No, not at all
Headlights flash across my bedroom wall
The crying eyes open 'cause I cannot fall
In love with you
No, not at all

[Chorus]
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
But aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

[Verse 2]
Busted in two like a brittle stick
I cannot drink because my throat constricts
Lovesick from you
That will never do
Open my mouth, I couldn't make a sound
I could not scream, you know, I could not shout
It out to you
Nothing to do, uh

[Chorus]
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Well aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
But aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Yeah, yeeeaaaah!

[Trumpet Solo]

[Bridge]
This may come as a shocking surprise
I have to take a walk, I have to kiss it goodbye
Goodbye, my love
Goodbye, my love
I am not alive

[Chorus]
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Well aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
But aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

[Outro]
How the price gets paid, ayayayayay!
Well I got to pay the price
I think I'll walk away
'Cause I couldn't survey, I couldn't pay the price
I couldn't pay the price

[Intro]
Ay ay ay ay ay!

[Chorus 1]
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And baby that's alright
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And that's alright with me

[Verse 1]
Get up off your knees, come on walk with me
Tell me what you need to get along
A statue come to life, I cut you with my knife
Bleeding to the tune of "Dolly Dagger"

[Chorus 2]
She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush

[Interlude]
Ay ay ay ay ay!

[Verse 2]
Haight Street's got nothing to show
Except the skirt on your ass
When you're living on the streets, you've got to let it roll
Get on with what you've got
Aw, everybody knows that it's alright
You've got no secrets to tell
But when you smoke that rock and suck that cock
You do it oh, so well

[Chorus 2]
She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude]
Bur bur bur bur bur

[Chorus 1]
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And baby, that's alright
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And that's alright with me

[Verse 3]
She's got marble eyes, sweet China doll, her thighs
An animal in pain, she starts to cry
Her pipes are open wide, she blows more than my mind
Echo sounds of soul time after time

[Chorus 2]
She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush

[Intro: Anthony Kiedis]
Well, alright-a
Now, dig this

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
You don't care for me, I don't care 'bout that
You got a new fool, huh? I like it like that, ha-ha
I have only one a-burnin' desire
Oh, ah, could I make love with your fire?

[Chorus 1: Hillel Slovak, Flea, & Anthony Kiedis]
Let me stand next to your fire (Fire, fire, fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Burnin', smoky fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Freaky, static fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Aw, yeah)

[Break: Anthony Kiedis]
Wah-huh
Now, just listen to this
Stop actin' so crazy

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Say your mom ain't home, it ain't my concern
Just don't play with me, and you won't get burned
I have only one burnin' desire
I'm gonna be doin' it in your fire

[Chorus 2: Hillel Slovak, Flea, & Anthony Kiedis]
Let me stand next to your fire (Fire, funky fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Oh, to your fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Freaky, static fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Aw, yeah)

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Oh, move over, Rover
And let Mr. Huckleberry take over
You know he's bad, you know he drowns
You know who he gives it to, ya, ha-ha, yeah

[Guitar Solo: Hillel Slovak]

[Break: Anthony Kiedis]
That's right
Now, do this

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
You try to give your money, you better save it, babe
Save it for your rainy day
I have only one a-burnin' desire
Oh, can I make love over your fire?

[Chorus 3: Hillel Slovak, Flea, & Anthony Kiedis]
Let me stand next to your fire (Fire, funky fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Freaky, static fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Oh, to your fire)
Let me stand next to your fire

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
You better slide yo ass over, girl
'Cause I'm comin' through once, and I'm comin' through once real hard
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ha, ha-ow, ha-yah

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
I'm a radio joe of the biz called show
I'm a rockin' pop star with a get up and go
Rubbin' elbows with the big wigs at my sold out shows
I've been on every cover, even Rolling Stone

[Chorus: John Frusciante & Flea]
Put us on MTV
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Conformin' to the norm straight out of the mold
Compromisin' each and every ounce of soul
I'm a-doin' anything for the records of gold
I only want what I can hold

[Chorus: John Frusciante & Flea]
Put us on MTV
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
We know that we'll never be better than
Mister slick superstar David Letterman
I promise we're perfect gentlemen
Just put us on the show, you'll regret us then

[Chorus: John Frusciante & Flea]
Put us on MTV
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please

[Verse 4: Anthony Kiedis]
Thank you very much! Be sure to label us
We wouldn't want to cause a ruckus or a fuss
Just put us in a category, if you must
AOR, CHR, Top Forty or Bust

[Chorus: John Frusciante & Flea]
Put us on MTV
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Go, Arnito!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
What I am is a picture on the TV screen
Don't make waves, don't make a scene
What I say when I play isn't worth a bean
I'm a video joe in an industry

[Chorus: John Frusciante & Flea]
Put us on MTV
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please
Uh!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah
Aah-aah, yeah
Uh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-uh-uh-uh
Aw yeah

[Verse 1]
Hair so smooth, black as coal, aw, baby, the way you sway
You wear the dress so very blue, that you take my blues away
She comes and goes, that I know, aw, she cums at least once a day
I can't resist, I kiss your lips, you're my sexy Mexican maid

[Chorus 1]
She cums, she cums
She cums, she cums
She cums, she cums
Lemme please get on my knees (She cums, she cums)
I come alone

[Verse 2]
When I wake up in the mornin', she greets me where I lay
I look outside to find that it's a bright and sunny day
So serene, she gives to me my toast and marmalade
What more can I say? She's my sexy Mexican maid

[Chorus 2]
She cums, she cums
She cums, she cums
She cums, she cums
Lemme please get on my knees (She cums, she cums)

[Verse 3]
She puts me in a bubble bath, she tickles me, and I laugh
She washes me until I'm clean, then she does a little sexy dance
Happy to feel my hand go slap upon her sexy ass
We make fun so very slow, then we make it very fast

[Chorus 3]
She cums, she cums
She cums, she cums
She cums, she cums
Lemme please get on my knees all merrily (She cums, she cums)

[Intro: Flea with Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
…Does that star-spangled banner yet wave?
Ha-ha-ha

[Refrain 1: Anthony Kiedis, with John Frusciante & Flea]
I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I-I, I, I cry, I cry

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
I was born in a land, I don't think you understand
Goddamn what I am
I'm a native of this place, please don't kick me in my face
My race has been disgraced

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Cop on
Sick a dig on
Right back

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante, Kristen Vigard, Vicki Calhoun, & Aklia Chinn]
Won't somebody testify? Kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

[Refrain 2: Anthony Kiedis, with John Frusciante & Flea]
I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I-I, I, what do I… why?

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Puts us in your pumpkin shell, where you keep us very well
It's Hell, where I dwell
When history books are full of shit, I become the anarchist
I'm pissed at this
What this country claims to be
It's a lie, no place for me, I bleed

[Pre-Chorus 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Bo-bo
Sick a gig on
Bo-bo

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante, Kristen Vigard, Vicki Calhoun, & Aklia Chinn]
Won't somebody testify? Kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

[Refrain 3: Anthony Kiedis, with John Frusciante & Flea]
I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I-I, I decide to defy

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
Kill my trust if you must, but in my blood, there is the lust
For life, that's right
Apache blood is in my heart, thrashing though me a-like a shark
Crashing though the dark

[Pre-Chorus 3: Anthony Kiedis]
Bo-bo
Sick a dig on
Step back

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante, Kristen Vigard, Vicki Calhoun, & Aklia Chinn]
Won't somebody testify? Kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

[Refrain 4: Anthony Kiedis, with John Frusciante & Flea]
I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I-I, I can fight, confide

[Verse 4: Anthony Kiedis]
What am I supposed to do? I feel like I'm cut in two
Confused by rules
Do these two cultures clash, or am I living in the past?
I ask, please tell me fast

[Pre-Chorus 4: Anthony Kiedis]
Bo-bo
Sick a dig on
Right back

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante, Kristen Vigard, Vicki Calhoun, & Aklia Chinn]
Won't somebody testify? Kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

[Refrain 5: Anthony Kiedis, with John Frusciante & Flea]
I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I, I, that's right

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
To what do I belong, and if I change, will I be wrong?
Be wrong, that's wrong
I took my foot and kicked a hole in the sky
I proceeded to plead, will fathers help me decide?
A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
I turned around and found that I was still alive
Snakes rise high from the purple-black sky
The red cloud rains, and the black horse rides
Then it dawned on me like the mornin' sun
I'm a part of two worlds, and the mornin' comes
Glowing embers tend to remember when
The power that is peace was treated as a friend
I'm a master of a destin' and I got to take action
I'm a man, the animal man

[Verse 1]
Down the street, you can hear her scream, "You're a disgrace!"
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
All the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries, "Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"
Against the door, he leans and starts a scene
And his tears fall, burn the garden green

[Chorus 1]
And so, castles made of sand
Fall in the sea, eventually

[Verse 2]
Was an Indian, brave, too, before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior Indian chief
Many moons passed, and the dream grew strong
'Til tomorrow, he would sing his first war song
Fought his first battle, but somethin' went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

[Chorus 2]
And so, castles made of sand
Fall in the sea, eventually

[Break]
Take it, Johnny!

[Verse 3]
There was a young girl whose heart was a frown
She was crippled for life, and she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop livin', so she decided to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
To her legs she smiled, "You won't hurt me no more."
But then, a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
"Look a golden winged ship is passing my way!"
And it really didn't have to stop, it just kept on goin'

[Chorus 3]
And some castles made of sand
Sl-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-lipped in the sea, yeah, eventually

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
You jump in front of my car
When you know all the time
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a lil' pain
You say you just want me to take you for a ride

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante & Flea]
You're just like (crosstown traffic)
So hard to get through to you
(Crosstown traffic)
I need to run over you
(Crosstown traffic)
All you do is slow me down
Tryin' to get on the other side of town

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
Tire tracks all across your back
I can see you had your fun
But darling, can't you see my signals turn from green to red?
And with you, I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante & Flea]
You're just like (crosstown traffic)
So hard to get through to you
(Crosstown traffic)
I need to run over you
(Crosstown traffic)
All you do is slow me down
Tryin' to get on the other side of town

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante & Flea]
You're just like (crosstown traffic)
Well, aw yeah (crosstown traffic)
Aye, aye, aye, be easy on 'em (crosstown traffic)
Aye, aye, don't fuck 'em up (crosstown traffic)
(Crosstown traffic) Well, aw yeah
(Crosstown traffic) All I need is to run over you
(Crosstown traffic) One more time for the band in blue

[Verse 1]
I am just a lousy bum
Searching for the unknown crumb
The crumb, the crumb
Something or someone to come
Come along illuminate my lust
Combust
Confucius might have been confused
And Buddha might have blown a fuse
I ooze the muse

[Chorus]
Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Freak the cheek on your hot spot

[Verse 2]
Back and forth my body's jerking
Will to thrill will not stop working
Work and work
I'll take you on a honeymoon
Jumping on a bed in a hotel room
The room, the groom

[Chorus]
Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Freak the cheek on your hot spot

[Chorus]
Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Freak the cheek on your hot spot

[Chorus 1]
I am you are me
I am you are me, who
I am you are me
I am you are me
Good woman said you've got to believe
Submerge into the urge of we
Deliciously the mystery
The mystery

[Chorus 2]
One big mob (oh yeah, oh yeah)
One big mob (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Ek bara mala (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Ek bara mala (oh yeah, oh yeah)
One big mob is...

[Verse 1]
Ooze into into my noodle
East or west shepherd or poodle
Ladybug pine tree to mingle with the bumblebee
A lover to the sun and a brother to the cool breeze
One big mob is...

[Chorus 2]
One big mob (oh yeah, oh yeah)
One big mob (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Ek bara mala (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Ek bara mala (oh yeah, oh yeah)
One big mob is...

[Verse 3]
We live in the city, we live in the jungle
It's time to be drinking, a thimble humble
Everything you ever see is never more than you and me
Give it on in to the beauty of the mystery
One big mob is home

[Bridge 1]
One big mob in one big home
A broken home
I'd like to share some air with you
Some air with you
A morning forest full of truths
The green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives
To give and give

[Bridge 2]
What was I thinking in my head
The color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread
Something I said
Checkmated by frustration, I
Need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost
A sullen cost

[Chorus 1]
I am you are me
I am you are me, who
I am you are me
I am you are me
Good woman said you've got to believe
Submerge into the urge of we
Deliciously the mystery
The mystery

[Chorus 2]
One big mob (oh yeah, oh yeah)
One big mob (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Ek bara mala (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Ek bara mala (oh yeah, oh yeah)
One big mob is...

[Verse 3]
Scrawled upon the wall of a bathroom stall
A stranger wrote a note that spoke to all
One, two, buckle my shoe
Take care of me 'cause I might be you
One big mob is...

[Verse 5]
Peek-a-boo street in Timbuktu
Do I need to repeat that a boy named Sue
Rocking to the beat of the kangaroo
Let me kiss your feet and forehead too
One big mob is...

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
I was riding, riding on my bike
Me with my friend, we're so alike

[Refrain]
Am I all alone?

[Verse 2]
She said all we have is this
We just had to stop and share a kiss

[Refrain]
Am I all alone?

[Pre-Chorus]
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it
If I chase it, I might waste it, come and spin it

[Refrain]
Am I all alone?
Am I all alone?

[Chorus]
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire

[Verse 3]
Close your eyes and click your heels
Can you believe how good it feels?

[Refrain]
Am I all alone?

[Pre-Chorus]
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it
If I chase it, I might waste it, come and spin it

[Refrain]
Am I all alone?
Am I all alone?

[Chorus]
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire

[Bridge 1]
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your mama, pay your father, take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your father, pay your father, take a bow

[Bridge 2]
Three pounds of love inside my skull
A million more lives, it's never dull
Just a few times spun, spun around the sun
A couple more or less and then we're done

[Chorus]
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Or maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire

[Verse 1]
I was not created in the likeness of a fraud
Your hell is something scary, I prefer a loving God
We are not the center of this funny universe
And what is worse, I do not serve in fear of such a curse

[Verse 2]
Shallow be thy game, 2000 years look in the mirror
You play the game of shame and tell your people live in fear
A rival to the way you see, the Bible let him be
I'm a threat to your survival and your control company

[Chorus]
You'll never burn me, you'll never burn me
I will be your heretic, yeah
You can't contain me, I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody

[Verse 3]
To anyone who's listening, you're not born into sin
The guilt they try and give you, puke it in the nearest bin
Missionary madness, sweep up culture with a broom
Trashing ancient ways is par for the course, it's fuckin' rude

[Verse 4]
To think that you're above the laws of nature, what a joke, oh
Purple sashes, feeding masses, smoke on which to choke
I might be a monkey when it comes to being holy
Fundamental hatred, get down on your knees and-

[Chorus]
You'll never burn me, you'll never burn me
I will be your heretic, yeah
You can't contain me, I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I was not created in the likeness of a fraud
Your hell is something scary, I prefer a loving God
We are not the center of this funny universe
And what is worse, I do not serve in fear of such a

[Chorus]
You'll never burn me, you'll never burn me
I will be your heretic, yeah
You can't contain me, I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody
You'll never burn me, you'll never burn me
I will be your heretic, yeah
You can't contain me, I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody

[Verse 1]
You are my God, you are my dog
You kept me close, love never lost
I called you hippie, you said fuck off
Said your brother's a real punk rocker

[Chorus]
Something's going to happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me, Lord, over the moon

[Verse 2]
Friends near death, you gave respect
Sympathetic intellect
Choices are for one and all
All we are is leaves that fall
That's all

[Bridge 1]
Always be loving you
Now I'm away from you
Always be loving you

[Verse 3]
'Round and 'round inside your head
Smartest fucker I ever met
Vicious fish bit at your toes
Made you lie and numb your soul

[Chorus]
Something's going to happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me, Lord, over the moon

[Verse 4]
Mule donkey ass you bore the load
Of all creation's tortured souls
Choices are for one and all
All we are are leaves that fall

[Interlude]
Like no other, I love you, you're my brother
Like no other, I love you, you're my brother
Like no other, I love you, you're my brother
Like no other, I love you, you're my brother
Like no other, I love you, you're my brother
Like no other, I love you, you're my brother

[Bridge 2]
Water flowing and I will drink it
I will drink for you
A part of me left that only you knew
Will never be understood
Will never be understood

[Outro 1]
Hey, gone to stay
Entire lifetime flash before me
In a loving stream
Hey, mother may
Have lost a child but she gave birth
To a loving stream
Oh, never know
When the gods will come and take you
To a loving stream
Oh, heart of gold
The most special things you gave me
Were from your loving stream
In a loving stream

[Outro 2]
Fuck the magazines
Fuck the green machine
See the human being
In a loving stream
Fuck the legal greed
Fuck the nothing scene
See the family
In a loving stream

[Chorus 1]
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?

[Verse 1]
I'll walk a water mile
Rest a while to kiss your smile
Laugh and roll and after a while
I'll begin to like your style

[Chorus 2]
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?
She turned me down this time
She turned me down
Lord, I can't believe she
She turned me down
She turned me inside out
She turned me down
All I ask of you
Is turn me up this time

[Chorus 1]
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?

[Verse 2]
Come on over show me your
Your glow soul I do adore
I'll be sure to drop my guard
Give it up it's not that hard

[Chorus 2]
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?
She turned me down this time
She turned me down
Lord, I can't believe she
She turned me down
She turned me inside out
She turned me down
All I ask of you
Is turn me up this time

[Chorus 1]
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?

[Verse 3]
Tested life but that's alright
Darker than the darkest night
Living hell and pollocks at you
Getting new down your back

[Chorus 1]
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?

[Verse 1]
Please start dirty
It’s 7:30
Loss of mind and
Cat alertly
My best, your rest
Send your call
And then I nest
Perversity in features
Adversity that teaches
Some call love more
Soon I’ll call the rhythm song

[Chorus]
It’s over
It’s over now
So long to doo-doo-ra
It’s over
It’s over now
I dare not get a look

[Post-Chorus 1]
Be yourself
Some let her call
Never fall
See yourself
Sit alone and wait
To my own call

[Verse 2]
Go ballistic
Anarchistic
Smack my mouth and
Then you kissed it
So long, my gun
Simple run and
Letter bum
Things are looking good on paper
Once when I was in your favor
This kiss from a mess
Send my girl riddle less

[Chorus]
It’s over
It’s over now
So long to doo-doo-ra
It’s over
It’s over now
I dare not get a look

[Post-Chorus 2]
See yourself
Sad, alone and wait
To my own brawl
Free yourself
There’s an only count
This stands for all of them

[Bridge]
Just play at any tempo
Going mad and going mental
All balm, said no
Just to let him put it wrong

[Chorus]
It’s over
It’s over now
So long to doo-doo-ra
It’s over
It’s over now
I dare not get a look

[Pre-Chorus]
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance

[Chorus 1]
One reason why I got you for
A woman is that you can do the moveable
Kitchen or bedroom or bathroom floor
Keep it moving because I need the hardcore

[Pre-Chorus]
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance

[Chorus 2]
Soft, she's off and left
Now I'm coming
I'm feeling in the ghetto because that's my trouble

[Pre-Chorus]
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance

[Verse 1]
Another reason why I love your ass
Your dancing like everyday could be your last
Do you, do you, do you want to dance
Lets get it on like black trash

[Pre-Chorus]
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance

[Chorus 2]
Soft, she's off and left
Now I'm coming
I'm feeling in the ghetto because that's my trouble

[Verse 2]
I met her on the school yard and
She was such a cool card
She took me for a fool
Because I acted like a bodyguard
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She was just the cutest thing
My God, that I have ever seen
Tearing up my seratonin
Messing with my dopamine
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
Just about the time
That I was feeling smart again
She walked into the room
Wearing nothing but a cardigan
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She knew what she was doing
When she told me no she would
Never let the perfect message
In and get the perfect screwing
Oh Yohanna love, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
Do a fat dance, do a fat dance
Do a, do a, do a fat dance

[Bridge]
Number three reasons why I'm in your house
Hot butter melts across your mouth
Dancing and a dancing, And a dancing machine
Somebody move, Somebody scream
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
One reason why I got you for
A woman is that you can do the moveable
Kitchen or bedroom or bathroom floor
Keep it moving because I need the hardcore

[Verse 1]
I was walking through a courtyard
Without shoes and without regard
Automatic catacombs
Take me where I wanna go

[Pre-Chorus]
All around, all in phases
It astounds and amazes
Built to last and known to roam
Touch me on my chromosome

[Chorus 1]
One time
Fascinated by the face of time
One time
I got it to give and now we're going to make some time

[Chorus 2]
Ultra-fine and altruistic
Can I spy into the mystic
System's down for infiltration
Open mind free of frustration

[Verse 2]
I was driving to a safe place
And arriving as I retraced
Yell into a telescope
Aim it at the star of hope

[Chorus 1]
One time
Fascinated by the face of time
One time
I got it to give and now we're going to make some time

[Post-Chorus]
All over the under
The smell of blood and thunder
I'm connected by the lightning rod, giving the beauty to it
Heaven knows how well I know you

[Chorus 2]
Ultra-fine and altruistic
Can I spy into the mystic
System's down for infiltration
Open mind free of frustration

[Pre-Chorus]
All around, all in phases
It astounds and amazes
Built to last and known to roam
Touch me on my chromosome

[Chorus 1]
One time
Fascinated by the face of time
One time
I got it to give and now we're going to make some time

[Post-Chorus]
All over the under
The smell of blood and thunder
I'm connected by the lightning rod, giving the beauty to it
Heaven knows how well I know you

[Outro]
Time
Time
Time
Time
Time
Time

[Verse 1]
Walking around all over town
Walking it out, when you want to
Soldiering, my style is smiling
Turn it in, do whatever I choose and
Take me now, to the water

[Chorus]
Don't be late, I hear it's gonna be so very great and
Out the door I'm walking like a runaway
All the reasons that I count up you can't haul away and
More and more, I'm a-walking like a runaway

[Verse 2]
Kick it around, stare at the ground
Breaking it down, when you want to
Soldiering my days I've chosen
Dance around, do whatever I want to
Take me now, it's the water

[Chorus]
Don't be late, I hear it's gonna be so very great and
Out the door I'm walking like a runaway
All the reasons that I count up you can't haul away and
More and more, I'm a-walking like a runaway

[Bridge]
I think I know everything you're gonna say, hey oh
I think you know why I wanna run away

[Chorus]
Don't be late, I hear it's gonna be so very great and
Out the door I'm walking like a runaway
All the reasons that I count up you can't haul away and
More and more, I'm a-walking like a runaway

[Outro]
All the reasons that I count up you can't haul away and
More and more, I'm a-walking like a runaway
More and more, I'm a-walking like a runaway
Out the door, I'm a-walking like a runaway

[Verse 1]
Here she comes in a suit and tie
Shepard's bush and a leopard's pie
She's marching to the funky beat of
James Brown and his dancing feet
Gonna set your fish on fire
Pistol whipping of desire
So please do not resist your fate
I'll pick you up, yes it's a date

[Pre-Chorus 1]
How could I forget to mention
The bicycle is a good invention
Sitting there in a silent movie
Beside the only girl who really ever knew me
Happy days, but sad I'm facing
Heaven knows that I'm on the case, oh
How could I forget to mention the bicycle?

[Chorus]
Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl, I heard it first
The beauty of your verse

[Verse 2]
A sticky finger and a wicked taste
Got a lot of love and a lyrical case
Be sure to write it in your book
I promise not to look
Want to smell your sunny face, a
Funny place but it's never a waste
I'd hop this fence to make amends
I hope this movie never ends

[Pre-Chorus 2]
How could I forget to mention
The bicycle is a good invention
Make it up, making you my business
A funny buttercup but I lend her forgiveness
Happy days, but sad I'm facing
Heaven knows that I'm on the case, oh
How could I forget to mention the bicycle?

[Chorus]
Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl, I heard it first
The beauty of your verse
Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl, I heard it first
The beauty of your verse

[Verse 1]
Everything you ever told me could have been a lie
We may never have been in love
Stuck on thinking that there is always something to lose
Or a hit from above
Or a hit from above
I don't need what I'm holding
What I'm holding on, I wish I didn't know

[Pre-Chorus]
But meanwhile...

[Chorus]
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
Expectation is taking its toll
'Cause everything you ever told me could have been a lie
We may never have been in love

[Verse 2]
And then I would escape
I'll never, ever have to see another disappointed face
No one to please
Every now and then, it feels like
In all of the universe, there is nobody for me
I told myself I wouldn't care, no I wouldn't care
But when she said she'd come 'round
I combed my hair, yes, I checked my hair

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and meanwhile, meanwhile, meanwhile...

[Chorus]
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
Fluctuation does make me feel old
Expectation is taking its toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul

[Verse 1]
But don't remind me of home
There's everywhere I'd rather go
It's true that some things have to change
Oh no

[Verse 2]
And don't remind me of home
Or I might notice where I am
It's true that some things
Have to change
I know some things have to change
It's true that some things have to change
I know some things have to change
Oh no

[Verse 3]
I'm gazing out the window
As I ascend into the sky
But I'm the one who's left behind
I'm the one who's left behind
There is nothing that is safe
I know some things have to change
Oh yeah, I do
Yeah, I do

[Verse 4]
But don't remind me of home
In case it isn't quite the same

[Verse 1]
One day while bathing in the sea
My talking dolphin spoke to me
He spoke to me in symphony
From freedom's peace beneath the sea

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He looked to me eyes full of love
Said, "Yes, we live behind the sun"

[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Behind the sun

[Chorus 2]
The sun goes up and the sun gets down
But like the heart of the sun, my heart continues to pound

[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun

[Verse 2]
Now while I shower in the rain
I watch my dolphin swim away
The one who listens to the surf
Can feel the pulse beat of the earth

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And like my dolphin swims so free
The sun does swim into the sea

[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Behind the sun (hahahaha)
Behind the sun

[Verse 3]
An island flying through the sky
One day your son might ask you why
And if your son should be a girl
She too might ask you of this world

[Pre-Chorus 3]
The sun shines sweet upon your beach
And yes my dolphin loves to teach

[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Behind the sun

[Chorus 2]
The sun goes up and the sun gets down
But like the heart of the sun, my heart continues to pound

[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun

[Outro]
Wow

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Because I'm happy to be sad
I want it all, I want it bad
Ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh, it's what I know
A vintage year for pop I hear, the middle of the end is near
Let's go, oh-oh-oh-oh
It's what I know

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
Torture me and torture me
Forcing me and so torture me, please
(Oh, no, my Lord)
Torture me with sorcery
(Oh, no, my time)
Forcing me, so torture me, please
(Whoa)

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go, oh-oh-oh-oh
It's what I know

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
Torture me and torture me
It's forcing me and so torture me, please
(Oh, no, my Lord)
Torture me with sorcery
(Oh, no, my time)
Forcing me, so torture me, please

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
The will of God is standing still
Brazilian children get their fill, let's go
Let's turn it up and dumb it down
The vision of your ultra sound is so—
But all the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around, let's go
A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near, it's so—
(Oh!)

[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(Oh, no, my Lord)
Torture me and torture me
(Oh, no, my time)
It's forcing me, so torture me, please
(Oh, no, my Lord)
Torture me with sorcery
(Oh, no, my time, baby)
Forcing me, so torture me, please
(Oh, no, my Lord)
Torture me and torture me
(Oh, no, my time)
It's forcing me and so torture me, please
(Oh, no, my Lord)
Torture me with sorcery
(Oh, no, my time)
Forcing me, so torture me, please

[Verse 1]
Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off (pay him off)

[Verse 2]
God knows when but you're doing it again
You better duck down the alleyway looking for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap by the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills; you only got ten, so look out kid

[Chorus]
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep it all hid, look out

[Verse 3]
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talking at the heat put plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May orders from the DA
This place called LA

[Verse 4]
Walk on your tip toes, don't try "no doz"
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes
'Cause you don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows, look out kid

[Chorus]
Look out, kid, it's somethin' that you did
Look out, kid, cause they keep all hid, look out

[Bridge]
Looks to me like you did
A little to much hitting kid
You should've took it to the bridge
Before you started to skid, look out, kid
The good god willing, we'll bebop to Bob Dylan
Chillin' 'em, thrillin' 'em, and red hot killin' 'em

[Interlude]
Killin' 'em
Said killin' 'em
C'mon, c'mon

[Verse 5]
Get sick, get well, hand around a ink well
Ring a bell, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army if you fail

[Verse 6]
But users, cheaters, and the six time losers
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parking meters, look out kid

[Chorus]
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid, look out

[Verse 1]
Well, my landlady, she lives
Three houses away
And she claims that she can hear my baby screaming to me
"Fuck me Anthony, well Anthony"

[Chorus]
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Struck by lust in a telephone booth
Busted by a cop, he said "That's uncouth"
He said that she can hear my baby screaming to me
"Fuck me Anthony, well Anthony"

[Chorus]
I want to party on your pussy, baby
Well I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Break]
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy

[Bridge]
I want to party on your pussy, baby
Well I want to party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby, I want to party on your pussy
I want to party all over your pussy, I want to party on your pussy

[Interlude]
Let me shine your diamond
The girl got a scratch
Slap that cat
Have mercy

[Chorus]
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Warlocks in wonderland
I've gotta megatropolis in my hand
And a subterranean marching band
Makin' noise for the boys in the Vatican
And a— A little package and off we go
Oh, ticky-ticky, tackita, tic-tac-toe
I know everybody's Eskimo
We've got another thing coming and that's our show, well

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for—
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Lilacs and contraband
I've got Santa Monica in my hand
A little Beatlemania when I can
I've got two big bags of old Japan, oh
Ring side and blow-by-blow
Another main event at the old rainbow
We're comin' right on top of the tupelo
When she looks just like Brigitte Bardot

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for—
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Make a deal with Uncle Weezer, sign your name to claim
Chi— China Chow will try to please her
Sweetness came from Jane

[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
Warlocks in wonderland
I've gotta Rockapotomus in my hand
With a happy ending that's made of sand
With a little bit of lovin', is all I can

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for—
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for—
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in now

[Verse 1]
She's a witch, a brat, a bonafide bore
What's more, she snores, and that is a fact
Cow eyes lie, yes it's time to resist
How did I ever get into this?
How could I ever have kissed that bitch?
So what if she has got big tits

[Chorus]
She's the kinda girl who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who won't just let things sit

[Verse 2]
She came like a cat like a cat to catnip
She came in my lap with her womanly hips
When I first met her I came unglued
When I played the part of the blue-blooded fool
I'm through with your sewage, I'm through with your trash
I always knew that I'd get the last laugh

[Chorus]
She's the kinda girl who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who won't just let things sit

[Verse 3]
Like two trains on one track are bound for a crash
Two red white and blues we were destined to clash
I can't fix the future, I can't change the past
Like flyby night news we were not meant to last
I'm through with your bluefish, I'm through with your gash
I'm through being screwed with by you and your wack attack

[Bridge]
Jump back for chump love, you won't be back for cover
But no no no no, I'm no chump love sucker
No chump love sucker, no chump love sucker
No chump love sucker, no chump love sucker
No chump love sucker!

[Verse 5]
I thought that your love was a matter of fact
But I lost my pride when I realized that
The smack in my bag and my baseball bat
Was all you were after you dirty rat
A bitch and a brat and a living disaster
She thought she was fast, boys, but I was faster

[Outro]
No chump love sucker, no chump love sucker
No chump love sucker, no chump love sucker
No chump love sucker, no chump love sucker
No chump love sucker, no chump love sucker

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Everything inside of me is burning up for you to see
And if we should get into it, a two way kind of syndicate
Hold me
Compare us to a Ferris wheel, just be sure what you want to steal
Some people do it by the book, but I prefer to go by feel
Tell me

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
I wanted to get out of here, but every time I reappear
Now, I have the words, my dear, to whisper right into your ear
Hey, yeah!

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(Oh) C'mon, girl, let's get it right
(Let's go!) Let's get it right, let's get it right
(Oh) C'mon, girl, let's get it right
(Let's go!) Let's get it right, let's get it right
(Oh) C'mon, girl, let's get it right
(Let's go!) Let's get it right, let's get it right
(Oh) C'mon, girl, let's get it right
(Let's go!) Let's get it right, let's get it right

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
The spirit of a dragon's tear is lovely at this time of year
The cave within your mountainside is deeper than it'll be wide
Hold me
My disenchanted diplomat, asleep inside the laundromat
Conveyer belts are moving and I want you to be sure of that
Tell me

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
And if you let it germinate, I know it will be worth the wait
Disputed by the news, that it was you who tried to instigate
Hey, yeah!

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(Oh) C'mon, girl, let's get it right
(Let's go!) Let's get it right, let's get it right
(Oh) C'mon, girl, let's get it right
(Let's go!) Let's get it right, let's get it right
(Oh) C'mon, girl, let's get it right
(Let's go!) Let's get it right, let's get it right
(Oh) C'mon, girl, let's get it right
(Let's go!) Let's get it right, let's get it right

[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Blessed are the hypocrites outwitted, but she never quits
The trouble with a band of slits is washing off the muddy bits
Hey, yeah!

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(Oh) C'mon, girl, let's get it right
(Let's go!) Let's get it right, let's get it right
(Oh) C'mon, girl, let's get it right
(Let's go!) Let's get it right, let's get it right
(Oh) C'mon, girl, let's get it right
(Let's go!) Let's get it right, let's get it right
(Oh) C'mon, girl, let's get it right
(Let's go!) Let's get it right, let's get it right

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
Oh, yeah!
She's with me and I'm your man
If I can't find you, no one can
(Whoa!)
Haha-haha-haha-haha-haha-haha

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm walkin' on down the road
But it can't be heaven 'cause the streets aren't gold
And everybody knows what Bobby D was told
I'm walkin' on down the road

[Verse 2]
Crooning a tune straight out of the womb
'Cause trust is a must to be a true blue dude
That's a matter of fact, don't be confused
Everybody knows true friends are few

[Chorus]
Everybody come and everybody sing, sing my song
Everybody knows and everybody thinks that I've done wrong
Everybody come and everybody sing, sing my song

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm walkin' on down the road
But it can't be heaven 'cause the streets aren't gold
And everybody knows what Bobby D was told
I'm walkin' on down the road

[Verse 3]
Like a mama bear hugs her baby bear cubs
A dude, he can't lose when he lives on love
Like the bark on a tree, like the skin on my knee
I'm standing by my blood

[Chorus]
Everybody come and everybody sing, sing my song
Everybody knows and everybody thinks that I've done wrong
Everybody come and everybody sing, sing my song

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Everybody come and everybody sing, sing my song
Everybody knows and everybody thinks that I've done wrong
Everybody come and everybody sing, sing my song

[Outro]
Well, I'm walkin' on down the road
But it can't be heaven 'cause the streets aren't gold
And everybody knows what Bobby D was told
I'm walkin' on down the road
I'm walkin' on down the road
I'm walkin' on down the road

[Intro: Anthony Kiedis]
Three, four

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Hustle, bustle and so much muscle, oh
Cells about to separate
And I find it hard to concentrate, and
Temporary this cash and carry
I'm stepping up to indicate
The time has come to deviate, and

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
All I want is for you to be happy, and
Take this moment to make you my family, and
Finally, you have found something perfect, and
Finally, you have found—

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Death-defying, this mess I'm buying
It's raining down with love and hate
And I find it hard to motivate, and
Estuary is blessed, but scary
Your heart's about to palpitate
And I'm not about to hesitate, and

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
One to treasure the rest of your days here, and
Give you pleasure in so many ways, dear, and
Finally, you have found something perfect
And, finally, you have found—
(Here we go)

[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Do you want me to show up for duty?
And, serve this woman and honor her beauty?
And, finally, you have found something perfect
And, finally, you have found...

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
...yourself with me
Will you agree to take this man into your world?
And, now, we are as one

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
My lone ranger
The heat exchanger is living in this figure eight
And I'll do my best to recreate, and
Sweet precision and soft collision, aw
Hearts about to palpitate
And I find it hard to separate, and

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
All I want is for you to be happy, and
Take this woman and make you my family, and
Finally, you have found someone perfect, and
Finally, you have found—

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
All I want is for you to be happy, and
Take this woman and make you my family, and
Finally, you have found someone perfect, and
Finally, you have found yourself

[Verse 1]
My love comes, and when it does
It's a crazy kind of
Selective affection
My love flows like a wise guy's tie
In the zaniest of directions
My love protection, my love erection
You better get some of my infection
My love can be a-bigger than
The Hoover Dam
My love can hide behind
A grain of sand
My love for life is fuelled by
The love for my band
I love his mother and
The silly mixed-up man
Some people think he's bad
They say he doesn't laugh
And ask my dad

[Verse 2]
My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is deepest depth, the ocean blues
My love is the Zulu groove
My love is coop-a-loop move, my love is lightning's blues
My love is the pussy juice, my love can't be refused
My love is gettin' skin on my flute
My love, my love

[Verse 3]
My love began from love
My love for an unknown grubby bum
My love for the baby suckin' on his thumb
My love for the best set of buns
My love for the feel of the drums
My love for a bunch of knuckleheads
My love for the sweet smell of bread
My love for the legs that I spread
My love for the fat natty dread
My love, my love

[Outro]
My love is my toes in the sand
My love is my dick in my hand
My love is my dope in the van
My love is my dick in your pants
Yeah!
Oh oh oh oh ohhhhhh

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
All the creatures on the beaches
Making waves in a motion picture
Won't you keep this in between us?
Search and seizure; wake up, Venus!
The dollar bill will mentally ill bill
Mom and dad, take your don't-be-sad pill
Turn the screw and twist my language
Don't forsake me, I'm contagious

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
There's a reason for the 21st century
Not too sure, but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be
Come on (Ooh!)

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
It's my favorite combination
A—Coming down with the favored nations
Deep rotation, mutilation
A—Learn to give and take dictation

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Like Cain and Abel
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Uh, time to run this table

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
There's a reason for the 21st century
Not too sure, but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Read me your scripture now
Read me your scripture
Read me your scripture and I will twist it
Show me your wrist, and I—
Show me your wrist, and—
Show me your wrist and I'll kiss it, kiss it

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Like Cain and Abel
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
It's time to run this table

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
Simple soldier, hand it over
Stop and read what you just wrote her
Strangulation, altercation
Oral sex and bird migration

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
There's a reason for the 21st century
Not too sure, but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be (C'mon!)
(Ah-aah) There's a reason for the 21st century
(Ah-aah) Not too sure, but I know that it's meant to be (Ah-aah)
And that it's meant to be (Ah-aah)

[Guitar Solo Outro: John Frusciante]

[Outro]
Yeah!
Can you dig it, can you dig it?

[Verse 1]
Welcome friends to my thoughts of when
The fax city 4 were four young men
Time has come, now we jam
With the uplift mofo party plan
We're the organic anti-beat box band

[Verse 2]
One comes from the holy land
Another was born an Australian
Me I'm from Michigan
But Hollywood is the land of lands
It's a Hollywood jam

[Chorus 1]
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
We represent the Hollywood jam
Organic anti-beat box band

[Verse 3]
Life is grand in the land of lands
The mind does boggle, the mind expands
The Anarchy Four have manned their craft
Get on your knees and shake your ass
To the jam, that is (that's right)

[Verse 4]
We don't ask we demand
That you and your clan
Listen now to this jam
To the power of the drummer 'cause the drummer is bad
It's a Hollywood jam
Let's rock!

[Chorus 1]
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
We represent the Hollywood jam
Organic anti-beat box band
(It's a jam)

[Verse 5]
There's a party in my town at twelve o'clock
There's a party that's rocking down to the rock
I've got nothing against hip hop
But there's a party in my town and no beat box
Jam, that is

[Verse 6]
The party's got girls the girls got hot
The party's got boys and the boys got socks
Something popped, the doors unlocked
The house got up ran around the block
Sit down house, take off your blouse

[Chorus 2]
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
Very good friend of the lollipop kids
Over the rainbow with the wiz
We represent the Hollywood jam
Organic anti-beat box band

[Outro]
We're the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam dance that is
We're the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam dance that is
We're the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam dance that is
We're the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam dance that is
We're the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam dance that is
We're the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam dance that is
We're the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam dance that is
We're the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam dance that is
We're the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam dance that is
It's a Hollywood jam
(Encore!)

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Looks to me like heaven sent no lullaby kid, no five percent
Any way you wanna cut that cake, she's dyin' from the likes of abandonment

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Lost in the valley without my horses
She needs somebody to hold

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
It looked to me like heaven sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right
Who's gonna take you home and hold you when things aren't so bright?
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
It's a long walk down those tracks, it's a dirty walk in, it's a dirty walk back
Gonna learn a-way too much shootin' dope in the back of a Cadillac, Jack

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Slow down the road to my back 40
She needs somebody to hold

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
It looked to me like heaven sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right
Who's gonna take you home and hold you when things aren't so bright?
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
Down in the South Seas, give me your mouth, please
Resuscitation is the way I found these
(Aah) I give you major, you give me minor
Don't fade away like an ocean liner now

[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Lost in the valley without my horses
No one can tell me what my remorse is
God made this lady that stands before me
She needs somebody to hold

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
She shows the world up with a smile and then she throws the fight
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right
Down on the bathroom floor, she's searching for another light
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
She looked to me like heaven sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right
Who's gonna take you home and hold you when things aren't so bright?
She looks to me, she looks to me

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
I've got a cousin making beats deep down in Arizona
We're gonna rocket to Ramones in the city of Pomona
Go!

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(Oh) And if I give to you my second sight
You got it!
(Oh) And if I stay the course, I'll stay the night
Come get it!

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Readymade, readymade
Baby, ought celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
I've got a sister making babies with a Black and Decker blow torch
We're gonna fop it all night in the middle of the back porch
Yeah!

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Readymade, readymade
Baby oughta celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(Oh) And if I give to you my second sight
You got it!
(Oh) And if I stay the course, I'll stay the night
Come get it!
(Oh, clean it up, Johnny!)

[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]

[Instrumental Break: Anthony Kiedis]

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Readymade, readymade
Rockin' for the sake of slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen, but don't be afraid

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
I've got a brother making trouble in the state of Caledonia
I wish I knew another way, but I'm gonna have to clone ya'
Hey!

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Readymade, readymade
Rockin' for the sake of slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen, but don't be afraid

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(Oh) And if I give to you my second sight
You got it!
(Oh) And if I stay the course, I'll stay the night
Come get it!

[Verse 1]
It's always half and half
I'm happy and I'm sad
Everything that's beautiful
Always kills me too
The highest I get up
Is the deepest I get down
You're up there with your life
That's why I got to shout, shout and then got to shout, shout

[Chorus]
Blues for Meister, you sweet little thing
Blues for Meister, I'm so sad I gotta sing
A cozy little kitty up sitting on the couch
Oh, kitty cat, oh, baby, I really miss you now
Well have some respect for my cat
He got squashed by the wheel of a Cadillac
Well, me and my pussy, we lost our flow
Well, goodbye my little calico

[Verse 2]
Your food's still in the cupboard
Hanging in its can
You used to love to eat it
Down
I'll always love you Meister
You were so good to me
There's nothing like you nowhere
As far as I can see

[Chorus]
Blues for Meister, you sweet little thing
Blues for Meister, I'm so sad I gotta sing
A cozy little kitty up sitting on the couch
Oh, kitty cat, oh, baby, I really miss you now
Well have some respect for my cat
He got squashed by the wheel of a Cadillac
Well, me and my pussy, we lost our flow
Well, goodbye my little calico

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
And if I had a clue, I'd know exactly what to do
If I were the wiser of the two
And if I saw it all so clear, I'd write it down and bend your ear
If I were the clearer of the two

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
We could take a walk into the canyons of 5th Avenue
Sing and dance, just to name a few

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
All I do
All I do

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
And if I heard the angels sing, I'd sing it back to you
And bring sound of heaven ringing just for you
And if I saw the sun fall down, I'd pick it up and make a crown
One that was a perfect fit for you

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
We could take a walk into the apple orchard by the school
We could make a little residue
We could find a place to stay, a secret little hideaway
Spend a little time inside of you

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
All I do
All I do

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante, John Frusciante]
All eyes
All eyes
All eyes on you (Eh, he-he-he-hey)

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante, John Frusciante]
All I do (He-he-he-hey)
All I do
All I do (He-he-he-hey)
All I do

[Verse 1]
All of my love and most of my fears
Been coming on strong for most of my
Years add up and end up in a song
Cellophane tweeds and revenue streams
Are blocking my shots and killin' my
Dreams that showed me how to be the cause

[Interlude]
Ooh ahh, yella
Ooh ahh, hey, ah, what now?

[Chorus]
It's the lifetime of a strange man, that's right
It's a long time, for me, I see
She wants to belong and I want to be free
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee

[Interlude]
Ooh ahh, yella, ooh ahh, yeah

[Verse 2]
All of my friends and enemies, they
Were part of this dance that put me right
Here we go, so glad I got this chance
Better known plans and lesser known schemes
Were all about love and less about
Me, I'd have to say she wore the pants
That's, oh!

[Chorus]
It's the lifetime of a strange man, that's right
It's a long time, for me, uh-huh
She wants to belong and I want to be free
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee

[Instrumental Bridge with Vocalizations]

[Chorus]
It's the lifetime of a strange man, that's right
It's a long time, for me, let's see
She wants to belong and I want to be free
Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee

[Outro]
It's the lifetime of a strange man, that's me
It's a long time, for me, uh uh
She wants to be rich and I want to be free
Keep your plans elastic 'cause there ain't no guarantee

[Intro]
Smile when I'm shy in ways
But I love
Everything of first impressions
Sweet successions

[Verse 1]
Been around for quite a while
I see you kept it versatile
Motivated to combine
Even when it's bad, it's fine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Did she say something that made you cry?
Have you lost it all?
The big fall
Oh, so slowly, comes back holy

[Chorus]
Bishop takes a knight but I will put up quite a fight, oh
Here's your ham on rye
Elementary, the chemistry means everything to me
Long progression's why

[Verse 2]
Set it off to collect knowledge
Quit a job and go to college
All about the aftershock
Swedish Latin super funk

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Moses of Manhattan made it great
Pain we celebrate
And I love
The long progression, indiscretion

[Chorus]
Bishop takes a knight but I will put up quite a fight, oh
Here's your ham on rye
Elementary, the chemistry means everything to me
Long progression's why

[Post-Chorus]
In between the reasons are the psychedelic seasons, oh
Simple as your stride
Information intimated, elegant and integrated
Sweep your floors with pride

[Bridge]
Smile, 'cause it's all a ride
All supplied
And I love everything about this
Session and this long progression

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Bishop takes a knight but I will put up quite a fight, oh
Here's your ham on rye
Elementary, the chemistry means everything to me
Long progression's why

[Outro]
In between the reasons are the psychedelic seasons, oh
Simple as your stride
Elementary, the chemistry means everything to me
The long progression's why

[Intro: Chad Smith, Anthony Kiedis]
One, two
If I want to—

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
She's the one, she's the only one
She's got ripped back light, gonna make me come
I say, when I smile I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide like a country mile

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis]
I said, now I'll take it, it's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it, 'cause that's what we do

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
Pick a star in the open sky
I see you (Ah-ah) see me and that is why
I hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel (Ah-ah) your fire jump up to meet

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
I said, now I'll take it, it's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it, 'cause that's what we do

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Something out there, where love is your only friend, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better, and
Someone to spare when love is the only end, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better
(Oh, yeah!)

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
In a world that has run amok
I've got to set (Ah-ah) my sights just to get struck
I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched (Ah-ah) out mouth and a pack of style

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
I say, she's the one, she's the only one
Make me search (Ah-ah) myself until I'm done, and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea (Ah-ah) of stars make a diagram?
And—

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Something out there, where love is your only friend, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better, and
Someone to spare when love is the only end, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better

[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Oh, yeah!
Hey, yeah!
Hey!
(Oh, yeah!)

[Verse 4: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
So alive, I arrive on dust
You can search (Ah-ah) my mind for the red on rust
I said, take me there and she really cares
Lighten up (Ah-ah) for me, gonna hear my prayers
I said—

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Now, I'll take it, it's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it, 'cause that's what we do

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Something out there, where love is your only friend, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better, and
Someone to spare when love is the only end, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better now

[Intro]
(shouted) One, two...

[Verse 1]
Show me a sign that I love you
Blow me your mind cause you always do
Remind me to tell you that I've come to
Believe in the beauty that powers you
Woman dissolved into the sea
The body of water is calling me
The god of my daughter is always free
There's nothing to solve when you're solving me

[Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company
Ooh ooh ooh, body that's calling me
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company

[Verse 2]
Throw me a line I could use one
A special design because I'm your son
Two thousand below where I feel my love
The body of water where I come from

[Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company
Ooh ooh ooh, body that's calling me
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company

[Bridge]
I'm dreaming, got a reason to steal
Fire from the other side out there
Formations flow like streams
I'm made with a life to spare
Get the gist, Mr. Sism got a rhythm
Technology of a prayer
Scientist to the prism of faith
And hope so I am there
Oh

[Verse 4]
Baby I'm home, you can come here
The science of love is becoming clear
Invisible love with the color steel
A meet to a place in the atmosphere

[Chorus]
And I may believe
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company
Ooh ooh ooh, body that's calling me
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Next stop on the KLM
Two lips and a sturdy stem
A funny thing always happens when I get a heavy jam
I'm gonna turn it into hydrogen
I, I— I, I— I, I—
I, I, I, I, I—

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Cowgirl and a troubadour
MGM and the lion's roar
A straight shot to the corner store
I wanna show you what—
I wanna show you what your head is for
I, I— I, I— I, I—
I, I, I, I, I—

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
So much, I wish I could—
So many, I wish I would—
So much, I wish I could count on you not to deplete me
So much, I wish I could—
So many, I wish I would—
So much, I wish I could count on you not to defeat me

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Please, don't turn away again
Please, don't turn me into them
Please, don't turn away a friend
Please, don't turn me into them

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
Stand by for the great eclipse
Rip it out, now shake your hips
Backing off the apocalypse
I gotta loosen up—
I gotta loosen up to get my grip
I, I— I, I— I, I—
I, I, I, I, I—

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
So much, I wish I could—
So many, I wish I would—
So much, I wish I could count on you not to deplete me
So much, I wish I could—
So many, I wish I would—
So much, I wish I could count on you not to defeat me

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Please, don't turn away again
Please, don't turn me into them
Please, don't turn away a friend
Please, don't turn me into them
(What you wanna do about it?)
Please, don't turn away again
Please, don't turn me into them
(What you're going to give it now?)
(Oh, now)

[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
Whoooooooa!

[Verse 1]
Janey
You are my Victorian machinery
(Breathe yourself to life)
Lady
Your tender shape is bending like the scenery
(Ride you like a bike)

[Chorus 1]
You be the sail and baby I'll be the rudder
We could make it all day until it turns into butter
I saw your face
A seminal pleasure, I will love you forever
When I heeded your call and every heavy endeavor
I'll keep your place, woah!

[Verse 2]
Janey
Coming down the mountain like a buffalo
(Seeds deep in your eyes)
Crazy
But then again, a girl could like it rough you know
(Makes up for her size)

[Chorus 1]
You be the sail and baby I'll be the rudder
We could make it all day until it turns into butter
I saw your face
A seminal pleasure, I will feel you forever
When I heeded your call and every heavy endeavor
I'll keep your place

[Bridge]
Be yourself
When I saw you

[Chorus 2]
You be the shack and baby I'll be the desert
There is nothing to lack when there is nothing to measure
It's all, all space
Woah!

[Interlude]
You are my Victorian machinery
(Nah nah nah nah nah) woo!
Janey
Make a fist and knock me off the moon again
(Breathe yourself to life)

[Verse 3]
Lady
Make me feel like I was born in June again
(Ride me like a bike)
Crazy
Sing along just like they do in Budapest
(Hot moon on the rise)

[Outro]
You be the shack and baby I'll be the desert
There is nothing to lack when there is nothing to measure
It's all, all space

[Verse 1: Anthony with John Frusciante]
The curtain is open, a head to put dope in
Now we will come clean it
The future, we've seen it
No, no, I know— I said, no, no
It's like a dream that falls away
Into the night, where we can play
I'm on a train, one happy day
Two eyes for sight, three times I pray, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
Soda pop, we've got to set up shop
And when the weather comes, we've got a pressure drop
We don't know, but every day I go
To see what I can bring into a cameo
(Ooh) Oh-oh! Oh, no! Bah-da-ra-de-ro-pom

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
We believe
We believe
We believe (Climb a tree for monkey business)
(Write a check-out to forgiveness)
We believe (All the world on half an acre)
(Pushing dirt into a quaker)
Oh!

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante, Both]
The mission, the method
The downfall arrested
'Cuz it's not the first time, nor is it the worst time
No, no! Oh, no! Bah-da-ra-de-ro-pom (Uuh!)
To see the bird without a care
For in a word, it's nice out there
In a tree, my mama bear will be all right with proper care
(Hey) Hey, hey! Hey, oh! Bah-da-ra-de-ro-pom

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Ha! Mh— Yeah
Uh— Whoa!

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Boomerang into a bigger bang
A little cry of love, because they cannot sing
Cherokee, what did the pharaoh see?
Another time and space, another place to be

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with people]
We believe, we believe
We believe, we believe
We believe (Climb a tree for monkey business)
(Write a check-out to forgiveness)
We believe (All the world on half an acre)
(Pushing dirt into a quaker)
We believe (Climb a tree for monkey business)
(Write a check-out to forgiveness)
We believe (All the world on half an acre)
(Pushing dirt into a quaker)
Yeah

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
The motive, the measure
The purpose, the pleasure
The risk, is it worth it?
The disc, is it perfect?
I found you amongst them
The flower with young stem
Disparage, the broken
The marriage, eloping

[Verse 1]
Well, If I stall at all or hesitate
The world of always never seems to wait
A comedy that could be so divine
Never is a long time
A shadow born to steal the light of day
You woke me up and said, "come on, let’s play"
Well now I know this never has its way

[Chorus]
You are, you are, the star I say
From far, from far, from far away
The laws that cause it all to stay
By you, by you, by you, by you, for you, I do

[Verse 2]
I thought I'd done it all, I thought I knew
But nothing ever looked as clear as you
Now every never that I knew was fine
But never is a long time
Now I share this feeling with my dad
Stolen goods aren't always half that bad
A never that will always

[Chorus]
You are, you are, the star I say
From far, from far, from far away
The law that caused it all to stay
By you, by you, by you, by you

[Bridge]
The faded piping on your dress
Will always have its place, I guess
By you, by you
A common love that we can bless
The pleasure of my child’s best
Golden Books and tenderness
Have rescued me from emptiness

[Outro]
You are, you are, the star I say
From far, from far, from far away
The laws that cause it all to stay
You are, you are, the star I say
From far, from far, from far away
The laws that cause it all
It all, it all, it all, it all, it all to stay

[Verse 1]
Sat on a cliff, wondering, "What did I miss?"
I watched the waves come in
Roll in, roll out
Without a single doubt

[Verse 2]
Lone on a bluff, is there ever enough?
I stare into the air
Somewhere out there
The family affair

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Bring home the night

[Chorus]
Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me the love of my life

[Post-Chorus]
She gave me the love

[Verse 2]
Coming up short and I’m sad to report
We fuss and fight tonight
Your case, my case
Another day to waste
Lovers don’t mix when they can’t even fix
A plot that has a twist
To share my prayer
I need my baby Bear

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Come home tonight, woah!

[Chorus]
Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me the love of my life
Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me the love of my life

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude]
(Love of your life)
(Love of your life)
(Love of your life)
(Love of your life)
(Love of your life)
(Love of your life) (Hit it)
Yeah!

[Chorus]
Hey, I know that you turned on the light
Hey, so slow but you gave me the love of my life

[Outro]
Hey, I know that I waited so long
Hey, so slow but you gave me the love of my life
Oh, she gave me the love of my life
Tell 'em, Flea
Go ahead

[Verse 1]
Floozies at The Rainbow
Superstars that won’t get far
Who is who that we know?
Coochie Coo is at the bar

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you really love?
Do you love, do you love?
Do you want to make the call?
We all long, we all fall

[Verse 2]
Shoelace for the sirens
Groupies and the tyrants ply

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do you really want?
Do you want, do you want?
Do you want to have it all?
We all long, we all fall

[Chorus 1]
I’m so tired
Well, I get by but I could use a few
I’m so tired that I slept along the way

[Verse 3]
Suitcase of perception
Rhinestones and redemption cries

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you really love?
Do you love, do you love?
Do you want to make the call?
We all long, we all fall

[Chorus 2]
I’m so tired
The sun beats down upon my lonely face
I’m so tired that I slept along the way

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Do you really love?
Do you love, do you chase?
Do you take this town today?
We all long, we all face

[Chorus 1]
I’m so tired
Well, I get by but I could use a few
And I’m so tired that I slept along the way

[Outro]
The sun beats down upon my lonely face and
A perfect world with all its perfect places
I could use a few for just in cases
And I’m so tired that I slept along the way

[Verse 1]
Driving up the coast to find a version of the truth
Left the backdoor swinging like a dirty little sleuth
The truth is I have never felt half this alive
Now it’s time to dance upon the grave called 45
Jacked up on some Kerouac and surely bullet proof
The girl who taught me what to do was missing her front tooth
Gentle as a storm inside your mental health
I want to find the answer but I just can’t find myself

[Chorus]
I said so long to the way I played
The way I played inside of yesterday
Hey, let’s run around
The great escape from out of my hometown

[Verse 2]
Later I would look for love inside a woman’s dorm
A couch to keep me humble and her breath to keep me warm
Ophelia was the girl that I was feeling for
Come to realize it was me who was the whore
A captain lost himself inside a 40 year old skull
The drink of choice was knowledge and we always wanted more
Drunken sailors seeking their Geronimo
Instead they found the things that they really didn’t want to know

[Chorus]
I said so long to the way I played
The way I played inside of yesterday
Hey, let’s run around
The great escape from out of my hometown

[Post-Chorus]
Country roads would never let me stay
The way I played inside of yesterday

[Verse 3]
A devil’s growl and cat’s meow were blended into one
Termites called suburbanites were eating all the fun
A juggernaut of comedy and blasphemy
I want to stop the madness but I think it has to be

[Chorus]
I said so long to the way I played
The way I played inside of yesterday
Hey, let’s run around
The great escape from out of my hometown

[Post-Chorus]
Country roads would never let me stay
The way I played inside of yesterday

[Outro]
Hey, let’s run around
The great escape from out of my hometown

[Chorus 1]
Say what you need to say
Make it clear, make it great
'Cause it's not too late and there's no mistake
When you shine
Shake it for me anyway
Now we crash the gate to investigate
Your fate

[Verse]
Pleasure to meet you, got so much more
To offer the world, see what's in store
Stay all day
Someone to love, that's my boy chip chop
Open the doors and we never close shop
Stay all day

[Chorus 2]
Take what you need to take
To forsake
Make it for me anyway
When we fill the void that is Pink As Floyd
To destroy
Records that we file away
Now we'll clean the slate as we calculate
Your fate

[Verse]
Pleasure to meet you, got so much more
To offer the world, see what's in store
Stay all day
Someone to love, that's my boy chip chop
Open the doors and we never close shop
Stay all day

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
And you shine, as you redefine
Your time
Just another time of day
Do you feel the spark when you play the part?
Superstar
Fake it for me anyway
Time to tell them all without hem or haw
No applause
Tell them how to generate

[Chorus 4]
How to raise the bar, how to keep it hard
Be alive
Make it for me anyway
If you care at all you will bare it all
You will grind
Shake it for me anyway

[Outro]
Born to play the part, dying for your art
'Cause it's time
Take it for me anyway
You will clear the air with a single stare
Your fate

[Intro]
"Ah, fuck...shit!"

[Verse 1]
I’m afraid that I’m never afraid
I’ve got combat boots and I’m American made
For your eyes girl

[Verse 2]
Mormon lover on a delicate day
Going to marry the boss, gettin' carried away
War cries girl

[Verse 3]
I’m not immune to Canadian snow
Now teach me everything that I should know
With your eyes girl

[Chorus]
Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to leave and alone
Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to bleed into snow

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on
Let go
We know

[Verse 4]
Do you shine like a temple inside
Can I open your core, so gentle and wide
Like your eyes girl

[Verse 5]
Rack ‘em up, stretch ‘em out when they’re tight
This acetylene torch is giving me sight
War cries girl
Hey!

[Chorus]
Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to leave and alone
Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to bleed into snow

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on
Let go
We know

[Guitar Solo]
Kill it!
WOOOOOO!
Lord, woo!
Yeah!
Uh, uh, uh!
Your! Eyes! Girl! Oh!

[Verse 6]
Black and blue from the hullabaloo
Do the caribou bite when they look into you
And your eyes girl

[Chorus]
Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to leave and alone
Freeze on the radio
I’ve got to bleed into snow

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on
Let go
We know

[Verse 1]
In love dying
There’s a flawless rain
In love dying
One foot in the astral plane
Someone’s sighing
There’s a vergin' road waiting to be strode
Rope’s untying
This power I could not withhold

[Verse 2]
Satisfying
What do we contain?
Can’t stop crying
These tears of change remain the same

[Chorus]
My girl, she shoots down the baddest of guys
She knows that they want me dead
She fires up the starry night
And fills them so full, so full of lead

[Verse 3]
In love dying
Does it go two ways?
In love dying
This body I can not detain

[Verse 4]
Wake up flying
See the solar shore
Passers buying
The memories we re-adorn

[Verse 5]
In love dying
Nothing to obtain
In love dying
No crawling through the halls of fame

[Chorus]
My girl, she shoots down the baddest of guys
She knows that they want me dead
She fires up the starry night
And fills them so full, so full of lead

[Verse 6]
In love dying
Loss becomes the gain
In love dying
Recreate me so I may sustain

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
My girl, she shoots down the baddest of guys
She knows that they want me dead
She fires up the starry night
And fills them so full, so full of lead

[Outro]
In love dying
In love dying

[Verse 1]
Death
Let me catch my breath
Let me see what's left, let me see what's true
Do I really want to run from my depths?
Will I have regrets?
Will I ever find you? Will I ever find the words
That give me motive to express?

[Verse 2]
Bread
Will I go unfed?
Will I be that fool who rushes on in to where
Angels fear to tread?
Was it me who bled
On the new death bed and there is no fear
When you're leaning on love, those grateful dead

[Chorus]
Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone, I do
To be there when push comes to shove

[Post-Chorus]
I know that you know
The ending numbers

[Verse 3]
Chess
Let me play my best
When I do regress, let it all unwind 'cause we're never confined
To the board unless
There's a second guess
Look into the sky where we all comply
With something higher than the rest my love
Sail through

[Chorus]
Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone, I do
To be there when push comes to shove

[Post-Chorus]
I know that you know
The ending numbers
Someone like you

[Bridge]
Sky all around
Fell to the ground
Now I'm a child
Stayed for a while

[Verse 4]
Flesh
Is it meaningless?
But we all protest to the last request
Is there anything you could now suggest?
Did I do my best?
Did I leave it better even though we look to be
Just mildly obsessed with you
Sail through

[Chorus]
Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone, I do
To be there when push comes to shove

[Post-Chorus]
I know that you know
The ending numbers

[Outro]
Someone like you to be there

[Verse 1]
Love is all the world, you say the world is gone
Love is all the world, you say it's gone, I don't
The party in your eyes says someone to caress
A party in the sky, I think I'll wear a dress

[Chorus]
God save us all and tell us how it ends
Laugh 'til we fall, so why can't we be friends?

[Verse 2]
Mother taught me what to do in chaotic times
Work and play all day until the sun resigns
Haley and the Comets sang an old rock jam
The ukulele played another song or prayer

[Chorus]
God save us all and tell us how it ends
Laugh 'til we fall, so why can't we be friends?

[Post-Chorus]
Stole a lot from Peter 'cause you to had to pay your Paul
And when you find that's not enough, he'll break your fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Some get on and some get off the carousel
I think it's time to go, so I will fare thee well

[Chorus]
God save us all and tell us how it ends
Laugh 'til we fall, so why can't we be friends?

[Post-Chorus]
Stole a lot from Peter 'cause you to had to pay your Paul
And when you find that's not enough, he'll break your fall

[Intro]
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

[Verse 1]
This is the kitt, I can't compare
A delicate new arrival
Check the commute, I do declare
Lets sing a new revival

[Verse 2]
Chemical circus at the pub
Mentally she's departed
Cut me a check, I'll cut your rug
Later we'll get bombarded

[Chorus]
Everybody knows
The game is full of highs and lows
Like your mother said
Girl, your father's dead
Everybody knows
That life is full of highs and lows
Is there always red
In your wedding bed?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, everybody knows

[Verse 3]
Officer please, I just got there
Traveled from door to door
Haven't you seen my girlfriend's hair?
What are we looking for?

[Chorus]
Everybody knows
The game is full of highs and lows
Like your mother said
Girl, your father's dead
Everybody knows
The day is full of highs and lows
Is there always red
In your wedding bed?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, everybody knows

[Guitar Solo]
(Talk to me)

[Verse 4]
This is the kitt, I can't compare
A delicate new arrival
Check the commute, I do declare
I think we have our bible

[Chorus]
Everybody knows
The game is full of highs and lows
Like your mother said
Girl, your father's dead
Everybody knows
That life is full of highs and lows
Is there always red
In your wedding bed?

[Outro]
Take me to the shore
Show me what it's for
Is there always red
In your wedding bed?
Everybody knows
This game is full of cons and pros
Like your mother said
Girl, your father's dead
Everybody knows

[Chorus]
Brave from afar when I hold you for country
Saved by a star, can I hold you to one thing?

[Post-Chorus]
Do you feel safe when they tell you, they sell you?
Pray for your children, the shelter they're building

[Verse 1]
Prime time, the perfect crime
Bow my head, the axe we grind
Ruse cruise, P's and Q's
I got beat up by the evening news
Deep hits, the media blitz
Lost my mind to keep my wits
Maintain the same old same
Goodbye shiz and so long game

[Chorus]
Brave from afar when I hold you for country
Saved by a star, can I hold you to one thing?

[Post-Chorus]
Do you feel safe when they tell you, they sell you?
Pray for your children, the shelter they're building

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Plain Jane, the big campaign
Last detail has been restrained
Fraud, fraud, the lightning rod
See that sign, time to applaud

[Chorus]
Brave from afar when I hold you for country
Saved by a star, can I hold you to one thing?

[Post-Chorus]
Do you feel safe when they tell you, they sell you?
Pray for your children, the shelter they're building

[Verse 1]
Feeling good and I don’t know why
Another day and another high
I walk around like I am on the ray, hey-yeah
Somewhere way out in the rays of Hanalei
I met a girl and I liked her vibe
Another day and another ride
I met a girl who wants to save the world, save the world
Make it safe for someone else to find their faith

[Chorus]
I’m away, I’m away, I'm away, I’m away
I'm away, I’m away, I'm away, Hanalei
I'm away
I’m away, I’m away, I'm away, I’m away
I'm away, I’m away, I'm away, Hanalei
I'm away

[Verse 2]
A simple song and it made me cry
I really don’t want to pass me by
A simple song that spoke of Hemingway, hey-yeah
The revolution in your blood creates the wave
I picked her up on the road to surf
Looked a lot like a Mother Earth
She said, "Hello, my name is Charlotte Gray," hey-yeah
Make it safe for someone else to find their faith

[Chorus]
I’m away, I’m away, I'm away, I’m away
I'm away, I’m away, I'm away, Hanalei
I'm away
I’m away, I’m away, I'm away, I’m away
I'm away, I’m away, I'm away, Hanalei
I'm away

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude: Josh Klinghoffer]
You and I do more than merely survive
You and I
You and I do more than merely survive
Divide your mind

[Chorus]
I’m away, I’m away, I'm away, I’m away
I'm away, I’m away, I'm away, Hanalei
I'm away
I’m away, I’m away, I'm away, I’m away
I'm away, I’m away, I'm away, Hanalei
I'm away

[Verse 1]
So we were down in Brazil and, man, that place is wild
We were in Rio de Janeiro, and uh, we had this, this sort of, uh, security-guard type guy and he was supposed to take us around
I said "Hey, could, you know, could you take us to the, the favelas and show us the prostitution, and the drug deals, and the night fights, and the...you know, the street life of your town?" And he said "Sure." So we, we pull up to this hooker and she's wearing some kind of a, a bright green miniskirt, and it turns out it's a transsexual, and he says "Get over here!" And she comes over and she thinks she's busted, but she's not busted. Naw, she's not busted, he just wanted to smack her on the ass a few times and say, "Hey, what's up, girl?"

[Chorus]
Get out of bed and I clear up my head and
I don't want to go but I do it instead
We are dreams within a dream
Get into bed and I turn off my head
And I﻿ started to float, was it something she said?
We are dreams within a dream

[Verse 2]
So I remember we got our driver's license, and my friend Hillel had this little Datsun painted green, and...
Hollywood would get so crazy in the winter. The rains would come and the hills would just kind of melt down into the city lights, and, well, you know, we'd smoke weed and we'd go up in the hills, and we'd listen to progressive rock music, and just kind of trip out and... Well, we would dream, you know, we would dream, and we would talk about what we wanted to do, and we would talk about girls and music. And, you know, Hillel wanted to be a rock star, and I didn't even know what that was. I was like, "Whatever you want to do, man, I'm coming with you, I'm right with you my friend."

[Chorus]
Get out of bed and I clear up my head and
I don't want to go but I do it instead
We are dreams within a dream
Get into bed and I turn off my head
And I﻿ started to float, was it something she said?
We are dreams within a dream

[Outro]
Why in the world would you want it to be?
Why would you want to take it so, so literally?
All these things that come down from the sky, raining upon your head
Make you stop and wonder why, ah!
Can't they just spell it out, make it clear, make it easy to read
For the simple man like me? I don't think so
I reach out to my family and I say, "It's not about religion and the God sitting in a chair in the sky
With a punishing hand, no
It's about heaven in your heart." Now when can we start?
I wanna choose love instead of fear
Won't you come right now, over here
And be a part of my, ah...
Let me make it easier this time, I love you

[Verse 1]
PT-boat on the way to Havana

Now I'm a guide for the CIA
Hooray for the USA!

Baby, baby, make me loco

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
What's up with her?
She know she ain't right
Jeans don't fit her
She got that kind of body that I like
Somebody's with her
But I don't see no man in sight
I'm tryin' to get her
And I only need her for one night

[Chorus: Sean Kingston]
So can I borrow that?
Ay girl can I borrow that? (Oh-ooh-whoa)
Can I borrow that?
Won't you let a nigga hold that?
Can I hold that? Can I hold that?
Ay girl can I hold that? (Oh-ooh-whoa)
Won't you let a nigga hold that?

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
Let's go missin'

I told you before, stay away from my door
Don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother
The freaks on the phone, don't leave me alone
Don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother

[Chorus]
I, I found out!
I, I found out!

[Verse 2]
Now that I showed you what I been through
Don't take nobody's word what you can do
There ain't no Jesus gonna come from the sky
Now that I found out, I know I can cry

[Chorus]
I, I found out!
I, I found out!

[Verse 3]
Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand
Don't get you nowhere, don't make you a man
I heard something 'bout my Ma and my Pa
They didn't want me so they made me a star

[Chorus]
I, I found out!
I, I found out!

[Verse 4]
Old Hare Krishna ain't got nothing on you
Just keep you crazy with nothing to do
Keeping you occupied with your pie in the sky
There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes

[Chorus]
I, I found out!
I, I found out!

[Verse 5]
I've seen through junkies, I've been through it all
I seen religion from Jesus to Paul
Don't let them fool you with them dope and cocaine
No one can harm you, feel your own pain

[Outro]
I, I found out!
I, I found out!
I, I found out!

[Intro]
I tumble into space, try to stop the fall
My body ripped and tore, I could have floated in space
Could have floated

[Verse]
I stumble around my home
I am on the outside My legs and arms are lead, feeling love from no one
Could have floated My head weighs ninety-pounds and I've been down
My friends are aliens and I've been down
Well now I've got no wife Cut a lizard's tail, it grows back to life
I killed some sleepless nights, my heart's torn to pieces
Could have floated I am the funny guy, yeah I've been down
I am the big rock star yeah I've been down
I'll never be the same, cause I've been inside out
And I want to be an animal and take care of my own
My head weighs ninety pounds and I've been down
My friends are aliens and I've been down
I know what it's like cause I've been down Devil sneaks in and deals and I've been down

[Verse 1]
Let's make evil, let's make good
I'd do anything I could
Just to get you in my dirty world
Go down on you
Seventeen and thirty-one
I am just my mother's son
Brown eyes and a silver tongue
All the mothers come undone
At the sight of me

[Chorus]
The water's falling clear
Interiors deceived by fear
(I think I'll kiss my shame away)
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
(I think I'll kiss my shame away)

[Verse 2]
Let's get soft and let's get hard
Let's get off in my backyard
Where the desert wind will wash our skin
A lighter red
Let's make peace and let's make war
Let's break into heaven for
A dance with heaven's devils or
Is that more than you can store
Inside your head

[Chorus]
The water's falling clear
Interiors deceived by fear
(I think I'll kiss my shame away)
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
(I think I'll kiss my shame away)

[Bridge]
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame
Slay my shame

[Verse 3]
Let's get gentle, let's get pissed
Get your knickers in a twist
'Cause the angel and the devil kiss
They fell in love
Some sing dirty, some sang clean
Something from a madman's dream
Am I really what I seem?
Rising to my head like cream
It feels so strange

[Chorus]
The water's falling clear
Interiors deceived by fear
(I think I'll kiss my shame away)
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
(I think I'll kiss my shame away)

[Outro]
Slay my shame
Slay my shame
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame
Slay my shame
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Persistent mist that faults my vision
Psycho-exist point of collision
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium

[Verse 2]
Three pound of gray about to burst
Inside my three pound universe
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium

[Chorus]
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind

[Verse 3]
Symbols I've been given to express my goal
Always come up short, you know they just don't get that low
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium

[Chorus]
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind

[Chorus]
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind

[Outro]
Quick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision
Bio-organic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devastation
Cleaner than light, meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000
Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most
As the uncontrollable soldiers of suffering succotash
Instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bus station frustration
Alone in the constellation of alienation detached from empty conversation
I wait
I wait
For the wave to break

[Intro]
My life is brilliant...
What, was I too early? I'm sorry
Should I... do you wanna start over? Or keep going?
Okay, now? Now?

[Verse 1]
My life is brilliant
Your life's a joke
You're just pathetic
You're always broke
Your homemade Star Trek uniform
Really ain't impressin' me
You're sufferin' from delusions of
Adequacy

[Chorus]
You're pitiful
You're pitiful
You're pitiful, it's true
Never had a date
That you couldn't inflate
And you smell repulsive, too
What a bummer being you

[Verse 2]
Well, you just can't dance
And forget romance
Everybody you know still calls ya
"Farty Pants"
But you'll always have a job, well, I mean
As long as you still can work that Slurpee machine

[Chorus]
You're pitiful
You're pitiful
You're pitiful, it's true
You're half undressed
Eatin' chips off your chest
While you're playin' Halo 2
No one's classier than you

[Bridge]
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la... loser

[Chorus]
You're pitiful
You're pitiful
You're pitiful, it's true
Your dog would much rather
Play fetch by itself
You still live with your mom and you're 42

[Outro]
Guess you'll never grow a clue
Well, it just sucks to be you

[Verse 1]
Deep inside these sleeping shallows
Far away where no one goes, now
Take my place in golden space
Of TV star that no one knows, now
Deep, deep mystery is talking to me
She's a giver of constant animation
All around and ready to make a new formation
You're the reason I'm in this world

[Chorus]
I don't believe in everything I see
Rivers Of Avalon
Your supernatural energy
Part of my scenery
What I belong to is your ecstasy
Rivers Of Avalon
Your faith unwavering is key

[Verse 2]
The clone of my own loneliness has got to fade
What am I known to?
Little garland and in your starling
Loving waves that I've succumbed to
Deep, deep mystery is talking to me
She's a giver of constant animation
All around and ready to make a new formation
You're the reason I'm in this world

[Bridge]
Deep, deep mystery is talking to me
She's a giver of constant animation
All around and ready to make a new formation
You're the reason I'm in this world

[Chorus]
I don't believe in everything I see
Rivers Of Avalon
Your supernatural energy
Part of my scenery
What I belong to is your ecstasy
Rivers Of Avalon
Your faith unwavering is key

[Outro]
I don't believe in everything I see
Rivers Of Avalon
Your supernatural energy
All that it means
I took the boat down to the blacksmith's at the breaks
Quite ridiculous (Quite ridiculous)
He said "The problem that we've got living round here's fighting all these scary monsters"
And there's one coming down
Top of the roofs
Get out the car
We're just running
Running away

It's in your house now
It's in your house now now
In your house now now

Well mister, you came straight bolting in looking scared
Quite ridiculous
Said "you never guess what just happened seven just got manipulus"

She said "you don't look frightened at all"
With one so near
You just kept on saying that it's all, it's all gonna get colder
It's gonna get colder now
Now you're here
You can make no sound
And they'll still sense you're near
They can't run as fast as I can
We'll be here soon
You'll be laughing, man

[Verse 1]
I should be on my way
I really ought not stay
Far too strong with the pinup on
Hear my conscience - I'm gone!
I should have let you know
This boy was made to roam
The band is who I'm married to
And this is what God said to do
I let my motor stray
Forgive me where I play
Sending my love to a Tennessee
She got style now let's see
I remember who
To surrender to
The captain of my ship is brave
It's brothers hood on a Mother's Day

[Pre-Chorus]
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do

[Chorus]
I show enough I love you
I show enough I do
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to

[Verse 2]
I'm off to wonderland
Just in my second hand
Life is short but ain't it grand
I'm a way outside but in demand
I'll take it on my chin
Go back and forth again
Find me on some telephone
With a broken down voice and a shaky tone
Do unto others who
You would have do to you
Ain't no way I'd ever trade
That sparer life for this piece of shade
Destined for battle zone
Why's there no lesson known
The lesson's not to wait for me
Unless you got a taste for the bittersweet

[Pre-Chorus]
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do

[Chorus]
I show enough I love you
I show enough I do
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to

[Bridge]
Let your joy decide, let your joy divide
Everything we do
Let your joy decide, let your joy divide
Everything we do
Let your motor ride, let your motor ride
Everything we do
Ow, hit me!

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Do do do do do
Do do do do do (ehhh)
Do do do do do
Do do do do do

[Chorus]
I show enough I love you
I show enough I do
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to

[Outro]
We could have made it, my love
We could have skated through
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to

[Verse 1]
History's so strong
History's so strong
History's so strong
History's so strong
Sing another drinking song, the honky tonk will do
Making another breaking bone your favorite ingenue
This, the distant dawn
This, the distant dawn

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my cards upon the table
I do this because I am able
One pixie's broken-down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Shine at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down

[Chorus]
Stay all night, we save the population
Stay all night, we save the population
Stay all night, we save the population
Stay all night, we save the population

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Pistol and its pawn
Sailing through the lexicon
A pistol and its pawn
Blood on borderlines be drawn
Take another bottle down, the brothel and the shrew
Make another awful sound to rap the Gothic through
History's so strong
History's so strong

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my cards upon the table
I do this because I am able
One pixie's broken-down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Shine at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down

[Chorus]
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
(Stay all night, we save the population)
Stay all night, we save the population
(Stay all night, we save the population)
(Stay all night, we save the population)

[Verse 1]
I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb
I am a world's forgotten boy
The one who searches and destroys

[Chorus 1]
Honey got to help me please
Somebody got to save my soul
Baby detonate for me

[Verse 2]
Look out honey, cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Soul radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight

[Chorus 2]
Honey gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby penetrate my mind

[Verse 3]
And I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searching, searching to destroy
And honey I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searching, searching to destroy

[Outro]
Forgotten boy, forgotten boy
Forgotten boy said hey forgotten boy

[Chorus 1]
In a world that can be so insane
I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I wanna know more than your brain

[Verse 1]
Into my life you were injected
Not something that I expected
Now I smile from your affection
We have made a soul connection
Just for whom does your bell toll
Don't be cold, show me your soul

[Chorus 2]
Sentimental gentlemen
Are not afraid to show you when
I am you, you're my best friend
Show me your soul

[Chorus 1]
In a world that can be so insane
I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I wanna know more than your brain

[Verse 2]
Yes, I find you so appealing
When you show me how you're feeling
You, my friend, need not be kneeling
Open up and start revealing
Trust in me my heart is sole
I need to see, show me your soul

[Chorus 2]
Sentimental gentlemen
Are not afraid to show you when
I am you, you're my best friend
Show me your soul

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 1]
In a world that can be so insane
I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I wanna know more than your brain

[Verse 3]
Don't expect too much from me
Perfection is no test for me
Because the best I'll ever be
Is just like you, a human being
You won't offend, I need to know
Please, my friend, show me your soul

[Chorus 2]
Sentimental gentlemen
Are not afraid to show you when
I am you, you're my best friend
Show me your soul

[Verse 1]
Everybody knows we’re Hollywood skunks
Soulful sexy funky monks
My Tinseltown is made of steel
Let's whip, let's shout, let's make a deal
Hollywood or Hollywood not
We are so lively on the spot
Never sold out always in stock
Are you deaf or does this rock?

[Chorus 1]
Silly little creature, Sikamikanico
Sitting on a bleacher, Sikamikanico
I don't want a teacher, Sikamikanico
If we're going to reach ya, Sikamikanico

[Verse 2]
Don't you know about Frank Sinatra
That's all gone because I got up
We don't just play, we display
Got to give it up, gotta do it my way
Shooting my sex into the cave
You mind receives my radio wave
Shake it girl, you won't get hurt
I knock my dick into the dirt

[Chorus 1]
Silly little creature, Sikamikanico
Sitting on a bleacher, Sikamikanico
I don't want a teacher, Sikamikanico
If we're going to reach ya, Sikamikanico

Anybody want some, Sikamikanico
Everybody on the run, Sikamikanico
Rock it more breeza, Sikamikanico
If we're going to treasure, Sikamikanico

[Bridge]
Hey, Ho, Let's go
Mother Fucker, wanna be a gigolo
Let me demolo how it goes
Under ho sittin' on my big toe
Hey Joe, a radio chump
I'll never going to overcome in Hollywood, I'll come alone
Oh no, it would now leave my nose that you blow
Hey ho, let's go

[Verse 3]
So big boy says you are bad news
We doubt our mama's been confused
It's plain to see we rock the groove
If you don't like it, time to move
And all the press, you don't amaze me
I'm not your dick so don't appraise me
Never going to fit your critical shit
You better watch out, you might get hit

[Chorus 1]
Silly little creature, Sikamikanico
Sitting on a bleacher, Sikamikanico
I don't want a teacher, Sikamikanico
If we're going to reach ya, Sikamikanico

[Chorus 2]
Anybody want some, Sikamikanico
Everybody on the run, Sikamikanico
Rock it more breeza, Sikamikanico
If we're going to treasure, Sikamikanico

Someone
There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for

Nothing major or too complicated
Just a friendly wager that we orchestrated
For someone, someone
Cut my heart out
With a feather
And put an end
To any extra pressure for

[Chorus]
Someone
There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for

And fill the space with lack of controversy

On my aeroplane
Here's a present
For the future memory lane

There are no worries for me

For me

Stranded on a toilet bowl

What do you do when you're stranded
And there ain't nothing on the roll?
To prove you're a man
You must wipe it with your hand

[Chorus]
Stranded
Stranded on a toilet bowl!

[Verse 1]
Every night, I just want to go out
Get out of my head
Every day, I don't want to get up
Get out of my bed
Every night, I want to play out
And every day, I want to do
But tonight I just want to stay in and be with you, ooh
And be with you

Every morning brings a new day
And every night, that day is through
But tonight I just want to stay in and be with you, ooh
And be with you

Bicycles for two
Broken-hearted jubilee

Parachutes, army boots
Sleeping bags for two
Sentimental jamboree

This is the story of a boy named Ted
If his mother said, "Ted, be good", he would
She told him tales about his soldier dad
But it made her sad, then she'd cry, oh my

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ted used to tell her he'd be twice as good
And he knew he could, 'cause in his head he said

"Mommy don't worry, now teddy boy's here
Taking good care of you
Mama don't worry, your teddy boy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"

Teddy turned and ran, far away, okay
He couldn't stand to see his mother in love with another man
He didn't know, oh no

He found a place where he could settle down
And from time to time, in his head he said

[Chorus 1]
"Mommy don't worry, now teddy boy's here
Taking good care of you
Mommy don't worry, your teddy boy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"

Walk my horse up on the hill (When I walk my horse upon a hill)
When I lay me down
Will my lover love me still?

When I thought, well, I thought
When I thought you was my friend
(When I thought that I could call you my friend)
But you let me down (hoo!)
Put my heart around the bend

[Chorus 2]
A fly flies in (A fly flies in)
A fly flies out (A fly flies out)
Most flies they got three legs
But mine got one

Well, when I fly, when I fly, when I fly
When I fly above the clouds
(When I fly above the maddening crowd)
Oh, when I fly, when I fly, when I fly
When I fly above the clouds
(When I fly above the maddening crowd)
You can knock me down with a feather, yes, you could
But you know it's not allowed (But you know it's not allowed)

A dog is here (A dog is here)

[Verse 1: SZA]
Ripping the heads off all my Barbie dolls
Toss them to the side, get the convertibles
(Click, vroom) I like the way it rides up
Ken had it all, Skipper wanted more than
Watching from the sidelines, wish that she had it
She wish that she had it

[Chorus: SZA]
Here in your backyard, building a fantasy
Fuck reality, do you want to know, know me
Do you want to know me?

[Verse 2: SZA]
Stuck in Nintendo, you're the controller
Street Fighters and such
I yelled "finish him"
(Down goes Frazier)
I yelled "finish him"
Come Desdemona, Othello and tragedies
Shakespearean sorrows, where do I begin?
Where do we begin?

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I got L's on my record
Weed on the vinyl
Keys open doors when them keys is albino
Now knock on my door when my stars is a Lionel
I've been fishing for a minute, for a minnow
Only I know that a pawn is a trade
And a rookie for a castle like tuition for a final
Playing hooky for a tassel, spend a minute on the minor
Wins on my window
Ash on my skin, when the record low temps for the wind blow
Only write rhythm to the tardiest of tempos
Only ride shotgun when the car is a limo
Y'ar see
I crowd surf in a cypher
Scuba in my shower, take an Uber to my neighbors
Used to pay the piper, till Peter picked it better
Now the first thing you should tell is where the hell is all the paper
But memories keep coming back
All the nights that we used to laugh
Wanna know how I used to was, how I used to was

[Outro: SZA & Chance the Rapper]
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
(Here in your backyard, building a fantasy)
Just wonder how I used to was, how I used to was
(Fuck reality, do you want to know, know me)
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
(Do you want to know me?)
Just wonder how I used to was, how I used to was
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
Just wondering how I used to was, how I used to was
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
Just wondering how I used to was, how I used to was
Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
Just wondering how I used to was, how I used to was

[Intro: Spoken]
Yelled: Here's a song
Here's a little punk rock song for you
A little punk rock called
I think it was written by the Ramones
In the early 70's
Maybe before they started
You know, when it was really hard core back in the old days
Remember?
Flea
I could have sworn this was the Dead Kennedy's

[Chorus 1: Spoken]
No no no no no
I think it was Sham 69
No, this is the Buzz-cocks

[Verse 2: Spoken]
You idiot, you worthless peon
Don't you know this is one of the
It must have been, um
The Sex Pistols

No, this is Non Non Non
Hey, it was the Church or the Weirdos maybe

[Chorus 2]

[x2]
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You've had a busy day today

[Verse 1]
So I sat in the attic, a piano up my nose
And the wind played a dreadful cantata (cantata, cantata)
Sore was I from the crack of an enemy's hose
And the horrible sound of tomato (tomato, tomato)

[Bridge]
Ketchup (ketchup)
Soup and puree (soup and puree)
Don't get left behind (get left behind)
Ketchup (ketchup)
Soup and puree (soup and puree)
Don't get left behind
(Get left behind, get left behind, get left behind)

[Verse 2]
When a rattle of rats had awoken
The sinews, the nerves, and the veins
My piano is boldly outspoken
And attempts to repeat his refrain
So I stood with a knot in my stomach
And I gazed at that terrible sight
Of two youngsters concealed in a barrel
Sucking monkberry moon delight

[Chorus]
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight

[Verse 3]
Well, I know my banana is older than the rest
And my hair is a tangled beretta (beretta, beretta)
And when I leave my pyjamas to Billy Budapest
And I don't get the gist of your letter (your letter, your letter)

[Bridge]
Catch up! (catch up)
Cats and kittens (cats and kittens)
Don't get left behind (get left behind)
Catch up! (catch up)
Cats and kittens (cats and kittens)
Don't get left behind (get left behind
Get left behind
Get left behind)

[Chorus]
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight

[Outro]
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Sucking monkberry moon delight

Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight

Try some of this honey
What is it?
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight
Monkberry moon delight

Speed along the highway
Honey, I want it my way
But listen to her daddy's song
"Don't stay out too long"
Ooh, we're just busy hiding
Sitting in the back seat of my car

Looking for a ride in the haul-about
Looking for a ride in and out of town
Stalling around in a haul-about

Every day, she takes a morning bath, she wets her hair
Wraps a towel around her as she's heading for the bedroom chair
It's just another day
Slipping into stockings, stepping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
It's just another day

At the office where the papers grow, she takes a break
Drinks another coffee, and she finds it hard to stay awake
It's just another day

So sad, so sad

[Intro: Lee Fields]
You can't make me do wrong
You can't make me do wrong
I've always been a faithful man, 'til you came along
(Let go)

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
He spent most of his youth with his head down
Chubby, fugly, awkward walk and not much of a talker
He was good at setting bad examples but bad at math
Crunch time, he kept it moving like the lunch line
Working on his salad bars and fruit punch lines
His simple triplets had his english teachers tongue tied
As he starts pirouette for perfection
And Darren Aronofsky Black Swan reflection

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, he wasn't sure
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, toward something more

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
Raised in a broken home built brick by government, cheese brick
Back and forth between parents, making us sea sick
On his knees every night, praying for a little change
But the tooth fairy was broke and offered little hope
He used to stand in front of mirrors
With his toothbrush star searching
But he ain't have to search far
He was smart and made a pact with himself
With a smirk and made a vow that one day
His dad would never ever have to worry

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, he wasn't sure
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, toward something more

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Fast forward a few twenty four hours
Little boy turned man, makes good on his promise
Just to say we didn't take the trips to the Bahamas
Now your boy bank account got a few more commas
The hard work payed off, don't it?
Plus it feel good when you can say you own it
No rent, lease, loan or a mortgage
That generator money, no shortage

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, he wasn't sure
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, toward something more

[Chorus: Brendon Urie]
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong

[Verse 1: Shakira]
Why do you say things if you do not mean them?
Why do you fill up my wounds with your dirt?
Bullets are flying this time, I can't shield them
Santa Maria, I know how it hurts

[Chorus: Shakira & MAGIC!]
'Cause you cut me deep
Your words are like steel
And now I can't sleep
Cause I'll never heal

[Verse 2: Shakira & (MAGIC!)]
Why do you make me believe we are spirits?
Molded together to conquer this Earth (molded together)
Climb up the mountains so high we can see them (yeah)
Then send me to plummet with savaging words

[Chorus 2: Shakira & MAGIC!]
'Cause you cut me deep (you cut me deep, so deep, so deep)
Your words are like steel (now every word is sharp like steel)
And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal (you cut me, you cut me)

[Bridge: Shakira & MAGIC!, Both]
I am covered in scars
Like a rose without thorns
My defenses are gone
No one's out there to warn
If there's love in your heart
Let me leave now in peace
You know you took it too far

[Chorus: Shakira & MAGIC!]
Cause you cut me deep
Your words are like steel
And now I can't sleep
'Cause I'll never heal

[Outro: Shakira]
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so, so
You cut me deep
You cut me so deep
You cut me deep
You cut me so, so, so, so

[Verse 1]
I've got my baggage and you've got yours
I know we've been damaged, been through it all
You know that feeling just before a beautiful disaster
Right on the top
Looking down from the terrifying rolling roller coaster

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, can you hear the sound?
My broken heart's beating faster now
In your arms
But I know that I'm safe here in your arms

[Chorus]
Lay down
Lay down your head on my shoulder
Hey now
Let's just depart from the notion
That I love you too much and I'm here to stay
I'm not giving up
I'm not running away
So we're going to leave it that way
That way

[Verse 2]
This is much bigger than you and I
To live without love would be suicide
I think you'll would soon close your pretty eyes
I like you hear your breathing
It's like the soundtrack of my life
The only memory I'm keeping

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, can you hear the sound?
Your broken heart's beating faster now
In my arms
I promise that you're safe here in my arms

[Chorus]
Lay down
Lay down your head on my shoulder
Hey now
Let's just depart from the notion
That I love you too much
And I'm here to stay
I'm not giving up
I'm not running away
So we're gonna leave it that way
We're gonna leave it that way
That way

[Verse 1]
Boy meets a girl
Hid behind a wall
Piling up the bricks
Hoping they would fall
Girl meets a boy
Surrenders to his charms
Leaves her old boyfriend
And crumbles in his arms

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And if they wanna make me pay now
Then go on
Cause loving you was never wrong

[Chorus]
Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
Cause it's so bright, so bright
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I end up blind

[Verse 2]
Lazy for a while
Laying golden eggs
Some just want your money
Or whatever they can take
But hearing your name
Don't need anyone else
You're here because you want me
And not for what I make

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hey, they better know
If there is a price to pay now, the game is on
Cause in the end you know I won

[Chorus]
Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
Cause it's so bright, so bright
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I end up blind

[Bridge]
And every camera flash my way
And every word of every page
Well they can say whatever they want to
Cause what we got is just so real
That they can't change the way I feel
Cause I would do it all again for you

[Chorus]
Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
Cause it's so bright, so bright
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I end up blind
Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
And it's hurting my eyes
Cause it's so bright, so bright
But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
And I wouldn't give you up even if I end up blind

[Verse 1]
Sunrise blinded by the morning light
Already dreaming up tonight
And I know
That it won't be long
Oh, we can't hide
From the love that burns this strong

[Chorus]
But it's just you and me
And we chase our shadows
We're waiting for, just waiting for
The sun to go down
But until it does
We'll chase our shadows
And when the night comes
We will run from nothing, my love

But it's just you and me
And we chase our shadows
We're waiting for, just waiting for
The sun to go down
But until it does
We'll chase our shadows
And when the night comes
We will run from nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love

[Verse 2]
Night time
And I am back in your arms
When all my dreams are brought to life
And I know that it won't be long
For we can't hide
From the love that burns this strong

[Chorus]
But it's just you and me
And we chase our shadows
We're waiting for, just waiting for
The sun to go down
But until it does
We'll chase our shadows
And when the night comes
We will run from nothing, my love

But it's just you and me
And we chase our shadows
We're waiting for, just waiting for
The sun to go down
But until it does
We'll chase our shadows
And when the night comes
We will run from nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love
Nothing, my love

[Verse 1]
Everybody needs an anchor
A little something that makes you stay
An incentive, someone to fight for
Cause no one really needs so much space

A couple years ago I was lonely
I used to think that there was no God
But then you looked at me with your blue eyes
And my agnosticism turned into dust

[Pre-Chorus]
How well you know me
That I don’t care if the rest don’t
It doesn’t matter to me, no ohh
Oh-oh-oh and as long as you love me
As long as we still have each other

[Chorus]
I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23
Pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa
Ahh- ahh

[Verse 2]
God knows that I’m a good dancer
My feet can move to the music he plays
But there were times I asked for an answer
When he was acting in mysterious ways

There were nights that I stayed up crying
Cause I was certain that things wouldn't change
But then you came and I saw you smiling
Just like an angel, so beautifully strange

[Pre-Chorus]
And then you touched me
It's like you were made for me, oh-oh
Like it was all meant to be, oh-oh
And I was sure that you would love me
And that we'd always have each other

[Chorus]
I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23
Pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa
Ohh- ohh

[Bridge]
Always thought that I was fine but I was wrong
It was you, that one piece I was missing
And I could do without you but, it'd be no fun
I found you and life was suddenly easy
There ain't no worries now
There ain't no feeling down

[Chorus]
I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23

[Verse 1]
I fold your t-shirts
And I strip your bed
I loved you perfect
But there's no, appreciation
I listen sweetly to your sour tongue
I loved you only
But there's no, reciprocation

[Pre-Chorus]
Before you came along
It was all beautiful
I have nothing left in my heart, in my soul
Should have never helped you become
So powerful
But I saw a champion in your eyes

[Chorus]
You don't care about me
If you did you would let me go
You will eventually
Cause you just don't care about me
You don't care if I die
If you did you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
That you just don't care about me

[Verse 2]
You say you're thirsty so I pour the wine
The bottle's empty
But there's no, consummation

[Pre-Chorus]
Before you came along
It was all beautiful
I have nothing left in my heart, in my soul
Should have never helped you become
So powerful
But I saw a champion in your eyes

[Chorus]
You don't care about me
If you did you would let me go
You will eventually
Cause you just don't care about me
You don't care if I die
If you did you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
That you just don't care about me

[Bridge]
Oh baby how we used to dance
I couldn't separate from your hands
Now they don't even play that song anymore

[Chorus]
You don't care about me (No)
Don't care about me (No)
Don't care about me
You don't care about me (No)
Don't care about me (No)
You don't care about me
If you did you would let me go
You will eventually
Cause you just don't care about me
You don't care if I die
If you did you would have spared my life
I say it confidently
That you just don't care about me

[Verse 1]
Every morning when I woke up
I was choked up
I was living without a purpose
Always jumping all the hurdles
Doing circles
In the dark with a broken compass

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't explain the way it feels
I could trip on my own words
I make mistakes, that much is clear
But I made it here, my love
Yeah I made it here, my love

[Chorus]
You are the one thing that I got right
It's a fickle world, yeah it's a fickle world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah I'm a lucky girl
And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right
Right, right, right

[Refrain]
One thing I got right
One thing I got right

[Verse 2]
Every morning when you wake up
I wanna hold you
I just need to be wrapped around you
It's kinda funny when you think that
You just got here
Now I know I can't live without you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can't explain the way it feels
I could choke on my own words
Sometimes it seems like it ain't real
Like you're really here my love
Yeah you're really here my love

[Chorus]
You are the one thing that I got right
It's a fickle world, yeah it's a fickle world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah I'm a lucky girl
And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right
Right, right, right

[Bridge]
Every time I see your smile
Every time I hear your laugh
Baby you bring in new sunshine over my way
You are the little dream
I had since I was a child
My fairytale comes true when I look at your face
May not be here forever
But it'll be a long road together
I already know
We're gonna be fine, fine, fine
We're gonna be just fine, fine, fine

[Chorus]
You are the one thing that I got right
It's a fickle world, yeah it's a fickle world
You turn the darkness into sun light
I'm a lucky girl, yeah I'm a lucky girl
And if I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right
You're one thing I got right

[Final Chorus]
If I mess up everything someday
I won't hide my head in shame
Cause you're the one thing that I got right
Cause you're the one thing that I got right
One thing that I got right
One thing that I got right

[Verse 1: Shakira & Blake Shelton, Both]
And I feel like I'm losing my mind
Banging my head up against the wall
Staring at nothing 'cause I can't sleep at night
Can't make it stop, yeah, I think too much
What do I do? Falling apart
I need a shock straight to my heart
No one would want to be in my shoes right now, o-oh

[Chorus: Shakira & (Blake Shelton), Both]
I don't reach for the bottle of whisky (Straight on the rocks)
But you won't see me popping the pills (P-p-p-popping the pills)
'Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second, make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my m-m-medicine, medicine
My m-m-medicine, medicine
My m-m-medicine

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton & Shakira, Both]
You know you're an expert at complicating things
(That's how I'm wired, believe me, it's no fun)
But you make the war seem like such an easy game
Kiss me and my arguments come undone
Down in the trenches, you are the white flag
Make me surrender
Want you so bad
Baby, don't stop what you started
Don't ever be done, o-oh

[Chorus: (Blake Shelton) with Shakira]
I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
(Straight on the rocks)
But you won't see me popping the pills
(P-p-popping the pills)
'Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my m-m-medicine, medicine
My m-m-medicine, medicine
My m-m-medicine

[Bridge: Shakira with Blake Shelton]
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home

[Chorus: Shakira with Blake Shelton]
I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
No, you won't see me popping the pills
'Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second, make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my m-m-medicine, medicine
My m-m-medicine, medicine
My m-m-medicine

[Bridge: Shakira & Blake Shelton]
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home
You make it all better, better
You make me feel home

[Outro: Shakira]
You're my medicine

[Verse 1]
I'm older but you're wiser than anyone can see
You're patient like no other has even been with me
Your eyes take me to places
I've never dreamt about
Your voice is the only music I can't do without

There can't be any doubts now
We're just too far ahead to look behind
And above the good and bad

[Chorus]
I need you to believe in my word
I feel like a broken record
And I've told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
My search is done
Can you put your trust in my word?
I sound like a broken record
And I've said it 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
You are the one

[Verse 2]
Your hands that have no mercy
Are also my best friends
And I can get lost climbing on your legs that never end
I found a perfect distance between my body on you
And that is no distance, dear if that's alright with you
They said we wouldn't make it
But look at how we've beaten all the odds
I just need you to be aware of that

[Chorus]
I need you to believe in my word
I feel like a broken record
And I've told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
My search is done
Can you put your trust in my word?
I sound like a broken record
And I've told you 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
You are the one

[Bridge]
I just want you to take a leap of faith
No it's easy to make all the same mistakes
But I won't this time, no, not this time

[Chorus]
I need you to believe in my word
I sound like a broken record
And I've said it 700 times
I don't need to keep looking
You are the one

[Outro]
A dozen icy summers were leading me to you
I had to hear the liars to recognize the truth
Remember the first Christmas
It almost seemed untrue
You promised that you'd always be with me
And I promised too

[Chorus]
C moon c moon c moon is she
C moon c moon c moon to me

[Verse 1]
How come no one older than me
Ever seems to understand the things I wanna to do?
It will be l7 and I'd never get to heaven
If I filled my head with glue
What's it all to you?

[Chorus]
C moon c moon c moon is she
C moon c moon c moon to me

[Verse 2]
Bobby lived with Patty
But they never told her daddy
What their love was all about
She could tell her lover that he thought but
She never was the type to let it out
What's it all about?

[Chorus]
C moon, c moon, oh c moon are we

[x2]

[Verse 3]
How come no one older than me
Ever seems to understand the things I wanna to do?
It will be l7 and I'd never get to heaven
If I filled my head with glue
What's it all to you?

[Chorus]
C moon c moon c moon is she
C moon c moon c moon to me

[Verse 4]
Bobby lived with Patty
But they never told her daddy
What their love was all about
She could tell her lover that he thought but
She never wanted to let it out
What's it all about?

[Chorus]
C moon, c moon, c moon are we

[x2]

[Outro]
Well what's it all about?
C moon, c moon, c moon are we
C moon are we

[Verse 1]
Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Used to be your arms around me
Your body on my body

[Chorus]
When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms, another's arms
When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms, another's arms

[Verse 2]
Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Is there someone there to reach me?
Someone there to find me?

[Chorus]
When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms, another's arms
And that's just torture to me
Another's arms, another's arms
Pull yourself into me
Another's arms, another's arms
When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms, another's arms

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Got to pull you close into me
Another's arms, another's arms
Pull yourself right through me
Another's arms, another's arms

[Outro]
Late night watching TV
Wish that you were here beside me
Wish that your arms were around me
Your body on my body

[Verse 1]
Me and my heart took a
Vow from the start and a
Vow to my heart i never break
Seasons may come and the
Seasons may go but know
Through every time and space
My love will always stay forever and always

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my heart, i love you
I can say these words to you without delay
If you're wondering just how long i'll love you
Try forever that's how long i'll feel this way

[Verse 2]
Me and my heart got a
Promise from the stars that they'd
Keep this love burning endlessly
People will come just as
People will go but know
Whatever life has in store
Through all eternity you will have my love for always

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yes, forever is how long my love will stay
Forever is a long, long time
But so what?

[Verse 1]
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Verse 2]
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Interlude]
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Introduction]

I think of you
I haven't slept
I think I do, but
I don't forget

My body moves
Goes where I will
But though I try
My heart stays still

It never moves
Just won't be led
And so my mouth waters to be fed
And you're always in my head

You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
Always in my
Always in my

This, I guess
Is to tell you you're chosen out
From the rest

[Verse 1]
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path

[Chorus]
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart, oh

[Chorus]
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I think I see you ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh)

[Verse 1]
You want a love to last forever
One that will never fade away
I wanna help you with your problem
Stick around, I say

[Chorus]
Coming up
Coming up, yeah
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, I say

[Verse 2]
You want a friend you can rely on
One who will never fade away
And if you're searching for an answer
Stick around, I say

[Chorus]
Coming up
Coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, yeah

[Verse 3]
You want some peace and understanding
So everybody can be free
I know that we can get together
We can make it, stick with me

[Chorus]
Coming up
Coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up for you and me

[Instrumental Break]
Coming up, coming up

[Chorus]
Coming up
Coming up, I say
Coming up like a flower
Coming up
Feel it in my bones

[Verse 4]
You want a better kind of future
One that everyone can share
You're not alone, we all could use it
Stick around, we're nearly there

[Chorus]
Coming up
Coming up
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, for all to share
Coming up, yeah
Coming up any way
Coming up like a flower
Coming up

[Verse 1]
Mister Marks, can you find for me
Someone strong and sweet fitting on my knee?
She can keep her job if she gets it wrong
Ah, but, Mister Marks, I won't need her long
All I need is help for a little while
We can take dictation and learn to smile
And a temporary secretary
Is what I need for to do the job
I need a

[Chorus]
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary

[Verse 2]
Mister Marks, could you send her quick?
'Cause my regular has been getting sick
I need a

[Chorus]
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary

[Verse 3]
Mister Marks, I can pay her well
If she comes along and can stay a spell
I will promise now that I'll treat her right
And will rarely keep her 'til late at night
I need a

[Bridge]
She can be a belly dancer
I don't need a true romancer
She can be a diplomat
But I don't need a girl like that
She can be a neurosurgeon
If she's doing nothing urgent
What I need's a temporary, temporary secretary
I need a, I need a

[Chorus]
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary

[Verse 4]
Now, Mister Marks, when I send her back
Will you please make sure she stays on the right track
Well, I know how hard it is for young girls these days
In the face of everything, to stay on the right track

[Bridge]
She can be a belly dancer
I don't need a true romancer
She can be a diplomat
But I don't need a girl like that
She can be a neurosurgeon
If she's doing nothing urgent
What I need's a temporary, temporary secretary

[Chorus]
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary
Temporary secretary

[Verse 1]
It's a tug of war
What with one thing and another
It's a tug of war
We expected more
But with one thing and another
We were trying to outdo each other
In a tug of war

[Chorus]
In another world
In another world we could
Stand on top of the mountain
With our flag unfurled
In a time to come
In a time to come we will be
Dancing to the beat played
On a different drum

[Verse 2]
It's a tug of war
Though I know I mustn't grumble
It's a tug of war
But I can't let go
If I do you'll take a tumble
And the whole thing is gonna crumble
It's a tug of war
(Pushin' and pushin', pullin' and pullin'
Pushin' and pullin')

[Bridge]
In years to come they may discover
What the air we breathe and the life we lead
Are all about
But it won't be soon enough
(Soon enough)
Soon enough for me
No, it won't be soon enough
(It won't be soon enough for me)
Soon enough for me

[Chorus]
In another world we could
Stand on top of the mountain
With our flag unfurled
In a time to come we will be
Dancing to the beat played
On a different drum
We will be dancing to the beat
Played on a different drum
We will be dancing to the beat
Played on a different drum

[Verse 3]
It's a tug of war
(A tug of war, a tug of war)
What with one thing and another
It's a tug of war
We expected more
But with one thing and another
We were trying to outscore each other
In a tug of war
(Pushin' and pushin'
Pullin' and pullin'
Pushin' and pullin')

[Verse 1]
Well, you know I'll always love you
But it would have been a lie
If I said that I could please you
Every moment that I try
Wouldn't want to see you crying
So l hope you don't mind the things I say
On the way

[Verse 2]
Well, we've been traveling for a long time
And we finally finished here
Though I said some things to hurt you
Well, it was only out of fear
Wouldn't want to see you crying
So l hope you don't mind the things I say
On the way

[Verse 3]
Well, you know I'll always love you
Everything will be alright
If I know you don't mind the things I say
On the way

[Outro]
I know you don't mind the things I say
On the way
Well, you know I'll always love you
Everything will be okay
If I know you don't mind the things I say
On the way

[Chorus]
Take it away
Want to hear you play 'til the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay 'til there's no one else around?
Take it away
Want to hear you play 'til the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay 'til there's no one else around?

[Verse 1]
Lonely driver out on the road
With a hundred miles to go
Sole survivor carrying the load
Switches on his radio

[Chorus]
Take it away
Want to hear you play 'til the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay 'til there's no one else around?
Take it away
Want to hear you play 'til the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay 'til there's no one else around?

[Verse 2]
In the audience watching the show
With a paper in his hand (In his hand, in his hand)
Some important impresario
Has a message for the band
Oh!

[Chorus]
Take it away
Want to hear you play 'til the lights go down (Down, doen)
Take it away
Don't you want to stay 'til there's no one else around?

[Bridge]
You never know who may be listening to ya
(Never know who may be listening to ya)
(You never know who may be listening to ya)
Take it away, take it away

[Verse 3]
After hours, late in the bar
By a darkened corner seat
Faded flowers wade in the jar
Till the evening is complete
(Complete, complete, complete)

[Outro]
(Hah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!)

[Verse 1]
Don't go jumping waterfalls
Please keep to the lake
People who jump waterfalls
Sometimes can make mistakes

[Chorus 1]
And I need love, yeah I need love
Like a second needs an hour
Like a raindrop needs a shower
Yeah I need love every minute of the day
And it wouldn't be the same
If you ever should decide to go away

[Instrumental Verse]

[Chorus 2]
And I need love, yeah I need love
Like a castle needs a tower
Like a garden needs a flower
Yeah I need love every minute of the day
And it wouldn't be the same
If you ever should decide to go away

[Verse 2]
Don't go chasing polar bears
In the great unknown
Some big friendly polar bear
Might want to take you home

[Chorus 1]
And I need love, yeah I need love
Like a second needs an hour
Like a raindrop needs a shower
Yeah I need love every minute of the day
And it wouldn't be the same
If you ever should decide to go away

[Verse 3]
Don't run after motor cars
Please stay on the side
Someone's glossy motor car
Might take you for a ride

[Chorus 3]
And I need love, yeah I need love
Like a castle needs a tower
Like a garden needs a flower
Yeah I need love, said I need love
Like a raindrop needs a shower
Like a second needs an hour
Every minute of the day
And it wouldn't be the same
If you ever should decide to go away

[Outro]
Don't go jumping waterfalls
Please keep to the lake

[Verse 1]
When your body is coming apart at the seams
And the whole thing's feeling low
You're convincing yourself that there's nobody there, I know
I know how you feel

[Verse 2]
Like somebody has taken the wheels off your car
When you had somewhere to go
Well it's annoying, not going to get very far, I know
But somebody cares

[Chorus]
There's always someone, somewhere
You should know by now
Always somebody who cares
It's happening day in, day out
Well you know by now
Always somebody who cares

[Post-Chorus]
And if you don't know it, how will it find you?
How will we know your whereabouts?
But I know how you feel

[Interlude]
I know how you feel

[Verse 3]
Like somebody has taken the wheels off your car
When you had somewhere to go
Well it's frustrating, not going to get very far, I know
But somebody cares

[Chorus]
There's always someone, somewhere
You should know by now
Always somebody who cares
It's happening day in, day out
Well you know by now
Always somebody who cares

[Post-Chorus]
And if you don't know it, how will it find you?
How will we know your whereabouts?
But I know how you feel

[Verse 1]
It's a tug of war
No, no, your troubles cease
When you learn to play the pipes of peace
It's a tug of war
No, no, your troubles cease
When you learn to play the pipes of peace
What with one thing and another
It's a tug of war
No, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
It's a tug of war
No, no, your troubles cease
When you learn to play the pipes of peace
It's a tug of war
Learn to play the pipes of peace

[Outro]
Pushing, pushing
Pulling, pulling
Pushing, pulling

[Intro]
I said nobody knows
Nobody knows

[Verse 1]
Which one of you can tell me what it is I'm looking at?
Anyone who can has got to be a crazy cat
I believe that nobody knows
(No, nobody knows)
Yeah, nobody knows, no
(Lord, I cannot tell you)
Well, that's the way I like it
Yeah now, nobody knows

[Verse 2: Mostly Instrumental]
Nobody knows
Oh, nobody knows
Well, Lord, you know that nobody knows

[Verse 3]
Samson and Delilah would have made a crazy pair
If that silly woman hadn't shaven off his hair
I believe that nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows (Nobody)
But that's the way I like it
Oh, now, nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no

[Verse 4: Mostly Instrumental]
Nobody knows, nobody knows
That's the way I like it, nobody knows

[Verse 5]
I may go hungry, maybe next week
Well if I do, baby, I'll still find something to eat
And you know, nobody knows
No, nobody knows
Well, that's the way I like it
Baby, nobody knows

[Verse 6]
And that includes you, honey
(Nobody knows)
I'll pay your rent
I'll do you right
(Nobody knows)
Most every night
But still there's nobody knows
No now, nobody knows
And that's the way I like to keep it
Just so nobody knows

[Intro]
I light a candle to our love
In love our problems disappear
But all in all, we'll soon discover
That one and one is all we long to hear

[Verse 1]
All around the world
Little children being born to the world
Got to give them all we can 'til the war is won
Then will the work be done?

[Chorus]
Help them to learn (Help them to learn)
Songs of joy instead of "burn, baby, burn" (Burn, baby, burn)
Let us show them how to play the pipes of peace
Play the pipes of peace

[Chorus 2]
Help me to learn
Songs of joy instead of "burn, baby, burn"
Won't you show me how to play (How to play)
The pipes of peace? (Pipes of peace)
Play the pipes of peace
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
What do you say? (Do you say)
Will the human race be run in a day? (In a day)
Or will someone save this planet we're playing on?
Is it the only one?
What are we going to do?

[Chorus 3]
Help them to see (Help them to see)
That the people here are like you and me (Like you and me)
Let us show them how to play (How to play)
The pipes of peace (Pipes of peace)
Play the pipes of peace
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
I light a candle to our love
In love our problems disappear
But all in all, we soon discover
That one and one is all we long to hear

[Verse]
Someone's sleeping
Through a bad dream
Tomorrow it will be over
For the world will soon be waking
To a summer's day

Someone's sleeping
Through a bad dream
Tomorrow it will be over
For the world will soon be waking
To a summer's day

[Verse 1]
Everybody bogey, dig that bogey beat
Man, that bogey rhythm smells so clean and sweet
Everybody bogey, bogey on to the street
Without bogey music, life is incomplete
Without bogey music, life is incomplete
Everybody bogey, dig that bogey beat

[Verse 2]
If you little bogeys want to sing along
Clean your bogey act up and learn the bogey song
Without bogey music, life is incomplete
Without bogey music, life is incomplete
Without bogey music, life is incomplete

[Chorus]
Bogey music, bogey music
Bogey music, bogey music

[Bridge]
Alright, here we are now
Tonight in Bogeyland

[Chorus]
Bogey music, bogey music

[Verse 3]
Well, when the younger bogeys hear that bogey sound
Every little bogey got to bogey down
Bogey, man, bogey
Bogey, man, bogey
Bogey, man, bogey on down

[Chorus]
Bogey music, bogey music
Bogey music, bogey music
Bogey music, bogey music
Bogey music
Bogey, man, bogey on down
Bogey music

[Verse 4]
All you little bogeys, I want you to sing along
Clean your bogey act up and learn the bogey song
Without bogey music, life is incomplete
You know it is, suckers

[Chorus]
Bogey music, bogey music
Bogey music, bogey music

[Intro: Stevie Wonder]
Good morning
Or good afternoon?
Good night

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder]
What's that you're doing?
Girl I like what you do to me
What's that you're doing?
'Cause it makes no kind of sense to me
You can make me feel so proud
You can make me holler ow!
Girl you make me want to dance and sing
My mind is blown and you're to blame
I say it's sunny when there's rain
I jump by leaps and bounds, just call my name

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
What's that you're saying?
Girl I likes the way you talk to me
What's that you're saying?
Even if it's wrong girl I do agree
Girl you make me feel so small
Though I might stand six feet tall
What you've got cuts me right down to size
I'll be the last, you'll be the first
I'll do my best to quench your thirst
I'm the lucky one who keeps the prize

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder & Paul McCartney]
Girl I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
Girl I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more
'Cause I like what you
Do to me, do to me
Do it some more
Do it to me, do it to me
Do it some more

[Ad lib: Stevie]
Do you know that I'm appreciating
What you do to me?

[Verse 3: Stevie Wonder & Paul McCartney]
What's that you're doing?
Girl I like what you do to me, ooh
What's that you're doing?
'Cause it makes no kind of sense to me
You can fill my appetite
Without me taking up a bite
Never knew that love could fill you up
You're much too good for me to pass
I'm for the taking, you just ask
We can make it stick with love and luck

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder & Paul McCartney]
Girl, I like what you're doing
(Girl, I like what you're doing)
Baby do it some more
Girl, I like what you're doing
(Girl, I like what you're doing)
Baby, do it some more
Do it to me, do it to me
Do it some more
You know I like what you're doing
Girl, I like what you're doing
Baby, do it some more

[Instrumental interlude with synth solo]
What's that you're doing?

[Verse 4: Stevie & Paul]
What's that I'm feeling?
That sensation's such a mystery
I know that it's thrilling
And I hope this feeling lasts eternally
Girl, you make me scream and shout
Tell me what it's all about
You make me give in without a fight
I don't have no words to say
You can fill it anyway
And everything you do will turn out right

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder & Paul McCartney]
Girl, I like what you're doing
Come on baby, do it some more
Girl, I like what you're doing
Baby do it some more

[Outro: Stevie Wonder & Paul McCartney]
We love you yeah yeah yeah
We love you yeah yeah yeah yeah
Baby, do it some more

Girl, I like what you're doing
When it's one o'clock, when it's two o'clock
When three, when four, when five o'clock
When it's seven o'clock, when it's eight o'clock
Nine and ten and eleven o'clock
When it's one o'clock, when it's two o'clock

Girl, I like what you're doing

[Verse 1]
I know I was a crazy fool
For treating you the way I did
But something took a hold of me
And I acted like a dustbin lid
I didn't give a second thought
To what the consequence might be
I really wouldn't be surprised
If you were trying to find another me

[Chorus]
'Cause the other me would rather be the glad one
The other me would rather play the fool
I want to be the kind of me
That doesn't let you down as a rule

[Verse 2]
I know it doesn't take a lot
To have a little self-control
But every time that I forgot
Well I landed in another hole
But everytime you pull me out
I find it harder not to see
That we can build a better life
If I can try to find the other me

[Chorus]
The other me would rather be the glad one
Yeah, the other me would rather play the fool
Said I want to be the kind of me
That doesn't let you down as a rule

[Bridge]
But if I ever hurt you
Well you know that it's not real
It's not easy living by yourself
So imagine how I feel

[Verse 3]
I wish that I could take it back
I'd like to make a different mood
And if you let me try again
I'll have a better attitude
Well I know that one and one makes two
And that's what I want us to be
I really would appreciate it
If you'd help me find the other me

[Chorus]
The other me would rather be the glad one
The other me would rather play the fool
But I want to be the kind of me
That doesn't let you down as a rule

[Verse]
Got a place
We can go
Lights are low
Let me show you to my darkroom

[Chorus]
Come a-come along with me to my darkroom
Come a-come along with me to my darkroom

Come a-come along with me to my darkroom
Come a-come along with me to my darkroom

Ah come a-come a-come a-come a-come on
Come a-come along
Cah-cah-cah-cah-cah-cah-cah-cah-cah-cah-cah come on
Ah

[Verse]
Got a place
We can go
Lights are low
Let me show you to my darkroom

[Chorus]
Come a-come along with me to my darkroom (Got a place)
Come a-come along with me to my darkroom (We can go)

[Verse]
Got a place
We can go
Lights are low
Let me show you to my darkroom

[Outro]
Come a-come along with me to my darkroom

[Intro]
Love, I'm going to pick you up in the morning
Love, I'm going to take you out on a journey
I don't know where I'm going to
But I know what I've been going through
Without you by my side

[Verse 1]
What good is butter if you haven't got bread?
What good is art when it hurts your head?
Might as well be in bed
Keep under cover 'til the battle has ceased
Keep out of trouble 'til the prisoners are released

[Verse 2]
What good's a puzzle when you haven't a clue?
What good is me when I'm not with you?
Might as well stay in bed
Keep under cover till the clouds disappear
Keep out of trouble till the weather is bright and clear

[Chorus]
Love, I'm going to pick you up
I'm going to take you out
I don't know what I'm gonna do
But I know what I've been going through
Without you by my side
Without you by my side

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
What good is tennis when there isn't a ball?
What good's a curtain without a call?
Might as well be in bed
Keep under cover till the battle has ceased
Keep out of trouble till the prisoners are released

[Chorus]
Love, I'm going to pick you up (I'm going to pick you up)
I'm going to take you out (Yes, I'll be taking you out)
I don't know what I'm going to do
But I know what I've been going through
Without you by my side (Without you by my side)
Without you by my side

[Outro]
Keep under cover
Keep under cover, yeah
Keep under cover, ooh
Keep under cover, ah ah ah ah
Keep under cover

[Verse 1]
One of these days, when my feet are on the ground
I'm gonna look around and see
See what's right, see what's there
And breathe fresh air ever after

[Verse 2]
One of these days, when a job just takes too long
I'm gonna sing my song and see
See what's right, see what's there
And breathe fresh air ever after

[Bridge]
It's there, it's round
It's to be found
By you, by me
It's all we ever wanted to be

[Verse 3]
One of these days, when we both are at our ease
When you've got time to please yourself
See what's right and see what's there
And breathe fresh air ever after

[Bridge]
It's there, it's round
It's to be found
By you, by me
It's all we ever wanted to see

[Verse 1]
One of these days, when my feet are on the ground
I'm gonna look around and see
See what's right and see what's there
And breathe fresh air ever after

[Outro]
Ever after
Breathe fresh air ever after

[Verse 1]
There is a pain, inside my heart
You mean so much to me
Girl I love you, girl I love you so bad
And if you leave my pain will go
But that's no good to me
Girl I love you, yes I love you so bad

[Chorus]
Well it feels so good, sometimes it feels so bad
This is worse than anything I've ever had

[Verse 2]
There was a pain but now you're here
And I don't fear a thing
Girl I love you, yes I love you so bad
And she said, boy I love you
Boy I love you so bad

[Refrain]
Girl, I love you
Girl, I love you so bad

[Chorus]
Well it feels so good, sometimes it feels so bad
This is worse than anything I've ever had

[Verse 2]
There was a pain but now you're near
And I don't fear a thing
Girl I love you, girl I love you so bad
She said, boy I love you
Boy I love you so bad

[Outro]
Girl, I love you
Girl, I love you

[Verse 1]
There's a man
Who plays the game of life so well
Ooh there's such a man
His thoughts you can never tell
Ooh

[Chorus 1]
And it's just the way he thought it would be
'Cause the day has come for him to be free
Then he laughs, he kicks then rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

And it's just the way he thought it would be
'Cause the day has come for him to be free
Then he laughs, he kicks then rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

[Verse 2]
There's a man
Everybody thought they knew
Ooh there's such a man
He's not like me and you
Ooh

[Chorus 2]
And it's just the way she thought it would be
As he says, something has happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

And it's just the way he thought it would be
'Cause the day has come for him to be free
Then he laughs as he smiles and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Did you know this man can do anything?
Ooh there's such a man
I wish that we could bring
Ooh

[Chorus 3]
And it's just the way he thought it would be
'Cause the day has come for him to be free
Then he laughs, he kicks then rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man
And it's just the way he thought it would be
'Cause the day has come for him to be free
Then he laughs, he kicks then rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man

[Outro]
This is the man
This is the man
This is the man

[Verse 1]
Light out wanderlust
Head us out to sea
Captain says there'll be a bust
This one's not for me

Take us from the dark
Out where we can see
Captain's out to make his mark
This one's not to be

[Chorus]
Light out wanderlust
Help us to be free
Light out wanderlust
Do it just for me
Wanderlust

[Verse 2]
Oh where did I go wrong, my love?
What petty crime was I found guilty of?
What better time to find a brand new day?
Oh - wanderlust away

[Chorus]
Light out wanderlust
Help us to be free
Light out wanderlust
Do it just for me
Wanderlust

[Verse 3]
Captain's out to make his mark
This one's not to be

[Verse 1/Verse 2 countermelody]
Light out wanderlust
(Oh where did I go wrong, my love?)
Head us out to sea
(What petty crime was I found guilty of?)
Captain says there'll be a bust
(What better time to find a brand new day?)
This one's not for me
(Oh - wanderlust away)

[Outro]
Dropping a line
Maybe this time
It's wanderlust for me

[Verse 1]
Well, I used to smile when I was a pup
Sailing down the Nile in a china cup
With the recipe for a lovely day
Sticking out of my back pocket

[Pre-Chorus]
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Then we made it up in the ballroom

[Chorus 1]
Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your ballroom dancing
Seen it on TV
I got what I got from ballroom dancing
Big B.D.

[Verse 2]
Well, I used to fly when I was a kid
And I didn't cry if it hurt a bit
On a carpet ride to a foreign land
At the time of Davy Crockett

[Pre-Chorus]
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till we made it up in the ballroom

[Chorus 2]
Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your ballroom dancing
Seen it on TV
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing
Big B.D.

...tell you the band is ready. We're starting with the first of five dancers in this competition: that's the cha-cha-cha!

[Verse 3]
Well, it went so fast and we all grew up
Now the days that passed in the china cup
Are the memories of another day
And I wouldn't want to knock it

[Pre-Chorus]
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Then we made it up in the ballroom

[Chorus 2]
Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your ballroom dancing
Seen it on TV
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing
Big B.D.
Oh!

[Intro]
The pound is sinking, the peso's falling
The lira's reeling and feeling quite appalling

[Verse 1]
The mark is holding, the franc is fading
The drachma's very weak, but everyone's still trading
The market's bottom has fallen right out
And only the strong are survivors

[Bridge 1]
Well, I fear, my dear, that it's eminently clear
That you can't see the trees for the forest
Your father was an extraordinary man
But you don't seem to have inherited many of his mannerisms
Oh, any of his mannerisms

[Verse 2]
The dollar's moving, the ruble's rising
The yen is keeping up, which hardly seems surprising
The market's bottom has fallen right out
And only the stout are survivors

[Bridge 2]
Hear me, my lover (Hear me lover)
I can't be held responsible now (Oh no, it wasn't me)
For something that didn't happen (I didn't do it anyway)
I knew you for a minute
Oh, it didn't happen only for a minute
Your heart just wasn't in it anymore
Mmm, hmm

[Outro]
The pound is sinking, the peso's falling
The lira's reeling and feeling quite appalling

[Verse 1]
Well, they can treat you like a brother
Yeah, they can treat you like a clown
But if they treat you like a lover
They've got the sweetest little show in town

[Chorus]
You got the sweetest little show
Sweetest little show
Sweetest little show in town

[Bridge]
You've been around a long time
But you're still good for a while
And if they try to criticize you
Make 'em smile, make 'em smile

[Verse 2]
And if they treat you like a brother
Well you will never, never let 'em down
But if they treat you like a lover
They've got the sweetest little show in town

[Chorus]
They got the sweetest little show
Sweetest little show
Sweetest little show in town

You've got the sweetest little show
Sweetest little show
Sweetest little show in town

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
You got the sweetest little show
Sweetest little show

[Chorus 1]
Look at the average person
Speak to the man in the street
Can you imagine the first one you'd meet?

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm talking to a former engine driver (driver)
Trying to find out what he used to do
Tells me that he always kept his engine (engine)
Spit and polished up as good as new
But he said his only great ambition
Was to work with lions in a zoo
(Oh, to work with lions in a zoo)
Yes dear, you heard right
Told me his ambition was to work with lions every night

[Chorus 2]
Look at the average person
Speak to the man on the beat
Can you imagine the first one you'd meet?

[Verse 2]
Well, I met a woman working as a waitress (waitress)
I asked exactly what it was she did
Said she worked the summer crowd at seasides (seasides)
Winter time she ran away and hid
Once she had a Hollywood audition
But the part was given to a kid
Yes, the part was given to a kid
Yes sir, you heard right
Hollywood ambition made a starlet grow up overnight

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Well I bumped into a man who'd been a boxer (boxer)
Asked him what had been his greatest night
He looked into the corners of his memory (memory)
Searching for a picture of the fight
But he said he always had a feeling
That he lacked a little extra height
(Could've used a little extra height)
Yes mate, you heard right
He always had a feeling that he might have lacked a little height

[Chorus 3]
Look at the average person
Speak to the man in the queue
Can you imagine the first one is you?

[Outro]
Look at the average person

[Intro]
We wasted time and again on things
Things we already knew
Born to do, I give my love to you

[Verse 1]
Whenever you get some time
Whenever you get some time
I'd like to roll it all up in a ball
And spend it with you
You've got the power of love
And love has the power to make it come true

[Chorus 1]
We can go through our love
We can do things that they said were impossible
Though our love
We can do all that we want to do
We can go through our love
We can go through our love

[Verse 2]
Whenever you will be mine
Whenever you will be mine
I want to be with you
Just want to do whatever feels right
You've got the power of love
And love has the power to turn on the light

[Chorus 2]
Here we go through our love
We can see things that they said were invisible
Through our love
We can see where we are going to
We're going through our love
Through our love
We can learn to do things that they said were impossible
Through our love
We can be blessed with a better view
We can go through our love
We can go through our love
We can go through our love

[Chorus: Paul]
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it don't forget
It doesn't come around again
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it and you've got to get it good

[Verse 1: Carl & Paul]
Once I had a little Spanish guitar
The neighbours told me I could go pretty far
Well I came and I went
And my guitar got bent
But I discovered that the people who love
Are what we need if we're to get up above it all
And that's that
Unless the world is flat

[Chorus: Carl & Paul]
I want to get it mm mm
I want to get it just in case
It doesn't come around again
I want to get it mm mm
I want to get it and I wanna get it good

[Verse 2: Carl & Paul]
Pardon me if I've been misunderstood
I want to get it while the going is good
The telephone rang
About a song I sang
The life of Cadillac and ultra for sure
Is automatic for a lady demure
She came and she went
Without a single dent

[Chorus: Carl & Paul]
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it don't forget
It doesn't come around again
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it and you've got to get it good

(I get you
Go get)

[Chorus: Carl & Paul]
Come on, let's get it mm mm
Come on, let's get it don't forget
It doesn't come around again
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it and you've got to get it good

[Intro]
Now I know that it can easily happen
To someone like me
I don't want to step on anybody's toes

[Verse 1]
Who knows how to find love
Think before you give your answer
Who knows what a mystery may bring

[Chorus 1]
Once in a life I'm a lucky man
If I can find the kind of love
That's going to last for me
Twice in a lifetime
Is one of those unspoken dreams
We usually reserve for fantasy

[Verse 2]
Who knows how we find love
Stop before you give your answer
Who knows where the mystery begins
I know, I know
I know because it's happening to me
I know, I know

[Chorus 2]
Twice in a lifetime
Is one of those unspoken dreams
We usually reserve for fantasy

[Verse 3]
Who knows how to find love
You stop before you give the answer
Who knows what a mystery begins
I know, I know
I know because it's happening to me
I know, I know

[Outro]
Oh I know, I know
I know because it's happening to me
I know, I know

[Chorus]
Ooh, the one you wanted to be is now the one you see
Ooh, the one you wanted to be is now the one you see

[Verse 1]
Win or lose, sink or swim
One thing is certain, we'll never give in
Side by side, hand in hand
We all stand together

[Verse 2]
Play the game, fight the fight
But what's the point on a beautiful night?
Arm in arm, hand in hand
We all stand together

[Bridge]
La la la la la la la la
Keeping us warm in the night
La la la la la la la la la la la
Walk in the light
You'll get it right
La la la la la la la la
Keeping us warm in the night
La la la la la la la la la la la
Walk in the light
You'll get it right

[Verse 3]
Win or lose, sink or swim
One thing is certain, we'll never give in
Arm in arm, hand in hand
We all stand together

[Outro]
We all stand together

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I know it isn't easy to refuse
A lot of thoughts are flying through your head
Tell me this before you have to choose
Would you rather be alive or dead?

[Chorus 1]
It's as simple as that (simple as that)
Would you rather be alive or dead
It's as simple as that (simple as that)
It's so simple, it makes you want to cry

[Verse 2]
They ask you if you want to join in
You linger for a minute or so
Well, now's a perfect time to begin
Are you going to say yes or no?

[Chorus 1]
It's as simple as that (simple as that)
Are you going to say yes or no?
It's as simple as that (simple as that)
It's so simple, it makes you want to cry

[Chorus 3]
And if you love your life
Everybody will love you too
Yes, if you love your life
Everybody will love you too

[Verse 3]
It's harder when you start to get around
I want you to remember what I said
I know you never like to let them down
But would you rather be alive or dead?

[Chorus 1]
It's as simple as that (simple as that)
Would you rather be alive or dead
It's as simple as that (simple as that)
It's so simple, it makes me want to cry
It's so simple, it makes you want to cry

[Chorus 3]
Yes, if you love your life
Everybody will love you too
And if you love your life
Everybody will love you too

[Bridge]
Would you rather be alive or dead?
Would you rather be alive or dead?
It's as simple as that (it's as simple as that)
It's as simple as that (it's as simple as that)
It's as simple as that (it's as simple as that)

[Chorus 3]
And if you love your life
Everybody will love you too
Yes, if you love your life
Everybody will love you too

[Outro]
And if you love, and if you love
And if your love

[Verse 1]
You can dress me up as a robber
But I won't be in disguise
Only love is a robber
And he lives within your eyes
Ooh, ooh eee ooh

[Verse 2]
You can dress me up as a sailor
But I'll never run to sea
As long as your love is available to me
What do I do with a sea of blue?
Ooh, eee ooh
Pa pa, pa pa, pa-ra-ra

[Chorus]
(Dressing me up)
It doesn't make a difference
What you want to do
Whichever way you look at it
I'm still in love with you
If we go on forever
I may never make a change

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 2]
(Dressing me up) (Dressing me up)
And if I don't convince you
You needn't look too far
To see that I'm not lying
'Cause I love you the way you are
And what's the point of changing
When I'm happy as I am?

[Verse 3]
Well you can dress me up as a soldier
But I wouldn't know what for
I was the one that told you he loved you
Don't wanna go to another war
No, no, no
Pa, pa pa, pa-ra-ra

[Chorus]
Ebony and ivory
Live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we?

[Verse]
We all know that people are the same where ever you go
There is good and bad in everyone
And we learn to live, we learn to give each other
What we need to survive together alive

[Chorus]
Ebony and ivory
Live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we?

[Bridge]
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory, ooh

[Verse]
We all know that people are the same where ever you go
There is good and bad in everyone
We learn to live when we learn to give each other
What we need to survive together alive

[Chorus]
Ebony and ivory
Live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we?
Side by side on my piano keyboard
Oh Lord, why don't we?

[Outro]
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory
Living in perfect harmony

[Verse 1]
Babe
There's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?
Babe
There's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No tired sigh, no rolling eyes
No irony
No "Who cares?", no vacant stare
No time for me

[Chorus]
Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

[Verse 2]
Babe
There's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin?
Babe
There's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this
Oh, what a sin

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To the strand, a picnic planned
For you and me
A rope in hand for your other man
To hang from a tree

[Chorus]
Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to hide outside your door

[Intro]
Feel like you've never fit before

[Chorus 1]
Here we are
Where are we
Cast adrift on some uncharted sea
I know we'll find our way
I know we'll reach the end
If you will say you'll be my secret friend

[Chorus 2]
Night draws in, once again
As she turns her velvet collar up
A perfect day will end
If you will say you'll be my secret friend

[Chorus 3]
Feel like you've never fell before, once more

[Chorus 2]
Night draws in, once again
As she turns her velvet collar up
A perfect day will end
If you will say you'll be my secret friend

[Chorus 3]
Feel like you've never fell before, once more

[Chorus 1]
Here we are
Where are we
Cast adrift on some uncharted sea
I know we'll find our way
I know we'll reach the end
If you will say you'll be my secret friend

[Chorus 3]
Feel like you've never fell before, once more

[Bridge]
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you

[Chorus 2]
Night draws in, once again
As she turns her velvet collar up
A perfect day will end
If you will say you'll be my secret friend

[Chorus 3]
Feel like you've never fell before, once more

[Chorus 1]
Here we are
Where are we
Cast adrift on some uncharted sea
I know we'll find our way
I know we'll reach the end
If you will say you'll be my secret friend

[Outro]
I need you
I need you

[Verse 1]
I can wait another day until I call you
Mm-hm
You've only got my heart on a string
And everything aflutter (na na na na)
But another lonely night might take forever (na na na na)
We've only got each other to blame
It's all the same to me love

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cause I know
What I feel
To be right

[Chorus 1]
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

[Verse 2]
May I never miss the thrill
(Na-na-na na, Na-na-na na)
Of being near you
(Na-na-na-na-na-na)
And if it takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I will do
What I feel
To be right

[Chorus 2]
No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

[Bridge 1]
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away

[Guitar solo: David Gilmour]

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Yes, I know
What I feel
To be right

[Chorus 3]
No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

[Bridge 2]
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
And I won't go away until you tell me so
No, I'll never go away
No more lonely nights
No, no
Hoo

[C part with guitar solo by David Gilmour]

[Intro]
If this keeps up, we're gonna be in London til Boxing Day!

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 1]
I need to laugh and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 2]
We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as I touch the ground

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Verse 3]
Then we lie, beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good (she feels good), she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine

[Chorus]
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

[Intro]
My brave, my brave
My brave face

[Verse 1]
I've been living in style
Unaccustomed as I am
To the luxury life
I've been hitting the town
And it didn't hit back

[Verse 2]
I've been doing the rounds
Unaccustomed as I am
To the time on my hands
Now I don't have to tell anybody
When I'm gonna get back

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since you went away
I've had this sentimental inclination
Not to change a single thing
As I pull the sheet back on the bed
I wanna go bury my head in your pillow

[Chorus]
Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
And take me to that place
Where I can't find my brave face
Where I can't find my brave face
My brave, my brave, my brave face
My brave face

[Verse 3]
Well, I've been living a lie
Unaccustomed as I am
To the work of a housewife
I've been breaking up
Dirty dishes and been throwing them away

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since you left I have been trying to
Compose a "Baby, will you please come home?" note
Meant for you
As I clear away another
Untouched T.V. dinner
From the table I laid for two

[Chorus]
Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
And take me to that place
Where I can't find my brave face
Where I can't find my brave face
My brave, my brave, my brave face
My brave face

[Verse 1]
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there
I'm going to get me one

[Verse 2]
I'm going to be standing on the corner
12th Street and Vine
I'm going to be standing on the corner
12th Street and Vine
With my Kansas City baby and a bottle of Kansas City wine

[Chorus 1]
Hey, hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Hey now, baby (hey, hey)
Whoo now (whoo whoo)
Yeah, yeah (hey now)
Tell me, baby, what's been wrong with you, oh yeah

But if I have to walk, yeah, I'm going just the same
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little lovin' there
I'm going to get me one, oh

[Verse 4]
Well, I might take a train, I might take a plane
But if I have to get on my back, I'm going just the same
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come, I'm goin' home, yeah
They got some crazy little women there
I'm going to get me one
Hey, hey

[Chorus 2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Hey, baby (hey, hey)
Yeah, there (hey, hey)
Yeah, yeah (hey now)
Tell me, baby, what's been wrong with you, oh yeah

[Verse 5]
Well, I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
They got some crazy little women there
I'm going to get me one

[Chorus 3]
Hey, hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Hey now, baby (hey, hey)
Yeah, there (hey, hey)
Whoo (hey now)
Hey now, baby, what's been wrong with you, hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Hey now, baby (hey, hey)
Hey, there gal (hey, hey)
Hey now (hey now)
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come

[Verse 1]
Is the answer in his eyes?
Is the answer in her smile?
Or in the words that you first hear her say
Is it in the nick of time?
First impression in your mind
Do you know it all in just one day?

[Chorus]
How will i know she loves me?
How will i know she cares?
It's hard for true love to find you, find you
So easy to feel you're there
How will i know she loves me?
I know all things in time
Well, i have no problem waiting, waiting
For true love forever mine

[Verse 2]
Is the answer in her glance?
The first time you're holding hands
Or in the moment that feels oh so right
Is it in her tenderness?
Or the magic of his kiss
Or in the sweet love you make through the night

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I needed loving, I needed a friend
I needed something that would be there in the end

[Chorus]
Of the rough ride to Heaven
Want to get inside, what will I do?
Oh, on a rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside to be with you

[Verse 2]
I knew you'd help me, I knew you could
You knew I didn't want to be misunderstood

[Chorus]
On the rough ride to Heaven
Want to be inside, what'll I do?
Oh, on a rough ride to Heaven
I want to be inside to be with you

[Bridge]
I'm not asking for an easy passage
So I hope you understand
I'm not after any special treatment
But I wouldn't mind a hand

[Outro]
On a rough ride, on a rough ride
On a rough ride
On a rough ride
Rough ride to Heaven
If I want to get inside, what will I do?
Whoa oh
What will I do? What will I do?
Rough ride
A rough ride
A rough ride
A rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside, what will I do?
Hey on a rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside to be with you
A rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside
Want to be with you
Rough ride to Heaven
Ooh I want to be inside with you
On a rough ride

[Verse]
Yesterday all my trouble seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday

Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

[Verse 1]
Ooh, well, I got a girl with a record machine
When it comes to rocking, she's a queen
Went to a dance on a Saturday night
All alone where I could hold her tight
She lives on the twentieth floor uptown
The elevator's broken down

[Chorus]
So I walk one, two flight, three flight four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag
Fifteen before I'm ready to drag
Get to the top and I'm too tired to rock

[Verse 2]
Well, she, she called me up on the telephone
Said, "Come on over, baby, I'm all alone"
I said, "Baby, you're mighty sweet
But I'm in bed with a aching feet"
This went on for a couple of days
But I could not stay away

[Chorus]
So I walk one, two flight, three flight four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag
Fifteen before I'm ready to drag
Get to the top and I'm too tired to rock
You know I'm too tired baby

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, sent to Chicago for repairs
Till it's fixed I'm using the stairs
I hope they hurry, before it's too late
You know, I love my baby too much to wait
All this climbing is getting me down
They'll find my corpse draped over the rail

[Chorus]
So I walk one, two flight, three flight four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag
Fifteen before I'm ready to drag
Get to the top and I'm too tired to rock

[Verse 1]
Ooh, well, I got a girl with a record machine
When it comes to rocking, she's a queen
Went to a dance on a Saturday night
All alone where I could hold her tight
She lives on the twentieth floor uptown
The elevator's broken down

[Chorus]
So I walk one, two flight, three flight four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag
Fifteen before I'm ready to drag
Get to the top and I'm too tired to rock

[Verse 1]
Yes it's me and I'm in love again
Had no loving since you don't know when
You know I love you, yes I do
And I'm saving all my loving just for you

[Verse 2]
I need your loving and I need it bad
Just like a dog that's going mad
Ooh-ee baby ooh-ooh-ee
Baby won't you give your love to me

[Verse 3]
Eenie meenie and miney mo
Told you don't want me around no more
Ooh-ee baby ooh-ooh-ee
Baby don't you let your dog bite me

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 1]
Yes it's me and I'm in love again
Had no loving since you don't know when
You know I love you, yes I do
And I'm saving all my loving just for you

[Verse 2]
I need your loving, I need you bad
Just like a dog when he's going mad
Ooh-ee baby ooh-ooh-ee
Baby won't you give your love to me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I need your loving, I need it bad
I'm like a doggie when he's going mad
Ooh-ee baby ooh-ooh-ee
Baby won't you give your love to me

[Verse 3]
Eenie meenie and miney-mo
Told me you didn't want me 'round no more
Ooh-ee baby ooh-ooh-ee
Baby don't you let your dog bite me

[Verse 1]
Yes it's me and I'm in love again
I've had no loving since I don't know when
You know I love you, yes I do
And I'm saving all my loving just for you, now

[Verse 3]
Eenie meenie and miney-mo
Told me you didn't want me 'round no more
Ooh-ee baby ooh-ooh-ee
Baby don't you let your dog bite me

[Verse 1]
She makes me go so wrong
(Yeah you kept me awake you know you did)
I've loved her oh so long
(So why don't you come right out and say it, stupid?)

[Chorus]
She makes me do things I don't want to do
I don't know why I should be telling you
I know that you want her too

[Verse 2]
My intentions are quite sincere
(That's not what you said the other night)
And all you can do is sneer
(So go ahead and kid yourself, you're right)

[Chorus]
She makes me do things I don't want to do
I don't know why I should be telling you
I know that you want her too

[Bridge]
I've got a better chance than you do
I know that you want her too
You're such a hopeless romantic
She told me you're so predictable and nice
She only did you a favor once or twice (once or)
Once or twice

[Verse 3]
She makes me go so wrong
(So why don't you lie back and enjoy it?)
My conscience is clear and strong
(Yes, she says I'm just the boy for it)

[Chorus]
She makes me do things I don't want to do
I don't know why I should be telling you
I know that you want her too
I know that you want her too
I know that you want her too

[Verse 1]
If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind

[Chorus]
Oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
You know I laughed when you left
But now I know I've only hurt myself

[Chorus]
Oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I'll bring you jewelry and money too
But that's not all I'm going to do for you, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, now won't you bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bring it home

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
You know I'll always be your slave
Oh, till I'm dead and buried in my grave, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, why don't you bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh, if you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind

[Chorus]
Oh, why don't you bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)

[Verse 1]
You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs
But i look around me and i see it isn't so
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs

[Chorus 1]
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know, because here i go again
I love you, i love you

[x2]

[Verse 2]
I can't explain the feeling's plain to me; say can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me
Now can't you see

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when i'm in it
It isn't silly, no, it isn't silly, love isn't silly at all

[Chorus 2]

[x2]
How can i tell you about my loved one?

[x3]
(i love you)
How can i tell you about my loved one?
(i love you)

[Verse 1]
What is this thing in life that persuades me to spend
Time away from you?
If you can answer this, you can have the moon
This is the place to be, any way you can see
There's a lovely view
Why are there always so many other things to do?

[Chorus 1]
Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing 'round my head
When I'm alone, I think of you
And the life we'd lead if we could only be free
From these distractions

[Verse 2]
The postman's at the door
While the telephone rings on the kitchen wall
Pretend we're not at home and they'll disappear
I want to be with you, tell me what I can do
Nothing is too small
Away from all this jazz we could do anything at all

[Chorus 2]
Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing around my head
When I'm alone, I think of you
And the things we'd do if we could only be through
With these distractions

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'll find the peaceful place
Far away from the noise of a busy day
Where we can spend our nights
Counting shooting stars

[Chorus 2]
Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing around my head
When I'm alone I think of you
And the things we'd do if we could only be through
With these distractions

[Chorus 1]
Like butterflies are buzzing around my head
When I'm alone, I think of you
And the life we'd lead if we could only be free
From these distractions

[Verse 1]
Well, you've got me dancing in a figure of eight
Don't know if I'm coming or going, I'm early or late
Round and round the ring I go
I want to know
I want to know, hey

[Verse 2]
Why can't we travel a continuous line?
Make love a reliable covenant all the time
Up and down the hills I go
I got to know
I got to know

[Chorus]
Is it better to love one another
Than to go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yeah, we'd better take good care of each other
Avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eight

[Bridge]
Well, figure it out for yourself, little girl
It don't go nowhere at all
It's nothing more than a tape loop in a big dance hall

[Verse 3]
You've got me running in a figure of eight
Don't know if I'm coming or going, early or late
Round and round I go
I want to know
I want to know

[Chorus]
Say is it better to love one another
Than to go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yes, we'd better take good care of one other
And avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eight

[Verse 1]
I laughed at the teachers
Who taught in my school
They kept one arm bandits
In the swimming pool
They don't understand me
But they never will
And if was there
I'd be telling them still

[Chorus]
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more

[Verse 2]
I followed the leader
Into her tent
But nobody told me that she owed some rent

[Chorus]

[x2]
She wanted to love me, I wanted to go
But she taught me things that I needed to know
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more

[x4]

[Verse 3]
I talked to my lawyer, he picked up my bail
Won't someone get me out of this lousy jail
We're both in agreement that grime never pays
And I should be out in a couple of days

[Chorus]
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more
I'm not such a bad boy no more, no more, no more

[Verse 1]
Lucille, please come back where you belong
Lucille, please come back where you belong
You ran off and married
Singing such a beautiful song

[Verse 2]
Lucille, please don't do your sisters will, yeah
Lucille, please don't you do your sisters will
You ran off and married
But I love you still

[Bridge]
Well, I woke up this morning
Lucille was not in sight
Asked my friends about it
But all their lips were tight

[Verse 4]
Lucille, please come back where you belong
I'm singin' to you, baby
Singing such a beautiful song

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Well, I woke up this morning
Lucille was not in sight
Asked my friends about it
But all their lips were tight

[Verse 4]
Lucille, please come back where you belong
I'm speakin' to you, baby
You're singing such a beautiful song
Ah, come on now, Lucille

[Bridge]
Well, I woke up this morning
Lucille was not in sight
Asked my friends about it
But all their lips were tight

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 4]
Lucille, please come back where you belong
I'm singin' to you, baby
Singin' such a beautiful song

[Verse 2]
Well Lucille, please don't do your sisters will, yeah
Lucille, please don't you do your sisters will
Well, you ran off and married
But I love you still

[Verse 1]
I hear them telling me that you're selling off the furniture
And even keep my personalized autographs
You might as well go all the way and sell your granny to the zoo
And while you're at it, may I go to my psychiatrist ?
He's making money out of making me laugh
But I don't mind , I wish that I could say the same about you

[Chorus]
It seems to me that you've still got no values
Oh you know you're not so hot, no values
And I'll be glad if you went away again
No values . . . no values . . . no values at all

[Verse 2]
The city shark is at the dark and of the alleyway
You pays your money and you takes your choice
The artful dodger says he wants to pick a pocket or two
But you, you've taken up a place in high society
A personal friend of messes rolls and Royce
Got them all convinced that everything you say to them is true

[Chorus]
It seems to me that you've still got no values
Oh you know you're not so hot, no values
You know you've got a lot, but no values
And I'd be glad if you went away again
No values . . . no values . . . no values at all

[Verse 3]
I like your wife's smile, I like her car
If I had your lifestyle, I wouldn't go far wrong
On the waters of life you row your boat
Into the strongest tide that you can find
On the darkest of nights we were two of a kind
We went through it all before the tide went out
And left us stranded on the shore
How was I to know

[x2]

[Chorus]
Well you ain't got no values
You know you think you're hot, no values
You know you've got a lot, but no values
And I'd be glad if you went away again
No values . . . no values . . . no values at all

[Intro]
Well...

[Verse 1]
I missed the Saturday dance
I might have gone, but what for?
It's awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore

[Verse 2]
But I thought I'd visit the club
I got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

[Bridge]
Oh, darling I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why bring my memo-
Why bring my memo-, why bring my memories?

[Verse 3]
Been invited on dates
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Oh, darling I guess
My mind's more at ease
But nevertheless
Why bring my memo-, why bring my memo-
Why bring my memories

[Verse 2]
I thought I'd visit the club
I got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
Oh

[Verse 1]
Your day breaks
Your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up
She wakes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

[Chorus]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 2]
You want her
You need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

[Chorus]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 3]
You stay home
She goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone, but no hes gone
She doesn't need him
Your day breaks
Your mind aches
There will be times when all the things you said will fill your head
You won't forget her

[Chorus]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 1]
Well that's all right, mama
That's all right for you
That's all right mama
Just anyway you do

[Chorus]
Well that's all right
That's all right
That's all right my mama, anyway you do

[Verse 2]
Well my mama she done told me
My papa done told me too
"Son, that gal you're fooling with
She ain't no good for you"

[Chorus]
Well, that's all right
That's all right
That's all right my mama, anyway you do

[Verse 3]
Well I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Then you won't be bothered with me
Hanging around your door

[Chorus]
Well, that's all right
That's all right
That's all right my mama, anyway you do

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Well my mama she done told me
Papa done told me too
"Son, that gal you're fooling with
She isn't no gal for you"

[Chorus]
That's all right
That's all right
That's all right my mama, anyway you do

[Verse 3]
Well now I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Then you won't be bothered with me
Hanging around your door

[Chorus]
Well, that's all right
That's all right
That's all right, my mama, anyway you do
Oh, come on now

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm leaving town, baby
Now I'm leaving town for sure
Then you won't be bothered with me
Hanging around your door

[Chorus]
Well, that's all right
That's all right
That's all right my mama, anyway you do

[Outro]
Well da da dee dee dee dee, a dee dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee
I need your lovin'
That's all right
That's all right, my mama, anyway you do
Well, that's all right, my mama, anyway you do
Well, that's all right, my mama, anyway you do

[Intro]
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

[Verse 1]
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding was been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for ?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people, where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong ?

[Verse 2]
Father McKenzie, writing the words to a sermon that no one will near
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care ?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people, where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong ?
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

[Verse 3]
Eleanor Rigby died in church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

[Chorus]
All the lonely people, where do they all come from ?
(ah, look at all the lonely people)
All the lonely people, where do they all belong ?
(ah, look at all the lonely people)

[Verse 1]
It's summertime
And the living is easy
The fish are jumping
And the cotton is high, oh yeah
Your daddy's rich
And your mama's good looking
So hush, hush little baby
Don't, don't you cry

One of these mornings
Oh, you're going to rise up singing
Oh, then you'll spread your wings
And you take to the sky
But till that morning, yeah

So hush, so hush little baby
Now don't, don't you cry, hey

Hey now one of these mornings

You're going to rise up singing
Oh, rise up singing

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
One of these mornings
One of these mornings, one of these mornings
You're going to rise up singing, ooh
You're going to spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky
Oh, but till that morning, morning
Ooh baby, ain't nothing can go harm you
With your daddy and mommy
Daddy and mommy, daddy and mommy standing by

[Verse 1]
You made me cry when you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

[Verse 2]
Oh well, goodbye, although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame
You know you're the one to blame, baby

Well, you broke my heart
When you said we're gonna part
Well, ain't that a shame?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Oh well, goodbye, although I'll cry

Oh well, good goodbye, although I'm gonna cry
Ain't that a shame?
Oh, my tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame, oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
You feel bad, but not bad enough
You know you had it coming because you played so rough
Back over your shoulder got an icy chill
Man, you thought you'd get away with it
Now you know you never will

[Chorus]
Somebody, somebody
You got a feelin' somebody's following you

[Verse 2]
No one knows about the times you had
You've been so evil, you know, you've been so bad
There's a devil to pay for what you put them through
And you got a feeling somebody's following you

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 3]
There's a jack-o-lantern moon in the midnight sky
Somebody going to live, somebody going to die
But down in the graveyard on that old tombstone
There's a big black crow and it's calling you home

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
Somebody
You know there's somebody

[Verse 1]
Going fast, coming soon
We made love in the afternoon
Found a flat, after that
We got married

[Verse 2]
Working hard for the dream
Scoring goals for the other team
Times were bad, we were glad
We got married

[Bridge 1]
Like the way you open up your hearts to each other
When you find a meeting of the minds
Just as well love was all we ever wanted
It was all we ever had

[Verse 3]
Further on in the game
Waiting up till the children came
Place your bets, no regrets
We got married
We got married
We got married

[Verse 4]
Nowadays every night flashes by
At the speed of light
Living life, loving wife
We got married

[Bridge 2]
Ohh, I love the things that happen when we start to discover
Who we are and what we're living for
Oh just because love was all we ever wanted
It was all we ever had

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work at it

[Verse 1]
You're always hollerin' 'bout where I've been
You're always screaming 'bout the money I spend

[Chorus]
Quit bugging me
Yeah, yeah, he's cracking up
Yeah, yeah, he's cracking up

[Verse 2]
I do your laundry and your cooking too
Well, what more, woman, can a man like me do?

[Chorus]
You're bugging me
Yeah, yeah, he's cracking up
Yeah, yeah, he's cracking up

[Organ Solo]

[Verse 1]
Give me your hand
I'd like to shake it
I want to show you I'm your friend
You'll understand
If I can make it clear
It's all that matters in the end

[Chorus]
"Put it there if it weighs a ton"
That's what a father said to his young son
"I don't care if it weighs a ton
As long as you and I are here, put it there
Long as you and I are here, put it there"

[Verse 2]
If there's a fight, I'd like to fix it
I hate to see things go so wrong
The darkest night and all it's mixed emotions
Is getting lighter sing along

[Chorus]
"Put it there if it weighs a ton"
That's what a father said to his young son
"I don't care if it weighs a ton
As long as you and I are here, put it there
Long as you and I are here, put it there"

[Chorus]
Well

That I Know
She's The Woman That Loves Me So

[Chorus]

[Repeat 1]

(Come On Riggs, Clamp 'Em)

[Chorus]

[Repeat 1]

[Verse 1]
Well, well, well
Just because you think you're so pretty
And just because your mama thinks you're hot
Just because you think you've got something
That nobody has got

Well, you know you made me spend all my money, honey
You laughed and you called me old Santa Claus
Ooh, I'm telling you baby, I'm through with you
Because, well well, just because

[Verse 2]
Well, just because you think I'll be lonesome
And just because you think that I'll be blue
Just because you think I'll be foolish
I'll stand around, wait around for you

And though you made me drop all my girlfriends
You laughed and called me old Santa Claus
Ooh, I'm telling you baby, I'm through with you
Because, well well, just because
Come on, boys

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, there will come a time when you'll be lonesome
And there will come a time when you'll be blue
There'll come a time when ol' Santa
Hey, he won't pay the bills for you

Ooh just because you think I'll be foolish
Honey, you laughed and called me old Santa Claus
I'm telling you baby, I'm through with you
Because, well well, just because
Aw, come on

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 1]
Well, just because you think you're so pretty
And just because your mama thinks you're the hottest thing in town
Well just because you think you've got something
Ooh that nobody has got

Well, you know you made me spend all my money, honey
You laughed and called me old Santa Claus
Well, I'm telling you, baby, I'm through with you
Because, well well, just because, yeah
Because, well well, just because, mmm mmm
Because, well well, just because

[Chorus 1]
Well I woke up late this morning
My head was in a whirl
Only then I realized
I lost my little girl
Oh oh oh oh

[Chorus 2]
Well her clothes were not expensive
Her hair didn't always curl
I don't know why I loved her
But I loved my little girl
Oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
Well, well, well, well, well
Wake up early in the morning hear the ding-dong ring
Comin' walking to the table I see the same damn thing
Knife and fork upon the table, piece of paper in my hand
Nothing I can do about it, I'll get in trouble with the man

[Chorus]
Let the midnight special shine a light on me
Let the midnight special shine it's ever loving light on me

[Verse 2]
If you ever go to Houston you better act right
You better not gamble and you better not fight
'Cause the sheriff will arrest you and he'll carry you down
If they go and find you guilty you're penitentiary bound

[Chorus]
Let the midnight special shine a light on me
Let the midnight special shine it's ever loving light on me

[Verse 1]
Well, well, well, well, well
Wake up early in the morning, hear the ding-dong ring
Comin' walking to the table I see the same damn thing
Knife and fork upon the table, piece of paper in my hand
Nothing I can do about it, I get in trouble with the man

[Chorus]
Let the midnight special shine a light on me
Let the midnight special shine it's ever loving light on me
Let the midnight special

[Verse 2]
If you ever go to Houston you better act right
You better not gamble and you better not fight
'Cause the sheriff will arrest you and he'll carry you down
If they go and find you guilty, well you'll be Sugarland bound

[Chorus]
Let the midnight special shine it's light on me
Let the midnight special shine it's ever loving light on me

I said the midnight special shine a light on me
Let the midnight special shine it's ever loving light on me

[Intro]
This one, this one, this one, this one, this one...

[Verse 1]
Did I ever take you in my arms, look you in the eye
Tell you that I do?
Did I ever open up my heart
And let you look inside?

[Chorus]
If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one

The swan is gliding above the ocean
A god is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black

[Verse 2]
Did I ever touch you on the cheek
Say that you were mine, thank you for the smile?
Did I ever knock upon your door
Try to get inside?

[Chorus]
If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one
The swan is gliding above the ocean
A god is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black

[Bridge]
What opportunities did we allow to flow by
Feeling like the timing wasn't quite right?
What kind of magic might have worked if we had stayed calm?
Couldn't I have given you a better life?

[Verse 3]
Did you ever take me in your arms
Look me in the eye, tell me that you do?
Did I ever open up my heart
Let you look inside?

[Chorus]
If I never did it, I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one
The swan is gliding above the ocean
A god is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black

[Outro]
The swan is gliding, oh
A god is riding, oh
How calm the water
How calm the water and bright the rainbow

[Verse 1]
Fuck that nigga—pussy-ass nigga
Straight murder that boy and every pussy that's with em
Sit him in the trunk, tell him, "Let's have fun"
No noise fat potato on the end of the gun
My boy’s get that paper just as quick as it come
And if you're standing in the way then mama missing her son
I remember back in the day it was me and Brandon
Cut school, smoke weed, I was strapped, he had one too
Rest in peace from the Hollygrove crew
Tell ya momma I will do whatever she need me to do

[Chorus]
Lil Beezy we use to get red-eye
Can't believe my nigga dead ah

[Verse 2]
I'm an apple street killer, a eagle street soldier
Lil Spitter i'm a ropa, silver duck tape her
I'm a kidnapper, if ya bitch look good bet I'm a get at her
She see me in the coupe I put the petal to the metal
If ya boy wanna trip I put the ratta to the tatta
Everybody scatter tryna get the fuck away
Sparks fly, glass shatter, situation gets sadder
Daddy I'm a pitcher, who's the next batter
I whip it like gadda and I throw it right at em
Junior high school, high school when I had em
Had 10 dollar bags 25 dollar package
We ain't even in the same lane, stop lacking
Damn even Mack Maine tell me i'm macking
Nigga stop trippin, bitch shake ya laffy taffy
This is New Orleans classic, young Wayne the main attraction

[Hook 2]
I got that goose in my system
Somebody gone be my victim

[Verse 3]
Talkin with ya bitch, meeting with ya bitch, creeping with ya bitch Now I'm sleepin with ya bitch, you can keep her, she a bitch
I don't love her, I don't trust her
Nigga own mother told me the bitch loves to hustle
Gotta get that paper baby, gotta get that cake
Cop a black Lamborghini, put gold on the plates
Home to the beach, sand at my feet
R1 one wheel hanging off the seat
My nigga Lil Naughty was a downtown G
We use to blow 2 or 3, tell me all about the streets
My nigga Soulja Slim had a motherfuckin message
Magnolia head busta, Uptown legend

[Hook 3]
Lil Naughty we use to get red eye
I can't believe my nigga dead ah
Lil Soulja he meant what he said, ah
I can't believe that nigga dead, ah

[Verse 3]
My nigga Lil Spitta that's my nigga all day
First bullet out the barrel nigga better guard your face
Say my nigga Lil Spitta he in the game let's play
He about to take over for my half time break

[Verse 4: Curren$y]
Now once upon a time not long ago
He was in the hospital and damn near broke
And all he had was a mask and a Glock
A box of baking soda and a couple of pots
The streets was empty, the fiends was hungry
He wanted to give em just what they wanted
To get cheap coke all he needed was connect
So he called his homie Wayne from the Hollygrove set

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Yes, then I got his call, I'll be on the way
Don't worry about nothing but that money to be made
Met up with Spitter we got the shit straight
And I gave him the dope and I kept the yay
Now we on the grind and the bitches know who we are
I come through in the car like gosh
My posture as delicate as fur, I'm all hers
Cut niggas head like barbers, fruity ass niggas is Starburst
Throw em in the ceiling fans
Little Wayne Weezy Baby motherfucking triggaman
Yeah-Yeah, throw em in the ceiling fans
Little Wayne Weezy Baby motherfucking triggaman
Yeah-Yeah the motherfucking triggaman

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Burn the midnight lamp down until the dawn
I'll keep watch until I'm sure you're coming home
Shadows play and flicker on the bedroom wall
They turn into a bad dream overnight
Something could be terribly wrong

[Bridge 1]
Don't be careless love
(Don't be careless love)
(Don't be, don't be careless)
(Don't be, don't be careless love)
In my dream you're running nowhere
Every step you've taken turns to glue
Walking down a spiral staircase
Falling through, falling through
Don't be careless love
Be careless love

[Verse 2]
The lamp burns down and out
I'm getting pretty tired of this
I feel so bad, something might be going amiss
I won't be there so look out for yourself
You're getting in deep whatever you do
Don't let me go back to sleep

[Bridge 2]
Don't be careless love
(Don't be careless love)
(Don't be, don't be careless)
(Don't be, don't be careless love)
Saw your face in the morning paper
Saw your body rolled up in a rug
Chopped up into two little pieces
By some thug
Don't be careless love
Be careless love

[Verse 3]
But in the morning light
When I wake up again
You're by my side and that's the way it's always been
But in the dark your mind plays funny tricks on you
Your mind plays funny tricks on you
Your mind plays funny tricks on you
Don't be careless love

[Verse 1]
Non nobis solum
Sed toti mundo nati
Toti mundo nati
Boys' choir
Non nobis solum
Sed toti mundo nati

[Chorus]
Ah, ah
(war, ah)

[Verse 2]
The air raid siren slices through
A night in 1942
A couple sheltering in the gloom
Know all too well this waiting room
For often they have in the past
Been huddled close against the blast
Of doodle bugs and bombs galore
They can't put up with any more
So it was that I was born
Into this world one summer morning
And breaking through this brand new day
I hear the sound of warning

[Chorus]
(war, ah)

[Verse 3]
Oh will it all end here?
Or is their future round the corner?
You'll be forgiven if you're down on your knees
What will it be what will it?
What will we be what will we?
What will we see what will we see?
They stay in darkness underground
Until they hear the all clear sound
And weary eyes will search the sky
For any sign of sunlight
For any sign of sunlight

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Mother and father holding their child
Not knowing what future magic lies inside
We open our hearts
You open the door
To peace and happiness for evermore
For us for evermore

[Verse 1]
I feel such sorrow
I feel such shame
I know I won't arrive on time
Before whatever out there is gone
What can I do, that day is done

[Verse 2]
It's just a promise, that I made
I said I'd walk in her parade
Hot scalding tears I thought would flow
Still in my heart they'll never show

[Chorus]
That day is done, that day is done
You know where I've gone
I won't be coming back
That day is done

[Verse 3]
Well I recall the time and place
When they announced her precious face
I thought at once my heart would burst
Still, every time is like the first

[Verse 4]
There was applause when she stepped up
I wished that I could interrupt
I made no sign, I made no sound
I know I must stay underground

[Chorus]
That day is done, that day is done
You know where I've gone
I won't be coming back
That day is done

[Bridge]
That's why she walks, or so they say
She always knew just what I needed
Now if she would just look my way
One time before they proceed

[Verse 5]
She sprinkles flowers in the dirt
That's when a thrill becomes a hurt
I know I'll never see her face
She walks away from my resting place

[Chorus]
That day is done, that day is done
You know where I've gone
I won't be coming back
That day is done

[Chorus]
Well Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

Well, it was on one moonlight night
Well Stars shining bright
Wind blowing high
My Love said good-bye
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

[Chorus 1]
Well, it was on one moonlight night
Stars shining bright
Wind blowing high
Love said good-bye

[Chorus 2]
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

[Chorus 3]

[Uptempo]
Well Blue moon, blue moon, blue moon
Keep shining bright
Well Blue moon, keep on shining bright
You're gonna bring me back my baby tonight
Blue moon, yeh keep shining bright

[Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus]
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

[Verse 1]
How many people stand in a line?
How many people never get a chance to shine?
If you can tell me, I'll gladly listen
How many people have died?

[Chorus]
One too many right now for me
I want to be happy, I want to be free
One too many right now for me
I want to see ordinary people living peacefully

[Verse 2]
How many people go for a ride?
How many people never make it through to the other side?
If you can tell me, I'll gladly listen
How many people have cried?

[Chorus]
One too many right now for me
I want to be happy, I want to be free
One too many right now for me
I want to see ordinary people living peacefully

[Verse 3]
How many people will it take?
How many people for goodness sake?
How many people?
How many people?
One too many

[Verse 1]
I can't get over your love
No matter how hard life seems
There's a light in my dreams
Thanks to you

My friends keep asking me why
There's such a smile on my face
There's a home at my place
Thanks to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want anything from you
Turn on your motor of love

[Chorus]
Motor of love, motor of love
Heavenly father look down from above
I can't get over your powerful
Motor of love

[Verse 2]
I can't get over your love
No matter how lost I feel
I know my love is real
Thanks to you

You simply reached out your hand
And touched me deep in my soul
I came in out of the cold
Thanks to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't steal anything from you
You give me more than enough

[Chorus]
Motor of love, motor of love
Heavenly father look down from above
I can't get over your powerful
Motor of love

[Bridge]
There was a time
When I was down and counted out
Well I remember I felt so bad
I nearly threw away
Nearly threw away the keys

[Chorus]
Motor of love, motor of love
Heavenly father look down from above
Motor of love, motor of love
Heavenly father look down from above
I can't get over your powerful
Motor of love

[Outro]
Your powerful motor, strong revolution
Constantly turning, over and over
Your powerful motor, strong revolution
Constantly turning, over and over

[Verse 1]
I got the blues from my baby left me by the San Francisco Bay
The ocean liner's gone so far away
Didn't mean to treat her so bad
She was the best girl I ever have had
She said goodbye, I can take a cry, I want to lay down and die

[Chorus]
I ain't got a nickel and I ain't got a lousy dime
She don't come back, think I'm going to lose my mind
If she ever gets back to stay, it's going to be another brand new day
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay

[Verse 2]
Sitting down looking from my back door
Wondering which way to go
The woman I'm so crazy about, she don't love me no more
Think I'll catch me a freight train, 'cause I'm feeling blue
And ride all the way to the end of the line, thinking only of you

[Chorus]
Meanwhile, in another city
Just about to go insane
Thought I heard my baby, Lord, the way she used to call my name
If I ever get her back to stay, it's going to be another brand new day
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay

[x2]

[Verse 1]
For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
Discuss all the vast intricacies of life
We could jaw through the night
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
But we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time

[Verse 2]
Take a sip, see the world through a glass
And speculate about a cosmic solution
To the sound, blue guitars
Caught up in a philosophical discussion
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
But we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time

[Verse 1]
For a while, we could sit, smoke a pipe
And discuss all the vast intricacies of life
Yeah, we could jaw through the night
Talk about a range of subjects, anything you like

[Chorus]
But we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time
Yeah, we always came back to the song we were singing
At any particular time

Yeah, we always came back

[Verse 2]
Take a sip, see the world through a glass
And speculate about the cosmic solution
To the sound, blue guitars
Caught up in a philosophical discussion
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
But we always came back to the songs we were singing
At any particular time
Yes, we always came back to the songs we were singing
At any particular time

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We always came back to the songs we were singing
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I saw you sitting at the center of a circle
Everybody, everybody wanted something from you
I saw you sitting there

[Verse 2]
Saw you swaying to the rhythm of the music
Caught you playing, caught you praying to the voice inside you
Saw you swaying there

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don't care what you wanna be
I go back so far, I'm in front of me
It doesn't matter what they say
They're giving the game away, hey hey

[Chorus]
I can see the world tonight
Look into the future
See it in a different light
I can see the world tonight

[Verse 3]
I heard you listening to a secret conversation
You were crying, you were trying not to let them hear you
I heard you listening in

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Never mind what they want to do
You've got a right to your point of view
It doesn't matter what they say
They're giving the game away, hey hey

[Chorus]
I can see the world tonight
Look into the future
See it in a different light
I can see the world tonight

[Instrumental Break]
I can see the world tonight

[Verse 4]
I saw you hiding from a flock of paparazzi
You were hoping, you were hoping
That the ground would swallow you
I saw you hiding there

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don't care what you wanna be
I go back so far, I'm in front of me
It doesn't matter what they say
They're giving the game away, hey hey

[Chorus]
I can see the world tonight
Look into the future
See it in a different light
I can see the world tonight

[Outro]
Look into the future
I can see the world tonight
See it in a different light
I can see the world tonight
I can see the world tonight

[Verse 1]
How many days will the wet weather last?
I want to know will the clouds when they roll back
Reveal a man in an old mac
Living on a park bench, sitting on his own?
Cut to the rain as it runs down the glass
Eventually through the lightning and thunder, we see a man going under
This is how it happens
This is what he said

[Chorus]
I don't need love, though temptation is sweet
Give me your hand 'til I'm back on me feet
You're always telling me about my misery
I've seen things you'll never see
Don't pity me

[Verse 2]
Focus in on the breath of a man
Who takes a brown paper bag
From his knapsack
Between his whispers and wise cracks
He's looking for permission
Screaming at the sky

[Chorus]
I don't need love, though temptation is sweet
Give me your hand 'til I'm back on me feet
You're always telling me about my misery
I've seen things you'll never see
Don't pity me

[Verse 3]
I'll be right again
Be upright without you
I'll stand up again
Kick up a fuss again too
Cut back again to a girl walking by
Until the feet that are all shoes and no socks
Climb an invisible soap box
Laughing at the traffic
Shouting at the world

[Chorus]
I don't need love, though temptation is sweet
Give me your hand 'til I'm back on me feet
You're always telling me about my misery
I've seen things you'll never see
Don't pity me

[Verse 4]
I'll stand up again
Kick up a fuss again too
I'll be right again
Be upright without you
We see a life through the eyes of a man
As he live and he dies
By a simple tattoo

[Verse 5]
I'll be back again
When I land on my feet
I'll stand up again
Kick up a fuss again, wouldn't you
Well there you go, though we tried hard to know him
It's there on his face
He's a case where there's clearly no hope
Give me your hand again
'Til I land again

[Outro]
His face starts to fade
As we pull down the shade
And the picture we made
Is in glorious cinemascope
I'll be back

[Verse 1]
If you wanna, if you wanna
If you wanna love me again
I'll take you for a ride in my Cadillac
He'll be in the front, we'll be in the back

[Chorus]
When you're ready, let me know
I'll be waiting to make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip

[Verse 2]
And if you wanna, if you wanna
If you wanna do it again
I'll take you to the coast for a holiday
You can be my guest, you can let me pay, yeah

[Chorus]
When you're ready, well let me know
I'll be waiting to make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip
Whenever you're ready

[Bridge 1]
When you want to love me, this is what you need
To be thinking of me when you plant the seed of love

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
When you're ready, let me know, I'll be waiting
To make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip

[Bridge 2]
When you want to love me, this is what you need
To be thinking of me when you plant the seed
The seed of love

[Verse 1]
If you wanna, if you wanna
If you wanna do it again
I'll take you for a ride in my Cadillac
He'll be in the front, we'll be in the back

[Chorus]
When you're ready, let me know, I'll be waiting
To make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip

[Verse 1]
Some days I look
I look at you with eyes that shine
Some days I don't
I don't believe that you are mine

It's no good asking me what time of day it is
Who won the match or scored the goal
Some days I look
Some days I look into your soul

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I laugh
I laugh to think how young we were
Sometimes it's hard
It's hard to know which way to turn

Don't ask me where I found that picture on the wall
How much it cost or what it's worth
Sometimes I laugh
I laugh to think how young we were

[Bridge]
We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real
Inside each one of us is love
And we know how it feels

[Verse 3]
Some days I cry
I cry for those who live in fear
Some days I don't
I don't remember why I'm here

No use reminding me, it's just the way it is
Who ran the race or came in first
Some days I cry
I cry for those who fear the worst

[Bridge]
We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real
Inside each one of us is love
And we know how it feels

[Verse 1]
Some days I look
I look at you with eyes that shine
Some days I don't
I don't believe that you are mine
It's no good asking me what time of day it is
Who won the match or scored the goal?
Some days I look
Some days I look into your soul

[Chorus]
Put on your hi heel sneakers
Honey put your wig-hat on your head
Honey on your head
Put on your hi heel sneakers
Honey put your wig-hat on your head
Alright
You better pass some boxing gloves
In case this foreman wanna fight

[Chorus 1]
Put on your hi heel sneakers
Honey get your wig-hat on your head
Honey, on your head
Put on your hi, hi heel sneakers, darling
Honey you're gonna wear your wig-hat on your head
Yeah
When I'm stepping out tonight, baby
I do believe, I'm really gonna knock 'em dead, oh!

[Verse 1]
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love
It isn't easy, nothing you can say will help him find love
He's got to do it for himself and it can take so long
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love

[Verse 2]
He doesn't need another helping hand from someone
But don't you think he doesn't understand what he wants - someone
Though independence means a lot, he's gotta still be strong
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love

[Chorus]
Find love, a perfect combination
Find love, whatever you do
Find love, a cause for celebration
Then it might come looking (looking)
Come looking for you

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Find love, in any situation
Find love, whatever you do
Find love, a cause for celebration
And it might come looking (looking)
Come looking for you

[Verse 1]
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love
It isn't easy, nothing you can say will help him find love
He's got to do it for himself and it can take so long
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love

[Chorus]
Find love, a time for meditation
Find love, a source of inspiration
Find love, instead of confrontation
Find love, and love will come looking for you

[Verse 1]
It was written that I would love you
From the moment I opened my eyes
And the morning when I first saw you
Gave me life under calico skies

[Chorus]
I will hold you for as long as you like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
Always looking for ways to love you
Never failing to fight at your side
While the angels of love protect us
From the inner most secrets we hide

[Chorus]
I'll hold you for as long as you like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life

[Verse 3]
Long live all of us crazy soldiers
Who were born under calico skies
May we never be called to handle
All the weapons of war we despise

[Chorus]
I'll hold you for as long as you like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life
I'll hold you for as long as you like
I'll love you for the rest of my
For the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
Making love underneath the bed
Shooting stars from a purple sky
I don't care how I do it
I'm the man on the flaming pie

[Verse 2]
I stick my tongue out and lick my nose
Tuck my shirt in and zip my fly
Go ahead, have a vision
I'm the man on the flaming pie

[Bridge]
Everything I do has a simple explanation
When I'm with you, you could do with a vacation
I took my brains out and stretched them on the rack
Now I'm not so sure I'm ever going to get 'em back

[Verse 3]
Cut my toes off to spite my feet
I don't know whether to laugh or cry
Never mind, check my rhythm
I'm the man on the flaming pie
I'm the man on the flaming pie

[Bridge]
Now, everything I do has a simple explanation (Explanation)
When I'm with you, you could do with a vacation (Vacation)
I took my brains out and stretched them on the rack
Now I'm not so sure I'm ever going to get 'em back

[Outro]
Ow!
Yeah!
Uh-huh!
Yeah! Ha-ha!

[Verse 1]
There must have been a lot of heartache
For you to sink so low
You must have had a ton of pressure
Only answer if the answer's no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I need loving, you need loving too
Doesn't take a lot to get off the ground

[Verse 2]
There must have been a lot of magic
When the world was born
Let me be the one you wish for
One you call for, when you're all alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I need loving, you need loving too
Wouldn't take a lot to get off the ground

[Chorus]
Off the ground la la la la la la la, off the ground la la la la la la la
Fly around la la la la la la la, fly around la la la la la la la
Hear the sound, hear the sound
Off the ground la la la la la la la, off the ground la la la la la la la

[Verse 3]
Though it takes a lot of power
To make a big tree grow
It doesn't need a pot of knowledge
For a seed knows what a seed must know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You need loving, I need loving too
Doesn't take a lot to get off the ground

[Chorus]
Off the ground la la la la la la la, off the ground la la la la la la la
Fly around la la la la la la la, fly around la la la la la la la
Hear the sound, hear the sound
Off the ground la la la la la la la, off the ground la la la la la la la

[Outro]
Hear the sound, hear the sound
Off the ground la la la la la la la, off the ground la la la la la la la
Yeah yeah, off the ground

[Chorus 1]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

[Chorus 2]
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gonna stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know

[Chorus 3]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness everyday
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

[Verse 1]
I saw a cat with a machine in his brain
The man who fed him said he didn't feel any pain
I'd like to see that man take out that machine
And stick it in his own brain
You know what I mean

[Verse 2]
I saw a rabbit with its eyes full of tears
The lab that owned her had been doing it for years
Why don't we make them pay for every last eye
That couldn't cry its own tears?
Do you know what I mean?

[Chorus]
When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow
Yeah, when we're looking for changes

[Verse 3]
I saw a monkey that was learning to choke
A guy beside him gave him cigarettes to smoke
And every time that monkey started to cough
The bastard laughed his head off
Do you know what I mean?

[Chorus]
When I tell you that we'll all be
Looking for changes
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures
And we will learn how to grow
When we're looking for changes

[Outro]
We're looking for changes
We're looking for changes
We're looking for changes in the way we are

[Verse 1]
Well, I never felt more like singing the blues
And I never thought
That I'd ever lose your love
Why did you do me this way?
Well, I never felt more like crying all night
Everything's wrong
But nothing is right without you

[Chorus]
You've got me singing the blues
Well, the moon and the stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do
But cry-i-i-i over you
Cry over you
Well, I never felt more like running away
And why shouldn't I go
'Cause I couldn't stay without you

[X2]

You've got me singing the blues
(Mr. Paul Wiggins, Come on Paul)
Well, the moon and the stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do
But cry-i-i-i over you
Cry over you
Well, I never felt more like running away
And why shouldn't I go
'Cause I couldn't stay without you
You've got me singing the blues
You've got me singing the blues
You've got me singing the blues, ooh

[Intro]
I'm flying to my home

[Verse 1]
The sun is fading in the west
Out where the cattle roam
I'm like a bird at the end of the day
Flying to my home
I'm flying to my home sweet majesty
I'm flying to my home

[Verse 2]
The sky is like a painted flag
Above a sea of chrome
I've got a woman living in my life
Living in my home
I'm flying to my home sweet majesty
I'm flying to my home

[Chorus]
I haven't been back for so long
I don't know if I'm going to recognize it
They gave the old place a new face
And I'm going to take some time
To size the situation up
I haven't been back for so long
I don't know if I'm going to recognize it
They gave the old place a new face
And I'm going to take some time
To size the situation up

[Verse 3]
The sun is fading in the west
Out where the cattle roam
I've got a woman living in my life
Living in my home
I'm flying to my home sweet majesty
I'm flying to my home

[Outro]
I'm flying to my home sweet majesty
I'm flying to my home

[Chorus 1]
To me you are the loveliest thing I've seen all day
You can't take that away
No, you can't take that away
All my life, I wondered why it couldn't be this way
That was up until today
Oh it had to be this way

[Chorus 2]
Today, wait until the morning comes
Before you slip away
Without permission
Without suspicion
Without permission given

[Verse 1]
You seem to have a friendlier smile than all the rest
Well I looked and you were best
Yeah I've looked at all the rest
You can't imagine passionate words that I would say
If only you would stay
Oh you know you got to stay

[Chorus 2]
Today, wait until the morning comes
Before you slip away
Without permission
Without suspicion
Without permission given

[Verse 2]
You used to be and early bird
But how was I to know you would leave without shedding a tear
I only want to love you
I'll make a wish and suddenly I'm glad that I have you here
Oh I'm glad I have you here
Today

[Chorus 1]
To me you are the loveliest thing I've seen all day
You can't take that away
No, you can't take that away
All my life, I wondered why it couldn't be this way
That was up until today
Oh it had to be this way

[Chorus 2]
Today, wait until the morning comes
Before you slip away
Without permission
Without suspicion
Without permission given

[Verse 1]
I will always be hoping, hoping
You will always be holding, holding
My heart in your hand
I will understand

[Verse 2]
I will understand someday, one day
You will understand always
Always from now until then

[Pre-Chorus]
When it will be right, I don't know
What it will be like, I don't know
We live in hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

[Chorus]
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

[Verse 3]
And I wouldn't mind knowing, knowing
That you wouldn't mind going
Going along with my plan

[Pre-Chorus]
When it will be right, I don't know
What it will be like, I don't know
We live in hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

[Chorus]
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us

[Outro]
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance
Hope of deliverance from the darkness that surrounds us
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance, I will understand
Hope of deliverance, hope of deliverance, I will understand
Hope of deliverance

[Chorus 1]

Bluejean baby, with your big blue eyes
Don`t want you looking at other guys
Got to make you give me, one more chance
I can`t keep still, so baby let`s dance

[Verse 1]
Well the bluejean bop is the bop for me
It`s the bop that`s done in a dungaree
You dip your hip, you free your knee
Wiggle on you baby, one two three

Oh baby, bluejean bop, the bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, baby won`t you bop with me

[Verse 1]
She said, "Come in my dear
You're looking tired tonight
Your bath is drawn, let me loosen your tie
And fix you your usual drink"

[Verse 2]
He settles back, takes a magazine
Kicks off his shoes, as he studies the form
Of every appealing soubrette

[Pre-Chorus]
But where are the flowers that he used to bring?
Every endearing remark
Reminds her of passionate promises
That he only made in the dark
In her bed

[Chorus]
She wants to shout at the back of his head
Look at me, look at me, look at me--I'm afraid
See what it's come to
I'm just your mistress and maid

[Verse 3]
The wine is warm, but the dinner is cold
The look in his eye tells her it won't be long
Till the girls on the page come to life

[Pre-Chorus]
They'll get the flowers that he used to bring
With every endearing remark
And all of the passionate promises
He'll never fulfill in the dark
In their bed

[Chorus]
She wants to shout at the back of his head
Look at me, look at me, now that I'm not afraid
See what it's come to
I'm not your mistress and maid

[Outro]
See what it's come to
I'm not your mistress and maid
No no no no
No no no no
Mistress and maid
Mistress and maid
Mistress and maid
Mistress and maid

I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm acting wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mm, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
My hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mmm, yeah, yeah!

[Bridge]
Please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feeling fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death

[Verse 3]
She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Well now please don't ask me what's on my mind

[Chorus]
Run devil run, the angels having fun
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you
Listen what I'm saying to you, run
Run Devil run

[Verse 1]
By a swamp in Alabama in the cold in the damp
Sittin' reading by the light of a kerosene lamp
Lives a holly roller with a mission on her mind
Got to spread the word to anybody she can find
You can hear her screaming any time in night or day
This is what she says to keep the demons away

[Chorus]
Run devil run, the angels having fun
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you
Listen what I'm saying to you, run
Run Devil run

[Verse 2]
Her brother and her sister said that she brought them down
Steppin' on the bus that was heading to town
There they started drinking, they got into a fight
The sheriff introduced them to the jailhouse for a night
When the holy roller came to town to pay the bail
This is what she sang as she was leaving the jail

[Chorus]
Run devil run, the angels having fun
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you
Listen what I'm saying to you, run
Run Devil run

[Guitar and Piano Solos]

[Verse 3]
Well by the middle of the summer they were back in the shack
Picking cotton for a living keep them on the right track
Visiting the nieghbours trying to spread the good news
Singing gospel music with a hint of the blues
All of them determined to deliver the goods
Now you hear the music comin out of the woods

[Chorus]
Run devil run, the angels having fun
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you
Listen what I'm saying to you, run
Run Devil run

[Outro]
Ah you'd better run
Run Devil run
You better run
Run Devil run

[Verse 1]
Last night, you helped me through
Took me to the lovers zone
I saw there images
Projected on a wall of stone

[Pre-Chorus]
I stood inside Egyptian temples
I looked into eternal gardens
Lay on the shores of distant islands
Listening to the sea bird's song of joy

[Chorus]
Oh, I owe it all to you
You make me happy
Oh, I owe it all to you

[Verse 2]
Late last night, we were right
Into some exotic scene
Everywhere, images
Appearing on a giant screen

[Pre-Chorus]
I stood inside a glass cathedral
I looked into the golden canyon
Lay by the lakes of holy water
Glistening like a diamond in the light

[Chorus]
Oh, I owe it all to you
You make me happy
Oh, I owe it all to you

Oh, I owe it all to you
You make me happy
Oh, I owe it all to you

[Pre-Chorus Variation]
Egyptian temples, eternal gardens
Distant islands listening to the sea birds song of joy

[Chorus]
Oh, I owe it all to you
You make me happy
Oh, I owe it all to you

[Chorus]
But I don't want no other baby, but you
I don't want no other baby, but you
'Cause no other baby can thrill me like you do

[Verse 1]
Got a little woman lives across the hall
I got a little woman, she lives across the hall
And most every evening, she's asking me to call

[Chorus]
But I don't want no other baby, but you
I don't want no other baby, but you
'Cause no other baby can thrill me like you do

[Verse 2]
Well lots of other women say "Be my daddy do"
Yeah, lots of other women say "Be my daddy do"
But I tell them I don't want no other baby but you

[Chorus]
I say I don't want no other baby but you
No, I don't want no other baby but you
'Cause no other baby can thrill me like you do, ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
There's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away
And we call it Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay

[Verse 2]
Where you can buy a dream or two
To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is heart full of tears

[Bridge]
Going down to Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay
I'm going down to Lonesome Town
To cry my troubles away

[Verse 3]
Well now, in the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Going down to Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay
Yeah I'm going down to Lonesome Town
To cry my troubles, cry my troubles away

[Verse 3]
In the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget

[Outro]
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget

[Verse 1]
I've got too much on my plate
Don't have no time to be a decent lover
I hope it isn't too late
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My ever present past

[Verse 2]
I've got too much on my mind
I think of everything to be discovered
I hope there's something to find
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My ever present past

[Chorus]
The things I think I did
I d.i. d.i. did
The things I think I did
When I was a kid

[Bridge]
I couldn't understand a word that they were saying
But still I hung around and took it all in
I wouldn't join in with the games that they were playing
It went by, it went by in a flash
It flew by, it flew by in a flash

[Verse 1]
There's far too much on my plate
Don't have no time to be a decent lover
I hope it's never too late
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My ever present past

[Chorus]
The things I think I did
I d.i. d.i. did
The things I think I did
When I was a kid
The things I think I did
I d.i. d.i. did
The things I think I did
When I was a kid

[Verse]
She makes me feel glad, I want her so bad
My heart is beating madly for her
If you ask me why, I'm not gonna lie
I'll have to say that I adore her

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you do to me baby
You're making me feel so fine (So fine, so fine)
Step out in front of me, baby
They want you in the front line (So fine, so fine)
They wanna see your sunshine (So fine)
Oh yeah yeah

[Bridge]
She picks up daisies from a field
She loves to weave them in her hair
I know she knows it isn't real
She still hears music in the air
It's coming from inside her heart
I hope it lasts forever
The sun is shining in the sky
She wants to dance around the world
And though I'd love to be the guy
That gets to walk off with the girl
I'll go along with all she needs
And it will be my pleasure

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you do to me baby
You're making me feel so fine (So fine, so fine)
Step out in front of me, baby
They want you in the front line (So fine, so fine)
They wanna see your sunshine, oh

[Verse]
She makes me feel glad, I want her so bad
My heart is beating madly for her
If you ask me why, I'm not gonna lie
I'll have to say I adore her

[Outro]
Ooh, look what you do to me baby
You're making me feel so fine (So fine so fine)
I wanna see your sunshine
(Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Well, I was found in the transit lounge
Of a dirty airport town
What was I doing on the road to ruin?
Well, my mama laid me down
My mama laid me down

[Verse 2]
Around my hand was a plastic band
With a picture of my face
I was crying, left to die
In this godforsaken place
This godforsaken place

[Chorus]
Only Mama knows
Why she laid me down in this godforsaken town
She was running too
What she was running from, I always wondered
I never knew
Only Mama knows
Only Mama knows

[Bridge]
I'm passing through, I'm on my way
On the road, no ETA
I'm passing through, no fixed abode
And that is why I need to try to hold on
I've got to hold on
I've got to hold on

[Verse 3]
Was it planned as a one night stand
Or did she leave in disgrace?
Well, I never, will I ever see my father's face?
See my father's face?

[Chorus]
Only Mama knows
Why she laid me down in this godforsaken town
She was running too
What she was running from, I always wondered
I never knew
Only Mama knows
Only Mama knows

Only Mama knows
Why she laid me down in this godforsaken town
She was running too
What she was running from, I always wondered
I never knew
Only Mama knows (Only Mama knows)
Only Mama knows (Only Mama knows)
(Only Mama knows)
(Only Mama knows)

[Outro]
I've got to hold on
I've got to hold on
Got to hold on

[Verse 1]
There was a girl who loved a biker
She used to follow him across America
But the biker didn't like her
She didn't care, she still persisted
Though her brother said she was twisted
And the family said they wouldn't miss her
Anyway

[Chorus]
She loved the biker like an icon
Gazing at his picture everyday
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away

[Verse 2]
She did her best to fix a meeting
She pulled it off one night in Hollywood
When he met her he couldn't let her get away
He didn't ask for her permission
He took advantage of her position
But he was always her ambition
Anyway

[Chorus]
She loved the biker like an icon
Gazing at his picture everyday
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away

[Verse 3]
The family tried so hard to find her
They showed her picture across America
But no trace of her sweet face
Was ever found

[Chorus]
She loved the biker like an icon
Gazing at his picture everyday
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away

[Outro]
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away
She loved the biker like an icon
Slowly watching precious water drip away
She loved the biker like an icon

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong
How can I help it but I don't know this song
All day I try to be a man
Help me to do it, show me the plan

[Chorus]
Try, try, try
I try not to cry, cry cry
Cry over you-oo-oo
Over you
Yes I try, try, try
I try not to cry, cry, cry
Cry over you-oo-oo
Over you

[Verse 2]
I want to enjoy being alive
Don't want to leave before I arrive
I like to sing, I'll sing along
How can I do it, when I don't know the song

[Chorus]
Try, try, try
I try not to cry, cry cry
I cry over you-oo-oo
Over you
Yes I try, try, try
I try not to cry, cry, cry
Cry over you-oo-oo
Over you

[Verse 1]
When was that summer when the skies were blue?
The bright red cardinal flew down from his tree
You tell me

[Verse 2]
When was that summer when it never rained?
The air was buzzing with the sweet old honeybee
Let's see
You tell me

[Bridge]
Were we there? Was it real?
Is it truly how I feel?
Maybe
You tell me

[Interlude]
Ooh

[Bridge]
Were we there? Is it true?

You tell me

[Outro]
Ah let's see
You tell me (You tell me)

[Verse 1]
Now, let me take you to the movies, Magg, so I can hold your hand
Oh, it ain't that I don't like your house, it's just that doggone man
And that double barrel behind the door that waits for me, I know
Oh, climb upon ol' Becky's back and let's ride to the picture show

[Verse 2]
I only see her once a week and it's when my work is through
I break new ground the whole week long but my mind's set straight on you
And I polished up my old horse Beck, and she looks good, I know
So climb upon ol' Becky's back and let's ride to the picture show

[Verse 1]
Now, let me take you to the movies, Magg, so I can hold your hand
Oh, it ain't that I don't like your house, it's just that doggone man
And that double barrel behind the door that waits for me, I know
Oh, climb upon ol' Becky's back and let's ride to the picture show

[Verse 2]
Well, I break new ground the whole week long with my mind's set straight on you
And every time I try to smile, my heart it breaks in two
I slick myself for Saturday night 'cause there's one thing I know
I'm going to take my Maggie dear to the western picture show

[Verse 1]
Now won't you let me take you to the show so I can hold your hand
But it ain't that I don't like your house, it's just that doggone man
And that double barrel behind the door that waits for me, I know
So climb upon ol' Becky's back and let's ride to the picture show

[Verse 1]
Well, flying across the desert in a TWA
I saw a woman walking across the sand
She'd be walking thirty miles en route to Bombay
To meet a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man

[Verse 2]
Way back in history three thousand years, in fact
Ever since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shedding tears
Over a brown eyed handsome man
A lot of trouble was a brown eyed handsome man

[Verse 3]
Well, the Milo de Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To win a brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

[Verse 4]
Well, a beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter
Go out and find yourself a brown eyed handsome man
Just like your daddy was a brown eyed handsome man
Yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Well, a two-three the count with nobody on
He hit a high flyer into the stand
A-rounded third, he was a-heading for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man that won the game
It was a brown eyed handsome man
It was a brown eyed handsome man

[Verse 1]
You are what it is
That makes the world go around for me
You are what I need
You make me feel good about myself

[Bridge]
You see, I love you so much
I can never do without your touch
I'm like a busy honeybee
I'm always hungry for it
How could anyone ignore it?
Surely everybody will agree

[Verse 2]
That you are what it is
That makes the cloud roll around the sky
Oh yeah, you got what it takes
You make me proud to be who I am

[Bridge]
You see, I love you so much
I can never be without your touch
I'm like a busy honeybee
I'm always hungry for it
How could anyone ignore it?
Surely everybody must agree

That makes the world go around for me
Yeah you are what I need
You make me feel good about myself

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Well you are what it is

[Outro]
That you are what it is
That makes the world go around for me
You make the world go around for me
Yeah, you make the world go around, world go around
World go around for me
You're what it is

[Chorus 1]
I'm not coming down no matter what you do
I like it up here without you

Go light, Mr. Bellamy
We'll have you down soon

[Verse 1]
No one to tell me what to do
No one to hold my hand
Bellamy's got a lot to do
And I hope that you'll understand

Nobody here to spoil the view
Interfere with my plans
Bellamy's got a job to do
And he's hoping you'll understand

[Bridge]
Steady, lads
And easy does it
Ooooh, don't frighten him!
Here we go

[Chorus 1]
I'm not coming down no matter what you say
I like it up here anyway

Sit tight, Mr. Bellamy
This shouldn't take long

[Verse 2]
In the delusionary state
No wonder he's been feeling strange of late

Nobody here to spoil the view
Interfere with my plans
Bellamy's got a job to do
And he's hoping you'll understand

[Bridge]
Steady, lads
And easy does it
Don't frighten him!
Here we go
Here we go

[Chorus 1]
I'm not coming down no matter what you do
I like it up here without you

[Verse]
Hear me, why you keep fooling, little coquette?
Making fun of the one who loves you?
Breaking hearts you are ruling, little coquette
True hearts tenderly dreaming of you

[Bridge]
Someday you'll fall in love, as I fell in love with you
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too
And when you are alone with all your regrets
You know, my little coquette, I love you

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Someday you'll fall in love, as I fell in love with you
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too
And when you are alone with all your regrets
You know, my little coquette, I love you

[Verse 1]
Best thing I ever saw
Was a man who loved his wife
In a place where things were good
I felt peace in the neighbourhood

[Verse 2]
That feeling in the air
Something was definitely there
It was a time when things were good
I felt peace in the neighbourhood

[Bridge]
I was there, I really was
At the centre of a love vibration
People sharing with their friends
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out

[Verse 3]
Then I woke up from my dream
To see things as they really are
People struggling to survive
How can peace hope to stay alive?

[Bridge]
Well I was there, I felt so good
At the centre of a love vibration
People caring for their world
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out

[Outro]
Best thing I ever saw
I saw a man who loved his wife
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Helping each other out
Peace in the neighbourhood
Peace in the neighbourhood
Peace in the neighbourhood

[Intro]
Holy smokes! Land sakes alive
I never thought this would happen to me

[Verse 1]
Uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah
I got stung by a sweet honey bee
What a feeling came over me
Well it started in my eyes, crept up to my head
Flew into my arms, till I was stung dead
I'm done, uh-huh, I got stung
Uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah

[Verse 2]
She had all that I wanted and more
I've never seen honey bees before
Well she started through my ears, buzzing in my brain
Got stung all over but I feel no pain
I'm done, uh-huh, I got stung

[Bridge ]
Well don't think I'm complaining
Because I'm might pleased we met
Because you give me just one little peck
On the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold cold sweat

[Verse 3]
If I live to be a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzing around your hive
Every day at five

Don't live in the past
Don't hold on to something that's changing fast
What we are is what we are
And what we wear is vintage clothes
Vintage clothes (Vintage clothes)
Vintage clothes
Vintage clothes

[Verse 2]
We jump up for joy
Who cares if we look like a girl or boy?
What we are is what we are
And what we wear is vintage clothes
Vintage clothes
Vintage clothes

[Bridge]
A little more, a little tall
Check the rack
What went out is coming back

What we are is what we are
And what we wear is vintage clothes
Vintage clothes

Check the rack
What went out, is coming back

[Verse 1]
Golden earth girl, female animal
Sings to the wind, resting at sunset
In a mossy nest
Sensing moonlight in the air
Moonlight in the air

[Verse 2]
Good clear water friend of wilderness
Sees in the pool her own reflection
In another world
Someone over there is counting

[Chorus]
Fish in a sunbeam
In eggshell seas
Fish in a sunbeam
Eggshell finish

[Verse 3]
Natures lover climbs the primrose hill
Smiles at the sky watching the sunset
From a mossy nest
As she falls asleep she's counting

[Chorus]
Fish in a sunbeam
In eggshell seas
Fish in a sunbeam
Eggshell finish

[Verse 4]
As she falls asleep she's counting

[Chorus]
Fish in a sunbeam

That was me at the scout camp, in the school play
Spade and bucket by the sea
That was me
That was me playing conkers at the bus stop
On a blanket in the blue bells
That was me

[Chorus 1]
The same me that stands here now
When I think that all this stuff
Can make a life that's pretty hard to take it in
That was me

[Verse 2]
Well, that was me, royal iris, on the river
Merseybeatin' with the band
That was me
Yeah, that was me
Sweating cobwebs under contract
In the cellar, on TV
That was me

[Chorus 2]
The same me that stands here now
If fate agreed that all of this
Would make a lifetime
Who am I to disagree?
That was me
Yeah, that was me

[Verse 3]
That was me accapella at the altar
In the middle of the picture
That was me
That was me at the party sweating cobwebs
In a cellar on TV
Yeah, that was me

[Chorus 1]
The same me that stands here now
When I think that all this stuff
Can make a life, it's pretty hard to take it in
That was me

[Outro]
That was me
That was me

[Good Times Coming]

Good times coming
Good times coming in
Good times coming
Good times coming in
Good times coming
Good times coming in
Good times coming
Good times coming in

[Verse 1]
I was thinking about that summer so long ago
Pack up your bags and yell, "Geronimo!"
That was a golden summer, wasn't it hot?
We laughed a lot that summer, laughed a lot

[Chorus 1]
Laughing at the good times coming
Laughing at the good times coming in
Good times coming
Laughing at the good times coming in

[Verse 2]
There was something about the weather, what can I say?
Nothing like any other holiday
That was a silly season, was it the best?
We didn't need a reason, just a rest

[Chorus]
Happy at the good times coming
Happy at the good times coming in
Good times coming, happy at the good times coming in

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I'm loving you, I'm loving you, I'm loving you now
I'm loving you, I'm loving you, I'm loving you now

[Verse 3]
There was a golden summer before the war
They laughed a lot that summer, la de dah

[Chorus]
Laughing at the good times coming
Laughing at the good times coming in
Good times coming, laughing at the good times coming in
Good times coming, good times coming in
Good times coming, good times coming in
Good times coming, good times coming in

[Feel the Sun]

[Chorus]
Feel the sun shine in, shine in, shine in
Feel the sun shining in on you
Feel the sun shine in, shine in, shine in
Feel the sun shining in on you

All the beauty, all the pain
Will it ever be the same again?
If you love me, show me now
It's the only way that we know how

[Chorus]
Feel the sun shine in, shine in, shine in
Feel the sun shining in on you
Feel the sun shine in, shine in, shine in
Feel the sun shining in on you
Feel the sun shine in, shine in, shine in

Well, come on in this house, stop all that yakety-yak
I said, come on in this house, stop all that yakety-yak
'Cause your sugar daddy don't want no talking back

[Verse 2]
Well, you keep on talking, talking 'bout this and that
Yeah, you keep on talking, talking 'bout this and that
I got news for you, baby, you're nothing but an alley cat

Hi oh, hi ho Silver, hi oh, hi oh Silver away-hey

[Verse 1]
The teacher said I had my head in the clouds
They directed, I suspected, disconnected
Hat in my way

[Verse 2]
On the street, I had my feet on the ground
Stood corrected, well protected, resurrected
Had it my way

[Chorus]
I've got my feet in the clouds, got my head on the ground
I know that I'm not a square as long as they're not around
But I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Yes, I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard

[Verse 3]
Love is fab, it's like a stab in the heart
My hidden treasure, made to measure, for my pleasure
I had it my way

[Chorus]
I've got my feet in the clouds, got my head on the ground
I know that I'm not a square as long as they're not around
But I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Oh, I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Yes, I find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Oh I find it, yes I find it hard
Find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Oh I find it, and I find it hard
Find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Oh I find it, and I find it hard
Find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Oh I find it, and I find it hard
Find it very, very, very, very, very, very hard
Oh I find it, yes I find it hard

[Outro]
I've got my feet in the clouds (Feet in the clouds)
(Head on the ground) Head on the ground
(I'm not a square) I'm not a square
(They're not around) As long as they're not around
(It's so hard) Yeah, but I find it so hard
(It's so hard, it's so hard) I find it so hard

[Verse 1]
Just leave it to me
Now don't you ever be ashamed
Just give me a chance
And I'll take care of everything
Your troubles I share
I'll let you know when I'll be there
I'll take care, take care of you
Any place and everywhere

[Chorus]
Shake a hand, shake a hand
A-shake a hand if you can
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand if you can

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 2]
Be truthful to me and I'll be truthful to you
But I'm in love, I'm in love with your soul
And I don't now just what to do
So let's call it a day
I've said all I've got to say
Except, oh yeah, baby, you got to learn how to pray
And shake a hand every day

[Guitar Solos]

[Verse 2]
Be truthful to me and I'll be truthful to you
But I'm in love, I'm in love with your soul
And I don't now just what to do

So shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand if you can
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand if you can

[Verse 1]
Lightning hits the house of wax
Poets spill out on the street
To set alight the incomplete
Remainders of the future

Hidden in the yard
Hidden in the yard

[Verse 2]
Thunder drowns the trumpets' blast
Poets scatter through the night
But they can only dream of flight
Away from their confusion

[Chorus]
Hidden in the yard
Underneath the wall
Buried deep below a thousand layers
Lay the answer to it all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Lightning hits the house of wax
Women scream and run around
To dance upon the battleground
Like wild demented horses

[Chorus]
Hidden in the yard
Underneath the wall
Buried deep below a thousand layers
Lay the answer to it all
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Hidden in the yard
Underneath the wall
Buried deep below a thousand layers
Lay the answer to it all

[Chorus]
At the end of the end, it's the start of a journey
To a much better place
And this wasn't bad, so a much better place
Would have to be special
No need to be sad

[Verse 1]
On the day that I die, I'd like jokes to be told
And stories of old to be rolled out like carpets
That children have played on
And laid on while listening to stories of old

[Chorus]
At the end of the end, it's the start of a journey
To a much better place
And a much better place would have to be special
No reason to cry

[Verse 2]
On the day that I die, I'd like bells to be rung
And songs that were sung to be hung out like blankets
That lovers have played on
And laid on while listening to songs that were sung

[Chorus]
At the end of the end, it's the start of a journey
To a much better place
And a much better place would have to be special
No reason to cry
No need to be sad
At the end of the end

[Verse 1]
I have always needed somebody girl
But I close the doors to keep out the world
But for you, I would be here all alone
Locked in a photograph

[Chorus 1]
All of the clocks have run down
Lover beware
We'll be the lovers that never were

[Verse 2]
I hang patiently on every word you send
Will we ever be much more than just friends?
As for you, you sit there playing this game
You keep me waiting

[Chorus 2]
When all of the clocks have run down
All over the world
We'll be the lovers that never were

[Bridge]
For as long as the sun shines in somebody's eyes
I believe in you baby, so don't tell me lies
For as long as the trees throw down blossoms and leaves
I know there will be a parade of unpainted dreams

[Verse 2]
And I know dear, how much it's going to hurt
If you still refuse to get your hands dirty
So you, you must tell me something... I love you
Say goodbye or anything

[Chorus 3]
All of the clocks have run down
Time's at an end
If we can't be lovers we'll never be friends

[Bridge]
For as long as the sun shines in somebody's eyes
I believe in you baby, so don't tell me lies
For as long as the trees throw down blossoms and leaves
I know there will be a parade of unpainted dreams

[Verse]
And when the time comes around, we will be duty bound
To tell the through of what we've seen
And what we haven't found will not be going down
Despite too easy ride to see

[Chorus]
From a lover to a friend, take your own advice
Let me love again
Now that you turned out to be someone I can trust
Someone I believe

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh la la la la la la la
How can I walk when I can't find a way
I have a dilemma
All I want is to tell me
You're going to take it away

[Chorus]
From a lover to a friend
Take your own advice, let me love again
Now that you turned out to be
Someone I can trust, someone I believe

[Verse excerpt]
And what we haven't found
Will not be going down
Despite too easy ride to see

[Chorus]
From a lover to a friend, you turned out to be
Someone I believe
From a lover to a friend, take your own advice
Let me love again

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh la la la la la la la la
How can I walk when I can't find a way
I have a dilemma
All I want it is to tell me
You're going to take it away

[Outro]
From a lover to a friend
From a lover to a friend
From a lover to a friend
Let me love again

[Verse 1]
If you really love me baby, better than staying in bed
If you really love me baby, nod your head
If you really love me baby till you fall down dead, she said
If you ever want to make it, nod your head

[Chorus]
Nod it up, nod it down
Side to side, around and 'round
'Round and 'round

[Verse 2]
If you ever want to prove it, then you hang it on a thread
If you ever want to shake it, nod your head
If you think the life you're leading is better then the life you led
If you like the life you're living, well, nod your head

[Chorus]
Well nod it up, nod it down
Side to side, 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round

[Outro]
If you really love me baby, better than staying in bed
If you really love me baby, nod your head

[Verse 1]
Staring from a cardboard castle down and out
One of life's young students finds out what it's all about
Paper flutters, angry taxi drivers shout
From the pages of a paper, candles shine
On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine
They suggest a highly recommended wine
Once again the same old line

[Chorus 1]
Why so sad, my fine young friend?
Why so blue?

[Verse 2]
Weary carriage horses stand in single file
Someone at a crowded bus stop wears a friendly smile
Touching nerves that no one's heard from in a while
Papers from the same old file

[Chorus 1]
Why so sad, my fine young friend?
Why so blue?

[Verse 3]
Sometimes, when eyes meet, you know
They have to meet again
Sometimes birds of a feather
Got to fly together
From a dingy attic window candles shine
On a perfect table laid for two who love to dine
Now they drink the highly recommended wine
Free at last and feeling fine

[Chorus 2]
I'm so glad, my fine young friend
Glad for you
I'm so glad, my fine young friend
Glad for you

[Outro]
You used to be so blue, you used to be so blue
Why so blue?

[Verse 1]
Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips

[Verse 2]
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff in a violent room
Fightin' with lover's past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast

[Verse 3]
Well, I ordered: "Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't too hungry"
Dorothy laughed
She said: "It sound like a real man to me
(You're kinda cute)
You're kinda cute, you wanna take a bath?"
(Do you wanna, do you wanna?)
... Bath?

[Verse 4]
Oh, I said: "Cool, but I'm leavin' my pants on (What you say?)
'Cause I'm kinda goin' with someone"
She said: "Sound like a real man to me
Mind if I turn on the radio?"
"Oh, my favorite song," she said
And it was Joni singing: "Help me, I think I'm falling"
(Drring) The phone rang and she said
"Whoever's calling can't be as cute as you"
Right then and there I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)

Well

[Verse 5]
My pants were wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie 'cause she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh
(Ha ha, ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back to the violent room
(Tell us what you did, what you did)
Let me tell you what I did

[Chorus]
I took another bubble bath with my pants on
All the fighting stopped
Next time I'll do it sooner
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker

[Outro]
Well
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Well
Oh

[Verse 1]
And if you take your love away from me
I'm only going to want it back
I'll probably pretend I didn't see
But knowing me, I'll want you back again, and again
Till the word has lost its meaning

[Chorus]
And love is all that stays
Only love remains

[Verse 2]
If you should ever feel that something's wrong
I'm gonna wanna put it right
To bring a happy ending to our song
I'll carry on believing in a love
If your love was to trickle through my fingers
What would it leave me with?

[Chorus]
Only love remains
(Only love, love remains)
Only love (Remains)

[Bridge]
Old enough and strong enough to stretch across the world
Taking the sand inside an oyster, changing it into a pearl
Making another magic transformation
Find the right boy for the right girl

[Verse 3]
When all our friends have gone and we're alone
There's nothing left to shout about
Together we'll explore the great unknown
I'd say we won't be going out tonight
Let tonight be the one that we remember

[Chorus]
When love is all that stays
Only love remains
When love is all that stays (Only love, love remains)
Only love remains
Only love remains

[Verse 1]
Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But moving and a grooving going to satisfy my soul

[Chorus]
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
Send it to the store and buy some more and
Have a party tonight

[Verse 2]
I've never kissed a bear
I've never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room

[Chorus]
And let's party
Let's have a party
Send it to the store and buy some more and
Have a party tonight

[Verse 3]
Now, honky-tonky Joe
Is knocking at the door
Bring him in and fill him up and set him on the floor

[Chorus]
And have a party
Yeah let's have a party
Send it to the store and buy some more and
Have a party tonight

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Well, I feel it in my leg
Feel it in my shoe
Tell me, pretty baby if you think you feel it too

[Chorus]
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
Oh, I'm going to send it to the store and buy some more and
Have a party tonight

[Verse 1]
Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But moving and a grooving going to satisfy my soul

[Chorus]
Let's have a party
Yeah let's have a party
Oh, I'm going to send it to the store and buy some more and
Have a party tonight
We're going to send it to the store and buy some more and
Have a party tonight
Oh yeah
We're going to have ourselves a little party tonight

[Outro]
I'm not giving up yet
I'm going to have a party, yeah
Party hearty
Yeah I'm not going home yet
Send it to the store and buy some more
Come on and have a party tonight
Some people like to rock
People like to roll
Moving' and groovin' to satisfy my soul
Let's have a party

[Verse 1]
Crash bang wallop I'm a lover again
I've got my eyes on the road and I'm feeling no pain
I've found a real fine woman, I'm heading to see her
Bye bye melancholy listen to me
We had a long long ride but it isn't to be
I've got a real fine woman, I'm heading to see her now

[Chorus]
Get out of my way
Get out of my life
I don't need anybody to tell me
How to be right
Now don't try to stop me

I won't need anybody except my woman tonight
Yeah yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I can't help it if I'm starting to smile
I've got a full gas tank and it's only a mile
Till I'll be with my little woman, I'm ready to see her
So I say bye bye melancholy listen to me
We had a long long ride but it isn't to be
I've got a real fine woman, I'm heading to see her now

[Chorus]
Get out of my way
Get out of my life

How to be right
Don't try to stop me

Tonight

Alright

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah now
All mine, mine, mine, mine
Yeah, road too all bright

[Verse 1]
Nothing too much just out of sight
You say you love me
If this is true, the best thing to do
Is to lie down beside me
I said I love you
Now nothing too much just out of sight

Oh, don't you want to be fair?
In the beautiful in the twilight now
Of the half-night, it was all bright
All bright

[Verse 2]
I love you
I said I love you
I thought you knew
The last thing to do was to try to betray me
The new morning light, I'll never forget it
That's just out of sight
Twilight of the half-night
Southwest, I was barely obsessed
Nothing too much all bright

[Verse 3]
All I can remember, the beautiful air
I can't remember, why did you take me there?
Don't you try to betray me, yeah
You don't wanna betray me
I was barely obsessed, the way
I was barely obsessed with the way she undressed

Bright nothing too half-night
Yeah, it was all right, all bright
Now nothing too much just out of sight

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
Now nothing too much just out of sight
In the beautiful air

Oh, don't you wanna be frightened of the half-night
Beautiful air
On the road to the west, oh, I was barely obsessed
By the way she undressed in the moonlight
In the twilight of the half-night
It was alright, all bright
All bright
Well nothing too much
It was alright
Just out of sight

The last thing to do was to try to betray me

[Verse 1]
Velvet, I can wish you for the collar of your coat
And fortune smiling all along your way
But more I cannot wish you than to wish you find your love
Your own true love this day

[Verse 2]
Mansions, I can wish you, seven footmen all in red
And calling cards upon a silver tray
But more I cannot wish you than to wish you find your love
Your own true love this day

[Bridge]
Standing there gazing at you
Full of the bloom of youth
Standing there gazing at you
With the sheepish eye and a look of the truth

[Verse 3]
Music, I can wish you, merry music while you're young
And wisdom, when your hair has turned to gray
But more I cannot wish you than to wish you find your love
Your own true love this day

[Outro]
With the sheepish eye and the look of the truth
And the strong arms to carry you away

[Chorus]
I saw two magpies
A girl and a boy
One for sorrow, two for joy
With no salutes, I move away
And long to face, face, face
Face down fear, ooh

[Chorus]
I saw two magpies
There was a girl and a boy
One for sorrow, two for joy
Content to cry, no more to lie
I move away
And lie in truth, cha

[Chorus]
Look, two magpies
Ooh, a girl and a boy
One for sorrow, two for joy
Three for a girl and four for a boy
I saw two magpies
Two for joy

[Outro]
Content to cry
No more to lie
In truth with you
To face down fear
Content to cry
No more to lie
No more to lie
And face down fear
Doo doo

[Chorus 1]
Like the sun playing in the morning
Feel the quiet, feel the thunder
Every ladder leads to heaven
Colored pencils, draw the picture

[Chorus 2]
Sing the changes, oh, as you're sleeping
Feel the quiet, feel the thunder
Sing the changes calling over
Feel the quiet in the thunder

[Chorus 1]
Like the sun playing in the morning
Feel the quiet, feel the thunder
Every ladder leads to heaven
Colored pencils, draw the picture

[Chorus 3]
Sing your praises as you're sleeping
Sing the changes, any wonder
Feel a sense of childlike wonder
Sing your praises as you're sleeping

[Chorus 2]
Sing the changes, oh, as you're sleeping
Feel the quiet, feel the thunder
Sing the changes calling over
Feel the quiet in the thunder

[Chorus 4]
Sing your praises as you're sleeping
Feel the quiet in the thunder
Sing the changes calling over
Everybody has a sense of childlike wonder

[Chorus 4]
Sing your praises as you're sleeping
Feel the quiet in the thunder
Sing the changes calling over
Everybody has a sense of childlike wonder

[Verse 1]
Can I get you to give me a minute of your time?
Can I get you to slip me the answer?
Can I get you to show me a little of your mime?
You were always a very good dancer

[Verse 2]
I'd be happy to show you a bit of what I found
I'd be happy to share in its beauty
I'd be happy to lay low, inevitably bound
I would only be doing my duty

[Pre-Chorus]
I wait, I wait
I can wait
I can wait back in the bar
I can wait, I can wait
I can wait back in the car
I'll be waiting for you

[Chorus]
Stranglehold, you know you've got one on me
I don't want to go without ya
Stranglehold, you've got me where you want me
But I want to know more about ya
I want to know more about ya

[Verse 3]
Are you willing to wager a little of your life?
Are you willing to take such a gamble?
Are you ready to walk on the edge of the knife?
Then I think we can skip the preamble

[Pre-Chorus]
I wait, I wait
I can wait
I can wait
I can wait back in the bar
I can wait, I can wait
I can wait back in the car
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting

[Chorus]
Stranglehold, you know you've got one on me
I don't want to go without ya
Stranglehold, you've got me where you want me
And I want to know more about ya
I want to know more about ya

[Outro]
I can wait
I can wait back in the bar
I can wait, I can wait
I can wait back in the car
I'll be waiting for you

[Intro]
A master can highlight the phrases
Sleazy instruments, half talked, half baked ideas
Dad, you didn't say O.K.!
The window was open, outside was a spaceship
(A master can highlight the phrases)
It took off into the sky, leaving a trail of smoke behind it...

[Verse 1]
Short of the standard, was it the sun?
What was rehearsal? Conventional drum?
Not quite a hundred, less than a ton
Clearly the time came, the plan had begun

[Chorus]
With talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
Words of a feather are worn in a hat
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
I'm happy to do it for you

[Verse 2]
Developed since earlier days at the school
Cheapest sensations were used as a rule
Outstanding to memory, major free flow
Bio-degradable, look out below for
Talk, more talk
Oh, I love to hear the gentle sound
Of conversation sprinkled around
A room where I can be at one with you for

[Chorus]
Talk, more talk (Talk, talk, talk)
Chat, more chat (Chat, chat, chat)
Words of a feather are worn in a hat
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
I'm happy to do it for you
I'm happy to do it for you
I'm happy to do it for you
I'm happy to do it, I'm happy to do it
I'm happy to do it for you

[Verse 3]
Digital organ, finishing stretch
Instrumentation, analogue Gretsch
Not quite a thousand, lower than that
Possible bargain for listening at that

[Chorus]
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
Words of a feather are worn in a hat
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
I'm happy to do it for you

[Bridge]
All you want is a handyman and all you want is quick service
Because I'm a house owner
I am a house owner
It may be worth something someday
I hear water going through the pipes
I don't actually like sitting down music
Music is ideas
Talk, chat
Talk, chat
Talk, chat
Talk, chat

[Chorus]
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
Words of a feather are worn in a hat
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
Talk, more talk (More talk)
Chat, more chat (Chat, more chat)
Words of a feather are worn in a hat
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat

Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
Words of a feather are worn in a hat
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat

[Outro]
A master can tell (Talk, more talk)
Highlight the phrases his words to digress (Chat, more chat)
Grey flannel trousers
Grey flannel trousers (Words of a feather)
A blazer and grey flannel trousers (Are worn in a hat)
(Talk, more talk)

[Verse 1]
Open up your heart
If you want to set me free
Full of love, your love
Sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea

[Verse 2]
Lighten up, my heart
Leave it to the evening breeze
Give me love, your love
Sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea

[Chorus]
Oh my, I feel love for you
Spreading through my body
I remember how
We can be so loving
I feel love for you now

Loosen up, my heart
Let me have some time to be
With a love, oh my love
Sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea

[Chorus]
Oh my, I feel love for you
Spreading through my body
I remember how
We can be so loving
I feel love for you now
I feel love for you right now

[Post-Chorus]
We're sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea

[Outro]
Oh, I feel love for you now
I feel love for you right now
I feel love for you now
Baby I feel love for you right now
We're sailing on a winedark open sea
Sailing on a winedark open sea
Finish it now
I ride on the white wind high over the sand
I follow the bluebird, I follow the wise
I glide on the green leaf not asking for more
I follow the white wind, I glide on the green leaf

I swim in the blue sea, I walk on the sand
I fly through the blue sky to wherever you land

I ride on the white wind to a far away shore
I follow the bluebird to wherever she lands

I'll be traveling tonight, oh, across the sea
Where she waits, she waits for me
Across the broken sea
From the sea, from the sea
Oh yes, from across the endless sea
I'll be traveling tonight

[Verse 1]
Running through the nighttime
And looking like a wreck
Got too many highlights
And a love bite on her neck

Looking for some pay daddies
Who'll maybe come around
Everybody wondering
What's that sound

[Chorus]
Highway (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Always (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Highway (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Always (Do ya, do ya, do ya)

[Verse 2]
Standing in the doorway of a little black shop
Lifting up a pin light and ringing up a cop
Running down the street
Everybody sees
What she's got is what she needs
And what she loves is me

[Chorus]
Highway (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Highway (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Always (Do ya, do ya, do ya)

[Chorus]
Highway (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Yeah (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Highway (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Always (Do ya, do ya, do ya)

[Verse 3]
Oh, looking in the flowers
Hang on me every hour
Take me high and let me think
Move me baby, move me away
Everybody wondering why you're looking such a wreck
Yeah

[Chorus]
Highway (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Highway (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)

[Verse 4]
Everybody wondering why she didn't love me more
They damn know what it self
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Somebody can move me (Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Oh I'm feeling naked (Do ya, do ya, do ya)

Words are getting higher
Everybody fire
Lord, the sun is rising again
Words are getting higher
Everybody fire
Lord, the sun is rising again

[Outro]
Words are getting higher
Everybody fire

[Verse 1]
Well we're going to, yeah we're going to
Get it right this time
We're going to really going to
Raise it to the sky
People are ready to forgive a few mistakes
But let's get started, form a party
Don't you know how long it takes

[Chorus]
C'mon people let the fun begin
We've got a future and it's rushing in
Call all the minstrels from the ancient shrine
Pass down the message that it's right this time

[Verse 2]
Well I'm trying to, yeah I'm crying to
Lay it on the line
We're trying to, really dying to

So many yearning for the way it's gonna be
Believe it when you see it happening to you

We'll do what never has been done before

Call all the minstrels from the ancient shrine
Pass down the message that it's right this time

Yeah c'mon people

[Verse 1]
When the sky is filled up
With stones and heavy rain
And trouble starts sliding
Across the way

It's hard for me to see
Which road I've gotta take
I know I need to find a way
To leave it all behind

[Chorus]
Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me
Let it shine on
Yeah, let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me

[Verse 2]
And when the light is filled up
With storms and heavy rain
And trouble comes sliding
Across my mind

Which road I'm gonna take
I know I need to find a way
To leave it all behind

Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me

The air is buzzing
Na na na na na na, la la

Through the curtains, I look out
And the sun is melting the ground
When I'm walking through the town
Oh, every morning, every morning

Waves are breaking
I'm in the water

[Chorus]
The sun is shining down

[Verse 1]
Step into the misty mountains
With your hair like ambered honey
To feeling warm and breezes
Let me sweetly
Let me hear your sweet, sweet laughter
And your loving conversation
And your innocent solution

[Chorus]
Give me love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Be my lifelong passion
Give me love, love, love
Oh, make my lifelong passion

Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away

[Verse 2]
You feel the warm and breezes
You give me hands of warmth
Give me one of your hands
Let me hear your sweet, sweet laughter
Give me one of your hands
Let me kiss your lips of silver
Let me kiss your lips of silver

[Chorus]
Give me love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

Innocent solution
Make my lifelong passion, ooh

[Verse 1]
It's beautiful outside, an old hand gathers wood
Can he see me sitting here? His mind is somewhere else
His friends have flown away, he's left out in the cold
He won't sit by my fire, he says he likes it in the snow
Where footprints never go, he likes it in the snow

[Verse 2]
It's getting dark outside, the old hand's going home
Has he someone waiting there? Or is he living on his own?
Where footprints never go, he likes it in the snow

[Chorus]
White blanket, hiding the traces of tears she didn't see
Oh white blanket covers the memory
Of all that used to be, all that used to be
But his heart keeps aching in the same old way
He can't help feeling that she might come back someday

[Verse 3]
It's beautiful outside, a magpie looks for food
The old hand throws a crumb
Do you think he's found a friend?
Where footprints never go, he likes it in the snow

[Chorus]
White blanket, hiding the traces of paths he didn't take
Oh white blanket covers the memory
Of moves he didn't make
Oh white blanket, hiding the traces of tears she didn't see
Snow white blanket simply covers the memory
Of all that used to be
But his heart keeps aching in the same old way
He can't help feeling that she might come back someday

[Verse 1]
You should have let me know
That I had no chance at all
I can never be what you wanted
Should have let me know
That you're still thinking about her
Should've told me you was on it

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wonder why
Why I even bother
Trying to pull you out, boy
Should have let me know
I would lose you to the drink

[Chorus]
Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide ya, I can guide ya
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you're scared to death
Running out of breath
But I can hold you, hold you

[Verse 2]
You should have let me know
That you worked around the clock
Could have tried a little harder, yeah
You should have let me know
That you were afraid to love me
Afraid of looking like a liar

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wonder why
Why I even ask you, but I do

[Chorus]
Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide you, I can guide you
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you're scared to death
Running out of breath
But I can hold you, hold you
Lovers in a dream
Warmer than the sun
Lovers in a dream
Warmer than the sun
Lovers in a dream
Warmer than the sun
Lovers in a
Warmer than the sun

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got them

[Chorus]
I'm gonna smile and say "I hope you're feeling better"
And close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you

[Piano Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm gonna smile and say "I hope you're feeling better"
And close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe, oh, I'm gonna make believe
I'm going to make believe it came from you

[Intro]
Say one, say two, say three

[Verse 1]
Darlin', I love you very, very, very much
And I really am relyin' on your touch
But with all these people listenin' in
I don't know where I ought to begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we could hit upon a word
Something that the others haven't heard
When you want me to love you
Just tell me to press

[Chorus]
Right there, that's it, yeah
Ah, when you feel the stress, don't just stand there
Tell me to press

[Bridge]
You can give me what I want, I must confess
My body needs attention, my mind is in a mess
Oklahoma was never like this
Never like this, it was never like this
Ever like this, say was it ever like this?
Oklahoma was never like this
Oh, it was never like this!

[Verse 2]
Darlin', I know it really wouldn't be a crime
If I say I want to love you all the time
But with all these people listening in
I don't know where I ought to begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we should have a secret code
Before we both get ready to explode
When you want me to love you
Well just tell me to press
(Tell me to press, to press)

[Chorus]
Right there, that's it, yes
When you feel the stress
Don't just stand there
Tell me to press
(Tell me to press, tell me to press)

[Bridge 2]
My minds's in a mess
Oklahoma was never like this

[Outro]
Tell me to press (Never like this)
Right there (Never like this)

When you feel the stress (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh, come on now (Never like this)
Will you tell me to press? (Never like this)
Will you tell me to press? (Never like this)
Right there (Never like this)
That's it, yes! (Oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, yeah (Never like this)
Tell me to press
Well, just tell me to press
Whoa, been so good
Like you knew that it should (Never like this)
Oh, you tell me to press (Never like this)

A little bit higher (Never like this)
Woo, that's right (Oh-oh-oh)
Whoa, you feel the stress (Never like this)
Tell me to press (Never like this)
A little bit harder (Never like this)
A little bit higher (Never like this)
A little bit farther (Never like this)

Hillmen, hillmen, hillmen, hillmen
Oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 1]
Hillmen come down from the lava
Forging across the mighty river flow
Always forever
Only so you don't worry
Your pretty little head

[Chorus]
Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
Hillmen, hillmen, hillmen, hillmen
Oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 2]

Carrying trinkets, silk and precious stones, oh oh
Exotic legends

Your pretty little head

Hillmen, hillmen, hillmen, hillmen
Oh oh, oh oh

Living a life of silent dignity, oh oh

[Intro]
Evening marks the close of day
Skies of blue begin to grey
Crimson hues are fading in the west
Evening ever brings to me
Dreams of days that used to be
Memories of those I love the best

[Verse 1]
When shadows fall and trees whisper, day is ending
My thoughts are ever wending home
When crickets call, my heart is forever yearning
Once more to be returning home

[Bridge]
When the hills conceal the setting sun
Stars begin a-peeping, one by one

[Verse 2]
Night covers all, and though fortune may forsake me
Sweet dreams will ever take me home
Take me home

[Bridge]
When the hills conceal the setting sun
Stars begin a-peeping, one by one

[Verse 2]
Night covers all, and though fortune may forsake me
Sweet dreams will ever take me home

[Verse 1]
Step into the misty mountains
With your hair like ambered honey
To feeling warm and breezes
Let me sweetly
Let me hear your sweet, sweet laughter
And your loving conversation
And your innocent solution

[Chorus]
Give me love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Be my lifelong passion
Give me love, love, love
Make my lifelong passion
Sail away 

[x4]

[Verse 2]
You feel the warm and breezes
You give me hands of warmth
Give me one f your hands
Let me hear your sweet, sweet laughter
Give me one of your hands
Let me kiss your lips of silver 

[x2]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Give me love, love, love
Make my lifelong passion
Loving conversation
Loving conversation
Innocent solution
Make my lifelong passion

[Verse 1]
Well, the rest of my life lay in front of me
I was pedaling down the road
When I saw Nell Gwynne and her oranges
And said "I'll have one of those"

[Chorus]
She said "Move over, busker
Don't bang your drum
Move over, busker
Your time will come"

[Verse 2]
Well I was hanging around for a miracle
Struggling with a rhyme
When I saw Mae West in a sweaty vest
And I said "I'll come up and see you sometime"

[Chorus]
She said "Move over, busker
That's not my style
Your chance is coming
In a little while"

[Bridge]
We've got it coming, come on, come on
We've got it coming, coming to you
We've got it coming, come on, come on
We've got it coming, coming to you

Well, I've been waiting
But I'm impatient
No-one can hold me back
I want to stay with the action
But I won't get it
My great illusion
Will vanish anyhow
If I don't grab it now

[Verse 3]
Well, I was hacking my way through the undergrowth
Juggling with my pride
When I saw Errol Flynn in a tiger skin
And I said, "You look satisfied!"
Well, he looked down at me from his motor home
And he gave me a dirty smile
He said "Well, yes, I am but she's calling me
Would you excuse us for a while?"

[Chorus]
Move over, busker
Your day is done
Move over, busker
My time has come
I'm telling you to
Move over, busker (Come on, come on)
I'll bang my drum (Come on, come on)
Move over, busker
My time has come
(You've got it coming, coming to you)

Move over, busker (Come on, come on)
Your day is done (Come on, come on)
Move over, busker
My time has come
(You've got it coming, coming to you)

[Verse 1]
Say, its only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Verse 2]
Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Chorus]
Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

[Verse 3]
It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Chorus]
Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

[Verse 3]
Yeah, It's a Barnum and Bailey world
About a phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Outro]
If you believed in me
If you believed in me

[Chorus]
What the hell gives you the right to tell me what to do with my life?
Especially when you made a mess of every chance you had to success
Look at you, just look at you
I said I'm angry
Just looking at you
Ah, come on!

[Verse 1]
And I'm sick and tired of sitting back listening to all of your clap-trap (Clap-trap)
If you could get me to take the rap I guarantee you'd leave me with a backslap (Backslap)
Push me to the left, push me to the right
Try to take me out of the way
Even if you kick me off the edge of the world
You're still going to hear me say

[Chorus]
What the hell gives you the right to tell me what to do with my life? (Life, life, life, life, life)
Especially when you made a mess of every chance you had to success
Look at you! Ow, look at you
I said I'm angry
Just looking at you

[Post-Chorus]
Shouting down again Mahama
Shouting down again
Shouting down again Mahama
Shouting down again

[Verse 2]
I can't begin to tell you all the reasons
Why you're making me crazy (Crazy)
I've got so many answers
Like you're stupid, like you're crooked, like you're lazy (Lazy)
Hit me with your left, hit me with your right
Hit me from the top to the toe
Even when you chew me up and spit me out
I'm still going to want to know

[Chorus]
What the hell gives you the right to tell me what to do with my life?
Especially when you made a mess of every chance you had to success
Look at you, look at you!
I said I'm angry
Just looking at you
Lookin', shouting, oh!

[Outro]
Shouting down again Mahama
Shouting down again
Shouting down again Mahama
Shouting down again
What the hell gives you the right?!

[Verse 1]
Ears twitch, like a dog
Breaking eggs in a dish
Do not mock me when I say
This is not a lie

[Verse 2]
It's a funny thing, half serious
With our hands on our ears
Living dreams with mouths ajar
Wide awake, we go to sleep

[Chorus]
However absurd, however absurd... It may seem
However absurd, however absurd... It may seem

[Bridge]
Something special between us
When we made love the game was over
I couldn't say the words
Words wouldn't get my feelings through
So I keep talking to you

[Chorus]
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem

[Verse 3]
Custom made dinosaurs
Too late now, for a change
Everything is under the sun
But nothing is for keeps

[Chorus]
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... that may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd, however absurd,... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem

[Verse 1]
I tried to get over you
I tried to find something new
But all I could ever do was fill my time
With thoughts of you

[Verse 2]
I tried to go somewhere old
To search for my pot of gold
But all I could ever hold inside my mind
Were thoughts of you

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear your music and it's driving me wild
Familiar rhythms in a different style
I hear your music, and it's driving me wild again, oh

[Chorus]
Don't want to let you take me down
Don't want to get hurt second time around
Don't want to walk that lonely road again

[Guitar Solo]
Yeah!
Oh, lonely, lonely road

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear your music, and it's driving me wild
Familiar rhythms in a different style
I hear your music, and it's driving me wild again

[Chorus]
Don't want to let you take me down
Don't want to get hurt second time around
Don't want to walk that lonely road again

Don't want to let you take me down
Don't want to get hurt second time around
Don't want to walk that lonely road again

[Outro]
I don't wanna walk that lonely road, no
Don't wanna, don't wanna walk that lonely road
Don't wanna walk that lonely road
I don't wanna walk it
No, no, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna walk that lonely road
I don't wanna walk that lonely road again
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna walk that lonely road
No, no
No, no

[Chorus]
You need love, write a letter, you need love write away
Get it down, you'll feel better, send it now, write away

[Verse 1]
Hey Cinderella, did you need that other fella?
On the wrong side of midnight your defences slipped away
You need attention, so I think it's worth a mention
That if I can deliver
Well there wouldn't be no heavy price to pay

[Chorus]
You need love so write a letter, you need love, write away
If you need to feel better do it now, write away

[Verse 2]
Hey Margarita, I can't think of nothing sweeter
But the taste of your nectar seems to leave the boys astray
Don't you forget it, well you know you won't regret it
I've got the answer, you were looking at it long before today

[Chorus]
You need love so write a letter, you need love write away
Get it down, you'll feel better, send it now, write away

[Outro]
You need love, love, love, write a letter
You need love, write away
If you need to feel better, do it now, now, now write away

[Intro]
It's not true!
It's not true!
It's not true!

[Verse 1]
Some people say she's a bad girl
Some people think she's a fool
Some people tell me she's no good
But I'm telling you
It's not true, it's not true, it's not true

[Verse 2]
They say that my girl's a mad girl
No saying what she might do
Some people tell me she's crazy
But I'm telling you
It's not true, it's not true, it's not true

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, they've been talking to the fellas
Ooh, ooh, ooh, have they never heard of jealousy?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, if she helps me write the melody
I'll let the words take care of themselves

[Refrain]
It's not true, it's not true, it's not true 

[x2]

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, they've been talking to the fellas
Ooh, ooh, ooh, have they never heard of jealousy?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, if she helps me write the melody
I'll let the words take care of themselves

[Verse 3]
Some people say she's a loser
Some people tell me that she's through
Some people say I don't love her
But I'm telling you
It's not true, it's not true, it's not true
What they're saying about her isn't true

[Outro]
Don't you know it isn't true?
It's not true

[Verse 1]
You don't feel right when I come on strong
Don't get it wrong
I wait all night but you won't be long
Don't get it wrong

[Chorus 1]
Hear me right
I love you from the bottom of my heart
You make the answer bright
You touch me in a way that no-one else could ever do
If you only love me, I'll love you

[Verse 2]
And if you're tempted to tell a lie
Don't get it wrong
Well it breaks my heart when I see you cry
Don't get it wrong

[Chorus 2]
Get it right
The brightest light that's shining in the skies
Is shining from your eyes
I love you in a way, that no-one else could ever do
If you only love me, I'll love you

[Bridge]
I'm often accused of giving too little
It's got me confused, I'm split down the middle
Conflicting reviews of our life coming in
It's tough on a tightrope, yes it's tough on a tightrope

[Chorus 1]
Hear me right
I love you from the bottom of my heart
You make the answer bright
You touch me in a way that no-one else could ever do
If you only love me, I'll love you

[Outro]
Tough on a tightrope

[Verse 1]
You gotta give a little, take a little
And let your poor heart break a little
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love

[Verse 2]
Now laugh a little, cry a little
Until the clouds roll by a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of love

[Bridge]
As long as there's the two of us
We've got the world and all it's charms
And when the world is through with us
We've got each other's arms

[Verse 3]
You gotta win a little, lose a little
And always have the blues a little
'Cause that's the story of, yeah, that's the glory of love

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
As long as there's the two of us
We've got the world and all it's charms
But when the world is through with us
We've got each other's arms

[Verse 3]
You've got to win a little, lose a little
And always have the blues a little
'Cause that's the story of, that's the glory of love
'Cause that's the story of, and that's the glory of love

[Verse 1]
We three, we're all alone
Living in a memory
My echo, my shadow and me

[Verse 2]
We three we're not a crowd
We're not even company
My echo, my shadow and me

[Bridge]
What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight
That shines above
I walk with my shadow, I talk with my echo
But where is the one I love

[Verse 3]
We three, we'll wait for you
Even till eternity
My echo, my shadow and me

[Verse 1]
We three, we're all alone
Living in a memory
My echo, my shadow and me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
We three, we're all alone
Living in a memory
My echo, my shadow and me

[Bridge]
What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight
That shines above
I walk with my shadow, I talk with my echo
But where's the one I love

[Verse 3]
We three, we'll wait for you
Even till eternity
My echo echo, my shadow and me
We'll be here waiting
My echo, my shadow and me

[Verse 1]
She's given up talking, don't say a word
Even in the classroom, not a dickie bird
Unlike other children, she's seen and never heard
She's given up talking, don't say a word

[Verse 2]
You see her in the playground standing on her own
Everybody wonders why she's all alone
Someone made her angry, someone's got her scared
She's given up talking, don't say a word

[Bridge]
But when she comes home, it's yap-a-yap-yap
Words are running freely like the water from a tap
Her brothers and her sisters can't get a word in edgeways
But when she's back at school again, she goes into a daze

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
But when she comes home, it's yap-a-yap-yap
Words are running freely like the water from a tap
Her brothers and her sisters can't get a word in edgeways
But when she's back at school again, she goes into a daze

[Verse 1]
She's given up talking, don't say a word
Even in the classroom, not a dickie bird
Unlike other children, she's seen and never heard
She's given up talking, don't say a word

[Outro]
She's given up talking
She don't say a word
Don't say a word
Don't say a word
Don't say a word
Don't say a word

[Verse 1]
You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister In-Between

[Verse 2]
You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
Have faith or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene

[Bridge]
To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale and Noah in the ark
What did they do, just when everything seemed so dark?
Man, they said, we gotta

[Verse 1]
Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister In-Between

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge]
To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale and Noah in the ark
What did they do, just when everything looked so dark?
Man, they said, we better

[Verse 1]
Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister In-Between

[Outro]
Oh no, don't go, they'll pave its way
Too dark for you
Don't mess with Mister In-Between

[Chorus]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's go for a drive
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Let's go there and back again

[Verse 1]
If something's open, it's my heart
If something's missing, it's when we're apart
If something's good, it's when we're back together again
Nothing's wrong, it's just insane
Nothing's right until you're back again
Nothing's broken when it's softly spoken
And we're walking slowly down the lane

[Pre-Chorus]
Why don't we drive in the rain?
Straight to the eye of the hurricane?
Go for a ride in the driving rain

[Chorus]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's go for a drive
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Ooh, ooh
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's go for a drive
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Let's go there and back again
Baby, baby

[Verse 2]
You come walking through my door
Like the one that I've been waiting for
Letting sunshine in the darkest places
When I've been going there again

[Pre-Chorus]
So why don't we drive in the rain
Straight to the eye of the hurricane?
Why don't we drive in the rain
Straight to the eye of the hurricane?
Go for a ride in the driving rain

[Chorus]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's go for a drive
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Ooh, ooh
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's go for a drive
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Let's go there and back again
Baby, baby

[Bridge]
In the driving rain
Why don't we drive in the driving rain?

[Chorus]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Ooh, ooh
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Oh, let's go back again

1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's go for a drive
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Let's go there and back again

[Outro]
You come walking through my door
Like the one that I've been waiting for

[Intro]
Everything went wrong
And the whole day long
I'd feel so blue
For the longest while
I'd forget to smile
Then I met you

Now that my blue days have passed
Now that I've found you at last

[Verse 1]
I'll be loving you, always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand
I will understand
Always, always

[Verse 2]
Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year
But always

[Instrumental Verse]

[Verse 2]
Mmm, days may not be fair, always
But that's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
No, not for just a day
Not for just a year
But always

[Verse 1]
If you only knew how much it meant to me
You'd understand and I would feel your love was true

[Chorus 1]
This is all I want
This is all I need
This is all I long for
"I do"

[Verse 2]
Just remember this, after a time it's through
And evermore will there be days for me and you

[Chorus 2]
This is all I ask
All I ask of you
Please remember darling
I do love you

[Bridge]
Days go by so quickly when you're having fun
But life is never easy even in the sun

[Verse 2]
But please remember this, after a time it's through
And evermore will there be days for me and you

[Chorus 2]
This is all I want
This is all I need
Darling please remember
I do love you

[Outro]
If you only knew

[Verse 1]
My very good friend, the milkman says
That I've been losing too much sleep
He doesn't like the hours I keep
And he suggests that you should marry me

[Verse 2]
My very good friend, the mailman says
That it would make his burden less
If we both had the same address
And he suggests that you should marry me

[Bridge]
Then there's a very friendly fellow who prints
All the latest real estate news
And every day he sends me blueprints
Of cottages with country views

[Verse 3]
All my very good friends, the neighbors say
That they've been watching little things I do
And they perceive that I love you
So I suggest that you should marry me

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Then there's a very friendly fellow who prints
All the latest real estate news
And every day he sends me blueprints
Of cottages with country views

[Verse 4]
And my very good friends, the neighbors say
That they've been watching little things I do
They perceive that I love you
So I suggest that you should marry me

[Intro]
Well, well
Oh, yeah
Mmm, hmm
Well, well
Oh, yeah
Mmm, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
If you're part of my love, don't leave home tonight
While we're sleeping we can learn to see that

[Chorus]
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside
Those of us who notice are expected to hide
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside the truth

[Verse 2]
When I look in your eyes I can see the sky
Shining down upon the perfect garden

[Chorus]
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside
Those of us who notice are expected to hide
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside the truth

[Bridge]
You can't imagine just what I've been going through
I wouldn't wish it on a soul much less on you
I well remember when my heart was free
My soul could laugh, so could we

[Verse 1]
If you're part of my love, don't leave home tonight
While we're sleeping we can learn to see that

[Chorus]
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside
Those of us who notice are expected to hide
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside the truth

[Bridge]
You can't imagine just what I've been going through
I wouldn't wish it on a soul much less on you
I well remember when my heart was free
My soul could laugh, so could we

[Verse 1]
If you're part of my love, don't leave home tonight
While we're sleeping we can learn to see that

All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside
All the world's a tiny bubble
All the world's a tiny bubble

[J. Robert Oppenheimer]
We knew the world would not be the same
Few people laughed, few people cried, most people were silent
I remember the line from The Hindu Scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita
Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty
And, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says:
"Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"
I suppose we all thought that, one way or another

[Verse 1]
There must have been magic
The night that we met
If I hadn't stopped you
I'd always regret

[Verse 2]
A few minutes later
You'd have been out that door
I'd have been lonely forever more
Forever more

[Bridge]
Oh what made us do it?
Under what holy spell?
Nature's mother knew it
Only too well

[Verse 3]
She reached out her fingers
To point at the sky
Leaving me helpless
Not knowing why

[Verse 3]
And this is the hour
That they turn out the light
Nothing but memories
Burning so bright
Burning so bright

[Bridge]
Oh what made us do it?
Under what holy spell?
Nature's mother knew it
Only too well

[Verse 1]
There must have been magic
The night that we met
If I hadn't stopped you
I'd always regret
Always regret

[Outro]
There must have been magic
There must have been magic
There must have been magic the night that we met

[Intro]
Blackbird, blackbird, singing blues all day
Right outside my door
Blackbird, blackbird, I gotta be on my way
To where the sun shines once more

[Verse 1]
I pack up all my cares and woes
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye, blackbird

[Verse 2]
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet and so is she
Bye bye, blackbird

[Bridge]
No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me

[Verse 3]
So, make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge]
No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me

[Verse 3]
Make my bed and light the light
I'll be home late tonight
Blackbird
Oh Blackbird, ooh
Blackbird, bye bye

[Verse 1]
I like it, please don't take my heart away
It's happy where it is, so let it stay

[Chorus]
You gave me love
You gave me what I wanted
You gave me love your way

[Verse 2]
I've seen it shining from the furthest stars
Like Venus saw it on the way to Mars

[Chorus]
You gave me love
You gave me what I wanted
You gave me love your way

[Post-Chorus]
Your way is strong
You way is right
Your way is mine tonight

[Verse 1]
I like it, please don't take my heart away
It's happy where it is, so let it stay

[Chorus]
You gave me love
You gave me what I wanted
You gave me love your way

[Post-Chorus]
Your way is strong
You way is right
Your way is mine tonight

Your way is strong
You way is right
Your way is mine tonight

[Outro]
You gave me love your way

[Verse 1]
If only my love was here
I’d be taking the time to feel it
Washing over my body and soul
If only my love, only my love was here

[Verse 2]
I wish that my heart was strong
I’d be letting it beat much faster
At the thought of you holding me near
I wish that my heart, wish that my heart was strong

[Bridge]
Hoping to be where you are
I’m longing to be your lover
Don't want to ever be far
Apart from you my love

[Verse 3]
But only our hearts will know
If we’re gonna spend it together
Holding on to the dreams that we share
Only our hearts know how much love is there

[Harmonica Solo]

[Bridge]
Hoping to be where you are
I’m longing to be your lover
I don't want to ever be far
Apart from you my love

[Verse 3]
But only our hearts will know
If we're gonna to spend it together
Holding on to the love that we share
Only our hearts, know how much love is there
Yes, only our hearts, know how much love is there

[Verse 1]
At last I wake up to see what you've done
So what can I do but pack up and run
I know the rules, go get yourself another fool

[Verse 2]
You say that you loved me, I'm yours to command
But your kind of loving, my heart couldn't stand
You used me for a tool, go get yourself another fool

[Bridge]
And now, now that we're through
You say you meant to be true
But deep in your heart you know
Our love could never grow

[Verse 3]
I tried to believe you that we'd never part
But your kind of loving just broke my poor heart
Now I know the rules, go get yourself another fool

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
And now, now that we're through
You say you meant to be true
But deep down in your heart you know
That our love could never grow

[Verse 3]
Well, I tried to believe you that we'd never part
Your kind of loving just broke my poor heart
But I know the rules, go get yourself another fool

[Outro]
Yeah, you better get yourself, get yourself
You better get yourself another fool
Go ahead and get yourself, get yourself
Get yourself another fool

[Chorus]
I said, "I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes"
I said, "I'm sitting here wondering
Matchbox hole in my clothes"
I haven't got no matches
But I sure got a long way to go

[Verse 1]
I'm an old poor boy
I'm a long way from home
I'm an old poor boy
And I'm a long way from home
I've never been happy
Because everything I ever did was wrong
Well, if you don't want my peaches
Honey, please don't shake my tree
If you don't want any of those peaches
Honey, please don't mess around my tree
I've got news for you, baby
Leave me here in misery, alright
Well, let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
Watch how your puppy dog runs

[Chorus]

[Intro]
World spinning round to the next revolution
Sun going down, gonna rise up again

[Verse 1]
I watch the sun go down with some sorrow
And now I know it's gonna come back tomorrow
Ain't no reason it has to do that
It's the season of the culture bat

[Chorus]
Spinning on an axis
Spinning on an axis
Staring in the face of time and space
Spinning on an axis

[Bridge]
World spinning round to the next revolution
Sun going down, gonna rise up again
World spinning round to the next revolution
Sun going down, gonna rise up again
Hear me rising
Rise up and sing
Rise up
Rise up

[Verse 2]
Although I'm curious, it isn't a crime
I want to know if I'll find out in time
A lot of people busy doing their thing
Gonna wake up and sing early

[Chorus]
Spinning on an axis
Spinning on an axis
We ask the question, the answer's "yes"
Spinning on an axis

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I watch the sun go down with some sorrow
And now I know it's gonna come back tomorrow
Ain't no reason why it has to do that
It's the season of the culture bat

[Verse 3]
I watch the sun go down
Wonder if it's gonna come back
Certainly there's no guarantee
But I got a feeling it will be

[Chorus]
Spinning on an axis
Spinning on an axis
Spinning on, spinning on an axis
Spinning on an axis
Spinning on an axis
Yeah

[Bridge]
World spinning round to the next revolution
Sun going down, gonna rise up again
World spinning round to the next revolution
Sun going down, gonna rise up
Gonna rise up
Gonna rise up
Gonna rise up
Gonna rise up again

[Outro]
World spinning round to the next revolution

[Verse 1]
You know what I mean
It's like walking in the heat all day with no water
It's like waiting for a friend
Watching everybody else meet theirs on that corner
Or losing in an argument
Though you're right, can't get your thoughts in order

[Pre-Chorus]
Still I refrain from talking at you, talking on
You know me well, I don't explain

[Chorus]
But what the hell?
Why do you think I come round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh, the truth spills out
And oh, oh I, I've told you now

[Verse 2]
You know what I mean
Although I try my best I still let down the team
You're everything I want
Why should I resist when you are there for me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Still I refrain from talking at you, talking on
You know me well, I don't explain

[Chorus]
But what the hell?
Why do you think I come round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh, the truth spills out
And oh, oh I, I've told you now

[Bridge]
I've told you now
I've told you now
I've told you now
I've told you now

[Pre-Chorus]
Still I refrain from talking at you, talking on
You know me well, I don't explain

[Chorus]
But what the hell?
Why do you think I come round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh, the truth spills out
And oh, oh I, I've told you now
But what the hell?
Why do you think I come round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh, the truth spills out
And oh, oh I, I've told you now

[Verse 1]
Inch worm, inch worm
Measuring the marigolds
You and your arithmetic
You'll probably go far

[Verse 2]
Inch worm, inch worm
Measuring the marigolds
Could it be you'll stop and see
How beautiful they are

[Verse 3]
Two and two are four
Four and four are eight
Eight and eight are sixteen
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two

[Verse 1]
Inch worm, inch worm
Measuring the marigolds
You and your arithmetic
You'll probably go far

[Verse 3]
Two and two are four
Four and four are eight
Eight and eight are sixteen
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two

[Verse 2]
Inchworm, inchworm (Two and two are four)
Measuring the marigold (Four and four are eight)
Seems to me you'd stop and see (Eight and eight are sixteen)
How beautiful they are (Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two)

[Verse 1]
Inchworm, inchworm (Two and two are four)
Measuring the marigold (Four and four are eight)
You and your arithmetic (Eight and eight are sixteen)

Together we can make it happen
Together we can make it stick
Together we can make it happen
Together we can make it stick
Together we can make it happen
Together we can make it stick

[Verse 1]
(Together we can make it happen, together)
I learn something special, special every day
I learn something special every day
(Together we can make it happen, together)
Learn something hard, learn something fast
And I learn to find my way

[Chorus]
Together we can make it happen
Together we can make it stick

[Intro]
One, two, three, four!

[Verse 1]
You give me power to get out of bed
When in the morning I'm feeling dead
Living and loving there's a lot to be said
It's true

[Chorus]
Going to say it about you
Say it about you

[Verse 2]
Out of the darkness and into the light
Straight to the centre of everything right
Darling, don't worry, the sky will be bright and blue

[Chorus]
When I say it about you
Going to say it about you
I'll say it about you

[Verse 3]
When did you teach me to fly thru the air?
Sooner or later, we all will be there
I read the headlines, and now I can swear
It's true

[Outro]
And they said it about you
Gonna say it about you
Gonna say it about you
Gonna say it about you
Gonna say it about you
Gonna say it about you

[Verse]
I'm going to fly to the moon
Check in outta space
Find me a suitable plot
Build myself a place
There I will stay for a year and a day
Until the cares of my life blow away
And I will dance to a runcible tune
With the queen of my heart

[Outro]
Heather

[Chorus 1]
Ooh, ooh, what do you do?
No one else can dance like you
So what's all the fuss?
There ain't nobody that spies like us

[Chorus 2]
Hey, hey, what do you say?
Someone took your plans away
So what's all the fuss?
There ain't nobody that spies like us

[Verse 1]
Hey don't feel afraid of an undercover aid
There's no need to fuss
There ain't nobody that spies like us
Spies like us

We don't know the meaning of fear
We play every minute by ear
One for all and all for one
Everybody's on the run
Especially at this time of year

[Chorus 1]
Ooh, ooh, what do you do?
No one else can dance like you
So what's all the fuss?
There ain't nobody that spies like us

[Chorus 2]
Hey, hey, what do you say?
Someone took your plans away
So what's all the fuss?
There ain't nobody that spies like us

[Verse 2]
We get there by hook or by crook
We don't do a thing by the book
Never needed special clothes
How we did it no one knows
I guess we must have had what it took

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh when things get tough (oh when things get tough)
Guys like us act rough (guys like us act rough)

[Chorus 2]
Hey, hey, what do you say?
Someone took your plans away
So what's all the fuss?
There ain't nobody that spies like us
Spies like us

Where we're leaving behind
All our trouble and strife
That's the way it's gonna be
Oh, for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
Well, here we are, here we are
We're back in the sunshine again
No more worries, no more worries
And no more pain, no more pain

[Bridge]
Life's too short to spend it lonely
You only throw it away
Listen to your voice of reason
Yeah, call it a day
Eh eh ay

Take a ride, take a ride
Out to the land of the free, ooh ooh
Don't hurry take your time, take your time
Come and spend it with me

Why, why?

[Outro]
We're back in the sunshine again

[Verse 1]
How can I hope to reach your love?
Help me to discover what it is you're thinking of
'Cause when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity inside your loving flame

[Bridge]
What am I to do if I don't have you?
I'll be feeling blue just sitting here without you
You could be the one to chase my blues away
Away

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
So tell me how, how to reach your love
Help me to discover what it is you're thinking of
'Cause when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity inside your loving flame

[Bridge]
What am I to do if I don't have you?
Say I'll be feeling blue just sitting here without you
You could be the one to chase my blues away
Away

'Cause when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity inside your loving flame
So tell me how (Tell me how)

[Verse 1]
Picking up scales and broken chords
Puppy dog tails in the house of lords
Tell me darling, what can it mean?

[Verse 2]
Making up moons in a minor key
What have those tunes got to do with me?
Tell me darling, where have you been?

[Chorus]
Once upon along ago
Children searched for treasure
Nature's plan went hand in hand with pleasure
My pleasure

[Verse 3]
Blowing balloons on a windy day
Desolate dunes with a lot to say
Tell me darling, what have you seen?

[Chorus]
Once upon along ago
Children searched for treasure
Nature's plan went hand in hand with pleasure
Such pleasure

[Verse 4]
Playing guitars on an empty stage
Counting the bars of an iron cage
Tell me darling, what can it mean?

[Verse 1]
Picking up scales and broken chords
Puppy dog tails in the house of lords
Tell me darling, what does it mean?

[Chorus]
Once upon along ago
Children searched for treasure
Nature's plan went hand in hand with pleasure
Such pleasure

[Verse 4]
Playing guitars on an empty stage
Counting the bars of an iron cage
Tell me darling, what can it all mean?

Picking up scales and broken chords
Puppy dog tails in the house of lords
Tell me darling, oh, what can it mean?

[Chorus]
Once upon along ago
Children searched for treasure

Such pleasure

[Verse 1]
Sally, Sally, pride of our alley
You're more than the whole world to me
Sally, Sally, don't ever wander
Away from the alley and me
Ladies and gentlemen, Reginald Dixon
And the Blackpool Tower Orchestra
Come on Reg, lovely, lovely, lovely
I love the way this boy plays, I love it
Marvelous, marvelous, I love it, I love it
Oh, now when you're away there are gray skies
And when I'm away there are even more gray skies
Than the gray skies I talked about before
Sally, Sally, don't ever wander
Away from the alley and me, oh
Thank you, thank you, thank you so much
Thank you, thank you so much
For coming here to Batley tonight
So lovely

[Verse 1]
The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring
And you appear in all your splendor
My one and only love
The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips, so warm and tender
My one and only love

[Chorus]
The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

[Verse 2]
You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love

[Chorus]
The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love

[Verse 1]
Hey, everybody out there
You know what it's like
If you haven't got a life
When you haven't got a life
Hey, do you want to make a difference?
Well, stand in the line
If you haven't got the time
I can give you some of mine

[Chorus]
There, but for the grace of God go you and I
We're the brightest objects in the sky
There, but for the grace of God go you and I
Do some good before you say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Hey, I was trying to remember
How bad it was then
When you didn't have a friend
When you didn't have a friend
Hey, everybody out there (Oh oh oh oh)
Everybody out there
Hey, everybody out there (Oh oh oh oh)

[Chorus]
There, but for the grace of God go you and I
We're the brightest objects in the sky
Remember, there but for the grace of God go you and I
Do some good before you say goodbye

[Outro]
Hey, everybody out there
Oh, talk to me
I can't hear you
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey, everybody out there
I know what it's like
I know what it's like
Everybody out there
I can't hear you, I can't hear you
Everybody out there

[Verse 1]
Come now, lady, don't you do me wrong
I fell for you, and now it won't be long
Before I hold you in my arms
Before I take you to my heart again

[Verse 2]
Time is flying by us every day
I want to show my love in every way
I want to hold you in my arms
I want to take you to my heart again

[Chorus]
If you believe it, you can stay all night
Hide in the darkness 'til it's getting light
Do everything until we've got it done
Then sing hosanna to the morning sun
Hosanna, hosanna
Sing hosanna to the morning sun

[Verse 3]
Calm down, lady, don't put up a fight
If you are true, you know the time is right
For me to hold you in my arms
For me to take you to my heart

[Chorus]
If you believe it we can stay all night
Hide in the darkness till it's getting light
Do everything until we've got it done
Then sing hosanna to the morning sun
Hosanna, hosanna
Sing hosanna to the morning sun
Hosanna, hosanna

[Verse 1]
Listen to me, we can give it a try
I'll look you straight in the eye and pull you to me
What I'm going to do next I'll leave entirely to your imagination

[Verse 2]
Do you hear me, if you don't understand
I'll take a hold of your hand and pull you near me
What I'm gonna do next I'll leave entirely to your imagination

[Chorus]
I can bet, I can bet
I can bet you'll never guess
I can bet, I can bet
I can bet that you'll never guess
Oh, no

[Verse 3]
Come and feel it, we can give it a go
But if you'd rather not go, I won't reveal it
Because what I'm going to do next I'll leave entirely to your imagination

[Chorus]
I can bet, I can bet
I can bet you'll never guess
I can bet, I can bet
I can bet that you'll never guess
Oh, no

[Bridge]
Be straight with me, yeah
Create with me, yeah
Don't wait for me to be steady
I've got no plan, yeah
But I'm you man, yeah
And I'll be there when you're ready

[Verse 4]
What I'm going to do next I'll leave entirely to your imagination

[Chorus]
I can bet, I can bet
I can bet you'll never guess
I can bet, I can bet
I can bet that you'll never guess
Oh, no

[Verse 1]
If you ask her how it's done, she won't know
It's like trying to catch the sun on the water
She tries to explain, then it happens again

[Chorus]
Everybody's looking at her
She's got everybody talking about her
She's good, she's kind, she's so refined
But me, I'm losing my mind

[Verse 2]
Though she haunts me like the sound of the rain
Or a river running down to the ocean
I hate to complain but it's happening again

[Chorus]
Everybody's looking at her
She's got everybody talking about her
She's good, so fine, she's sweet as wine
But me, I'm losing my mind

[Bridge]
Doesn't she know, why can't she see
Look at the effect, she's having on me
I'm not alone, I'm part of the crowd
Turning our heads, as she walks down the street

[Verse 3]
She tries to explain, then it happens again

[Chorus]
Everybody's looking at her
She's got everybody talking about her
She's good, she's kind, she's so refined
But me, I'm losing my mind

[Outro]
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind

[Verse 1]
Peaceful, like heaven on a Sunday
Wishful, not thinking what to do
We've been calling it love
But it's a dream we're going through

[Chorus]
And if I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose

[Verse 2]
Restful, like Devon on a Monday
Cooling my fingers in the bay
We've been learning a song
But it's a long and lonely blues

[Chorus]
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
It's peaceful, like heaven on a Sunday
Wishful, not thinking what to do
We've been calling it love (love)
But it's a dream (dream) we're going through (through)

And if I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose

Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
Yours would be the one I'd choose
If I only had one love
(Yours would be, yours would be...)
(Heaven on a Sunday)

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

[Chorus]
All my loving I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you

All my loving I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true
All my loving, all my loving ooh
All my loving I will send to you

But in the night-time that dark is black
Come on baby you got to help me get back

[Chorus]
I love you, oh yeah

Oh yeah, you know it's true

[Verse 1]
Someone's gone out fishing, someone's high and dry
Someone's on a mission to the lonely Lorelei
Some folk's got a vision of a castle in the sky
And I'm left stranded, wondering why

[Verse 2]
You and me together, nothing feels so good
Even if I get a medal from my local neighbourhood
I won't need a castle, they've got castles in Versailles
And I'm still stranded, wondering why

[Chorus]
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold

[Verse 3]
Some boat's on the ocean, we're here in this room
Seems to me the perfect way to spend an afternoon
We can look for castles, pretty castles in the sky
No more wondering, wondering why

[Bridge]
Things can go wrong, things can go right
Things can go bump in the dead of the night
So let me be there, let me be there
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night

[Chorus]
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
Such a beautiful night for love
Such a wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Yeah, it's beautiful night
Yeah, it's beautiful night
Ah

[Outro]
Yeah, a beautiful night, beautiful night
Yeah, it's such a beautiful night, beautiful, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Lordie, lordie, lordie mama

With your silent smile
I won't talk to you for a couple of minutes
My little koala type bear

Looking out of eyes
Like the likes of yours
Do you find it so surprising

It was twenty years ago today
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought that you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Outro]
Oh yeah, all right
Are you going to be in my dreams tonight?
And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make

[Verse 1]
We came from nowhere
Hiding from a storm
We cling together
To keep each other warm
The road to somewhere
Stretches through the night
We follow blindly
Heading for the light

[Chorus]
I can't see anymore
The blinding light
It's just a metaphor
I use when things aren't going right

[Verse 2]
We held each other
Praying for a spark
Two crazy partners
Scrambling in the dark
Now where are we going
Searching in the night
We had a feeling
It's going to be alright

[Chorus]
I can't see anymore
The blinding light
It's just a metaphor
I use when things aren't going right

[Bridge]
Two crazy partners
Searching in the night
We've got a feeling
It's going to be alright
We follow blindly
Heading for the light
We've got a feeling
It's going to be, it's going to be alright

[Verse 3]
We came from nowhere
Hiding from a storm
We cling together
To keep each other warm
The road to somewhere
Stretches through the night
We follow blindly
Heading for the light
Heading for the light

[Verse 1]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

[Chorus]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

[Verse]
I'm scared to say i love you
Afraid to let you know
That the simplest of words won't come out of my mouth
Though i'm dying to let them go
Trying to let you know
I have to say i'm sorry
Don't feel sad for me
But the beautiful birds won't fly out of their cage
Though i'm trying to set them free
Trying to let you see, how much you mean to me
I remember the first time we met
Tears in our eyes reflecting
Something connecting from so long ago
It might have been told in the stars, maybe that's what is was
It doesn't matter because

[Outro]
I'm still too scared to tell you
Afraid to let you see see
That the simplest of words won't come out of my mouth
Though i'm dying to set them free
Trying to let you see, how much it means to me
How much you mean to me
How much you mean to me now

[Verse 1]
Welcome to our island
Glad you came to call
Now you've made yourself at home
You're welcome to us all
We are simple people, why are we this way
This is what we always say

[Chorus]
It's the way that we bong on the bongo
It's the way that be bang on the big base drum
It's the way we sing in the song book
Plays the tropic island hum
Hum, hum

[Verse 2]
Playing in the sunshine, lots of sea and sand
Its jolly nice in paradise
Lordie ain't life grand
Everyone was happy joining in the fun
Doing like we've always done
It's the way that we shake on the shakers
It's the way that we bang on the big base drum
It's the way that we bake in the cake off
Plays the tropic island hum

[Chorus]

Good, good, good... Feeling good
Tonights a special night Feeling good
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Anything can happen in the meantime
Won't you come and celebrate our tropic island hum

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I took a trip into the ocean
High emotion filled me with desire
I had to see what I was fighting
That kept inviting me to take it higher

[Chorus]
Well looking back it didn't hurt me
It did something for my soul
It taught me when you find a love
Don't break it, try to make it whole

[Verse 2]
I took a walk into the fire
When I heard you calling me
I took a chance and what a good thing
It turned out to be

[Bridge]
It turned out
It turned out
It turned out to be

[Verse 3]
Well now it's done and out of nowhere
I can go wherever pleases me
If you don't mind some stormy weather
We'll be together in our fantasy

[Chorus]
Looking back it didn't hurt me
It did something for my soul
It taught me when you find a love
Don't break it, try to make it whole

[Outro]
I took a walk into the fire
When I heard you calling me
I took a chance and what a good thing
It turned out to be
It turned out
It turned out
It turned out to be
It turned out
It turned out
It turned out to be

[Verse 1]
I get a feeling when they call my name
Feels like we're all involved in some kind of game
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, get me out of here

[Verse 2]
Hear the taxman knocking at my door
I've got a feeling he'll be asking for more
Oh boy, get me out of here
Oh boy, someone get me out of here
Yeah

[Verse 3]
When we fight I don't know what to say
If feels so bad and yet I can't run away
Oh boy, oh boy someone get me out of here
I'm a celebrity
Oh boy, someone get me out of here

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
I see the doctor coming down the street
I got no fever, but I'm feeling the heat
Oh boy, (oh boy)
Get me out of here (someone get me out of here)
Oh boy, (oh boy) someone get me out of here
Oh boy, (oh boy)
Get me out of here (someone get me out of here)
Oh boy, (oh boy) someone get me out of here

[Intro]
Want to get you in my heart again
Want to love you once more
Want to have you in my heart again
Want to get you once more

[Chorus]
If you want to love, if you wanna fight
It doesn't really matter, I want you tonight

[Verse 1]
When I get you home, what I wanna do
Babe, I want to sample everything with you
Yes, I want to love you, I don't wanna fight
I can think of something when I get you home tonight
All I want is loving, anything will do
I'm your glass of poison and I'm acting up on you

[Chorus]
If you want to love, if you want to fight
It doesn't really matter, I want you tonight
If you want to love, if you want to fight
It doesn't really matter, I want you tonight

[Post Chorus]
Yeah, you know what you got here
You got the same old story happening again
The eternal struggle, the destiny of man
It's the same old story, it's happening again
Life's eternal struggle, the destiny of man

[Chorus]
If you want to love, if you want to fight
It doesn't really matter, I want you tonight
All I want is love, anything will do
I'm your glass of poison and I'm acting up on you

[Bridge]
It's the same old song
Being sung in the background, being sung up front
But if you want to get it right, you got to listen
Heed my words, listen to me!

[Chorus 2]
Anytime you want me, I'm not hard to find
I can't get your loving, I can't get you off my mind
But if I need you sometime, you got me here right now
We can work it out together, we'll get through this somehow

[Outro]
It's the same old story, it's happening again
Life's eternal struggle, the destiny of man (x4)
It's the same old story, it's happening again
Life's eternal struggle

All of my life, too late
Till you showed up with perfect timing

Our fingers are stuck in the socket

[Verse 1]
It's midnight at a liquor store in Texas
Closing time another day is done
When a boy walked in the door and points a pistol
He can't find a job, but Lord, he's found a gun
He pulls it off with no trace of confrontation
Then he lets the old man run out in the street
Even though he knows they'll come with guns a blazing
Already he can feel a great relief

[Chorus]
Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

[Verse 2]
He pictures the arrival of the cruisers
Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
He knows that when they're shooting at this loser
They'll be aiming at the demons in their lives

[Chorus]
Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

[Verse 3]
The evening news carried all the details
He dies in every living room in town
In his own a bottle's thrown in anger
And his father cries, he'll never live this down

[Chorus]
Oh, how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars?

And fly like eagles out among the stars?

[Intro]
Do, do, do, do
Uh, one, two...

[Verse 1]
There is a fine line between recklessness and courage
It's about time you understood which road to take
It's a fine line, and your decision makes a difference
Get it wrong, you'll be making a big mistake

[Bridge 1]
Come home brother, all is forgiven
We all cried when you were driven away
Come home brother, everything is better
Everyth
