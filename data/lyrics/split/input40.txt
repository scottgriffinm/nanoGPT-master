And so I came to see him, and listen for a while
And there he was, this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly, with his song

One time ya'll

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly, with his song

I can't stop

Love, love will come find you
Just to remind you of who you are
Oh love, it will forsake you
Threaten to break you, take what you got

[Chorus]
Everybody laughs, everybody cries
Oh, it could hurt you, baby, but give it a little try
See, that's the thing about love

[Verse 2]
Friends, sometimes will blind you
Sneak up behind you, you can't give enough
Then life, it will embrace you, ha
Totally amaze you, so you don't give up

[Chorus]
Everybody laughs, everybody cries
Sure, it could hurt you, baby, but give it a little try
See, that's the thing about love

[Bridge]
Oh, tell me that I am not the only one that's going through it all
Oh, sometimes I feel like I'm the only one going through it all
But it's time, oh, it's time for me to shine, hey
So, it's 'bout time, oh, it's time for me to shine
It's my time, said, it's my time, for me to shine, oh oh oh
Oh, it's my time, it's 'bout time for me to shine

There's no other way
That I would want someone to hold me, show me like you
Falling in a daze
So many ways, I'm in amazement thinking about you
No one took the time
To hold my mind, and be the kind that I could talk to
This is the type of day
That I must say, I've been looking forward to

Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fear
So good that soon you'll be here
They just don't know how good it feels

Feels so good to not be searching
Knowing that I found that right one

Talking on the phone
When I'm alone, I'm in the zone
And tempted to touch you
Nothing ever fades
The way you take time for me
It makes me want you
Call it what you want
'Cause I'm so dumb
It may be wrong, but baby, I'm your fool
I can verify that you're my type
The things we try that others just won't do

Look at me shedding no tears
No worries followed by fears
So good that soon you'll be here
They just don't know how good it feels

She's filled with catastrophe
She lives in a world that's on fire
On fire, baby, on fire, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 2]
She looks like a girl, but she, yeah
She's really just a flame
You can try, but you'll never, you'll never forget her
On fire, on fire, baby, on fire, oh, oh yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm a girl and I'm on fire (Like a match to a flame)
Yeah, haha, yeah, you know I am
You know what you see
It's like a match to a flame
Werent't you the one who said that you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space and give the keys back to your door
And how I cry and try and try to make you stay with me
But still you said the love was gone and that I had to leave

Now you
Talking about a family
Now you
Saying I complete your dream
Now you
Saying I'm your everything
Your confusing me, what your saying to me
Don't play with me, don't play with me cause

What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
I remember when I was sitting home alone
Waiting for you
To 3 o'clock in the morn'

And when you came home you'd always had some sorry excuse
And explaining to me like I was some kind of a fool
I sacrifice the things I want just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me
You never come through

Now you
Wanna be a part of me
Now you
Have so much to say to me
Now you
Wanna make time for me
What you doing to me, your confusing me
Don't play with me, don't play with me cause

What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
I remember when I was sitting home alone
Waiting for you
To 3 o'clock in the morn'
Night after night knowing something's going on
What's that number for b go-a-go-a-gone

Lord knows it wasn't easy believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what your suppose to do
No need to punch me boo cause I won't play you cause

What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me

What goes around comes around (yeah)
What goes up most come down
Gotta stop trying to come back to me

What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
It's called Karma, baby
And it goes around

What goes around comes around
What goes up most come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
As the door over left behind to
Stand wide open for us to see
There is one thing in life I told you
I can see you but you can't see me, yeah

That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way it is

As my Father up in heaven above
Shining star that is full of love
And He is a big surprise that just open your hearts
And if that's one thing that I'm mighty proud of
You see now

There are sometimes when you make me happy
There are sometimes when you make me sad
But that's a part of life give it what you have
To all I ask is forget the bad
That's the way, that's the way it is
That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way, that's the way it is
That's the way it is

All your smiles and your all your lies won't
Oh, erase the pain inside, yeah
Hold your self and your serenity
'Cause I can see you this evening
And can't you see me, well?

That's the way, that's the way it is, yeah
That's the way, that's the way it is
That's the way, let me say that's the way it is
That's the way

And you must believe all the things I tell you
You won't believe all the words I say
Now one little thing in life I'm rest assured of
Heavenly father's gonna make a way in (Incomprehensible)

I will, yeah, I wanna clap my hands
Wanna clap my hands
Let me, let me clap my hands

Adrenaline rushin' in my body
All my power, I just can't fight it
No matter how I keep on tryin'

[Chorus]
Heartburn
Burnin' in my soul
Heartburn
Call the fire department
Heartburn

Heartburn

You got me trippin', slippin', gettin' beside myself
I tried some medication, but don't nothin' help
So I say, "Doctor, doctor, tell me, will I die?"
And he said, "Count to five, Alicia"
And I'm gonna be alright
Let's go, one, two, three, four!

[Pre-Chorus]
Adrenaline rushin' in my body
All my power, I just can't fight it

Heartburn
Burnin' in my soul

You're an alcoholic
You're an alcoholic red nose reindeer like Rudolph
I'm here to tear the roof off
And if you want to take it to the guns, I'ma shoot off
Your head before you reach for the pistol
And when the bartender turns around I'ma reach for the Cristal
You not ready for this style, I'm straight Psycho wit it
And I bet you in love with, yeah Psycho hit it
A long time ago, I'ma keep doing my thizzle
Till it's time to go, but for now it's time to blow
Good as me in the club popping bubbly
I can't complain life is lovely
Either you hate me or you love me
Fans wanna know when the Nuts is gonna come next
It doesn't matter competition is no contest
I don't mean to brag, I'm just being honest
Where my dogs at smoking up at the college?
Clap your hands to the beat and get your bounce on
Put your drinks up, if your blazing get you ounce on
Girl I'd house you, but this ain't no house song
And no kissing, I dunno what you had your mouth on
Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuff
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us
You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your, booty, booty I'm ready to fuck
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck
Look, don't approach me in a physical manner
'Cause the cannon I'm holding ain't a digital camera
And I don't care less about women and glamor
Or which one of you rappers is lifting his hammer
I'ma get loose like a pair of pajamas
I speak through those switches, spit like Obama
Trying to get rich without guns and the scanner
Thats A to the K with a fucking bandanna
Seize your empire, believe in no lies
Squeeze the deserties like Jesus inside her
Spit like the shit on my teeth is barbwire
Make your girl suck cock till her knees are on fire
That's it though, no more games
This one right here is gonna blow your brains
If you in the club you better hold your chain
Cause I'm bugging and I just might stomp your frame
Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuff
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us
You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck
Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuffs
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us
You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

[Verse 1]
Get so caught up everyday
Trying to keep it all together
While the time just slips away
See, I know nothing lasts forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There'd be no limit to my sorrow
So all I can say

[Chorus]
I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something
Before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour, let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something
Won't wait 'til it's too late

[Post-Chorus]
I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
I won't wait 'til it's too late

[Verse 2]
Just a simple conversation ('Sation)
Just a moment is all it takes (Yeah)
I wanna be there just to listen (I wanna be here)
And I don't wanna hesitate (Oh, no)

[Pre-Chorus]
Imagine there was no tomorrow (Imagine)
Imagine that I couldn't see your face (Your face)
There'd be no limit to my sorrow (Oh no)
'Cause there is nothing that can fill this space
I don't wanna put it off for too long (Too long)
I didn't say all that I had to say (Say)
I wanna take the time to right the wrongs
Before we get to that place (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
That it would all mean nothing if I don't say something
Before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour, let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something
Won't wait 'til it's too late

[Bridge]
Just lean on my shoulder
It's not over 'til it's over
Don't worry 'bout it
'Cause I'm gonna make sure
Our bond gets stronger, yeah
I don't wanna wait until the storm
There's something wrong
And now you're gone
And I can't find ya

[Chorus]
I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something
Before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour, let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something
Won't wait 'til it's too late
I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cause it would all mean nothing if I don't say something
Before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour, let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something
Won't wait 'til it's too late

[Post-Chorus]
I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
(I won't wait 'til it's too late)
I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
(No, won't wait, no no)
I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
(I won't wait 'til it's too late)
I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
(No, no, no, no, no)

[Outro]
No, no, no
I can't wait, I won't wait
No, no
I can't wait, I won't wait

[Jane Lynch]
If you are under 30 and you're totally cool, then you absolutely know these guys
The Lonely Island and Michael Bolton!

[Jimmy Fallon]
From their album Incredibad, please welcome The Lonely Island!

Incredibad, this is just a blockbuster
"Jizz In My Pants," "Lazy Sunday," Narnia

[Kristen Schaal]
And here they are with Akon!

And the Nobel Peace Prize goes to... The Lonely Island, oh fuck yes!
The Lonely Island, they're the truth!

[Bobby Moynihan]
I like 'em because they speak for the people!

There's no way I’ll let my kids listen to it
They’re Satanists and they should be boycotted!
Around the country today, citizens burning any and all Lonely Island paraphernalia...

[Vanessa Bayer]
Now here they are, the first men to become pregnant!

[Jason Sudeikis]
I hereby declare The Lonely Island, the 47th president of these United States!

Tragedy today as The Lonely Island was beaten to death with their own dicks outside an all-male strip club
I see thousands of people, lining up to desecrate the body
Here on the street, I've seen at least 300 already defiling the corpses
And there are thousands more waiting
It looks like there's some movement
Oh my God, The Lonely Island are alive!
They're removing the fans from their various holes and heading back into the studio
The Lonely Island will continue to entertain us
After an experience like this, God only knows what they will create

[Verse 1]
Another year has come and gone
But my love for you keeps on and on and on
You're perfect to me, mmm
No matter what others see
You're everything that's on my mind

[Verse 2]
If I could love you
One hundred years or more
You're everything that I love so, hey
My devotion to you
More than you can stand, mmm
And I, I, I believe in lovin' the whole woman

[Bridge]
Listen here
You know I love you
Oh, how I love you
You're all that's on my mind
Listen here
But oh, how I adore you
I'd go the last mile for you
You're ever changing times

[Verse 2]
You're perfect to me
More than my eyes can see, oh yeah
You know something you're the only thing that's on my mind
As long as I live
I'll have love to give
I don't want you to forget that now
I'll always be 'round, I'll always be around close around here, hey

[Outro]
You're perfect to me
I don't care what anybody else sees, oh no
You're the only thing, thing that's on my mind
Hey, hey, hey, ha
I love you, baby
I walk the floor at night
Holding my arms tight
But they don't feel better than you
I don't feel no better than you
I love you, baby girl
I don't like to fuss and fight, hey
All I got to say, all I got to say, all I got to say
I love you, baby, yeah
When you're down an' troubled
You need some love an' care
An' nothin', nothin' is goin' right

Close your eyes an' think of me
An' soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
An' you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin'
I wanna see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I will
You know I'll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend, you've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark an' full of clouds
An' that ol' North Wind
That ol' North Wind begins to blow
You just keep your head together
An' call my name out loud, yes
An' soon, very soon you'll hear me
Knockin' on your door, yeah, I will

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin' to see you again

Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've gotta do is call
An' I'll be there, yes, I will
You know I'll be there, yes, I will

Ain't it good to know you've got a friend?
'Coz people can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
Hell, they'll take your soul if you let them
No, don't you let them, no

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin' to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call me
And I'll be there, yes, I will, yes, I will
You know I'll be there, yes, I will
You know I'll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend, you've got a friend
You've got a friend, you've got a friend

[Intro]
Are you lonely for me, baby?
Are you lonely for me, baby?

[Verse 1]
Oh, it's our last train, baby, to Jacksonville
I'm gonna get on it, baby, you know I will
Will you try? Go ahead and try
To forget all the pain I brought you
Go on and try, go ahead and try, baby
I know I'm the one who taught you

Yeah, but I'm lonely, baby
And I'm lonely and blue
Good God, I'm lonely, baby
And I'm lonely for you, all alone
Yeah, I'm lonely
Let me, let me say that I'm lonely, baby
Lord have mercy right now

[Verse 2]
It's our last bus to Jacksonville
My sweet baby, are you still?
Tell your friend, it's the end
I will never, never again desert you
He will laugh
I can hear him laughing, baby
And you'd said that I was wrong to hurt you
Oh, but I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry about that, baby
I'm lonely, baby
And I'm lonely for you

[Chorus]
(I'm lonely)
Are you lonely for me, baby?
(Got to let you know I'm lonely, baby)
Are you lonely for me, baby?
(Let me, let me say that I'm lonely)
Are you lonely for me, baby?
(Oh my my, let me say that I'm lonely)
Are you lonely for me, baby?
(Hey, have you ever spent a lonely night?)
Are you lonely for me, baby?
(Sweet baby, I'm lonely)
Are you lonely for me, baby?

[Verse 3]
It's a long ride to Jacksonville
Nobody will ever know the way I feel
Will you be there, will you be there, baby?
When I step down from the train
Will you be there, baby?
You just you got to be there, baby
When it's somebody call my name

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'm lonely, baby
I'm lonely and blue
I'm lonely, baby
And I'm lonely for you
Let me, let me tell you that I'm lonely, baby
And I walked the floor all night long

[Outro]
Are you lonely for me baby?
(Got to tell you I'm lonely)
Are you lonely for me baby?
(Have you ever spent a lonely night?)
Are you lonely for me baby?
(Hey, I'm lonely right now)
Are you lonely for me baby?
(I'm lonely, let me say that I'm lonely, lonely, lonely)
Are you lonely for me baby?

[Verse 1: "Weird Al" Yankovic]
Hey there, let's have some fun
Join my good time gang
Just one question first
Rhubarb or meringue? Ha!
We'll make folks happy through the land
Have them howling on their knees
So my little, orange friend
Lend a hand if you please, pow!

[Chorus 1: "Weird Al" Yankovic]
Hey, don't look so shocked
Ain't it about the time
To let the pun fit the crime, ha!

[Verse 2: Jack McBrayer & "Weird Al" Yankovic]
Screwball, you try too hard
"Dr. Screwball" if you please, I've got an online Ph.D!
Folks should be free to find their own happiness
You can’t force them to have fun
Sure I can, watch this!

[Bridge 1: "Weird Al" Yankovic & Jack McBrayer]
Accordion!

[Accordion solo]
Banjo retort!

[Banjo solo]

[Chorus 2: "Weird Al" Yankovic & Jack McBrayer]
Hey, you're pretty good!
But I think that we both know
It's time to let my Sylvia go
Never!

[Bridge 2: "Weird Al" Yankovic]

[Banjo and accordion solo]

[Banjo stops, accordion plays]
String break! Here's a joke:
How are you, just like a lollipop stick?
In the end, you're both worn down by the force of my licks!
*laughs*

[Outro: "Weird Al" Yankovic]
Ain't it a laugh? *laughs*
Looks like the end of the line
So let… the pun… fit… the…
Crime

[Verse 1]
I starred in every high school play
Blew every drama teacher away
I graduated first in my class at Juilliard
Took every acting workshop I could
And I dreamed of Hollywood
While I read my Uta Hagen and studied the Bard

[Verse 2]
Hit the boards and paid my dues
And got phenomenal rave reviews
I knew the world was gonna love me, without a doubt
I was sure that Tarantino would be callin' me on the phone
Annie Leibovitz would shoot me for Rolling Stone
But the years have come and gone
And I'm sorry to say that's not the way that it's all worked out

[Chorus]
I'm a tour guide on the Jungle Cruise ride
Skipper Dan is the name
And I'm doin' 34 shows every day
And every time it's the same
Look at those hippos, they're wigglin' their ears
Just like they've done for the last 50 years
Now I'm laughin' at my own jokes but I'm cryin' inside
Cause I'm workin' on the Jungle Cruise ride

[Verse 3]
Oh, the critics, they used to say
I was the new Olivier
Thought I'd be the toast of Sundance or maybe Cannes
Aw, but don't bother tryin' to IMDB me
The only place you might possibly see me
Is ridin' my little boat around Adventureland
It ain't exactly what I planned

[Chorus]
But I'm a tour guide on the Jungle Cruise ride
Skipper Dan is the name
And I'm doin 34 shows every day
And every time it's the same
I would've killed if I'd been in Speed-The-Plow
But what's the difference, that's all behind me now
Cause I'm payin' the rent and I'm swallowin' my pride
And I'm workin' on the Jungle Cruise ride

[Bridge]
I should be there on Broadway
Knockin' 'em dead in Twelve Angry Men
But instead I'm here tellin' these lame jokes
Again and again and again and again
And again and again and again

[Skit]
Bengal Tigers can jump over 20 feet!
That's an African bull elephant...
And there it is, the backside of water!
What have I done with my life?!

[Pre-Chorus]
I shoulda listened when my grandfather said
"Why don't you major in business instead?"
Now my hopes have all vanished and my dreams have all died
And I'll probably work forever

[Chorus]
As a tour guide on the Jungle Cruise ride
Skipper Dan is the name
And I'm doin' 34 shows every day
And every time it's the same
Look at those hippos, they're wigglin' their ears
Somebody shoot me 'cause I'm bored to tears
Always said I'd be famous... I guess that I lied
Cause I'm workin' on the Jungle Cruise ride
I'm still workin' on the Jungle Cruise ride
Carbon monoxide making me choke
No AC and the radio's broke
Cars backed up far as you can see
Seems like I've been waiting here for all eternity

Oh, and just in case you're wondering
I'll tell you where I am
I'm right here (right here) right here (right here)
Stuck right here in the middle of this

Traffic jam, I haven't moved one inch from this here spot
Traffic jam, the freeway's one big parking lot
Traffic jam, my radiator's boiling hot
And I'm stuck right here in the middle (right here in the middle)
Right here in the middle of a traffic jam

Trapped inside my automobile
Cobwebs growin' on the steerin' wheel
Now, I'm no genius but one thing I know
I shouldn't have had that bag of bran muffins an hour and a half ago
Yeah, and if you need to find me
I'll tell you where I am
I'm right here (right here) right here (right here)
Stuck smack dab in the middle of this...

Traffic jam, I haven't moved one inch from this here spot
Traffic jam, the freeway's one big parking lot
Traffic jam, well, I thought we were movin' but I guess we're not
'Cause I'm stuck right here in the middle (right here in the middle)
Right here in the middle of a traffic jam

Stuck in the middle of a traffic jam
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Bumper to bumper to bumper to bumper to
Bumper to bumper to bumper to bumper to
Bumper to bumper to bumper to bumper...
Yay-hey!

There's a yuppie on a cellular phone
I'm gonna puke if I hear anymore
There's a motorcycle zoomin' by me
Watch what happens when I open my door

Now we're all goin' nowhere fast
Well, I guess that's perfectly clear
I left home five hours ago
And I can still see my house from here
So if anybody's tryin' to find me
Well, I'll tell you where I am
Right here (right here) right here (right here)
Stuck right here in the middle of this...

Traffic jam, I haven't moved one inch from this here spot
Traffic jam, the freeway's one big parking lot
Traffic jam, now my back teeth are floatin' and my nerves are shot
And I'm stuck right here in the middle (right here in the middle)
Stuck right here in the middle of a traffic jam
Traffic Jam... Traffic jam... Traffic jam... Woo!

[Intro]
Wishing you were here
Oh yeah yeah

[Hook: Storm]
Wishing you were here, at this time of year
'Cause it don't mean a thing if it ain't with the one you love
See it so clear

[Verse 1: Prohgress]
Now Anny was a girl I knew back in the day
Thought she gave me eyes but she was looking at Jay (what up)
She had it 'cause of Becky and we spoke on the phone
Surprise visit to our house and Kev answer the do'
Carrel was a barrel, the laughs, we had fun
Till she pulled out her wallet in a stack full of wants
Debby always ready, Elly (get the girl)
But when they met each other they ain't need me no mo'
Francy, Francy, she wasn't from Cali
We had a little thing and now she's back in Miami (M.I.A.)
Life's full of all these peaks and valleys
Thank God I still got my family

[Hook: Storm]
Wishing you were here, at this time of year
'Cause it don't mean a thing if it ain't with the one you love
See it so clear

[Verse 2: J-Splif]
When I'm alone in my room, sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life I see I need love
There I was
Thinking bout the days befo'
Are you ever coming back or should I give up on hope
I know it's hard to cope, but the girl was a ho
She left me in the cold, never can't get a dove
What the hell was I thinking what a waste of my time
So I'm tearing down your stocking hanging right next to mine
Never make the same mistake when you're fishing the lake
I'm sailing in my boat, all alone for the holidays

[Interlude: Kev Nish]
I wanna be, wanna be in love but I don't believe you
No one's home for the holidays so it's nice to see you
Say this, say
I wanna be, wanna be in love but I don't believe you
No one's home for the holidays so it's nice to see you

[Hook: Storm]
Wishing you were here, at this time of year
'Cause it don't mean a thing if it ain't with the one you love
See it so clear

[Verse 3: Kev Nish]
Thanksgiving dinner for one delivery
Blockbuster night, no tree on Christmas eve
Labor day to Halloween looking for treats
But, no Eastern Bunny, just some rotting ass teeth
Broke, not poor, but broke like ambition
Heart can't start, so broke like transmition
Rasberry jelly feeling missin' (listen)
Ladies in my life never stay in the picture
Focus, wishing on a star moving east

[?]
Love's code red, valentines whine
One sip on the lips leaves a lonely man blind so

[Hook: Storm]
Wishing you were here, at this time of year
'Cause it don't mean a thing if it ain't with the one you love
See it so clear

[Verse 1]
My life, it used to be incomplete
Till I saw what I was looking for at a drive-in swap meet
My life, it won't be the same again
Now I'm proud to say the King lives on inside my den

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's all I live for, it's all I need

[Chorus]
My velvet Elvis, my velvet Elvis
My velvet Elvis means the world to me, yo, yo, yo

[Verse 2]
Although he may not be worth much dough
He means much more to me than some old Rembrandt or Van Gogh
Check out those sideburns, there's nothing greater
You can tell that he's no velvet Elvis imitator

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's all I live for, it's all I need

[Chorus]
My velvet Elvis, my velvet Elvis
My velvet Elvis, oh, now can't you see?
My velvet Elvis, my velvet Elvis
My velvet Elvis means the world to me, whoa

[Bridge]
In my own private Graceland
In my own little shrine to the King
I don't want nothin' else
No, I don't need anything
Don't need no lava lamp
Don't need no soap on a rope
No pictures of Mexican kids with those really big eyes
Or dogs playing poker, oh

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
When I'm at home, watching my TV
I know the king is always looking down on me
He looks so handsome, he stands so tall
So glad he's big enough to cover up that hole in the wall

[Outro]
(Velvet Elvis)
He's so fuzzy
(Velvet Elvis)
He's so great
(Velvet Elvis)
Never ages
(Velvet Elvis)
Never puts on weight
(Velvet Elvis)
Look at those rhinestones
(Velvet Elvis)
He's just so fine
(Velvet Elvis)
You can look but don't touch now
(Velvet Elvis)
'Cause he's mine, all mine, oh
Konvict

(chorous)
I love the way she moves, I see the way she is comin
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waitin for me (x4)
You take sugar and spice
Everything nice
And you got a little girl
You take snakes and snails
Some puppy dog tails
And you got a little boy

That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of

Snakes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice and everything nice
Yeah yeah all right
Something else to do

You take a walk by the sea
Two hearts on a tree
And you got a little gladness
Blue eyes cry
Two hearts say goodbye
And you got a little sadness
That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of

Hearts say goodbye
Eyes start to cry
Heart on a tree
Walk by the sea
Snakes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice everything nice
Yeah yeah all right

One more thing
You take a cruel word spoken
Pride gets broken
And you got a little break-up
You take a little bit of soul
Sweet words being told
And you got a little make-up

That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of

Words being told
With a little bit of soul
Pride gets broken
Cruel words spoken
Hearts say goodbye
Eyes start to cry
Walk by the sea
Snkaes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice everything nice
Yeah yeah all right
Is this the real life
Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Cause I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me
To me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a mam
Scaramouch, scaramouch, will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning - very, very frightening me
Galileo, galileo
Galileo, galileo
Galileo figaro - magnifico... hey! hey! hey!
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! no, we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! we will not let you go - let him go
Will not let you go - let him go
Will not let you go - let him go
No, no, no, no, no no no no no!
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me
For me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby - can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me anyway the wind blows - hey!
Listening to the muzak, hearin' people scream
Sittin' in the waiting room readin' crappy magazines
With a toothache
This is it pal, root canal
My molars are impacted, I'm gettin' gum disease
I'm gonna need some fillings, got twelve cavities
Can you help me?
Have mercy, doctor please

My teeth are a fright
Got a huge overbite
Numb me, drill me
Floss me, bill me

You jab at my nerve endings, it's driving me insane
Just give me nitrous oxide, shoot me up with Novocaine
Help me out here, 'cause I'm in severe
Pain

Please stop for a bit
Now let me rinse and spit
Numb me, drill me
Floss me, bill me
You validate my parking, I think that I'm okay
But you make one more appointment for a week from Saturday
'Cause you came upon
A little problem on my x-ray
Oy vey

It's getting absurd
Well, I hope I'm insured now
Numb me, drill me
Floss me, bill me

[Chorus:]
I'm so high
So high
Sexual high
A sexual high
Know she got me when you see that redness in my eye
Cause i'm so high
So high
She's my chocolate thai
Her body so fire
The way she got me dizzy
Floating high up in the sky

[Verse 1:]
Shawty got her back and her body got curves
When she bring it back it's like somebody hit a nerve
Just like that, I love it when you flirt
Take it to the back and hang a Do Not Disturb
Sign on the door cause your boyfriend's a her
Saw me leaving with you and he didn't say a word
Something so beautiful he does not deserve
If I was you baby i'd kick him to the curve

[Bridge:]
You're getting money thrown at you like George Bush
You're getting money thrown at you like George Bush
We tossing from a distance
Lil' mama heads up
The way your body moves got me so fucked up

[Chorus:]
I'm so high
So high
Sexual high
Sexual high
Know she got me when you see that redness in my eye
Cause i'm so high
So high
She's my chocolate thai
Her body so fire
The way she got me dizzy
Floating high up in the sky

[Verse 2:]
Shawty bonified and she'll never back down
She's the type of shawty that you always want around
Attracted to them real niggas and she know the sound
Of copters and them choppers when that drama come around
She's nothing like your average so called friend
Never miss a visit when you're locked in the pen
Her booty so phat and it's matching with her skin
She sitting on my lap, i'm watching...

[Bridge:]
You're getting money thrown at you like George Bush
You're getting money thrown at you like George Bush
We tossing from a distance
Lil' mama heads up
The way your body moves got me so fucked up

[Chorus:]
I'm so high
So high
Sexual high
Sexual high
Know she got me when you see that redness in my eye
Cause i'm so high
So high
She's my chocolate thai
Her body so fire
The way she got me dizzy
Floating high up in the sky

[Verse 3:]
Now ain't I ain't I chilled
Now ain't I ain't I real
Niggas that squeal... all can't feel
All I got is thorough convicts that surround me
If you don't fit the description, get from around me
Enough of these clowns, let me look at something sexy
You can get it, tell me where you want your baby
Kitchen table top, roof or the basement
Got all this money so you'll end up with a rich kid

[Bridge:]
You're getting money thrown at you like George Bush
You're getting money thrown at you like George Bush
We tossing from a distance
Lil' mama heads up
The way your body moves got me so fucked up

[Chorus:]
I'm so high
So high
Sexual high
Sexual high
Know she got me when you see that redness in my eye
Cause i'm so high
So high
She's my chocolate thai
Her body so fire
The way she got me dizzy
Floating high up in the sky
You tell a joke and forget the punchline
Why you always wastin' my time?
Hey baby, trust me, you just disgust me
Your hair's a mess and your make-up's crusty
I don't know too many females
Who make a habit of biting their toenails
Wo, every time you call, you drive me up the wall
Honey, just the sight of you makes my flesh crawl
I'm sure we'd be happy together
If only one little thing weren't true

Oh baby, I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you

You drink the milk right from the carton
What are you, in kindergarten?
You're belchin' everywhere, foulin' up the air
Then you use my razor to shave your back hair
You don't have an ounce of class
You're just one big pain in the neck
How much more can I take now
Give me a break now
You even snore when you're wide awake now
You tell all your friends we're the perfect couple
Well, maybe you should get a clue
'Cause baby, I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you
Baby, you're so nauseatin'
I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you

And when you softly call my name
It's like I'm listenin' to a squeaky chalk sound
And when you look at me that special way
It's hard for me to keep my lunch down
And when you ask me what I'm thinkin', honey
Usually I'm thinkin'
How I'd really like to tie your head completely up in duct tape
So I wouldn't have to listen to you
Asking me those stupid questions
Over and over again

Well, that disgusting noise you make when you laugh
Gives me a throbbing migraine
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you)
Until you came along, I never dated anyone this low on the food chain
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you)
You've got inhuman body odor
You've got the hair of a boxing promoter
Yeah, your teeth are all yellow
Your butt's made of Jell-O
You wake up in a puddle
Droolin' on your pillow
I hate the way you crack your knuckles
I hate your whiny loser girlfriends too
But mostly I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you
Really now, you're aggravating'
I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you
Not to mention irratating
I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you
Well, now won't you give my best regards to Satan
I yi yi yi yi
I'm so sick of you
I'm so sick of you
I'm so sick of you
I'm so sick of you
You make me sick
I'm so sick of you, now....

[Verse 1]
How come you're always such a fussy young man
Don't want no Cap'n Crunch, don't want no Raisin Bran
Well don't you know that other kids are starvin' in Japan
So eat it, just eat it
Don't want to argue, I don't want to debate
Don't want to hear about what kinds of foods you hate
You won't get no dessert 'till you clean off your plate
So eat it, don't you tell me you're full

[Chorus 1]
Just eat it, eat it
Get yourself an egg and beat it
Have some more chicken
Have some more pie
It doesn't matter
If it's boiled or fried
Just eat it, just eat it
Just eat it, just eat it, Woo!

[Verse 2]
Your table manners are a crying shame
You're playing with your food, this ain't some kind of game
Now, if you starve to death you'll just have yourself to blame
So eat it, just eat it
You better listen, better do as you're told
You haven't even touched your tuna casserole
You better chow down, or it's gonna get cold
So eat it, I don't care if you're full

[Chorus 2]
Just eat it, eat it
Open up your mouth and feed it
Have some more yogurt
Have some more Spam
It doesn't matter if it's fresh or canned
Just eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!
Don't you make me repeat it!
Have a banana, have a whole bunch
It doesn't matter what you had for lunch
Just eat it! Eat it!
Eat it! Eat it!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3]
Eat it! Eat it!
If it's getting cold, reheat it
Have a big dinner
Have a light snack
If you don't like it, you can't send it back
Just eat it! Eat it!
Get yourself an egg and beat it!
Have some more chicken. Have some more pie
It doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried
Just eat it! Eat it!
Don't you make me repeat it!

[Verse 1}
Sometimes I really want to be alone
But that's one state I'm never in
Because I know that I've got millions upon millions
Of tiny, one-celled organisms living on my skin

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Germs) I rub and scrub until my flesh is raw and bleeding
(Germs) But they just come right back again
(Germs) I can't even see'em
But I know they're up to something
Hey, don't touch that - you don't know where it's been!

[Chorus]
They're all over me
They're inside of me
Can't get'em offa me
I'm covered with... (microscopic bacteria)
What do they want from me?
What'll they do to me?
There's no escape for me
I'm crawling with... (microscopic bacteria)

[Verse 2]
Now if I ever dare to go to sleep
That's when they start their sneak attack
In the morning I wake up in utter horror
To find my teeth are covered with bacterial plaque

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Germs) Can't get those parasitic creatures off my face
(Germs) And there's more comin' every day
(Germs) I never said that they could camp out on my body
I wish they'd pack their tiny little bags and move away

[Chorus]
They're all over me
They're inside of me
Can't get'em offa me
I'm covered with... (microscopic bacteria)
What do they want from me
What'll they do to me?
There's no escape for me
I'm crawling with... (microscopic bacteria)

[Bridge]
They're creepin' around my shorts
They're under the bathroom sink
They're ridin' inside my car
They're swimmin' in every drink
They're hidin' between my toes
They're lurkin' in every kiss
I got'em way up my nose
In every orifice
I'm gonna show them who's boss
I'm gonna get even yet
Just gimme some Lysol spray
Just hand me a moist towelette
Don't tell me I'm paranoid
I know that they're after me
Look under the microscope
See...
{Chorus]
They're all over me
They're inside of me
Can't get'em offa me
I'm covered with... (microscopic bacteria)
What do they want from me
What'll they do to me?
There's no escape for me
I'm crawling with... (microscopic bacteria)

[Outro]
(Germs) They're all over me
(Germs) I can feel'em all over me
(Germs) Over every part of me
(Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) I know they're watching me
(Germs) They're always watching me
(Germs) They're coming after me
(Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) Won't somebody help (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) Please sombody help me (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) You've got to believe me (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) They're out to get me (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) They wanna control me (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) They wanna destroy me (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) They're tryin' to kill me (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) It kind of upsets me (Microscopic bacteria)
Uhh...

When I said I'd be faithful
When I promised I'd be true
When I swore that I could never
Be with anyone but you
When I told you that I loved you
With those tender words I spoke
I was only kidding
Now, can't you take a joke?

When I said that I need you, baby
When I told you I really care
When I said that I can't live without you
When I said I'd follow you anywhere
When I said you could always trust me
When I said I'd never leave you flat
Well, guess what? I was only kidding, baby
I can't believe you fell for that! You're so gullible...

(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) Now I'm sorry if you misunderstood, but the fact remains
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
Well I guess I got you pretty good, now listen
When I said that I love you baby
From the very bottom of my heart
When I said that I miss you so badly
Every second that we're apart
When I swore that you're just getting more and more
Beautiful every day
Well, I was only kidding, honey
What's that matter with you anyway?
Let me tell you something

(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) I guess it probably hurts you a bit, but you gotta know
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
I really love you; not!

When I said you oughta marry me
When I said that we should settle down
Well, I was pullin' your leg there, honey
I was just foolin' around
You see, I-I never meant to upset you, darlin'
I never meant to hurt anyone
I was only kidding, baby
Why don't you just put down that gun?
Let's talk this over
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) Watch where you're pointing that thing!
(I was only kidding) Hey, I'm sorry if your heart is broke, you gotta realize
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) Aww yeah
(I was only kidding)
Now, honey, can't you take a joke?
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding
(I was only kidding) I didn't lie to you
I was only kidding... Yes indeed
(I was only kidding) Baby, baby, you know
(I was only kidding) Hey
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there
(I'll be there)
And oh, I'll be there to comfort you

I'll be there, I'll be there, just call my name, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh
I'll be there, I'll be there, whenever you need me, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there, just call my name, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
I'll be there, I'll be there
Do it do it, he can do it, watch him do it

I got rhythm and a whole lot of soul
I can dance I can shake it baby (He can dance)
I'm just a little country boy
Harmonica in my hand I got soulful rhythm in me
I'm a get down dancin man
Shalalala boom boom
My name is Dapper Dan
Shalalala boom boom
I'm a dancin' man yeah
I'm gonna be king of the Disco tech
That's where I can be found
Master of the rhythm beat ohh
I've got the fastest feet around
Shalalala boom boom
My name is Dapper Dan
Shalalala boom boom
I'm a dancin man yeah
Do it do it Let's do it do it
Get up on the floor
Let's do it do it Dance what you wanta
Let's dance dance with me
I like the way you shake it
I like the way you shake it
I like the way you move it
Oo you sexy
You don't take your showers
You don't use Ban Roll On
Please don't come near me anymore
I'll throw up on the floor because you make me ill

I remember when

You used to smell half-decent
That hasn't been too recent
Now you're repulsing all the people you know
You perspire freely, your dandruff's like snow
And you're drawing flies everywhere that you go

'Cuz you don't take your showers anymore

I had to buy some Airwick
You even made my dog sick
You can't come over anymore 'cuz your hygiene is poor
And besides, you're a slob

You create a nuisance
When you're out in public
When you walk up to people in your smelly old clothes
And they just run from you, holding their nose
And you claim that you're lonely
But that's how it goes
'Cuz you don't take your showers anymore

And you claim that you're lonely
But that's how it goes

'Cuz you don't change your undies
And you don't use Ban Roll On
And you don't take your showers anymore
What's the matter with the songs he's singin'
Can't you tell that they're pretty lame
After listenin' to a couple albums
Well, they all start to sound the same

So he tried to change his musical style
He tossed all his ballads in the circular file
Then he found the punk sound
Breakin' ground all around
It's still Billy Joel to me

What's the matter with the tune he's writin'
Well, you know it's gonna be a smash
It's so nice when you're a big name artist
Doesn't matter if it sounds like trash

Now everybody thinks the new wave is super
Just ask Linda Ronstadt or even Alice Cooper
It's a big hit, isn't it
Even if it's a piece of junk
It's still Billy Joel to me
Woah, it doesn't matter what the critics say about him
'Cause he doesn't worry how they feel
When you're record's sellin' millions and its goin' triple platinum
You don't worry 'bout your next meal
'Cause money is no big deal

Maybe he should dye his hair bright pink
And stick a safety pin through his cheeks
Then he'd really fit the new wave image
But he couldn't sit down for weeks

Don't you know about the record business, honey
You gotta be trendy if you wanna make some money
Now everybody's sayin' that he sure sounds funny
But it's still Billy Joel to me

All right, Alfred
Oh

I can hardly wait 'til his next album
Well, I'll bet it's gonna be the rage
Buy a ticket to his next big concert
Well, I wonder what he'll do on stage

It might be disco and it might be the blues
Or maybe even somethin' like the B-52's
Just a handclap, finger snap
Even if it's mindless pap
It's still Billy Joel to me
Everybody's sayin' that he sure sounds funny
But it's still Billy Joel to me
Charles Nelson Reilly was a mighty man
The kind of man you'd never disrespect
He stood eight feet tall, wore glasses
And had a third nipple on the back of his neck
He ate his own weight in coal, excreted diamonds everyday
He could throw you down a flight of stairs
But you still would love him anyway
Yeah, you know you'd love him anyway

Charles Nelson Reilly won the Tour de France
With two flat tires and a missing chain
He trained a rattlesnake to do his laundry
I'm telling you the man was insane
He could rip out your beating heart
And show it to you before you died
Everyday he'd make the host of Match Game
Give him a piggyback ride
Yeah, two hour piggyback ride, giddy up Gene

Ninja warrior, master of disguise
He could melt your brain with his laser-beam eyes, Oh yeah
Oh yeah
He had his own line at the DMV
He made sweet, sweet love to a manatee
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, that was something to see, I tell ya
Charles Nelson Reilly sold his toenail clippings
As a potent aphrodisiac
He ran a four minute mile blindfolded
With an engine block strapped to his back
He could eat more frozen waffles
Then any other man I know
Once he fell off the Chrysler building
And he barely even stubbed his toe
Had a tiny little scratch on his toe
Didn't even hurt

Charles Nelson Reilly figured out cold fusion
But he never ever told a soul
I've seen the man unhinge his jaw
And swallow a Volkswagen whole
He'd bash your face in with a shovel
If you didn't treat him like a star
You could spit at the wind, or tug at Superman's cape
But Lord knows you don't mess around with CNR
No, no, no
Talkin' about CNR
Met this fine young thing at the local Circle K
She made a date for a half past eight and I said, "What the hey?"
So I journeyed to her crib and I let myself inside
That chick was slouched down on the couch, I think her brain was fried
Couldn't figure it out, she wouldn't even look at me
Then I saw her eyes, she was hypnotized, cold glued to her TV
"Hey, what's your problem, baby doll, let's have a little fling"
She said, "Hey, you fool, now just be cool
I'm watchin' that Gilligan's Isle thing"

Isle thing
Isle thing

Watchin' all night, musta been a marathon
I was bummin', those shows kept comin', here's what was goin' on
These castaways were stranded on this island out at sea
One of 'em called Gilligan, said, "Let's name it after me"
He'd mess up every rescue, man, that first mate was illin'
If I was one of those castaways, I think I'd probably kill him
Just about that time, telephone began to ring
She said, "Just let it, my machine'll get it
We're watchin' the Gilligan's Isle thing"
Isle thing
She loves that Gilligan's Isle thing
Isle thing
Please, baby, baby, please

I like the professor, he always saved their butts
He could build a nuclear reactor from a couple of coconuts
She said, "That guy's a genius," I shook my head and laughed
I said, "If he's so fly, then tell me why he couldn't build a lousy raft?"
And while we're on the subject, I'll tell you one thing for sure
Those homeboys brought an awful lot for just a three hour tour
Then her mom came in the room, it was kind of embarrassing
She said, "Hey, you two, I was once like you
And I loved that Gilligan's Isle thing"

Isle thing
She'd watch that Gilligan's Isle thing
Please, baby, baby, please

Skipper's in a hammock, he's looking kinda fat
He'd throw a fit and then he'd hit old Gilligan with his hat
Mrs. Howell got it goin' on, but Mr. Howell was meaner
Ginger and Mary Anne could've used some funky, cold medina
I was really diggin' this show, I didn't know what to do
It kinda looked like I was hooked, now I'm an addict too
I know each episode by heart, now I'm the rerun king
And on every date we both stay up late
And we watch the Gilligan's Isle thing
Isle thing
Hasta la vista, little buddy
Gilligan's Isle thing
Met this pretty young stewardess on a non-stop flight
She showed me to my seat and it was love at first sight
Now lately I've been flying to all kinds of places
That I never really wanted to go
Cause I'll do anything just to spend a little time
With the cutest flight attendant I know

You set my ever-lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy
Tell me I'm your favorite frequent flier, Airline Amy
Found a little piece of heaven on a 747
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy

Every one of our dates is at thirty thousand feet
She always points out the exits to me, she's so sweet
You know she gets me my headphones for free
Refills my coffee cup whenever I ask
And you gotta admit my baby looks pretty hot
When she's wearin' that oxygen mask

You set my ever-lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy
Tell me I'm your favorite frequent flier, Airline Amy
Found a little piece of heaven on a 747
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy
Amy, darlin', don't you know, you really drive me nuts
Every time you're handing out those honey roasted peanuts
Airline Amy, this is my new mission
Gotta get you in an upright locked position

You set my ever-lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy
Tell me I'm your favorite frequent flier, Airline Amy
Found a little piece of heaven on a 747
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy

You set my ever-lovin' heart on fire, Airline Amy
You're the only woman I desire, Airline Amy
Found a little piece of heaven on a 747
And no one else can take me higher
No one else can take me higher
And no one else can take me higher than Airline Amy

I got a fetish for these kicks
Fe-fetish for these jeans
A fetish for my hoodie, gotta have it I'm a fiend
Fe-fetish for these kicks
A fetish for these jeans
Fetish for my hoodie, fe-fe-fetish fetish fetish

[Verse 1: Prohgress]
Sweater on tight as the nights get colder
City zipped up and the hood on my shoulders
Haters looking green like a three-leaf clover
I've got a pair of everything I know of
I've got gear that's free like bail watch me rock it
Double day sales
Every day new jeans and a new shirt
From next year, it's like I'm back from the future
A fly outfit, on my hoverboard
Take that off and put this logo on your chest
Rep the west, Downtown to Sunset
Melrose to Fairfax, damn I'm fresh!

[Hook: Kev Nish]
I got a fetish for these kicks
Fe-fetish for these jeans
A fetish for my hoodie, gotta have it I'm a fiend
Fe-fetish for these kicks

Fetish for my hoodie, fe-fe-fetish fetish fetish
Got-got-got-got-got a fetish
Got-got-got-got-got a fetish I'm a fiend
Got-got-got-got-got-got a fetish, fetish
Got-got-got-got-got a fetish

[Verse 2: J-Splif]
For this pair on my feet, pro wings with velcro
Then L.A. Gear's Greatest Night's in shell toes
Thought they were the dopest until I saw the Jordans
Had to cop some but they cost me a fortune
I was just a kid, the freshest on the block
After school shootin' hoops pumping on my Reeboks
Kept my shoes always new, coming straight out the box
Every day different colors on my Nike high-tops
Air Force's, Airmaxes, even had a pair of Vans
K-Swisses, Chuck Taylors, can't forget the Timberlands
Bathing Ape's with the matching hoodie from Japan
But no matter what I'm wearing people staring like, "Damn! "

[Hook: Kev Nish]
I got a fetish for these kicks
Fe-fetish for these jeans
A fetish for my hoodie, gotta have it I'm a fiend
Fe-fetish for these kicks
A fetish for these jeans
Fetish for my hoodie, fe-fe-fetish fetish fetish
Got-got-got-got-got a fetish, fetish
Got-got-got-got-got a fetish I'm a fiend
Got-got-got-got-got-got a fetish, fetish
Got-got-got-got-got a fetish

[Verse 3: Kev Nish]
Fit from a brand New Era
Got the home town on the crown that I'm wearing
Looking for a love from L.A. to Paris
If you got style let me see what you sharing
If you got a tank top sweats and some kicks
Gimme that girl if my t-shirt fits
Mini-skirt works if you got nice hips
If you don't need a bra then you got nice tits
You're lookin'right when you rock a corset in a thong
Even better when you're dropping it with nothing at all
Take your sweater off in the Summer, Spring and Fall
'Cause skin's back in and it ain't the mall

[Hook: Kev Nish]
I got a fetish for these kicks
Fe-fetish for these jeans
A fetish for my hoodie, gotta have it I'm a fiend
Fe-fetish for these kicks
A fetish for these jeans
Fetish for my hoodie, fe-fe-fetish fetish fetish
Got-got-got-got-got a fetish
Got-got-got-got-got a fetish I'm a fiend
Got-got-got-got-got-got a fetish, fetish
Got-got-got-got-got a fetish I'm a fiend

[Verse 1]
When the shrill winds are screaming
And the evening is still
Lady Samantha glides over the hills
In a long satin dress that she wears every day
Her home is the hillside, her bed is the grave

[Chorus] 

[x2]
Lady Samantha glides like a tiger
Over the hills with no one beside her
No one comes near
They all live in fear
But Lady Samantha, she sheds only tears

[Verse 2]
The tales that I told round the fire every night
Are out of proportion and none of them right
She is harmless and empty of anything bad
For she once had something that most of you have

[Chorus] 

[x2]
Lady Samantha glides like a tiger
Over the hills with no one beside her
No one comes near
They all live in fear
But Lady Samantha, she sheds only tears
She sheds only tears
She sheds only tears

[Verse 1]
Oh, my baby, my baby she don't want me no more
Ever since she saw his poster in that record store
She says the way he grinds his molars is really sexy
She thinks he's so darn dysfunctional and Generation X-y
She likes his brooding angst and his wild-eyed stare
Yeah, he's her very favorite slacker multi-millionaire

[Chorus]
Well, my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder
She's all crazy 'bout that Eddie Vedder
Once she was mine, but now I better just forget her
Cause my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder

[Verse 2]
Now, every time I see him, well, he looks so grim
I guess it really must suck to be a rock star like him
What a pain in the butt to have so much success
Spending all his time moping and avoiding the press
But my girl can't get enough of his sullen demeanor
Like he's some big tortured genius
And I'm some kinda wiener

[Chorus]
Well, my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder
She's got a thing for that Eddie Vedder
Tell me, what can he do that I can't do better?
Now my baby's in love with--
I said I said I said my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder
Head over heels for that Eddie Vedder
I can't believe it, now she's knittin' him a sweater
Cause my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder

[Bridge]
I knew we were headin' for disaster
When she caught me hangin' out at the Ticketmaster
Now she's got an unrequited adoration
For the frustrated, agitated, designated, alienated
Spokesman for the disaffected grunge generation

[Verse 3]
Well, I don't wear Doc Martens and I don't wear flannel
And I don't boycott the music video channel
And I just can't compete with all that money and fame
But I know two can play at this kinda game
Well, let's just see how jealous she'll get
When I start stalking Alanis Morissette

[Chorus]
Well, my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder
She's all crazy 'bout that Eddie Vedder
Once she was mine but now I better just forget her
Cause my baby's in love with--
I said I said I said my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder
Why'd she have to fall for that Eddie Vedder?
If she wants to leave me, I guess I better let her
Cause my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder
Spam in the place where I live (ham and pork)
Think about nutrition, wonder what's inside it now (oh boy)
Spam in my lunchbox at work (it's the best)
Really makes a darn good sandwich any way you slice it at all

If you're running low, go to the store
Carry some money to help you buy more
The tab is there to open the can
The can is there to hold in the spam

Oh, spam on the table at home (ham and pork)
Think about selection, are there different flavors now (let's eat)
Spam in my office at work (it's the best)
Think about the stuff its made from, wonder if it's mystery meat

If you need a spoon, keep one around
Carry a thermos to help wash it down
Now, if there's some left, don't just throw it out
Use it for spackle or bathroom grout, now

Spam in my pantry at home (have some more)
Think of expiration, better read the label (oh boy)
Spam breakfast, dinner, or lunch (it's the best)
Think about how it's been precooked, wonder if I'll just eat it cold
Now, once you start in, you can't put it down
Don't leave it sitting or it'll turn brown
The key is going to open the tin
The tin is there to keep the spam in

Oh, spam (spam)
Ham and pork
Think about nutrition, wonder what's inside it now (oh boy)
Spam (spam)
It's the best
Really makes a darn good sandwich any way you slice it

Spam in the place where I live (have some more)
Think about addiction, wonder if I'm a junkie now (let's eat)
Spam in the place where I work (you're obsessed)
Think about the way it's processed, wonder if it's some kind of meat

Spam in the back of my car (ham and pork)
Spam any place that you are (ham and pork)
The tab is there to open the can (spam any place that you are) (ham and pork)
The can is there to hold in the spam (spam any place that you are) (ham and pork)

[You Are Not Alone]

[Verse 1: Michael]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

[Pre-Chorus: Michael]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus: Michael]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Post-Chorus: Michael]
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]

[Verse 1: Michael & Siedah]
Each time the wind blows, I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning, Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong, I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by, this time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now, you are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart, at your call, I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong, I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong, my life ain't worth living, If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Both & Siedah]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael & Siedah & Both]
Noche de estrellas, haz que me quiera como a ella yo
De madrugada, ven que te espera todo mi amor
Soy joven, lo sé, pero siento que te quiero y solo vivo por ti
Me conoces bien y sabes también, que yo no puedo vivir sin tu amor

[Chorus: Both & Michael]
Todo mi amor eres tú, todo mi amor eres tú
(Oh, oh, and it feels)
Cuando no estás no hay quien me dé lo que das tú
(Uh-huh)
I just can't stop loving you

[Bridge: Michael & Siedah & Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(No, baby, if I can't stop) (Oh)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(Oh! Oh! Oh, oh) (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl, you know I do)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

[Outro: Michael]
Remember the Time
Remember the Time
Remember the Time
Remember the Time
Oh, some times I think back to when I was younger
Life was so much simpler then
Dad would be up at dawn
He'd be watering the lawn
Or maybe going fishing again

Oh, and mom would be fixing up something in the kitchen
Fresh biscuits or hot apple pie
And I'd spend all day long in the basement
Torturing rats with a hacksaw
And pulling the wings off of flies

Those were the good old days
Those were the good old days
The years go by but the memory stays
And those were the good old days

I can still remember good old Mr. Fender
Who ran the corner grocery store
Oh, he'd stroll down the aisle with a big friendly smile
And he'd say, "Howdy", when you walked in the door
Always treated me nice, gave me kindly advice
I don't know why I set fire to his place
Oh, I'll never forget the day, I bashed in his head
Well you should've seen the look on his face

Let me tell ya now
Those were the good old days
Those were the good old days
The years go by but the memory stays
And those were the good old days

Do you remember sweet Michelle
She was my high school romance
She was fun to talk to and nice to smell
So I took her to the homecoming dance

Then I tied her to a chair and I shaved off all her hair
And I left her in the desert all alone
Well sometimes in my dreams
I can still hear the screams
Oh, I wonder if she ever made it home
I tell ya

Those were the good old days
Those were the good old days
The years go by but the memory stays
And those were the good old days
Let me tell ya, buddy
Those were the good old days
Those were the good old days
The years go by but the memory stays
And those were the good old days
You can watch Mr. Rogers
You can watch Three's Company
And you can turn on Fame or The Newlywed Game
Or The Addams Family
I say, you can watch Barney Miller
And you can watch your MTV
And you can watch 'till your eyes fall out of your head
That'll be okay with me
And you can watch
(TV)
You can watch Johnny Carson
You can watch Phil Donahue
And you can use TV Guide to help you decide
With capsulized review
Say, you can watch 60 Minutes
Even Captain Kangaroo
But there's only one set, so what ever you watch
Well, you know I gotta watch it too
Say, give it up, give it up, television's taking its toll
That's enough, that's enough, gimme the remote control
I've been nice, I've been good, please don't do this to me
Turn it off, turn it off, I don't want to have to see
The Brady Bunch
Not The Brady Bunch
Well, The Brady Bunch
Yeah, The Brady Bunch
It's the story of a lovely lady
Who was bringing up three very lovely girls
All of them had hair of gold, like their mother
The youngest one in curls
It's a story of a man named Brady
Who was busy with three boys of his own
They were four men living all together
Yeah, but they were all alone
Until the one day, one day when the lady met the fellow
And they knew, and they knew it was much more than a hunch
Then they knew, this group must somehow form a family
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way they all became
The Brady Bunch
Well, The Brady Bunch
Yeah, The Brady Bunch
Well, The Brady Bunch
Oh, it's The Brady Bunch
It's The Brady Bunch
Oh, The Brady Bunch, yeah
Oh, The Brady Bunch
It's The Brady Bunch
Well, it's The Brady Bunch
Well, it's The Brady Bunch
Well, it's The Brady Bunch
It's The Brady Bunch

Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely

Yo, this one here goes out to all my playas out there, man, ya know?
That got that one good girl, dawg, that's always been there, man, like
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
Wonderin' why she had to go and take that flight
Could've sworn I was dreamin', for her I feenin'
So I had to take a little ride

Back trackin' on these few years
Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin' and I'm so

Lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own

(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own, girl)
I'm so lonely

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right outta my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side

What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
'Cause without you in my life girl I'm so

Lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own, girl)
I'm so lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own, baby)
I'm so lonely

Been all over the world, ain't never met a girl
That could take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasin' you

'Cause there ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely

Lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own, no)
I'm so lonely
(So lonely)

For my own
(To call my own, girl)
I'm so lonely

Never thought that I'd be alone
(Be alone)
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
(Gone so long)
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playin' girl and come on home

Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
(No)
I want me and you to work it out
(Work it out baby)
I never wished to ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin' me crazy 'cause I'm so

Lonely

For my own
(To call my own, no)

So lonely, so lonely
So lonely, Mr. Lonely

Do you want to drive to ride mount on your pony
Loosen up my tie to help me breathe
Insisting that I pay my alimony
Each and every day is the same old scene

Come on do the roll, do the roll with me
Come on do the roll, do the roll with me
I said honey, I said honey
I said honey, I said honey
Come on do the honey roll with me

Well I want to say that I'm your mister funky
Singing this song is taking up your time
I did the donkey now I'm your funky monkey
Sing it children, sing it on your mind
When we first met she seemed perfectly normal
I never dreamed she'd make my life so hard
You see, my baby, she started to change
Started lookin' kinda strange
Wearin' all that white makeup and those black leotards
Well, I guess she kept her little secret pretty well
Now, ever since I learned the horrible truth, you know my life has been a living hell
That's right, you see...

She never told me she was a mime
She never told me she was a mime, oh no
Actin' like she's trapped inside a big glass box all the time
She never told me, she never told me whe was a...
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mime

I wish we both could just talk it all over
But my baby won't even make a sound
Now she makes everybody sick
Doin' that pantomime shtick
Even our old friends have stopped coming around
Well, my parents can't stand her and our neighbors hate her guts
She's really, really embarrassing me... This silent treatment's driving me nuts
You see...
She never told me she was a mime
She never told me she was a mime, oh no
Now she's actin' like she's trapped inside a big glass box all the time... What a crime
She never told me (she never told me) she never told me she was a mime

She walks against the wind everywhere we go
Stops at every corner, gotta put on a show
Carries 'round a picture of Marcel Marceau
Always was the quiet type, but how was I know to know?

She never told me she was a mime
She never told me she was a mime, oh no
Actin' like she's trapped inside a big glass box all the ti-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yime
She never told me, she never told me whe was a mime

Now they in my... they in my clothes

Drop dirty bass, drop dirty bass
Dirty bass girls drop it, dirty bass girls drop it
Dirty bass girls drop it, dirty bass girls drop it
Ok, hahaha

[Verse 1]
They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]
Just beat it (Beat it), beat it, (Beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it...

[Bridge]
STOP!
You wanna see who's bad? You wanna see who's bad?
Come on, come on, let's do it
Let's see who's bad, man, come on
Come on, let's go!
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad?

They're telling me (They're telling me)
You're doing wrong (You're doing wrong)
They'll lock you up (They'll lock you up)
Before too long (Before too long)
You're doing wrong (You're doing wrong)
You're doing wrong (You're doing wrong)
You're doing wrong, boy (You're doing wrong)
You're doing wrong (You're doing wrong)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad, brother? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
WOO!

Beat it

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Beat it (Beat it), beat it (Beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showing how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
(Who's wrong or who's right)
Just beat it (Ooh hoo) (Beat it), beat it (Beat it)
No one wants to be defeated (Oh Lord)
Showing how funky (Hee, hee) and strong is your fight (Hee, hee, hee)
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

[Verse 1:]
Fat and weak, what a disgrace
Guess the champ got too lazy
Ain't gonna fly now, he's just takin' up space
Sold his gloves, threw his eggs down the drain
But he's no bum, he works down the street
He bought the neighborhood deli
Back on his feet, now he's choppin' up meat
Come inside, maybe you'll hear him say:

[Chorus 1:]
Try the rye or the kaiser
They're on special tonight
If you want, you can have an appetizer
You might like our salami, and the liver's all right
And they'd really go well with the rye
Or the kaiser

[Verse 2:]
Never eats while on the job
He heard it's good to stay hungry
But he makes a pretty mean shish kabob
Have a taste, they were made fresh today

[Chorus 2:]
Try the rye or the kaiser or the wheat or the white
Maybe I can suggest an appetizer
Stay away from the tuna, it smells funny tonight
But you just can't go wrong with the rye
Or the kaiser

[Verse 3:]
So today, his deli comes first
Still he dreams of his past days of glory
Goes in the back and beats up on the liverwurst
All the while you can still hear him say:

[Chorus 3:]
It's the rye or the kaiser, it's the thrill of one bite
Let me please be your catering advisor
If you want substitutions, I won't put up a fight
You can have your roast beef on the rye
Or the kaiser

[Outro:]
The rye or the kaiser
The rye or the kaiser
The rye or the kaiser...
Yeah throw that got that paper left doin huh
Turning Im back bitch man tell a nigga pussy is here

Chorus:
She now wanna make love
When she whispered in my ear in the club
Want me to smack that, smack that
Pull her hair and give her good fuck
She say she want a real nigga
And Ima give her just that what she said
And Ima break her down till she can't get it out of her head
She loves it when I
Throw dat, throw dat, throw dat throw dat dick (3x)
She loves it when I
Throw dat, throw dat, throw dat throw dat dick (3x)
Throw dat dick, she loves it

Verse 1:
She loves the way I put it down on her fine ass
Straight strong armed robbery black mask
The whole 9 and a half in your fat ass
I got the pussy soaking wet just that fast
Said she got it from her mama she a freak too
And she got a couple friends she could bring too
Ima beat it up, like a bongo
And Ive a feeling like she deep off in the Congo
See Im world wide, with my dick game
Kuntakinte my nick name, ain't shit changed
You know my pedigree, she got up in it like geodesy
Chorus:
I wanna make love, when she whisper in my ear in the club
She now wanna make love
When she whispered in my ear in the club
Want me to smack that, smack that
Pull her hair and give her good fuck
She say she want a real nigga
And Ima give her just that what she said
And Ima break her down till she can't get it out of her head
Throw dat, throw dat, throw dat throw dat dick (3x)
She loves it when I
Throw dat, throw dat, throw dat throw dat dick (3x)
Throw dat dick, she loves it

Verse 2:
She got a whole lot of ass and a lil waist
The reason bout to have me guilty on a murder case
She said I tried to kill her pussy first morning 8
I guess she looking like Rihanna, need a piece of cake
I rode a night I love it up in the strip club
So many women to choose from, Im mixed up
Magic city on Mondays, Im all in
High next Tuesdays, Im balling
Wednesdays Im headed took them all
I love the girls and Im tryna fuck them all
Im a stroke current d away
Sundays fall less we okay
Chorus:
She now wanna make love
When she whispered in my ear in the club
Want me to smack that, smack that
Pull her hair and give her good fuck
She say she want a real nigga
And Ima give her just that what she said
And Ima break her down till she can't get it out of her head
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
Throw dat dick, she loves it

Oh Jessie I'd like to be
One of those men upon the screen
With an elegant lady and a cafe in Paris
Serving Pernot and Kalua with cream

You can see it I know
All the doors have been closed in my face
And the drinks at the Casbah
Run a mile or more from this place

And oh Jessie won't you look at the planes
Tell me, oh Jessie, is it true what they say
That there's a capital G in the name of the game
And the runway's a home for my silver-red plane

And won't you look at the planes
Riding down the skyway
Jessie ain't those wings just fine
Don't it make you want to fly someday

Why friend am I so still
Tied to my job with time to kill
Do I still bear the traces of old Don Quixote
Tilting giants on imaginary hills

[Verse 1]
If you wake up and don't want to smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

[Chorus]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Verse 2]
Why not think about the times to come
And not about the things that you've done
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

[Chorus]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Verse 3]
All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you

[Chorus]
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

[Bridge]
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back

[Outro]
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop

[Verse 1]
Die for it
So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the Devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do it for the money
They don't care, they use it for the money
So you go to church, read the Holy Word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care, they'd kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge, you're called the 'Just few'
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but
If you show me the cash then I will take it
If you tell me to cry then I will fake it
If you give me your hand then I will shake it
You do anything for money

[Chorus]
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil

[Verse 2]
Insurance, where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul, 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease
Of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers 'cause they're the backstabbers
If you know it's a lie then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance then you will dare it
You would do anything for money

[Chorus]
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything (Woo)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything (Hee)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil

[Verse 3]
I don't think so
If you show me the man then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie then I will tell him
If you're stealing with God then you will hell him

[Chorus]
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything (Hee)
Anything for money (Hoo)
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything now, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil

[Bridge]
You're dirty, you're dirty, you're dirty
You know that you're dirty, you're dirty
You know you love it, doggone, baby, anything
(Money makes the world go around)
Hoo
(Money makes the world go around)
Anything for money
Go tell it, go tell it, go, ah, go tell it to the devil

[Outro]
Ah, anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
I, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
I, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody's gone mad
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
Tell me what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I'm a victim of police brutality, no
I'm tired of bein' the victim of hate
Your rapin' me of my pride
And for G**'s sake
I look to heaven to fulfill this prophecy
Set me free!
Skinhead, deadhead
Everybody gone bad
Trepidation speculation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Black man, black mail
Throw the brother in jail
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
Hoooooo!
Everyday, create your history
Some things in life they just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be! No no!
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about . . 
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about . . 
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
Planet Earth, my home, my place
A capricious anomaly in the sea of space
Planet Earth, are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid
Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart soft and blue
Do you care?
Have you a part?
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul
In my veins I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood
Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat
Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste
Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste
In your beauty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now
Planet Earth are you just floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid
Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart gentle and blue
Do you care?
Have you a part?
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul
Planet Earth, gentle and blue
With all my heart, I love you

[Verse 1]
Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon
Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

[Bridge]
Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

[Verse 2]
Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon
Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon
Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

[Bridge]
Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

[Outro]
Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon
Gone too soon
Why don't you believe me when I say that I love you?
I'm crazy 'bout you
You wear the face that tells me you think my lovin' ain't true
I'm all about ya
You're my desire, I get higher every time I speak your name
All I do (That’s all I do, that’s all I do, that’s all I do)
And the way that I can't sleep at night
Just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you

Now, the first time that I saw you walkin' down the street, so pretty
Go on with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love when it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's drivin' me insane

You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one

I'm crazy 'bout you
I'm here to love and please you I'll do what you want me to
I'm all about ya'
Livin' and hopin', but I'm copin'
With these things you put me through
All I do (That’s all I do, that’s all I do, that’s all I do)
The way that I can't sleep at night just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you

Now, the first time that I saw you walkin' down the street, so pretty
Go on with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love you when it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's drivin' me insane

You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one

[Verse 1]
I watch the snowflakes fall
Against my window pane
And wonder if you
Are watching snowflakes, too
I take a walk downtown
To where you used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
But all that's waiting there is

[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

[Verse 2]
I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of good cheer that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
And say a liitle prayer
You'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is

[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

[Bridge]
This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(Bu I'm as sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me?
(Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me?)

[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

[Verse 1]
Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you, my friend, will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me)

[Verse 2]
Ben, you're always running here and there
(Here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere (Anywhere)
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)

[Bridge]
I used to say I and me
Now it's us, now it's we
(I used to say, I and me
Now it's us, now it's we)

[Verse 3]
Ben, most people would turn you away
(Turn you away)
I don't listen to a word they say
(A word they say)
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben
(A friend) like Ben (like Ben)
Like Ben

We say peace to the drama
Peace out to bad karma
'Cause peace is what I want
For my city
Ain't never become a thang
Just a one love dap hug family day
Give a dollar, take two, street hustlers do you
Nothin' comin' 'bout food when life is past due
Real dudes do the walking 'cause the streets do the talking
Real mommas do both and brew a damn good coffee
My city showed love to hucchi mamas and G's
Ordinary afternoons sunsets and palm trees
Hustle boobs to the roxy rocked it properly
Puttin' that work in for my city watch me
Rap world wide all for the west side
Throw your three fingers up at all times

[Verse 2: Prohgress]
I'm from the city of angels
Everybody gotta drive
So the streets is dangerous
Drive slow or the cops will get ya
And sit back while I paint this picture
It's been my home for about two decades
Folks rock T and C to their tele teles
Always rep L.A
On they white and blue cap
Two in the morning ain't a place to get your booze at

[Verse 3: J-Splif]
And I love my block
With the dimmed out street lights
Thugs do they thing under the busted ass street sign
Better lock your car before it turns into a G-ride
Tourists taking pictures looking happy holding peace signs
G's catching cases just a couple blocks down
The LAPD got 'em serving beat down
We learning ghetto law but we had to raise hell
Now we all doing well tryna stay outta jail

[Verse 4: Jin]
From the cities in the states
To cities abroad
I'm like that cool dude Benny
And city of gods
It's love when the city's at peace
Or the city's at odds
Either way I need to stay
Wherever I am within a five mile radius
From the night life, bright lights, and the craziness
Yeah, we live it up, so give it up
For-For-For-What?
The urban life, far from a suburbanite
A shot of Bourbon, twisting up the urban night
Makes things a bit easier to tackle
I'm from the orange state, now I'm in the big apple
The hip-hop Mecca
Bomb beats and concrete
When the time wear long Johns and turn on heat
Yo, the west is where it's at
I'm thinking 'bout going-going back-back
If I catch the 4pm to Long Beach I suppose
Catch could scoop me up right before the clubs close
On behalf of the Far Easty boys kings
Throw up three fingers y'all and make some noise for who?

For the city
I take one walk 'round
We ain't slowing down
Lovetron, lovetron
Lovetron, lovetron
I need more drink in my cup
Twisted off your love
Lovetron, lovetron
You got me leaning leaning
Girl, like you never seen it
Too many drinks for me and I'm just never fiendin'
I took a sip and you hit me with that feelin'
Pour another shot down, dizzy like I'm dreaming
Like girl I keep it rolling
Nothing's ever open
Swervin' down the middle, now we livin' in the moment
Let me put the top down, dress to the occasion
Finally got the buzz to say you're so amazing
Yea, here's to tonight
Here's to my lady now, turn down the lights
Here's to a movie
Baby, let's do it
Pour the champagne now and settle the mood in
I take one walk 'round
We ain't slowing down
Girl it's two times I've been here (Lovetron, lovetron)
It's two times I've been here (Lovetron, lovetron)
I need more drink in my cup
Twisted off your love
Girl it's two times I've been here (Lovetron, lovetron)
It's two times I've been here (Lovetron, lovetron)
Take a sip, now lock the lips
Break it down down to the kicks
Bottles upstate topless
This is how we poppin it
Light you up like sparklers
The love is so immaculate
And if you know what time it is
Then just a kiss ain't all of it
If you wanna be my baby
Then girl let me tell you something
If someone there don't get caught up
Let me take a drink of this loving
If you want me to feel it
Please slow jam when we cutting
Ain't nothing like how we bump and grind
Here's a toast to all the lovers
Yea, here's to tonight
Here's to my lady now, turn down the lights
Here's to a movie
Baby, let's do it
Pour the champagne now and settle the mood in
I take one walk 'round
We ain't slowing down
Girl it's two times I've been here (Lovetron, lovetron)
It's two times I've been here (Lovetron, lovetron)
I need more drink in my cup
Twisted off your love
Girl it's two times I've been here (Lovetron, lovetron)
It's two times I've been here (Lovetron, lovetron)
I take one walk 'round
We ain't slowing down
Girl it's two times I've been here (Lovetron, lovetron)
It's two times I've been here (Lovetron, lovetron)
I need more drink in my cup
Twisted off your love
Girl it's two times I've been here (Lovetron, lovetron)
It's two times I've been here (Lovetron, lovetron)
I take one walk 'round
(Lovetron, lovetron)
(Lovetron, lovetron)
We ain't slowing down
(Lovetron, lovetron)
Verse 1:
Used to be a mess
Be so stressed
How could i've allowed myself to go there
Spread my love
And spread my will till there wasn't enough left for myself

Chorus:
Then i realised that no one alive would care for me the way i would do
(gotta learn myself)
Just a matter of time
You find yourself searching back something inside
You always knew
Can u believe
My heart is healed after all its taken
Can u believe
My heart is healed after so much breaking
(im ready) yes im ready x3
(im ready) to give it all i got
(im ready) yes im ready x3
(im ready) to give it all i got
Verse 2:
I know there will be days where things will not go my way
And i know, that giving up ain't in my taste
Cause ive always stood by what ive always known
Streghth at the side will make this strong
You decide to look who you be in love
Be in love ohhh yeahhh

Chorus

Bridge:
In life theres so much to provide
Too much to sacrifice that its crazy
But i learn to accept and forgive
Ooooo yeahhh

Chorus

[Outro]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Then happy came one day
Chased my blues away
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was
Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lam was I till you came in
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was
(Till now)
Where have I been? What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was till now
Till now happy, yeah yeah happy
Yeah happy, oh happy
Happy, oh yeah happy
Who's looking for a lover?
Who's looking for a lover?

Early this morning while I was yawning
I got a warning thought
Somebody near me who doesn't fear me
Knows things I ain't been taught

Somebody older somebody bolder
Wants to get hold of me, yeah
Somebody smart wants my young heart
Our will is done, our will is done

Who's looking for a lover?
Who'll pick me out from all the crowd?
What thrills will I discover?
Will I be scared or do myself proud?

Who's looking for a lover?
Who's looking for a lover?
Maybe some honey just wants my money
Hey that's a funny tought

Someone appealing could set me reeling
And get my feeling caught

Somebody older somebody bolder
Wants to get hold of me, yeah
Somebody strong help me belong
Answer my song, answer my song

Who's looking for a lover?
Who wants to know what I can do?
Who's looking for a lover?
I'm looking everywhere for you

Somebody older somebody bolder
Wants to get hold of me, yeah
Somebody strong help me belong
Answer my song, answer my song

Who's looking for a lover?
Who'll pick me out from all the crowd?
What thrills will I discover?
Will I be scared or do myself proud?

[Verse 1]
I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can’t take this stuff no more

[Verse 2]
I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

[Bridge]
Hee-hee, hee-hee!
Don't try to pick me
Don't try, quit it

[Chorus]
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Tell me, I'm bothered!
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely
And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee!)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Body)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

[Outro]
And it doesn't seem to matter
(Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right
(Da da da da)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
(Da da, da da, da da, da)
Still I cry alone at night
(Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday

[Intro]
Boom, let me break it down for ya
Shake, get a little loud for ya
Boom, shake
Light, light it on fire

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
Hotter than heaven in the place to be
California ain't the west without the real far east
My name is kevin representin' everything that's free
Shaking the planet single handed with the m-i-c
So can you hear me, hear me, hear me
Hear me, hear me now
If I whisper in your ear then can you hear me when I shout
Arrest me 'cuase I like to play my music really loud
My people sick of hearing you
And now it's time to turn you down
My rap is revolutionary can you hear me when I'm scary
Quiet only in a library next to Halle Berry
Appearantly you didn't hear me
If I was your earring
Put your hands up to the ceillng
Put your hands up if you breathing
Feel me, fresh air, everybody need me
DJ right there scratch it till you're bleeding
Music for the movement suddenly everybody's feeling
All my party people show me if you're breathing
Hands up

[Hook]
Boom, let me break it down for ya
Shake, get a little loud for ya
Boom, shake the city, shake the city
Shake, shake the city
Light, light it on fire

[Verse 2: Prohgress]
I'm Prohgress represent the 6th letter
And the 13th you can add that together
Come in with the whackness no not ever
Light it on fire! (here comes the hot steppa)
Tippy tippy tap girl shake your moneymaker
Show your chest plate like you a gladiator
Sway to the beat make moves like a major
Put your hands up I'm the crowd motivator
Come in with the flavor smooth like gelato
You should go later I'm a heart act to follow
We can face off do it mano a mano
I ain't gonna lose it's not in my motto
Move in to the east 'cause we got to fill a void
Spend a year in the windy so I got that Illinois
Never shy on the mic I paid my dues
And now it's time to bring hood back like deja vu
Come on

[Hook]
Boom, let me break it down for ya
Shake, get a little loud for ya
Boom, shake the city, shake the city
Shake, shake the city
Light, light it on fire
Boom, let me break it down for ya
Shake, get a little loud for ya
Boom, shake the city, shake the city
Shake, shake the city
Light, light it on fire


Extra Extra, Read all about it
The movement on the loose so we boomshake the loudest
You don't wanna miss nothing keep yo eyes glued
Like a high speed chase on the five o' clock news
Got that Barry Bonds flow while we stay big headed
Giants on the mic and our style's infinite
We gon' leave for a minute, got a lifetime lease
Leave a stain on your brain like some fast-food grease
Beneficial to your health with a bowl of mixed greens
Have a feast help yourself to the ultra sick teen
On a quest for good music for your body and soul
We done turned every rock, not a story untold
Don't be counting all them calories
And shove it down your throat
'Cause we promise satisfaction no we giving back a dough
You can try other menus, trust they don't cut it
This is CMG the cast is star studded

[Hook]
Boom, let me break it down for ya
Shake, get a little loud for ya
Boom, shake the city, shake the city
Shake, shake the city
Light, light it on fire
Boom, let me break it down for ya
Shake, get a little loud for ya
Boom, shake the city, shake the city
Shake, shake the city
Is that the sound that a monster makes

[Outro]
I know you hear me
I'll make you feel it
Boom
I know you hear me
I'll make you feel it
They only show you their gums when they smile
Ain't got a tooth in their heads now, how vile
Only can eat things like pudding and applesauce
They never have to buy toothpicks or dental floss

Hey, stand up
Toothless people
The breath is lethal
Wanna tell ya

Hey, (come on), stand up, (get on your feet)
Toothless people
Old and feeble
What I say

No more of those pearly whites will they possess
Their oral hygiene is frightful, a mess
Lots of 'em suffering from trench mouth and gum disease
At least they don't have to worry 'bout cavities

Hey, stand up, (take out your teeth)
Toothless people
Old and feeble
Oh yes
You can brush 'em, you can floss 'em
They're something you just can't ignore
If you lose 'em you're in trouble
'Cause the tooth fairy won't come no more

You need something to show your dentist
The next time he makes you say "ah"
You don't wanna have to wind up
Eating all of your food through a straw

(Like toothless people)
(Toothless people)

You better brush your teeth now
Hey
Toothless toothless toothless toothless people...
Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday i sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night
I thought i heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens i will bear
But first i need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday i sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone
Whisper three words and i'll come runnin'
And girl you know that i'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone...
I woke up yesterday
Knowing I was lost in the past somewhere
I felt my destiny was a sad parade
Going no-o-where

When I saw my sweet melodie
Like a song, you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Made my heart keep time
To the music of a love that filled my mind

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only

Doo-doo-oo doo-oo dooo-doo ooo-ooo
(I wanna see you love me)
The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
The questions in my mind
Have been answered now that you’ve told me
All the colours are brighter now
And the darkness is lighter now
In my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye yesterday

Melodie, you're my symphony
A love song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only

Beautiful morning
Oh happy day
And you know that it’s music to my ears
Every word that you say-ay-ayyy

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only
Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only, only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only
I don't care if you wreck my car or shave off all my hair
You can go and run your vacuum during my favorite show
And I'll let you call up folks in Europe you don't even know
Anything you want, babe, if it makes you happy
But I'm begging you down on my bended knees
Oh, honey, please don't wear those shoes
You can spend my money, you can waste my time
Baby, I don't mind, but please don't wear those shoes
Don't wear those shoes
It's alright, you can play your Twisted Sister every night
I suppose, you can lick the middles out of my Oreos
Or start laughing while you're drinking milk so it comes out your nose
And you know that I'd do anything to please you
But I'm begging you down on my bended knees
Oh, honey, please don't wear those shoes
You can spit in my face in you're so inclined
Baby, I don't mind, but please don't wear those shoes
Oh, no, don't wear those shoes
I said oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, please don't wear those
Use my razor to shave your legs or eat crackers in bed
Stomp the poodle 'til it's flat
You can even shove a six-inch railroad spike through my head
I can learn to live with that
But now I'm begging you down on my bended knees
Oh, honey, please, don't wear those shoes
You can whip me, beat me, rob me blind
Baby, I don't mind, but please don't wear those
I said oh, no, oh, no oh, no, don't wear those shoes
I said oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, don't wear those shoes
You can scratch up my records, you can drink my booze
But baby, please don't wear those shoes
You can make me an offer I can't refuse
But darling, please don't wear those shoes
You can play your bongos while I'm trying to snooze
But honey, please don't wear those shoes
You can expose yourself on the six o' clock news
But please, please don't wear those shoes
I said oh, no, oh, no oh, no, don't wear those shoes
I said oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, don't wear those shoe
I said oh, no, oh, no oh, no, don't wear those shoes
I said oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, don't wear those shoe
I said oh, no, oh, no oh, no, don't wear those shoes
I said oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, don't wear those shoe
...
Hit my snooze alarm for the 27th time
Just don't feel like goin' to work
I think I'll call my boss, then I'm
Gonna hack and cough and wheeze
Swear I've got some strange disease
What's that little twerp gonna say?
Hey

I'm callin' in sick today
Callin' in sick today

I could shine my pennies or clean my lava lamp
I could spend all day in my underwear
Watching "Ernest Goes to Camp"
I could sit and count my hair
I could burp my Tupperware
I'm not busy now anyway
Hey

I'm callin' in sick today
Callin' in sick today
Ain't goin' to work, no way
Callin' in sick today
I can do anything I want to
I am invincible now
I'm on fire, baby
I'm alive, I'm alive, can you hear me, world?
I'm alive!

Maybe I'll spend all day staring at the sun
And trying not to squint
Maybe I'll make a huge color tapestry from
My belly button lint
When I'm sick of takin' abuse
I just make up some lame excuse
Freedom's just seven digits away

Hey
I'm callin' in sick today
Callin' in sick today
Ain't goin' to work, no way
Callin' in sick today

Answer my song, answer my song
Doctor, every night I have the strangest dreams
Doctor, listen to me, tell me what this means
First I'm goin' shoppin' in my underwear
Then all of sudden I'm floating in mid air
My lips fall off and everybody starts to stare
Donuts and hot dogs are flying everywhere

Now Doctor, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothin' yet
Next comes the part that I won't ever forget
Now I'm bein' followed by these Russian spies
They give me some Velcro and an order of fries
Suddenly I'm bowling on the Starship Enterprise
I fall down a hole and that's when I realize

I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
Night after, night after, night after night
Alright

Doctor, won't you tell me, am I going insane?
Was it something I ate or something wrong with my brain?
See, I'm naked in church when I meet a dinosaur
Try to run, but my feet have been nailed to the floor
Then a midget pushes me through a revolving door
And I'm back in the very same place I was before
Now I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
Night after, night after, night after night

And I can't bust out and I can't break free
And it's gettin' just a little too stuffy here for me
And I can't go home and I can't get loose
And I try to escape but it's just no use
And I can't ever leave and I can't ever win
And we're runnin' outta air and the walls are closin' in
And I can't go back and I can't get through
But Vanna since you're here
Why don't you let me buy a vowel from you?
Come on Vanna, come on!

Doctor, all those crazy dreams have started again
That's right, I even wake up screaming now and then
See, I'm coming home from work but I forgot my address
I'm half an hour late for my algebra test
Then some slimy alien jumps out of my chest
And I'm falling and falling and I guess you know the rest

I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
Night after, night after, night after night
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
Stuck in a closet with Vanna White
N-n-n-night after, night after, night night night

Then I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
Night after, night after, night after night

I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White

[Verse 1]
Look at that sun, look at that sky
Look at my sweater vest, it looks so fly
Look at that mailbox, look at that tree
It's about as beautiful as it can be

[Chorus 1]
Whoa-whoa
Today is gonna be exceptional
Never boring even for a minute
It's my world and we're all living in it
Whoa-whoa (We're all living in it), whoa-whoa
Never boring even for a minute
It's my world and we're all living in it

[Post-Chorus]
Go Milo, go Milo, go!
I'm already going actually, but thanks everybody! (Wow!)
Go Milo, go Milo, go!
Oops, I slipped in that puddle, now my clothes are all muddy

[Verse 2]
Look at this bruise, look at this scrape
How did that happen? Check the video tape
Look at this scratch, look at this abrasion
This is gonna be a memorable occasion

[Chorus 2]
Whoa
Today is gonna be incredible
If life's a game, I am gonna win it
It's my world and we're all living in it
Whoa-whoa (We're all living in it), whoa-whoa
Never boring even for a minute
It's my world and we're all living in it

[Verse 3]
I'm not waiting for a bell to ring
I'm not following a beat of drumming
I'm not looking for a brand new thing
'Cause I know I got another thing coming
Another thing coming, another thing coming
You know there's always just another thing coming
Another thing coming, another thing coming
You know there's always just another thing coming
Another thing coming, another thing coming
The next thing is gonna be sensational
Go Milo, go Milo, go!
Aww, thanks everybody, that is so motivational!

[Verse 4]
Look at this cast, look at this sling
I'm not missing a single thing 'cause
I'm not sitting here watching the world turn
You know I'd rather spin it
Go Milo, go Milo, go!
It's my world and we're all living in it

[Chorus 3]
Woah, woah
I'm not sitting here watching the world turn
You know I'd rather spin it
Go Milo, go Milo, go!
It's my world and we're all living in it
It's my world and we're all living in it
I finally made it through med school
Somehow I made it through
I'm just an intern
I still make a mistake or two
I was last in my class
Barely passed at the institute
Now I'm trying to avoid, yeah I'm trying to avoid
A malpractice suit

Hey, like a surgeon
Cuttin' for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Organ transplants are my line

Better give me all your gauze, nurse
This patient's fading fast
Complications have set in
Don't know how long he'll last
Let me see that I.V
Here we go time to operate
I'll pull his insides out, pull his insides out
And see what he ate
Like a surgeon, hey
Cuttin' for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Here's a waiver for you to sign
Woe, woe, woe

It's a fact, I'm a quack
The disgrace of the A.M.A
Cause my patients die, yeah, my patients die
Before they can pay

Like a surgeon, hey
Cuttin' for the very first time
Like a surgeon
Got your kidneys on my mind

Like a surgeon, ooh like a surgeon
When I reach inside
With my scalpel, and my forceps, and re-tractors
Oh oh, oh oh, woe, oh
Ooh baby, yeah
I can hear your heartbeat
For the very last time

[Intro]
Ready? One, Two, Three, Four

[Chorus 1]
This is it, here I stand
I'm the light of the world, I feel grand
Got this love, I can feel
And I know yes for sure, it is real

[Post-Chorus with The Jacksons]
And it feels as though I've seen your face a thousand times
And you said you really know me too yourself
And I know that you have got addicted with your eyes
But you say you going to live it for yourself, oh

[Refrain with The Jacksons]
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan (My plan)
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on baby just understand

[Chorus 2 with The Jacksons]
This is it, I can say
I'm the light of the world, runaway
We can feel, this is real
Every time I'm in love, that I feel

[Post-Chorus 2 with The Jacksons]
And I feel as though I've known you since a thousand years
And you tell me that you've seen my face before
And you said to me you don't want me hanging 'round
Many times want to do it here before, oh yeah

[Refrain with The Jacksons]
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan (My plan)
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on baby just understand

[Chorus 3]
This is it (This is it), I can feel (I can feel)
I'm the light of the world, this is real
Feel my song, we can say
And I tell you I feel that way

[Post-Chorus]
And I feel as though I've known you for a thousand years
And you said you want some of this yourself
And you said you want to go with me all the while
And I know that it's really true myself, oh yeah

[Refrain with The Jacksons]
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan (My plan)
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on please dear understand (Understand)
Ah-aye
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan (My plan)
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on dear please understand (Understand)
Oh yeah
Never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan (My plan)
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on please dear understand (Understand)
Oooh, word about you
Oooh, my plan
Oooh, be your lover
Oooh, understand

[Verse 1]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Post-Chorus]
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Verse 2]
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Bridge]
Oh, whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are not alone, I am here with you)
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
(Though you're far away, you and me)
But you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are always in my heart)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh)

[Outro]
You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh!
Together, together
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
You believe in me!
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
Not alone, oh!

[Intro]
I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain these things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels so right (Girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life (All my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (Like I)
Have finally found her perfect love is mine (See)
And I finally found, come on, girl

[Chorus]
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world, you know you did (Girl)
And everything I own I give (Come on, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

[Verse 2]
In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all my life (Searched for all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find
(Whoa oh oh)
Such a perfect love that's awesomely so right (Whoa, girl)

[Chorus]
You rocked my world, you know you did (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Girl)
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know you did
And everything I own I give (Girl, girl, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (Girl)
You rocked my world, you know you did (Oh)
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world (Oh), you know you did
And everything I own I give (To rock my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

[Verse 3]
And girl, I know that this is love
I feel the magic all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here, hoo

[Chorus]
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know you did
And everything I own I give (Look what you did to me, baby, yeah)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world, you know you did (Know you did baby)
And everything I own I give (Cause you rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Hoo, hoo)
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world
(You rocked my world, you know you did)
The way you talk to me, the way you're lovin' me
The way you give it to me
You rocked my world, you know you did
(Give it to me)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah ooh)
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know
You did
(You rocked my world, you rocked my world)
(Come on, girl) You rocked my world (Come on, girl)
You know you did
(Baby, baby, baby)
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

[Chorus]
I'm drivin' a truck
Drivin' a big ol' truck
Pedal to the metal, hope I don't run out of luck
Rollin' down the highway until the break of dawn
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on

[Verse 1]
My diesel rig is northward bound
It's time to put that hammer down
Just watchin' as the miles go flyin' by
I'm ridin' twenty tons of steel
But it's sure hard to hold the wheel
While I'm still waiting for my nails to dry

[Verse 2]
Oh, I always gotta check my lipstick in that rear view mirror
And my pink angora sweater fits so tight
I'm jammin' gears and haulin' freight
Well, I sure hope my seams are straight
Lord, don't let my mascara run tonight

[Chorus]
Because I'm drivin' a truck
Drivin' a big ol' truck
Smokey's on my tail and my accelerator's stuck
Got these eighteen wheels a-rollin until the break of dawn
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't mind when my crotchless panties creep right up on me
And my nipple rings don't bother me too much
But when I hit those big speed bumps
My darling little rhinestone pumps
Keep slippin' off the mother-lovin' clutch

[Chorus]
But still I'm drivin' a truck
Drivin' a big ol' truck
Headin' down the interstate, just tryin' to make a buck
Wearin' feather boas with sequins and chiffon
While I'm drivin' a truck with my high heels on

[Outro]
I'm drivin' a truck
Drivin' a truck
Got a load to carry and some eyebrows left to pluck
And I'm late for my appointment down at the hair salon
So I'll be drivin' a truck with my high heels on

[Verse 1]
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there

[Verse 2]
If you should ever find someone new
I know he'd better be good to you
'Cause if he doesn't, I'll be there

[Outro]
Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there
Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh
I'll be there, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there
(one, two, thray, four)
(one, two 

[nasal hocking sound])

I used to be a pinball freak
That's where you'd find me every week
But now it's Pacman
Yeah it's the Pacman

I love to gobble up those dots
Keep pumpin' quarters in the slots
They call it Pacman
Yeah it's the Pacman

At the game arcade, they say I'm hardcore
I can play all day 'til my hands are sore
And I quit my job just to play some more
But I won't give up 'til I break high score

Pacman 

[music from Pacman "intermission"]

Well it's the Pacman
Yeah it's the Pacman
Well it takes a lot of cash to play
(Pacman, get the cherry)
So I'm gonna sell my house today
(Pacman, eat 'em up)

I'm playin' Pacman
Yeah it's the Pac-ma-an

Hey mom, I won't be home this year
(Pacman)
Please forward all my mail right here
(Pacman)
I'm at the Pacman
Yeah it's the Pacman

And you're playing with no one but me
Pacman

[music from Pacman "intermission"]

[sound from when Pacman dies]
You make me wanna slam my head against the wall
You make me do the limbo
You make me wanna buy a Slurpee at the mall
You make me watch the Gong Show

There's really something kinda strange about you, baby
But I can't exactly seem to put my finger on it

You make me

That's what you do to me

You make me wanna hide a weasel in my shorts
You make me wanna phone home

Of the Eiffel Tower out of Belgian waffles

You make me wanna hang out in a trailer park
Then take my hamster to the beach
You make me wanna do my laundry in the dark
And use a recommended bleach

When I'm with you, I don't know whether I should study
Neurosurgery or go to see the Care Bears movie

You make me
You make me
You make me
That's what you do to me

(You make me)
That's what you do

Oh whoa
You make me wanna break the laws of time and space
You make me wanna eat pork
You make me wanna staple bagels to my face
Then remove 'em with a pitchfork

You know there's something quite unusual about you
But I can't exactly seem to put my finger on it

You make me

That's what you do to me

(You make me)

Done some things in my life that I'm ashamed of
All the money and the women thought I could not fall
Livin' lives was just caught up in the game of
Always takin', neva givin' wasn't real at all

All I'm askin' for is one more chance
To show to you the best of who I am

At the end of the day, I'm just a man
And I'm standin' here before you with my heart in hand
I wanna be your destiny someone to understand
For you I would try to be a good man

I am serious about this situation
Gonna make sure that I give the very best to you
I wanna fill your life with no complications
If you let me show and prove, I'll be there for you

All I'm askin' for is one more chance
To show to you the best of who I am
At the end of the day, I'm just a man
And I'm standin' here before you with my heart in hand

For you I would try to be a good man

And I'm' standin' here before you with my heart in hand
I wanna be your destiny someone to understand

And I'm standin' here before you with my heart in hand
I wanna be your destiny someone to understand
For you I would try to be a good man

[Remember the Time]

[Intro]
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time? (Do you remember?)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time? (Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time? (Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time? ('Cause I remember)

[Bad]

[Intro]
Who's bad?

[Verse 1]
The word is out, you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lying eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwing stones and hide your hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get through

[Chorus]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)

And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?

Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?
Was I everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I've been looking for

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
Time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed

[Chorus]
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
How many really know what love is?
Many of you never will
Do you know until you lose it?
That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
And you're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I've been looking for

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed

[Chorus]
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
(Can you do that for me, baby?)
Every time you touch me
(See, we don't really know)
Touch me like this is the last time
(Say every day, we never know)
Promise that you'll love me
(I want you to run with me)
Love me like you'll never see me again
(Like you'll never see me again)

[Outro]
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
We're dangerous dudes, we got bad attitudes
Most of our brain cells are gone
We were born to be bad, you better not get us mad
Or we just might toilet paper your lawn
We got a reputation 'round these parts
We only leave a 10% tip
Sometimes we don't return our shopping carts
Stay out of our way and don't you give us no lip

[Chorus]
'Cause we're young, dumb and ugly
That's what we are
We're so young--young, dumb and ugly

[Verse 2]
We wear black leather in the hottest weather
You can't imagine the smell
We got three-day stubble, our name spells trouble
T-R-U-B-E-L
Raisin' hell, bendin' the rules just a little
We're living only for thrills
We squeeze our toothpaste tubes from the middle
And wait until the last minute to pay our telephone bills

[Chorus]
'Cause we're young, dumb and ugly
You better believe it
We're young--young, dumb and ugly
I'll tell you again
We're so young, we're so young, dumb and ugly
We're comin' to your town, yeah
We're young--young, dumb and ugly

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
We're wild, reckless men, we're on a rampage again
We drive with just one hand on the wheel
Danger's in our soul, we goin' out of control
Swimmin' right after a big heavy meal
We're there whenever trouble's startin'
We're rebels without a clue
We drink milk right from the carton
And keep our library books till they're way overdue

[Chorus]
'Cause we're young, dumb and ugly
That's what we are
We're so young--young, dumb and ugly
You can't stop us
We're young, we're so young, dumb and ugly
Young, dumb, and ugly
We're young, we're young, dumb and ugly
So ugly
Young! Dumb! And ugly!

[Intro]
Always on the grind, always down to ride
Bump bump kick till the wheels fall off
Nothin' on my mind, skatin' till I die
Bump bump kick till the wheels fall off

[Verse 1: J-Splif]
Yo, it's going down, you about to witness
Pound for pound, best contenders in the business
We lift the globe on our own, defy physics
And we keep our sound more precious then jail visits
Always stay ahead, even if the wheels broke
Some HD40 keep us smooth on the road
We done made moves down to the deepest trenches
A little kick flip, ollie over lunch benches
Chillin' on deck crawlers jamming on the boards
Grind to you're black, till our ten toes are sore
Stars in the making so you betta take a flick
And if you down to roll just pump pump kick

[Hook: Prohgress]
Now, it's just one of those thangs
When ya got a job and ya ain't got paid
Living with ya moms and ya ain't got laid
Always on the grind (skate, skate)
Now, it's just one of those thangs
When ya got a job and ya ain't got paid
Living with ya moms and ya ain't got laid
Always on the grind (skate, skate)

[Verse 2: Kev Nish]
Ay yo, old school flava with new school kicks
Curb hop, hip hop, funk the skate kids
Sidewalk swerving, freestyle fellowships
Fat lace, finger flip, hang on my grip
'Cause I'm crusing down the street on my skateboard
Jocking the freaks, pimp slapping you hoes
Stuck in the lome, 'cause the 5-0s follow me home
Riding on bones, independent, got me grinding on poles
I'm in the zone, nobody know the way my bearings will roll
The rodes of L.A. got me Curious George
My parents is pissed off 'cause I never come home
Why don't you clones just leave me alone

[Hook: Prohgress]
Now, it's just one of those thangs
When ya got a job and ya ain't got paid
Living with ya moms and ya ain't got laid
Always on the grind (skate, skate)
Now, it's just one of those thangs
When ya got a job and ya ain't got paid
Living with ya moms and ya ain't got laid
Always on the grind (skate, skate)

[Verse 3: Black Silver]
This chick she said she digs my rip game, stay grashin'
Yeah the kid thick, plus he kick flip the big change, mashin'
Fat tracklist, pull her over just for practice
The wind up pitch, she call it MacTwist, we riding
Grindin' till the wheels fall off, we power sliding
7-20 that plan the profit is logical
Nothing out of our reach, we call highly impossible
Getting insane, brain, man it's frightening
The way she got me switching lanes
I call it half pipin' it, lots of it
Then when she done, I call that pop shove it
Far East, Big BlackSil, you gotta love it
This is on a daily album, calenders face it
Skate
Skate, skate

[Hook: Prohgress]
Now, it's just one of those thangs
When ya got a job and ya ain't got paid
Living with ya moms and ya ain't got laid
Always on the grind (skate, skate)
Now, it's just one of those thangs
When ya got a job and ya ain't got paid
Living with ya moms and ya ain't got laid
Always on the grind (skate, skate)

[Outro]
That's all we do, we do
Skate, skate
That's all we do, we do
Skate, skate
That's all we do, we do
Skate, skate
That's all we do, we do
Skate, skate
Late at night, you're hungry
You're craving some pizza
Let me be the one that you call

Olive or anchovy
Perhaps pepperoni
Anything you want, we've got it all

Near, far, I'll jump in my car
You just call in your order and I'm gone
You know, we hand toss our dough
Just tell me what you want and the toppings will go on and on

Deep dish, whatever you wish
Even get two for one with a coupon
You must try our special crust
But just don't eat too fast or your heartburn will go on and on
"Whenever I'm alone with you"
"Whenever I'm alone with you"
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Lowridin'
Low
Lowridin'
Lowridin'
Low
Lowridin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Lowridin'
Low (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Lowridin'
Lowridin'
Low
Lowridin' (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Picture me
Rollin' in my drop top
Me and my girl
Bumpin' the
Oldies with the homies
We on top of the world
This be
West coast ridin'
In the flyest two seater
With the fast low leader
So the hood's over heated
Candy painted whip
Doin' kisses on tip
I'm a lowridin' ruler
Burnin' rubber with my chick
On a California roll
Double 0 to 6-4
So I gotta drive slow when I'm
{Sittin' on chrome}
However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
However far away
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
You my ride-or-die chick
You keep my engine runnin'
You ain't picking up the phone
Even though your friends buggin'
But ain't nothin' when we touchin'
Ain't hearing nobody
In the backseat
Legs up
{Windows all foggy}
We ain't riding on blades
And I needn't all change
You ain't never seen nothin'
You just ridin' our way
And that's why I'm gonna stay with ya
{Stay with ya}
You ain't gotta
Worry about a thing, we could
Take a picture (Take a picture)
Yeah
Better step, to the side
Cause I'm gunnin' for the prize
I'm the number one contender here
To make the girl, mine
She's a diva, not a skeezer
Just a hot, senorita
And she makes my heart thump
Like some twenty-inch speakers
Once you wrapped around my arm
You could be my lucky charm
I'm a certified, pimp
And I got it goin' on
I'm addicted to you, girl
Need my fix, everyday
I ain't tryin' to rehab
Got you runnin' through my veins
"Whenever I'm alone with you"
FM on dial
"Whenever I'm alone with you"
Bionic
I can't watch this
I can't watch this
I can't watch this
I can't watch this

My my my my TV makes me so bored
Makes me say, oh my Lord
What is this garbage here?
Wanna cover my eyes and plug my ears
It sucks, and that's no lie
It's about as much fun as watching paint dry
Lowers my IQ one notch
And that's the reason why, uh, I can't watch

I told you homeboy, I can't watch this
Yeah, nothin' but trash and you know, I can't watch this
Poke out my eyes, man, I can't watch this
Yo, gimme that remote control, I can't watch this

Talkin' 'bout sick shows
There's America's Funniest Home Videos
I can't believe my eyes
When I see the kind of stuff that wins first prize
Somebody's poor old mom
Falls down off the roof, lands right on the lawn
Face first on a rake
I hear they got it on the seventeenth take
That's funny as a kick in the crotch
And that kind of show, uh, I can't watch
Yo, I told you, I can't watch this
Change the channel now, man, I can't watch this
Yo, pass the TV Guide here, sucker, I can't watch this

Cosby Show and Roseanne
Think I've taken 'bout as much as I can
Judge Wapner, oh my
You gotta be Rain Man to like this guy
Thirtysomething is alright
If you like hearing yuppies whining all night
Can't stand Twin Peaks
Wish they'd lynch those donut-eatin' freaks
Those Siskel and Ebert bums
Oughta go home and sit on their thumbs

That's word because you know, I can't watch this
I can't watch this
Break it down

Here's how to order
Money back guarantee
Removes tough stains fast
It tastes more like fresh peanuts
They keep going and going
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful
Could be dandruff
Our prices are insane!
Stop, primetime
I'm pretty sure I'll be sick
If I have to watch another stupid pet trick
Or that guy with the real flat hair
That goes 'Woof woof woof' and waves his fist in the air
Those weird talk shows
About transsexual Nazi Eskimos
They're rude, crude and vile
Just for a minute let's flip down the dial

Flip, flip, flip, eww, I can't watch this
Look man, I can't watch this
I can't take this torture no more, I can't
I can't watch this
Pay the bills, station break
Break it down

Operators are standing by
Cubic zirconium necklace
You're soaking in it
And our fabulous swimsuit issue
When you've got a headache this big
Read the book
This is your brain on drugs
I've fallen and I can't get up!
Stop, cable time
HBO and Playboy, Showtime and MTV
I might like 'em more after my lobotomy
Now why did I ever pay for this junk?
I hooked up eighty channels and each one stunk
Just brainless blood and guts
And mindless T&A
It's awful, it's putrid, it's crummy, it's stupid
Gonna throw my set away

I can't watch this
I can't watch this
I can't watch this
Yeah, I can't watch this
I told you, can't watch this
Too hip, can't watch this
Get me outta here, can't watch this

[Intro]
Convict
Convict
New York City
All the way to Los Angeles California
From the dry lands to over seas baby
To all my beautiful ladies (I see)

[Verse 1: Akon]
The first thing I noticed when I walked in the club girl was you watching me (me, me, me)
Then I started walking towards her when I lost her in the crowd, where could she be? (be, be, be)
You got me in the middle of the dance floor, just searching for you girl
I'm steady looking for you baby
I ask my myself where you created in this world, by the beauty in you girl
And I can't believe that you got me

[Chorus: Akon]
You got me so, you got me so
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do
So, you got me so, you got me so
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Now you got me all in the club like I ain't got none better to do than look for you (you, you)
Yeah
'Cause I'll be here all night searching, do what I gotta do till I find you (you, you)

You got me in the middle of the dance floor, just searching for you girl
(I said I'm searching for you girl)
You got me sweating, got me weak in the knee
'Cause I've been working for you girl
It's so hard because I'm so

[Chorus: Akon & T-Pain]
You got me so, you got me so
You got me so high and confused (so high and confused)
I don't know what to do (don't know what to do)

So, you got me so, you got me so
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do (don't know what to do)

[Verse 3:Akon]
Now I'm looking in the back while I'm looking in the front
While I'm standing in the middle like where are you? (Are you, are you)
I couldn't sworn that she walked right past me baby
Make her sipping on jack and tack
And the blunt got me looking at ladies, where are you? (Are you)
I couldn't sworn that she look right at me
'Cause I'm looking for you
You got me in the middle of the dance floor, just searching for you girl
And I'm tryna find you baby
I ask my myself where you created in this world, by the beauty in you girl
The beauty got me going crazy
(Come on and find me)

[Chorus: Akon]
You got me so, you got me so
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do

So, you got me so, you got me so
You got me so high and confused
I don't know what to do

Don't know if I can go on through this night without you
Acid
Acid
Acid
Acid
I love, I love, I love
Dirty bass
I love, I love, I love
Dirty bass
I love, I love, I love
Dirty bass
I love, I love, I love
Dirty
My girl's from acid
I love, I love, I love
I love that acid
I love that
Bass
I love that
Bass
I love that
I'll bang that woofer, if she's a looker
I'm cruising Hollywood & Vine, I don't want no hooker
I need a 5'4 freak for this FM creep
Let's take it back to the motel, now I'm in too deep
I make girls jiggle, right down the middle
My girl's from Assadena, she ain't that ghetto
She likes to sip the pub, VIP at the club
But when it comes to bass, my girl got a big trunk
Dig the way that you roll, put your bass down low
You can come to the crib
What you here for? Ain't that what you here?
I'm going HAM when the beat drop
Got beef, eat it like a pork chop
And the bass pump, pump like a Reebok
Sitting so high in the Phantom like a tea cup
Hit thriller bang at a scandal
Big Willie, chilling on the big Willah
Your girl icky
Give me lick, licky
No smalls, all biggie, biggie
And she bop to the beat
Back it up, hear the beep, beep
Come to L.A., life on the beach
And she give me brain
Club popping, dirty bass, girls dropping
Young Money, cash, got it
Now shake that ass, dunk it
I dip low when I feel loco
Don't trip, make a dip like a lo-lo
Make a dip like a lo-lo
Make a dip like a lo-lo
Make a dip like a lo-lo
My girl's from acid
I love that
I love that acid
I love that
I, I
I love that
I
I love that
I love that
I love that
I love that
Run so many miles
I run
I left the others in the dust
I know exactly what i want
I'll catch up
Because

Ooh i want you now
Want you now now now
Feels like i'm off the ground
Off the ground ground ground
'til i find you i'm never coming down down down
Until you're mine i'll be dreaming of you

Heading straight to you

Feels like i'm off the ground
Off the ground ground ground

Heading straight to you

Ooh i want you now
Want you now now now

I left my doubts in the shadows
Threw caution to the wind yeah
Finding you somewhere somehow was never a question no
Cause while i'm restless searching for you
I know you're restless searching for me too

I'll be chasing you
Heading straight to you
'til i'm facing you
I'll be chasing you
Ooh i want you now
Want you now now now

Got to work late 'cause my alarm was busted
The boss chewed me out and everybody's disgusted
'Cause it's one of those days
It's just one of those days
I lost one of my socks in the drier
I can't find my wallet and my hair is on fire
Just one of those days
It's just one of those days
I just wrapped my Cadillac around a tree
A big swarm of locusts is following me
There's not even anything good on TV
It's just one of those day
It's just one of those days
Left all my Beatles records out in the sun
Got a Coke bottle stuck on the end of my tongue
It's just one of those days
Gonna be one of those days
The Nazis tied me up and covered me with ants
And I spilled toxic waste on my brand new pants
Just one of those days
Ever have one of those days
The bank called me up and told me, I'm overdrawn
Some freaks are burnin' crosses out on my front lawn
And I can't believe it, all the Cheetos are gone
It's just, just one of those, one of those days
Just one of those, one of those days
The F.B.I. has got a tap on my phone
Those darn Russian spies won't leave me alone
Shouldn't have got up this mornin' should've known
It's just one of those days
It's just one of those days
A 747 crashed into my den
And there's nothin'
But tater-tots for dinner again
It's just one of those days
Never mind, it's just one of those days
Big steamroller just ran over my mom
And I cut myself shaving
And they're droppin' the bomb
It's just one of those days
That's all, it's just one of those days
Then late at night, just before I go to bed
The world blows up and now everybody's dead
You just can't deny it, it's just like I said
Just, just one of those, one of those days
Just one of those, one of those days
It's just one of those days
(Just one of those, one of those days)
It's just one of those days
(Just one of those, one of those days)
It's just one of those days
(Just one of those, one of those days)
It's just one of those days
(Just one of those, one of those days)
It's just one of those days
(Just one of those, one of those days)
It's just one of those days
(Just one of those, one of those days)
It's just one of those days
I was waiting in the express lane with my twelve items or less
At the checkout counter at the local grocery store
I was only passin' by but a paper caught my eye
And I learned a few things I never knew before
It said, "Your pet may be an extraterrestrial"
It said, "The ghost of Elvis is living in my den
You can learn to cope with stress and you can beat the IRS
And the incredible frog boy is on the loose again"

Oh, Midnight Star
It's in the weekly Midnight Star
Aliens from outer space are sleeping in my car
Midnight Star, I wanna know, I wanna know

Eat jelly doughnuts and lose twenty pounds a day
Hear the story of the man born without a head
And top psychics all agree that the telephone company
Will have a brand new service that lets you talk to the dead

Oh, Midnight Star
You can believe it if you read it in the weekly Midnight Star
They're keeping Hitler's brain alive inside a jar
Midnight Star, I wanna know, I wanna know
Tell me, tell me, tell me how to make my bust line grow
Midnight Star, I wanna know

Oh, Midnight Star, well, don't cha know that I read it
I read it in the weekly Midnight Star
The UFO's have landed and we'll tell you where they are
Midnight Star, I wanna know, I wanna know
Midnight Star
Well, you can read all about it in the weekly Midnight Star
You can use your ESP to learn to play guitar
I wanna know, I wanna know, Midnight Star
I wanna know, I wanna know, Midnight Star
I wanna know, I wanna know, Midnight Star
I wanna know, I wanna know, Midnight Star
Inquiring minds like mine wanna know, Midnight Star
I wanna know, I wanna know, Midnight Star
I wanna know, I wanna know, Midnight Star
I wanna know, I wanna know, Midnight Star
I wanna know, I wanna know, Midnight Star
I wanna know, I wanna know, Midnight Star
I wanna know, I wanna know
I woke up this morning
Then I went back to bed
Said I woke up this morning
Then I went right back to bed
Got a funny kind of feelin', like I got broken glass in my underwear
And a herd of wild pigs is tryin' to chew off my head
You know what I'm sayin'?

Well, I ain't got no money
I'm just walkin' down the road
Said I ain't got no money, honey
So I'm just walkin' down this lonely ol' road
Well, I wish I could get me some money
But I forgot my automated teller code

I was born in a paper sack
In the bottom of a sewer
I had to eat dirt clods for breakfast
My family was so poor
My daddy was a waitress
My mama sold bathroom tile
My brothers and sisters all hated me
'Cause I was an only child
I got the blues so bad
Kinda wish I was dead
Maybe I'll blow my brains out, mama
Or maybe I'll, yeah maybe I'll just go bowlin' instead
I'm just a no-good, scum-sucking, nose-picking, boot-licking, sniveling, grovelling worthless hunk of slime
Nothin' but a low-down beer-bellied, bone-headed, pigeon-toed, turkey-necked, weasel-faced worthless hunk of slime
I guess I've got a pretty low self-image, maybe it's a chemical imbalance or something
I should probably go and see a doctor about it when I've got the time

Aw, make it talk, son, make it talk
Okay, now make it shut up

Plagues and famine and pestilence
Always seem to get me down
I always feel so miserable
Whenever I'm around
I wish somebody would come along
And stick a pitchfork through my brain
I'd flush myself right down the toilet
But I'd just clog up the drain
I got the blues so bad
Kinda wish I was dead
Maybe I'll blow my brains out, mama
Or maybe I'll go bowling
Or I just might go bowling
Maybe I'll just rent some shoes and go bowling
Maybe I'll join a league, enter a tournament, put on a stupid-lookin' shirt and go bowling...
Instead

[Hook:]
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn my music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive

[Verse 1:]
All black car (car)
Three percent tint
I can clearly see out
But you can barely see in
The end and on the end
We blowing Indonesia
And I'mma let it hit til I get amnesia
I'm crazy the haze got me hazy I'm lazy
Tell Ben that it something about Mary and clearly (what)
I'm so outta here you can say a nigga spacey (damn)
Pocket full of papers so I'm finnin to get some papers (yeah)
Bout to inhale like I'm finnin to see Satan (what)
Bout to exhale like I'm finnin to see my savior
So get the leaves and trees like it's autumn
Have them windows all rolled up rolled em and told em man

[Hook:]
Roll the windows up when you get in the car, and I'mma light one up
Hit the gas station go and buy a cigar and a philly blunt
Every time I breathe it's like I'm taking a puff, turn the music high
Roll the windows up, when I smoke and drive
To know you is to love you
But to know me is not the way you see
Cause you made me so happy
That my love for you grows endlessly
When I'm down and feelin' sad
You always comfort me
Baby to know you is to love you
Is to see you bein' free as the wind
Cause the power of your lovin'
Is too strong to hold within
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I can feel our love just growing, growing, baby
Hey doggone it baby

[Intro]
Sometimes I feel, like I need a vacation
Sometimes I feel, like I wanna go
To the city of cavemen, the city of Bedrock
I'd be a Flintstone, now I'll tell you why

[Verse 1]
Well, I've got, I've got a woman named Wilma
Well, I've got, I've got a baby named Pebbles
Well, I've got, I've got a doggy named Dino
We do a little bowling and we drink a little vino
Well, I've got a little buddy, Barney Rubble
Got a neighbor by the name of Barney Rubble
He's a midget but he makes a lot of trouble
Doesn't like to shave, he got caveman stubble
Me and Barney, Loyal Order Water Buffalo
Lodge brothers, Loyal Order Water Buffalo
There's a handshake everybody gotta know
How come grand Poo-Bah always gotta run the whole show?

[Chorus 1]
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
I get by on all my prehistoric knowhow

[Verse 2]
Betty and Barney got a baby named Bamm-Bamm
Little Pebbles is his number one fan
He's the strongest toddler in the whole land
Tear your arm off, if he's shaking your hand
Got a car, gonna push it with my feet now
Gonna take my family out to eat now
Jumbo ribs at the drive-in can't be beat now
Made from brontosaurus, baby, not a moo-cow
Wanna chill with a saber tooth tiger
Wear a loincloth, natural fiber
Be the first Rolling Stone subscriber
Got a pterodactyl for a windshield wiper

[Chorus 2]
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Don't know what it means, but I say it anyhow

{Wilma, I'm home! Start serving dinner
And don't spare the spare ribs
Oh, no no no! Don't Dino, don't!
Now take it easy, boy!}

[Verse 3]
Lucky me, workin' down in the gravel pit
Movin' rocks, on a big dinosaur I sit
Mr. Slate gets mad and he throws a fit
Pull the birdie's tail, everybody knows it's time to quit
I realize I'm living in the Stone Age
No fax, no cellular phone-age
Pick my teeth with a dinosaur bone-age
Liftin' heavy boulders every day for my wage
Barney Rubble, laughin' like a hyena
Barney Rubble, what a little wiener!
Where's Wilma? Anybody seen her?
Got a baby elephant vacuum cleaner

[Chorus 3]
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba, yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba dabba do now
Yabba dabba dabba do now
{Now that's alright
Oh, boy!}
Don't you have a word to show what may be done
Have you never heard a way to find the sun
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blue

Have you seen the land living by the breeze
Can you understand a light among the trees
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Tell us all today
IF you know the way to blue

Look though time and find your rhyme
Tell us what you find
We will wait at your gate
Hoping like the blind

Can you now recall all that you have known
Will you never fall when the light has flown
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blue

[Chorus]
Girl, you're so together
Together we can make it, all the way
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe, yeah

[Verse 1]
There's no tree
That bears fruits as sweet as you, no
Apples, peaches
And cherries just won't do, ooh baby
Even the flowers and lollipops
Could never hope to top
The sweetness of your kiss
Can you dig it?

[Chorus]
Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it, all the way, yeah, yeah
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you, babe

Love you so much it's not funny

[Chorus]
Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it all the way, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, girl, you're so together

(Pick your planet, break it, roll it, blow it, then get blown away.) x2

5,4,3,2,1 blunts passed off
Pick your planet, roll it, toke it, smoke it, then we blast off
I'll probably be on mars when I light up
Clean up, then head down to Venus to get wifed up
The nigga in me wanna go to Pluto to get (iced up)
Race through space
Damn these colors vibrant
I'm going on a trip without the luggage
But there's baggage cause I bagged it

Flash the badge and they'll try to

Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way
(Pick your planet, break it, roll it, blow it, then get blown away.) x2

Green, yellow,orange, brown, red and that purp purp
Got me on my Final Frontier like Captain Kirk Kirk
Not to be on my ball sack
But, this isn't Star Trek
So puff the magic dragon and hop on my flying carpet
Preacher told me I should listen to more Mary Mary
But, I love Mary so much Imma probably marry Mary
Mary J. naw
Mary Jane like Peter Parker spot a maid
And I hope she feel the same

Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way
(Pick your planet, break it, roll it, blow it, then get blown away.) x2

Zoomin' the reason that I'm cruisin'
It's cause I'm steady waitin' to exhale
Blowin' on that Whitney Houston
She get me so emotional, delirious
If I hit more than a few times I'm tearin' up
And when life tear me up, god damnit it tear me up
She can be my mascot, always there to cheer me up
Oh my God I'm goin' I'm goin' I'm gone
Call me on my phone nah my nigga I'm zoned out

Take me away, way , way, way , way , way, way
Take me away, way, way, way, way

Pick it, pick it, roll it (x4)

Pick it, pick it, roll it (x4)
Then we blast off

Released as a uk b-side in 1982

Lonely boy, get up and fly
Lonely boy, get up and try
Everyone knows you got what it takes
All you need is one or two good breaks

Lonely boy, this is your time
Lonely boy, you're on the line
This just could be the only throw you got
Get on up and give it your best shot

You gotta make it lonely boy
You gotta take it lonely boy
Oh do da do da day
You gotta do it lonely boy
Get to it lonely boy
Oh take it all the way

Lonely boy, you are the one
Lonely boy, your chance has come
Destiny gonna put you to the test
Face the music and disregard the rest

[Verse: Al Green]
I know Jesus, He will fix it for you
For He knows just what to do, oh
Whenever you pray, let Him have His way
I know Jesus, He will fix it for you
Jesus, He will fix it for you, yes He will
He knows just what to do
Whenever, whenever you pray, let Him have His way
I know Jesus, He will fix it for you
Let me tell you, let me tell you somethin'
Jesus, He fixed it for me, yes He did
He knows, knows just what, what I need
Do you hear me? Whenever you pray
Let me just tell you let Him have His way
I know that Jesus, He will fix it, He'll fix for you
Oh, yes He will
Hey, hey Jesus, Jesus He will fix it
I know that Jesus He will fix it
I know that Jesus He will fix it
(Fix my hand) Jesus, He will fix it
(Fix my feet) Jesus, He will fix it
(My head's out of whack with the midnight blues)
Jesus, He will fix it
Jesus, He will fix it
Jesus, He will fix it
Jesus, He will fix it
Jesus, He will fix it
(Fixed it, He fixed it for me)
Jesus, He will fix it
(Fixed it, He fixed it for me)

(He fixed my feet)
Jesus, He will fix it
(He fixed my mind, my, my, my)
Jesus, He will fix it

[Intro]
I don't wanna do this
Over and over, yeah

[Verse 1]
He's a man so full of style and grace
Any woman'd be impressed
Takes a smile and paints it on your face
Makes you feel like you've been blessed
Promises things so special
Seems to come right from a song
Soon as you begin to feel secure, yeah
You turn around and he is gone, oh

[Chorus]
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
He's a Samsonite man

[Verse 2]
Maybe he is just a rollin' stone
Wandering from here to there
Searchin' for a place to call his own
You wonder if he even cares
So many years of heartache and pain
Is all you seem to know him for
Is it you or is it he to blame?
Whenever he walks out your door, oh

[Chorus]
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
He's a Samsonite man

[Post-Chorus]
Where ya always runnin' to?
Away from me

[Bridge]
If the wind blows you in my direction
You come through to rendezvous
Forget about your good intentions
To leave me lonely and confused
Mr. Samsonite man, pack a bag, that is my suggestion
From here on out, you will be leavin'
At my discretion (Yeah)
Said, I know the game, baby
And it'll never be the same, no, no, no, no, no, no
'Cause now, I got him

[Chorus]
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
He's a Samsonite man

[Outro]
Why don't you just go?
You can't hurt me no more, baby
You can't touch me
You can't hurt me no more, baby
Gotta go, gotta go
Pack your bags
Pack it up, got to go
Hit the road, Jack
Let me tell you what I told you
Long before I noticed love is real, yes
Say something
Don't sit there, say nothing
I will try to explain it to you
It's glory, Alleluia, this love is real
Won't you please clap your hands?
Please, say amen
'Cause love is so high, you can't get over
You're lucky to find a holy clover
Give it a try, you can't get 'round it
You'll reach the sky, you're only grounded
I will try to break it down, release it to be found
This love is real, yeah
Won't you clap your hands?
Somebody say, amen
Hey, we can fill it up
And feel our love then come to us
Love is real, yeah, say it aloud
Sit down, say nothing
Trying to be real, not trying to fool ya
Don't know it all, just trying to school ya
This common love, you won't get by now
But this kind of love you'll find in the sky
We can feel it up
And feel our love encounters love is real
Say something
Don't sit down say nothing, no
These feelings make you wanna want some
Feeling make you wanna want some
Hey, makes you clap your hands, son
Makes you clap your hands, son
I wish I could have
Something to say this evening
I gotta have
Something to say this evening
I'd say one Sunday evening
Somebody came knocking at my door
Knocking at my door, open the door and let him in
Was a feeling, oh, oh, feeling, hey
Make me wanna want some
Make me wanna want some
Make me wanna want some
Make me lost, ah, just a squeeze
Oh, mug around the house
Talking about going someplace
One thing about it I never heard mama
Talk about going to Chicago too much
I might even go into New York city
But never had an idea
That I wanna go to heaven
And I wanna go to heaven
I wanna go, I feel pretty good
I wanna go to 

[Incomprehensible]
I feel pretty good, yeah
I feel like, I feel like I wanna, huh
That's a note
Hey, this love is real, this love is real
Hey, this love is real
Hey, they wanna love is real
This love is real
So real, so real, so real
Love is real, this love is real, yes, it's real
This love is real
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide something so real
So till the end of time I'm telling you

There ain't no one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Pretty woman, give your smile to me
(Well, then let me say it again)
Pretty woman, stop awhile
(Although I just met you, baby)
Pretty woman, talk awhile
(You don't know how I'm feeling)
Pretty woman, give your smile to me
(I will take if you smile to me)
Pretty woman

[Intro]
Have you been making out okay?
Have you been making out okay?

[Verse 1]
Hey girl, I don't wanna change you now
I wanna know how you been making out
How you been?
Did the morning sun warm your soul?
Did he make you happy? Did he make you whole?
Hey

[Chorus]
Have you been making out okay?
Have you been making out okay?
Have you been making out okay?

[Verse 2]
Hey girl, since you been away with him
My life has been cloudy and days been awful dim
But you're looking well
Baby, would you rather be there with him?
Would you reconsider and come running back to me?

[Chorus]
Have you been making out okay?
Have you been making out okay? (I wanna know)
Have you been making out okay?

[Break]

[Chorus]
Have you been making out okay? (I wanna know)
Have you been making out okay? (I just want to know)
Have you been making out okay?

[Outro]
Hey baby, stopped by just to say
While I was on my way
Stopped by today just to see how you was getting along
I wanna know, can you make it on your own, baby?
On your own, baby
Have you been making out okay? (I wanna know)
Have you been making out okay? (Won't you tell me, tell me?)
Have you been making out okay?
Think of your fellow man
Lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart

You see it's getting late
Oh please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see

Another day goes by
And still the children cry
Put a little love in you heart
If you want the world to know
We won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see
Wait and see
Take a good look around
And if you're lookin' down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide
Kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your
Love in your heart
Darling you must know that you are only mine
Not for just right now but all the time
Your sweet ways I cannot forget
Are the only things that you said on the day we met

This love I try to fight but I couldn't know love too long
And I knew the way that I was, I wouldn't be 'round too long
Your sweet ways I cannot forget
When I think about all the things you said
To help me through my days

Now I need you more desperately than I ever did
All the things we've done, all the things you say
Just drives me outta my head

So baby, please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
I want you to stay with me, baby, yeah
Please, please, won't you stay with me forever?

Please take my love, that's all I have to give
Just right now you're giving me a reason to live
Help me understand what I feel is real
For no love has meant this much to me
In the past couple of years
And if you let me there is nothin' I wouldn't do for you
And if you trust me with your love
Then I will make your dreams come true

So baby, please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
I just want you to stay a while with me, baby
Please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
C'mon and stay

Oh, c'mon take me by the hand, oh
Heaven, I want you to cherish me
C'mon, c'mon
Love me
I want you back
I need you more than you think
I can't let you go
Hold me
I'm down to 1-2-3
Two and two is four
I can't let you go

Times spent together
All is dear to me
So you know my mind
All I need is Spring to see
Hold on tight
Can't let you go
Hold on tight
I just can't let you walk out on me

You don't know, know me
Stay around and see
I just can't let you go
Soon there'll be
Someone just for me
I'll be glad
When it comes down
To no one but you and me
I'll be glad when it comes down
To nobody but you and me

Hold on, got to hold on
Just can't let you go
Hold on
I just can't let you go
Hold on, got to hold on
I just can't let you go

[Chorus]
I'm finna win it all
They should put me on a poster
I gotta get it all
They should put me on a poster
Every night I get it all
They should put me on a poster

Yea the game barely started but its already over
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can

[Big Sean - Verse 1]
Starter, only hit the bench when Im liftin'
Priceless, but they still gotta pay admissions
I'm so far ahead that I could pause and take pictures
Hold the autographs, I'm a shot away from winnin' it all
Hell yea Im goin' for the title
And if your name is on the title then finna get the white out
So many cameras flashin' I can't even tell its night out
I swear I saw the reaper, guess I'm finna bout to play my life out
Lights out
Everytime I'm coming down
Cuz I will knock you out like you weigh 100 pounds
Bartender, I'ma probably need 100 rounds
Theres only one king, and not another crown
Tryna pay my tool like where is the pay station
Whole crowd packed, like they finna vacation
Doing everything in the world that I planned
So now I tell my dreams, c-catch me if you can

[Chorus]
I finna win it all
They should put me on a poster
I gotta get it all
They should put me on a poster
Every night I get it all
They should put me on a poster

Yea the game just started but its already over
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can
I said I bet you can't walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can

[Big Sean - Verse 2]
Now look, you can try and keep up, you probably gonna pass out
Yeah I took your girlfriend and turned her into my mascot
Hometown hero but I'll never pull my mask out
I bet the crowd love me, love me like I hit the last shot
Sometimes your first shot could be your last shot
Just see what I do when the ball get passed out
And my shadow is the only thing Im fearin'
And if I need to see my idol, I just look up in the mirror
So I'm the one they stand and applaud for
And guess who they goin bring out that award for
I hope they shinnin' up the medal case
Cuz the only thing I'm runnin' from is second place
Im still hungry, Im on my second plate
You a little guy, you need some extra weight
Bet everybody call me Big
Go hard or go home, so I'll don't ever see the crib

[Chorus]
I finna win it all
They should put me on a poster
I gotta get it all
They should put me on a poster
Every night I get it all
They should put me on a poster

Yea the game just started but its already over
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can

[Intro]
Oh, yeah, okay, huh
Let's take it back a little bit
Ya know, it's not that it's not good now, I just...
I'm remembering how, huh, but let me tell you, uh

[Verse 1]
Let's go back in time
When seeing your ID on mine
Made me crazy, oh baby, I'm saying
Let's go back there (Go back there)
Let's take it there (Take it there)
I'm talking 'bout back in time
When you wanna know my every move
Tired to keep it smooth keepin' up with me
You drove me crazy, oh baby
Let's go back there (Go back there)
Let's take it there (Take it there)

[Pre-Chorus]
When you didn't know me, didn't need me
Want to touch me, couldn't leave me
I couldn't know how far this would go
I couldn't know if this was for sure
We just could not
We just could not get enough of it, baby, let's go

[Chorus]
Have that wreckless love, that crazy love
That off the wall, won't stop 'til I get enough kinda love
I need that love, so baby, let's go
Have that wreckless love, that crazy love
That I don't really care, we can have it anywhere kinda love
That wreckless love

[Verse 2]
Let's go back in time when our kiss was brand new (ooh)
An adventure, not perfected, a little hesitant
Let's go back there (Go back there)
Let's take it there (Take it there)
Ooh, baby, now, take it back in time
When forever was a minute, and eternity was a second
I'm stressing that we gotta go back there (Go back there)
Let's take it there (Take it there)

[Pre-Chorus]
When you didn't know me, didn't need me
Want to touch me, couldn't leave me
I couldn't know how far this would go
I couldn't know if this was for sure
We just could not
We just could not get enough of it, baby, let's go

[Chorus]
Have that wreckless love, that crazy love
That off the wall, won't stop 'til I get enough kinda love
I need that love, so baby, let's go
Have that wreckless love, that crazy love
That I don't really care, we can have it anywhere kinda love
That wreckless love
Oh baby, let's go
Have that wreckless love
That crazy love
That off the wall, won't stop 'til I get enough kinda love
I need that love, so baby, let's go
Have that wreckless love, that crazy love
That I don't really care, we can have it anywhere kinda love
That wreckless love

[Verse 1]
There comes time in everybody's life
When you're in trouble and you don't know what to do
With Jesus by you let Him be your guide
He's the one to hold on to

[Chorus]
He'll be the light of the world
When darkness is all around you
He'll be your friend in time of trouble and time of need

[Verse 2]
Ever wonder why there's storms up in the sky
Or is it that we never second thought
With His outstreched arms, he'll lead you on through the night
He promised to hold on strong

[Chorus]
Oh, He'll be the light of the world
When darkness is all around you, oh, oh yeah
He'll be your friend in time of trouble and time of need

[Bridge]
Oh, hold on to His hand
Hold on, real strong, hold on, oh

[Chorus]
He is the light of the world
When darkness is all around you - listen now, oh oh oh
He'll be your friend in time of trouble and time of need, yeah, oh
He is the light of the world
When darkness is all around you
You don't have to worry, now, whoa, yeah
He'll be your friend in time of trouble and time of need
Oh, oh, yeah
He is the light - I'm so glad He is the light of the world
Yeah, oh yeah
He'll be your friend in time of trouble and time of need
I come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear, the Son of God discloses

And he walks with me, and he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

He speaks, and the sound of his voice is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing

And he walks with me, and he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

I'd stay in the garden with him though the night around me falling
But he bids me go; thru the voice of woe his voice to me is calling

And he walks with me, and he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

[Verse]
Oh, what a wonderful thing love is
Oh, I can see you standing there now
And you're the prettiest thing in the crowd
And guess who'll be laughing loud but me
You made me see the love that you're giving me
Baby, won't you hold my hand?
Now, that kind of makes a fool understand
Just let me know that I'm your man
And show I'm not ashamed
I walk the floor when you leave me
Baby, I don't know about you
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna try to make my dreams come true
With you, baby
With you, baby, yeah

[Outro]
I wanna say, I've been crying about your love
The nighttime find me wetting my pillow
But I, really I don't, I don't mind, no
But if you you just let me say it again
I've been crying
I wish old trouble would leave me alone
But I've been crying
Oh, come on and stop the rain right now, yeah
Stop the rain, stop the rain, stop the rain, yeah
Baby, baby, yeah
Oh, what a wonderful thing love is
Hey, yeah, baby

[Verse 1]
What is this feeling I have in my heart for you, my baby?
Oh, baby
It's one of the things that I can't explain to you
And that's how I feel about you (Ooh)
You kiss me a thousand times (Ooh)
Slowly drivin' me out of my mind, uh-huh, baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm really crazy 'bout the way you can be, my baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why can't you be that way to satisfy me?
Ooh, baby, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
You go out late at night, oh, yes, you do
Knowin' things with you and me ain't right, no, hee-hee-hee

[Bridge]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, baby (Baby)
Somebody need to help me now, yeah
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, baby, yeah, say

[Outro]
Crazy 'bout the way you can be (Yes I am)
Hey baby, hey baby, yeah, yeah
Why can't you be that way to satisfy me, baby? Yeah
I'm yours (I'm yours), I'm yours to keep (Yours to keep), baby, yeah

Your love me is something to put me on my feet, baby
I have to— I have to keep on sayin' (Yeah)
La-la-la-la (La-la-la-la), ooh, baby (Baby)
Won't you— hey, hey
Let me come on into your garden of love, baby
Oh-ho, all you got to do
Hold me tender, love me long
Hey, baby, yeah, I wanna know, I've got to know
What is this feeling?
What is this feeling?
Is it real?
Or is it something that I feel?
You say it, He was here

Might not be able to sing like a man, you say it
Might not be able to sing like a man, yeah
Might not be able to preach like Paul, baby
Might not be able to preach like Paul

I'm in love with you, girl, that ain't all, come on
I'm in love with you, and that ain't all

I wanna call you up and say how I feel, baby
Wanna call you up and say how I feel
I got to let you know my love is real, you say it
Got to let you know my love is real
Take time, don't give a damn, alright

I've been wanting to call you up for a long, long time, baby
Want to call your number for a long, long time
I got to let you know that your love is mine, alright now
Got to let you know your love is mine, alright
La, la, la, I feel alright, you say it
La, la, la, I feel alright
La, la, la, la, I feel aright

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm the steel-boned and iron blooded creep
I'm the tongue-flooded mouth and I cannot speak
I'm the scars upon your knees
I'm the scrapes allowing your skin to breathe
I could be anything

[Chorus]
And it was so brief
A kick in the teeth
Oil and powdered lungs
Because I know how to breathe
And it was so brief
I want more time for luck
And then I go again

[Intro]
Oo, Oo, Oo, Oo

[Verse 2]
You're the movements in my sleep
You are the words I couldn't keep
I saw the fumes and watched them seep
Into the wounds you bear to bleed
I could lose everything

[Chorus]
And it was so brief
A kick in the teeth
Oil and powdered lungs
Because I know how to breathe
And it was so brief
I want more time for luck
And then I go again

[Outro: In reverse]
Because I know how to breathe
Because I know how to breathe
Because I know how to breathe
Because I know how to breathe

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Broken promises
My heart you stole, lies you told
Got the best of me
Digging in my heart of gold (Hey)
Used to look at you and see the possibilities (Yeah)
I see you for who you are
Boy, you've disappointed me

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought you gave me love
Was never near enough
Soon enough, time reveals
Love wait of what is real
Know all I need to know (And I know it)
Boy, see, you gotta go (Bye, bye)
What have you given me (Hey)
But lies, lies? (Hey)

[Chorus]
Go ahead, go on and get up outta here
Go ahead, baby
You knew you was wrong
You knew all along
Must be crazy
If you think I'ma fall for this anymore
Everybody say no, no, no, no
Everybody say no, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
Used to believe in every word you said, clouds my head (Hey)
Leavin' me here to drown (Hey, hey, oh)
Hopes and dreams, therefore dead
You point your finger, tryna justify your mistakes
(You're gonna justify)
Our changes gon' be made
So you best be on your way

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought you gave me love
Was never near enough
Soon enough, time reveals
Love wait of what is real (So real)
Know all I need to know (Yeah)
Boy, see, you gotta go (Go)
What have you given me
But lies, lies?

[Chorus]
Go ahead, go on and get up out of here
Go ahead, baby
You knew you was wrong
You knew all along
Must be crazy
If you think I'ma fall for this anymore
Everybody say no, no, no, no
Everybody say no, no, no, no

[Bridge]
No need to apologize, don't try to make it right
I know, I should've known better
When you took hold, I was sold
Using fear to control, now it unfolds (Oh)
Let me tell you right now what I'm gonna do
Made up my mind, it's time and I'm through with you
Nothing you can say or can do can make me change my mind

[Chorus]
So, just go ahead, go on and get up out of here
Go ahead, baby
You knew you was wrong
You knew all along
Must be crazy
If you think I'ma fall for this anymore
Everybody say no, no, no, no
Everybody say no, no, no, no

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
No, no, no, no, no
You get up early in the morning just to see her eyes
She's walking 'round the house in a complete disguise
I don't know just how to tell you, just how she changed so fast
But she's the prettiest thing in my life at last

I'm (Incomprehensible) a silver moon, baby
I can't stand to see you in my bedroom
I'm moving with
And I wanna dance with my sweet love sixteen

I can't believe the way you hold me
I can't believe the way you console me
Oh, I wanna dance with my sweet love sixteen

Oh, the fellows wanna just touch her or hold her hand real tight
But she is the prettiest thing out here tonight, gentlemen
If the dancing gets good to you, lay down in your shawl
You try to move your body, you might lose control, tell you one thing

I don't believe the way you hold me
The way you console me
Oh God, I wanna dance with
My sweet love sixteen, alright
Tell you what I'll do, just talk with
Tell what I'll do unless you walk with
I believe I'll let ya sing baby
I don't want you to hold me

[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, tell me what's wrong with you
Oh, oh, baby, tell me what's wrong with you
You done gone away and left me
Tell me, tell me what you're tryin' to do

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, oh, baby, baby won't you please come back
Baby, yeah, baby won't you please come back
Let me say that you gone away and left me
Won't you please help me to relax
Oh oh, hey hey

[Verse 3]
What you tryin' to do
Oh, hey, baby, tell me what you tryin' to do
You gone away and left me
Won't you please try to be true
Oh, oh, hey

[Outro]
Hey, baby, what's wrong with you
I wanna, wanna know
Hey baby, baby, what's wrong with you
Hey, baby - hey, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, don't you go away, leave me
Lonely, lonely-lonely-lonely
Hey, baby, baby, won't you please come back
I wanna know, I gotta know
Baby, baby, baby won't you please come back
Baby, well I think I, think I hear my train
Gone away and left me
Won't you please help me to relax
I think I can hear the train comin', baby
Baby, won't you please come back
Baby, early this morning
Baby, come peepin' round my room
Baby, don't know what you tryin' to do
Hey hey, won't you help me, help me, baby, baby

[Intro]
Time, time, time, time

[Verse 1]
Well, hello there
My, it's been a long time
How am I doin'?
Well, I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long and it seems like
It was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

[Verse 2]
How's your new love?
I hope he's doin' fine, oh yeah
I heard you told him, told him
You're gonna love him 'til the end of time
But, if I remember, that's the same thing, same thing
That you told me, it was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time just slips away

[Bridge]
I gotta go now
I guess I'll see you somewhere around, somewhere around
Uh-huh, but, oh, you don't know, you never know
We don't know, you can't know when I'll be back in town
Remember what I told you
That in time you're gonna pay
Well, ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away

All I want you to do is just, just remember what I told you
In time, in time, you're gonna pay
Yeah, ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away

[Outro]
One thing I want you to do
Is just remember, remember what I told you
In time, in time, hey
Ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away
Ooh baby, oh baby
It's the same thing, same thing that you told me
Oh, it seems like just the other day
Ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away
Funny thing about the time, baby
It's funny, baby, how time slips away
Ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away

[Intro]
Hmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hmmm, hmmm

[Verse]
Sometimes I feel like I don't belong anywhere
And it's gonna take so long for me to get somewhere
Sometimes I feel so heavy hearted
But I can't explain 'cause I'm so guarded
But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there
Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel
To guide me?
Hmmm

[Verse 1]
In the morning when you wake
Might not wanna face today, and all your heartache
Thinking how much can you take
Please don't ever lose the faith, and don't fall under

[Pre-Chorus]
In a world that seems to get colder and colder
Don't you worry 'cause
My love will only get stronger and stronger

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I, I, I, I'm gonna love you, gonna hold you through it all
I, I, I, I'm gonna love you, gonna never let you fall
Ah, oh yeah, ah, oh, oh
Through it all
Ah, oh yeah, ah, oh, oh
Through it all

[Verse 2]
Don't think about the past, don't worry about the future
Just live in the moment
Long as there's another day, there will be another way
A chance to make it through

[Pre-Chorus]
In a world that seems to get colder and colder
Don't you worry 'cause
My love will only get stronger and stronger

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I, I, I, I'm gonna love you, gonna hold you through it all
I, I, I, I'm gonna love you, gonna never let you fall
Ah, oh yeah, ah, oh, oh
Through it all
Ah, oh yeah, ah, oh, oh

[Bridge]
When you're down and out
Losing dignity
Don't let go of me (Hold on)
Surely this is a brighter day right in front of me (Hold on)
If you really looked inside
You would finally realize
You don't have to cry (No more)
All you have to do is see
That you can believe in me
And I will never leave, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I, I, I, I'm gonna love you, gonna hold you through it all
I, I, I, I'm gonna love you, gonna never let you fall
Through it all

[Outro]
Ah, ah ah ah
Ah, ah ah ah
(Spoken)
Don't make no difference to you
Well, it's all right with me

Just because I'm from the country
I've been a miner too
Just because I'm thinking about New York City
Just 'cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking 'bout Georgia too

So it seems I dream
It's just a passing thing
I'm gonna find it out
Without the slightest doubt

Just because I'm from the country
I've been a miner too
Just because I'm thinking about New York City
Just 'cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking of Georgia too
Just 'cause I talk the way I do
Don't mean that it ain't true
'Cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking about Georgia too

Here me see it again now

'Cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking about ...
That's right!

In the meantime

So it seems I dream
It's just a passing thing

I'll play my guitar
Feels so good!
Just a country boy, yeah

Just because I'm from the country
I've been a miner too
(You better believe)
Just because I'm thinking about New York City
Just 'cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking about Georgia too
Meanwhile, meanwhile
I'll play my guitar here

South's gonna do it again

[Verse 1]
When you have trouble, don't cry
Just remember that God is standing by
Thank you, Lord
When you have heartaches
Don't cry, no, no, no, no, no
Don't worry, don't be discouraged
Don't cry, yeah
And sometime I have to say

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll be standing by
(That's what He told me, yeah)
So, I say there's no need to cry
Thank you Lord, yeah
Oh, I'll be standing by
(I'm gonna be standing, standing by, yeah)
So you see that there's no, no need to cry, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'd like to say one more thing
When you have heartaches you wonder why, yeah, yeah
But just remember, I want you to remember He's standing by
And you don't really have to worry about it, no
When you have trouble please
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, oh, no, no, no
Don't worry, don't ever be discouraged
I want you to know you don't have to cry
And sometimes when your burdens get you down

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll be standing by
(I'm gonna be standing by, thank you Lord, I thank you for seeing me)
So I get and no need, no need to cry
But oh, oh, I'll be standing by
(I'm gonna be standing by, thank you father, yeah, yeah)
So don't you worry and don't cry, yeah, don't cry, don't cry

Fountain of Love
By Al Green

As the world turns slowly
You?re always on my mind
As a friend you?re always there for me
Forever by my side
I hear you whisper my name
I can never feel alone
I says deep down in my heart
I don?t want us to part
And I want to take you home

Oh, just take my hand
Come and walk with me
Let us drink together from the fountain of love
Look in to my eyes and you?ll realise
That your love flows from the fountain of love
Love, love

Let love surround us
And this feeling of the night, yeah
If there is a doubt in your mind
I will make it alright, hmmm
I?ve never felt like this before
It?s only you that I adore
I says deep down in my heart
I don?t want us to part
And I want to take you home
Oh, just take my hand

Come and walk with me
Let us drink together from the fountain of love
Look in to my eyes and you?ll realise
That true love flows from the fountain of love
Love, love

Oh I know, I know
As the world turns slowly
You?re always on my mind
As a friend you?re always there for me
Forever by my side

Take my hand, come and walk with me
Let us drink together from the fountain of love
Look in to my eyes and you?ll realise
That true love flows from this fountain of love

If you want the answer now, now , now
Let?s drink together from the fountain of love
Oh baby, won?t you look in my eyes and realise
That true love flows from the fountain of love

Take my hand, come and walk with me
Let us drink together from the fountain of love
Why don?t you look in to my eyes and you?ll realise
That true love, true love, true love, flows from the fountain of love
Take my hand come on and walk with me
If you look into my eyes then you will realise
That true love flows from the fountain of love
Going to Paradise
No looking back
No time for thinking twice
Nothing do I lack
See I like it, I like it

There's nothing you can change
No substitute
Jesus is the one and only absolute
You see I like it, I like it

I finally found a love
And it's for real
I gotta let you know
I like it, I like it

Hey America
I want to tell the world about it
Hey America
Shout it from the mountains
Don't doubt it
You can turn a smile
And think I'm wild
Keep your own mind
Keep your own style
I like it, I like it
I finally found a love
That's for real
Gotta let you know
I like it, I like it
Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
'Tis Grace hath brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home

The Lord has promised good to me
His Word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun
Oh, yeah
Candles burning low
Lot's of mistletoe
Lot's of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singing carols
Right outside my door

All these things and more
Baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas
Means to me
My love
(Christmas means to me
My love)
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I see your smiling face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love you madly
It seems I love you more
The little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure
All these things and more
Baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas
Means to me
My love
(Christmas means to me
My love)
Oh, yeah

I feel like running wild
(Running wild)
As reaches and a little child
Greet you 'neath the mistletoe
I kiss you once
And then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas
Baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby)
And happiness
Happiness in the coming year
Oh, yeah

Christmas means to me, my love
(Christmas means to me, my love)
(Christmas means to me, my love)
Let's deck the halls
With holly
Sing a silent night
Fill a sheet
With angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

All these things and more
Baby
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas
Means to me
My love
(Christmas means to me
My love)
Hey, yeah

That's what Christmas
Means to me
My love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Oh, yeah
Merry Christmas
Yeah
Oh, yes
On this magic road I'm about to lose control
Oh, won't you bless my soul on this magic road
Down this magic road you can have anything you want
And leave out things you don't on this magic road

What is this I see? What a mystery
What a time to meet, baby

On this magic road smile is the down side
But don't you ever close your eyes on this magic road
On this magic road you can even drive my car
You can even be a superstar on this magic road

What is this I see? Oh my, my, my, my
What a mystery, what a time to meet
On this magic road, on this magic road
On this magic road

You can even drive my car, oh
You can even be a suitor or lawyer
Just know who, we know who you are
What is this I see? What a mystery
Sure to find life's ecstasy

On this magic road nothing's impossible
You can depend on me, keep saying
On this magic, magic, road, yeah
On this magic road, if you turn on and off the bulb
On this magic road, on this magic road

You can have a big bank account
(On this magic road)
You can see the old they're comin' here
Hey watch out, watch out for the little man in the corner

On this magic road
You can be anything that you wanna be
But hey, hey, watch out for the little man
(On this magic road)

They don't have what you have
Watch out for the poor man
They don't have what what you're having

You got a bigger house and a Mercedes, big brother
(On this magic road)
But you hanging around in a Volkswagen
(On this magic road)
On this magic road
Remember what's happening, agony
Slavery, agony trauma with (Incomprehensible)

See the little children, yeah, yeah, yeah

The lord is my shepherd I shall not want
Ohh, He making me lie down in green pastures
Ohh, He leadeth me beside the still waters, ohh
Ohh, He restoreth my soul
And He leads me in the path in righteousness
For his name's sake

Yea, though I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I will not fear, thou art with me
Ohh, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me
Ohh,Thou preparest a table before me
In the presence of my enemies

Thou anointest my head with oil
My cup runneth over
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me
Ohh, but (Incomprehensible) yea, my, my (Incomprehensible)
I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever
I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever, ohh, amen
Would you help me? Would you help me stay here?
Amen, why don't you have a seat? Amen
Everybody have to say is a, amen

[Chorus]
What more do you want from me?
I've just about given you all of me
More than your eyes can see
After all I've done for you
Oh baby, you gave me too, oh
What more do you want from me?
What more do you want from me?
What more do you love about me?
After all you've done for me
I love you, yes sirree, oh

[Bridge]
I've tried to do my best, girl, yeah
We can stand the test
Oh, and forget all about the rest
Good love is more than true
Oh baby, I just guess for me and you, oh

[Chorus]
What more do you want from me?
What more do you want from me?
What more do you love about me?
After all you've done for me
I love you, yes sirree, oh oh
You've won, you've won my heart, baby
Where do, where do we start?
What more do you want from my heart?
After all you've done for me, oh baby
I love you, yes sirree, oh oh

What more do you want from me?
What more do you want from me?
What more do you love about me?
After all you've done for me
I love you, yes sirree, oh oh

[Outro]
Think about it baby
What more?
Think about it baby
What more?
Think about it baby, oh

[Verse 1]
Down the oceanside, all my tears subside
But I feel I see my baby
I can't wait today -- don't want it to end this way
But I, I wanna be your man, be your man

[Chorus]
Won't you be my baby? Hey, yeah
Won't you be my baby girl?
Oh, won't you be my baby?
Be my special girl, whoa-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Every time I see you run
It seems like I'm having fun
But I, I wanna be your man
Every time I see you cry, every time I wonder why
Figure I oughta hold your hand, hold your hand

[Chorus]
Won't you be my lady? Oh, baby
Won't you be my baby girl? Hey, girl
Won't you be my baby?
Be my special girl, oh oh yeah

Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, oh
Won't you be my lady? Ow
Won't you be my baby girl? Hey, hey
Check it out
It feels kind crazy

These covers, may keep me warm at night
But they can't take your place, cause they never gonna hold me tight
And these pillows, may let me rest my head
But they can't say good night and tuck me in before I go to bed
Say now baby girl you're better off that's what I'm telling myself
But im lying to myself cause I know I don't want nobody else

These lips are missing you
Cause these lips ain't kissing you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these Tears Always Win
These arms are wanting you
Cause these arms ain't holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these Tears Always Win

These candles light up my room at night
But they can't lid the room they way you did when you walked inside, oh baby
If these walls could sing about everything they've witnessed
Oh it'd be a sad sad song, and it'll probably sound something like this
Say now baby girl you're better off that's what I'm telling myself
But I'm lying to myself cause I know I don't want nobody else

Cause these lips are missing you
Cause these lips ain't kissing you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these Tears Always Win
These arms are wanting you
Cause these arms ain't holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these Tears Always Win

Tell me when the hell this loneliness is gonna be over
When everything in this room reminds me of you
Everytime I think, I'm getting closer
Cause tears drown me out, once again I lose

Cause these lips are missing you
Cause these lips ain't kissing you
I put up a fight
But once again these Tears Always Win
These arms are wanting you
Cause these arms ain't holding you
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these Tears Always Win
Crying like oh oh oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these Tears Always Win
Crying like oh oh oh oh
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these Tears Always Win
These eyes put up a fight
But once again these Tears Always Win
Oh Lord, the time is growing nigh
When I must breathe my last breath inside
Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord

Oh Lord, my friends have gathered 'round
They're watching me slowly, slowly sinking down
Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord

Now Lord, now Lord, now Jesus time have come
When I'm a leave my earthly home
Friends standing around, tear in the eyes

They know that I am about to die
But I'm not worried, I'm not afraid
I know you do, Jesus, just what You say

[?]
You be with me Lord, day and night
I'm not afraid, I said I'm dying, don't leave me now

Oh Lord, I know you'll stand by me
When I'm in trouble, when I'm in misery
And Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord
Oh oh Lord, I know You'll stand by Your word
Whenever I call You, I know You have already heard
Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord

Now Lord, I said farewell, fare thee well
Fare thee well to my friends down here
I got loved ones waiting for me up there

Oh Lord, others are waiting for me
What a reunion, I know that will be
Lord, in my dying hour, stay with me, Lord
Ah, you build me up, build me up and
Just to let me down, let me down and
Then you fill my cup, fill my cup and
Turn my love around, all around

Why do you take me where my love can't go?
Why do you make me love you more and more?
I don't have the Eiffel tower, silver or gold
But my love for you, and my love for you
Is the greatest story ever told

Don't have the Eiffel tower, anything might die
Well, I love you, um, love you and that will survive

Why do you have to start, have to start that
Just to break my heart, break my heart, oh?
Tear it all apart, all apart and
Then you let it stop, let it stop

I can't stand it, baby, you, you move me so
And my love gets started, it goes and goes and goes and
This is not a dream and what love ought to make
Sometimes you just can see (Incomprehensible)
Don't have the Eiffel Tower or silver or gold
But my love for you, and my love for you
Is worth more and more and more

I want to stay this time
I, oh, wanna make you mine
And now, yeah, want to stay this time, yeah
I wanna make you mine

And I love you, baby, I

[Verse 1]
Since I met you, baby (You, baby)
My life, my life has changed
My heart has filled with love (Love, baby)
'Cause you made me a brand new man

[Bridge]
But I'm missin' you so, I can't let you
It's all in my heart, it can't fall apart
Lovin' you, you know it's true
That I love, I'm loving you, hey

[Verse 2]
Your love, our love will never die (Never die)
If it does, I will cry
'Cause you showed me, yes you did, so much love to give (Love, baby)
Talk about will to live, is this love for real?

[Chorus]
So real that it's all in my heart, I'm hooked on you, baby
It can't fall apart, I'm hooked on you, baby
I've been loving you, you know it's true
And I'm hooked on you, baby (Hooked on you)

[Outro]
You don't know, I'm hooked on you, baby?
Don't stay too long, I'm hooked on you baby
I've been loving you, and you know it, too
That I'm hooked on you (Hooked on you)
Hey hey, it's all in my heart, I'm hooked on you, baby
Don't fall apart, I'm hooked on you, baby
Just from loving you, I've been proud that it's true
That I'm hooked on you (Hooked on you)
Yeah, oh, oh, baby

[Verse 1]
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this world keeps on turning, yeah
Let's just be glad we had this time to spend together
There is no need to watch the bridges that we're burning

[Chorus]
Lay your head (lay your head) upon my pillow, sweet baby
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops rolling softly
Against my window, yeah, oh, late at night
Make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
For the good times

[Verse 2]
I'll get along, and I'm sure you'll find another
But baby please remember
I'll be here (I'll be here), I'm gonna stay right here
If you should find you ever need me, yeah
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever and ever and ever and ever
There'll be time enough for severance when you leave me, yeah
For the good times, yeah
For the good times

[Chorus]
Lay your head (lay your head) upon my pillow
Oh, just this one time, girl, one time
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine, yeah, oh baby
Won't you hear the whisper, hear the whisper
Of the raindrops, of the raindrops, rolling softly, softly against my window
All you gotta do is make believe
All you gotta do is make believe you love me one more time
For the good times, yeah baby
For the good times
And here's what you oughta do is
Lay your head upon my pillow
I just wanna hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Love
What about the things you want?
What about the things you need
Versus the things you don't have?
You should have
All of this world's desires
All of this world's entire
Bounty and beautiful love
Chorus
The stars and the moon
And the birds soar real soon
You should have
All the things that you need
Give it everything
All the world to bring
If you believe in something
You go to give it everything
Love
There's no time to waste
There's no life to take
Believers don't have to make haste
Oh no, but "I love you"
Are more than just some sweet words
"I love you"
Are the sweetest words I ever heard
One thing about I can't explain
That you are the world to me
When you're sure you love me
Show you love tenderly
Chorus
Why should settle for second best
When you haven't tasted all the rest
Listen to me
Listen to my request
You should have all the things you want
The things you need
All of the things your mind can conceive
Chorus

[Verse 1]
Standing by the highway
Just waiting in the rain
Standing by the highway
Just waiting in the rain
Although the sun is shining
These tears, they cause me pain
Oh, it seems we make up
Only just to break up, oh, baby

[Chorus]
And that ain't no fun to me
I said it ain't no fun to me

[Verse 2]
Leaving you, it sure ain't no fun to me, baby
I said leaving you sure ain't no fun to me, baby
Plus I believe in you
And I like what you to do me, baby, oh-oh
You make me feel like a brand new man
Oh, baby, another thing I'd like to say
I'll take the love and affection
Wherever I can, baby

[Chorus]
Now that seems fun to me
Won't you help me see it?
That's so fun to me, baby

[Outro]
You got me standing here waiting
You got me standing here waiting, see
I really, really, I don't mind waiting
But it ain't no fun to me, I want you— I want you to know
It ain't no fun to me, baby
Sometimes I have to sit down
I think about it, yeah
Just sit down, uh-huh, think about it
It ain't no fun to me, baby
Said it ain't no fun to me, baby
Sometimes I feel like leaving you, baby
I don't mind leaving you, baby
But it ain't no fun to me, no, no, no
No, it ain't no fun to me
Oh, sweet baby, you got me walking in my shoes, uh

[Verse 1]
Lately when I look into your eyes, I realize
You're the only one I need in my life
Baby, I just don't know how to describe
How lovely you make me feel inside

[Chorus]
You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz
You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz

[Verse 2]
It seemed like the likely thing
From the start you told me
I would be your queen
But never had I imagined such a feeling
Joy is what you bring
I want to give you everything

[Chorus]
You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz
You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz

Butterflies, butterflies...

[Chorus]
You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz
You give me butterflyz
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflyz

[Outro]
You give me something I just can't deny
Something that's so real
I just can't control the way I feel inside of me
You give me something I just can't deny
Something that's so real
I just can't control the way I feel inside of me

[Verse 1]
You made me see the good in loving me
Then you turn around and shamed my name
And all I can say is la-la-la
For you, baby (Good for you), listen here
It's for sure that I'm a man
Take the bread out of my hand
Now you wanna know how strong I am, all I can say is
La, la, la, la, for you, baby (Yeah)
What's the use of giving out (Giving out) giving in? (Giving in)
It's just as bad as sin
Now you tryna be, you wanna be my friend, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I'm gonna love you anyway, no matter what my friends say
Ooh, baby, come what may, oh, yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la (La)

[Intro]
Highway to Heaven
Highway to Heaven

[Refrain]
Well, it's a Highway to Heaven
Well, it's a highway
Well, it's a Highway to Heaven
Walking up the King's highway
Well, it's a Highway to Heaven
Walking up the King's highway
Well, it's a Highway to Heaven
Oh, oh, walking up the King's highway, highway
Highway to Heaven
And when I'm walking, stop all the talking
We are walking up the King's highway, highway
Highway to Heaven
Angels beside us and God's gonna guide us
We're walking up the King's highway, highway
Highway to Heaven
Walking up the King's highway
I got to say that it's a Highway to Heaven
Walking up the King's highway

[Outro]
Well, it's a Highway to Heaven
Walking up the King's highway

Oh, if it's sunshine or stormy weather
Walking up the King's highway

[Spoken Intro]
Here I am, here we are
As it will go on forever
Noise, always noise
Candles burn, lights are low
I haven't a place to go
Life in its constant state of moving nowhere
The music is nice, floats through the air
Sounds of waves crashing everywhere
Percussive submissions, mind conditions
Writing with the left hand
Unknowing and taking the chance
Why not fly? Why not try?
This constant game I play to stay high
But all is just a state of mind
All is reality of your choice
Constant evolution, constant adaptation
Constant state of moving nowhere
Footsteps, silence is loud
Kindness is brave, wisdom is long
Loving is necessary, I need it, we need it
Searching, looking for the satisfaction
It is nowhere, it is everywhere
Preaching, pleading, praying for God to come
What are we waiting for?
Why are we so afraid of taking charge?
But it's always changing, always
In the constant state of going nowhere
We all have demons to battle, roads to walk
Crosses to bear, mistakes and sins
Candles and their steady glow
Water and its constant crash
Endless horizon, rocks of times long gone
Still strong, still here, and so are we
Here we are, forever
The constant state of going nowhere
The constant state of going nowhere
Constant state of going nowhere
Con-con-constant state of moving nowhere
Constant state of moving nowhere
It's like a jungle
It's like a jungle

[Verse 1]
It's like a jungle out here, so much struggle out here
And my dreams steal my rest, sleep's the cousin of death
Always feels like a race against father time
In the streets of New York
All I see is street hoes, and bullet holes in my people
Only crime fills the brain, feels like I'm going insane
The revolution has to start, don't waste no time
In the streets of New York
Uh, uh, uh, yeah

[Chorus]
New York, New York, New York, New York, New York City
(Where we at, where we at, huh?)
New York, New York, New York, New York, New York City
(New York)
New York, New York, New York, New York, New York City
(Oh oh oh)
New York, New York, New York, New York, New York City
(Come on, come on, we just)

[Bridge]
Livin' in the city
Livin' in the city
(New York)
New York, New York City
(New York)
Livin' in the city
Livin' in the city
(In the city)
Livin' in the city
New York, New York City
Livin' in the city
(Come on now)
Livin' in the city
(Come on now)
Livin' in the city
(Where we at now?)
New York, New York City
(New York)
Livin' in the city
Livin' in the city

[Outro dialogue: Alicia Keys & Adam Levine]
Yeah, yeah, New York City
Thank you
Feels so appropriate
So, so appropriate
I'm gonna bring out a very special young gentleman who's going to sing with me
It's a very special song
I wanna bring out Adam Levine of Maroon 5, ladies and gentlemen
Yeah
Beautiful
I just wanna say, doesn't she look and sound perfect this evening?
Tryna melt my heart, look at that, thank you
We're gonna sing a beautiful song by the name of "Wild Horses"
We love this song
Ah, shall we?

[Verse 1]
I can love you ten thousand years, oh baby
I'd still feel the same, life's been fulfilled, oh baby
I'll have to keep on forever loving you, oh baby
Makes no matter what, what you say or do, oh

[Chorus]
If I had to do it all over
If I had to do it all over
I'd like to do it all over
I'd still choose you
I'd still choose you

[Verse 2]
I know it's gonna take some time, oh baby
Before I can make your sweet love mine, oh baby
I'll put the ring back on your finger, oh baby
You got my eye, I'll never linger, and oh

[Chorus]
If I had to do it all over
I'd like to do it all over
I'd like to do it all over
And I would still choose you

[Bridge]
Oh, every flower I pick, dear darling
Would be roses all around
We go through life's ups and downs
Until your love hits the ground

[Verse 3]
Oh, I know it's gonna take some time, oh baby
I know it's all, it's all a state of mind, oh baby
I still trust you, I grow in you
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
I, I'd hold you, until the time sake, forever

[Chorus]
If I had to do it all over
I would do it all over
Find out you're gonna do it all over
I would still choose you

[Outro]
Do it all over
Let me do it
Do it all over
Do it all over
And I would still choose you, oh
Do it all over
I wouldn't change it
Do it all over
I'm gonna do it
Do it all over
And I would still choose you
I love you, lady
Do it all over
Do it all over
Do it all over
Oh oh, I'd still choose you, oh baby

[Verse 1]
Don't let this world mislead you
Don't you ever go astray
Trust in God's word and believe it 'cause it'll never pass away
We will see Him in his glory riding on the clouds of joy
Greeting us with open arms and peace forevermore

[Chorus]
I know that everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back
Like He said He would
Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good

[Verse 2]
Now when the sky is darkened
There will be no moonlight
We'll know the time has finally come
And He'll change the wrong to right
So if you're always searching
Trying to find the bottom line
Just give your love and life to God
He'll give you a peace of mind

[Chorus]
I know that everything gonna be alright
He's coming back
Like He said He would
I said yeah, yeah, it's gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good
Play it
Everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back
Just like He said He would
Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good

[Bridge]
I wanna be ready, I gotta be ready
I wanna be ready, gotta be ready
For the peace, love and happiness
He's coming back like He said He would
Get ready for peace, love and happiness
He's coming back for the true and good

[Verse 3]
We know He's the beginning and we know that He is the end
There's no one better if you really need a friend
So don't you ever worry 'cause He gave the guarantee
That He'll return to take us home and fulfill the prophecy

[Chorus]
I know that everything is gonna be alright
He's coming back, like He said He would
Get ready for peace, love and happiness
I know He's coming back just like He said he would
Peace and love and happiness
I know He's coming back for the true and good
Everything gonna be alright
He's coming back
Like He said He would
Yeah yeah, it's gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good

[Verse 1]
Came across a picture of us today
Reminded me of how we used to play
And all of my kiss blew in the wind
Felt like those days would never end

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the hardest thing to learn
You were never really gone away
And I'll see you again
I'll see you again some day

[Chorus]
When I climb the stairs
And meet you there
'Cause love don't go nowhere
And you will see me
March up each step 'til I reach
Heaven's door
Can't wait to see your face
Save me a place
Your love can't be replaced
And you will see me
March up each step 'til I reach
Heaven's door
Heaven's door

[Verse 2]
Feel your warm hands against my face
Show me how you love me always every day
Never to tired to fix up a meal
Never to tired just to make me feel better
These memories will live with me forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the hardest thing to learn
You were never really gone away
And I'll see you again
I'll see you again some day

[Chorus]
When I climb the stairs
And meet you there
'Cause love don't go nowhere
And you will see me
March up each step 'til I reach
Heaven's door
Can't wait to see your face
Save me a place
Your love will never be replaced
And you will see me
March up each step 'til I reach
Heaven's door

[Outro]

Everybody say whoa whoa whoa oh

Everybody say whoa whoa whoa oh

[Verse 1]
Dream that there will come a day
Dream that the Lord will make her wake
Dream, dream, dream

Wake up early and
Dream the stars down from the sky
Dream without knowing the reason why
Just dream, just dream, oh dream

Long before I noticed love is real, yes
Say something
Don't sit there, say nothing

I will try to explain it to you
It's glory, Alleluia, this love is real
Won't you please clap your hands?
Please, say amen

'Cause love is so high, you can't get over
You're lucky to find a holy clover
Give it a try, you can't get 'round it
You'll reach the sky, you're only grounded

I will try to break it down, release it to be found
This love is real, yeah
Won't you clap your hands?
Somebody say, amen

Hey, we can fill it up
And feel our love then come to us
Love is real, yeah, say it aloud
Sit down, say nothing
Trying to be real, not trying to fool ya
Don't know it all, just trying to school ya
This common love, you won't get by now
But this kind of love you'll find in the sky

We can feel it up
And feel our love encounters love is real
Say something
Don't sit down say nothing, no

These feelings make you wanna want some
Feeling make you wanna want some
Hey, makes you clap your hands, son
Makes you clap your hands, son

I wish I could have
Something to say this evening
I gotta have
Something to say this evening

I'd say one Sunday evening
Somebody came knocking at my door
Knocking at my door, open the door and let him in
Was a feeling, oh, oh, feeling, hey

Make me wanna want some
Make me wanna want some
Make me wanna want some
Make me lost, ah, just a squeeze
Oh, mug around the house
Talking about going someplace
One thing about it I never heard mama
Talk about going to Chicago too much

I might even go into New York city
But never had an idea
That I wanna go to heaven
And I wanna go to heaven

I wanna go, I feel pretty good
I wanna go to 

[Incomprehensible]
I feel pretty good, yeah

That's a note
Hey, this love is real, this love is real

So real, so real, so real
Love is real, this love is real, yes, it's real

Could I be the one?

Could I be the one that you're thinking of
My goal is to be the one you're dreaming of
I wanna be your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
Trust me and I'll never let you down

Let me be with you through all your hard times
I wanna be around when the chips are down
It'll be me and you, against the opposition
Can't you see our love shinning through?

You've been there to solve all of my problems
You've been there to help me solve them
I don't know what, I don't know what to do
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(Could I be the one?)
Trust me with your dreams, I'll make them all come true
For the rest of my life, I'll be grateful to you
Time will pass, our love will last
I'll spend my life cherishing you
(Let me be the one)
Let me be the one in your life at the end of the rainbow
(Let me be the one)
Let me be the one that you love so
Late at night, the time is right
I wanna be the one you say is out of sight

But somewhere in your mind
You're always right on time

I'm so glad that I'm free, yeah
Lord above would have blessed it on me
I don't mind, won't you let it shine?
Please be kind and let it shine, shine, shine

Well, I know the words to say
Gimme my daily bread, yeah

Always sleep, they're wise yeah

Now I know that you're fooling me
Can't take life so seriously
Broke my heart one hundred times
Now I want to let it shine, shine, yeah

Eh, I know a star that shine
Is somewhere in your eyes
You're always right on time, yeah
Yeah, won't you let it shine?
I know that you're fooling me
Can't take life so seriously
Broke my heart one hundred times
Now I want to let it shine, shine, shine, yeah, yeah

Sanctify feelings, let it shine
Tales all my in my mind, yeah
Take me forth and let it shine, yeah
Take me forth and let it shine
I moved your picture
From my walls
And i replaced them
Both large and small
And each new day
Finds me so blue
Nothing
Takes the place of you

I read your letters one by one
And i still love you
When it's all said and done
And oh, my darling, i'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh nothing
Takes the place of you

I, i write this letter
It's raining on my window pane
I, i feel the need of you
Because without you
Nothing seems the same
So i'll wait
Until you're home
Again i love you
But i'm all alone
And oh my darling
I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh, but nothing takes the place of you

[Verse 1]
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time

[Pre-Chorus]
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?

[Chorus]
I need your love, I need your love
Godspeed, your love to me
Speed your love to me, speed your love to me

[Bridge]
Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
I just had to tell you that
Lonely rivers sigh, wait for me, wait for me
I'll be comin' home, wait for me
Please, baby, let me say

[Pre-Chorus]
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?

[Chorus]
I need your love, I'm not ashamed to say that I need your love
Godspeed, your love to, to me
Speed your love to me
Won't you speed your love to me
Speed your love to me

[Outro]
Unchained melody
Speed your love to me
Speed your love to me, speed your love to me
Speed your love to me
Oh yeah, speed your love to me
Speed your love to me
Speed your love, your love, your love, your love
Speed your love to me
Speed your love to me, all of your love
Speed your love to me
I'm feeling you, baby
You're under my skin
I'm hoping that maybe you can let me in
I wanna hear you say it "I like you too"
I'll do what I can do to get close to you

'Cause I... feel life when you're right here next to me
And I... feel right, baby, I can hardly breathe

I, I need you now

I need you now

I'm feeling you, baby
You're under my skin
I'm hoping that maybe you can let me in
I wanna hear you say it "I like you too"
I'll do what I can do to get close to you

'Cause I... feel life when you're right here next to me
And I... feel right, baby, I can hardly breathe
I Need you now
Sit right down and talk to me
About how you want to be
You ought to be with me
Yeah, you ought to be with me

Thinking 'bout what people do
Talking 'bout how I love you
Thinking there's nothing to what they say
You're going to be with me anyway

They don't want to see us do
All of the things we want to
You ought to be with me
Hey, you ought to be with me

You don't have to waste my time
If you want to be a friend of mine
You can leave me now and walk away
And turn your back for another day
Oh baby, yeah yeah
Ought to be the kind of girl
That can brighten this old world
And it's hard to see why you and me
Can't be together happily

I'm trying to realize
You being with some other guy
I don't know the reason why
You oughta be with me until I die
Hey, you ought to be with me until I die

I don't want to waste my time
If you want to be a friend of mine
I wanna hold you tight, love you right
Put good feeling in your night

[Verse 1]
This is the point of no return
'Cause this is where we crash and burn
And now every time I face this pain
I can hear it coming back again
It's the sound of letting go

[Chorus]
It's the sound of letting go
It's the sound of letting go
It's the sound of letting go
It's the sound of letting go

[Verse 2]
Breaking up and breaking down
This is what we've come to now
What's the use? We can't deny
Can't you hear it?
It's the sound of letting go

[Verse 3]
We could go around all day
Fine excuses we can say
In the silence I can hear
Can't you feel it?
It's the sound of letting go

[Bridge]
It's getting louder and louder
What we gonna do?
It's getting louder and louder
Fillin' up the room
I can hear it hear it
Comin' over us
I can hear it tellin' me that we had enough
It's getting louder and louder
What we gonna do?
It's getting louder and louder
Fillin' up the room
I can hear it hear it
Comin' over us

[Chorus 2]
It's the sound of letting go
I know you can hear it
It's the sound of letting go
I know we can't deceive it
I know you can hear it
It's the sound of letting go
I know we can't deceive it
It's the sound of letting go

[Verse 4]
I can't let it break me down
This is what we've come to now
What's the use? We can't deny (Can't you hear it?)
It's the sound of letting go
Every time I face this pain
I hear it coming back again
And I've been calling out your name (Can't you hear it?)
It's the sound of letting go

[Breakdown]
I can hear it
I can hear it
I can hear it

[Outro]
It's the sound of letting go
I can hear it
I can hear it
It's the sound of letting go
I can hear it
I can hear it
It's the sound of letting go
She don't care, 'bout education

When he can buy, his satisfaction

Chorus:

Get diamonds, and celebrity
Big payments, or die tryin'

[Verse 1]
I can't believe that it's real
The way that you make me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is you and me, baby
That make the world go round
And if keeping you and loving you means
Laying all my troubles down

[Chorus]
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, won't you come and take me
Take me by the hand, yeah
Show me
Here I am, baby

[Verse 2]
It always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
A love that I cannot have
You broke my heart into half

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is you and me, baby
That make the world go 'round
Keeping you and loving you means
Laying all my troubles down

[Chorus]
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, won't you come and take me
Take me by the hand, yeah
Squeeze it
Here I am, baby

[Bridge]
When I'm down I can always call you
For a helping hand
I know you'll do the best you can
But it don't take much for me
Before my cup runs over
All this love's inside of me
I believe there's going to be an explosion, yeah
You can talk to me, oh baby
I'm in no hurry
Tell me all your troubles
And you won't ever have to worry, no
And one more thing
You just can't trust everybody
Everybody you see, no no
You'll find yourself lost and alone
On a darkened street

[Chorus]
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, would you come and take me
Take me by the hand
Show me, hey hey
Take me, hey hey
Show me, won't you?
Here I am, baby, hey hey
Take me, won't you?
Teach me
Baby, won't you take me by the hand?
Teach me
Here I am, baby

Look at me, I don't know what to do
This chemistry is off the radar
Baby, let me see you later

[Chorus]
Over and over, you run in my mind
Give me one look and I know

And the way you touch, me
It's the way you love, me

[Bridge]
Baby, it's simple to see (Baby, it's simple)

You're making me start all over (You're making me start all over)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You was a pretty little thing sittin' all alone
And that's a no, no

Our conversation got you feelin' real comfortable
You don't want me to go

So now you want to flex
And to show the club who you're with
And I wanna watch you move all night long

Are you ready
To take
Your first slide
Cut the ribbon
Off the whip
Put the key in

Let's ride
From coast to coast
Hit a nice lounge

Have a toast baby
On this special day

We're gonna celebrate
My baby's birthday

[Kurupt]
A xxxxx is a bitch, whether she poor or rich
She still gettin a gang of dicks
It don't matter what you do or say
Cause xxxxx you can't change my feelings no way
I been across the whole U.S.A
Same ol' hoes on different days
Just ask my big homeboy Snoop de Snoop
Xxxxx you ain't cute, with all that (woop de woop)
I might just rock ya, I ain't afraid to blast
I might rock a fella like Dame and dash
Grip the heater and slap your ass
Xxxx it back, automatic clap your ass
Now this is how a gangster mash out
The homies in the Coupe, me and Snoop in the glass house
Bouncin (bouncin) bouncin (swervin)
Blaze up a whole ounce and get the ramen with the cotton candy

Chorus: Snoop
Yeah, and all my niggas say... ride, ride on
Yeah, and all the honies say... ride on
Yeah, and all the xxxxxxx say... ride on
Yeah, and all the robbers say... ride on (can't get caught up)
(repeat 2X except last line)

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
I'm out to paper count the paper bump some xxxxxxx and move
I take a trip with my click on a three day cruise
Spank the corner in the fo', sittin low gettin low
Now we headed to the sto' in the fo', hoes holler
Top dollar with the gold flea collar
Dippin in my blue Impala
They say Snoop Dogg is a fool, cause he got the bitches
And the little homey sellin weed up outta high school
I never ever break the law, I just bend it
Keep everything splendid, that's how I intend it
Class is in session, you might get suspended (shhhh)
If you don't shut the xxxx UP and listen for a minute
I been in it for life, with two kids and a wife
With no tattooes just stress and stripes, so
I'ma do what I feel and do what I like
But I won't go to sleep without my heater at night (ride on)
Chorus

[Kurupt]
Nigga gimme erything you got, from your hat
To your contacts, t-shirt to your socks
Dogg Pound affiliate? Hell naw nigga
Certified branded Cedar Paul nigga
Mashin, grey and, blue all day
All night all heated with heaters, mac-11's
Nine millimeters, whattup Big Nate
I got a xxxxx that gobble up dicks like steak
She lives upstate, and I don't think
Near a one of those xxxxxxx is proper, stash the chopper
DPology (DPG) but first call Snoop
Whattup big homey niggas with the swoop
The homey jumps in whips out the four pound
When we get there, we shakin all xxxxxxxxxxxx down
It's what I had in mind, let's get paid
Hit the spot just like a raid one of the homies got a gauge
Come on
Chorus

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Let me holler at y'all for a minute man
I mean this game is gettin real deep
We got niggas that be misrepresentin
I mean, xxxxxxxxxxxxx you know thinkin that DPG
Is a motherfuckin football game or a football team or somethin
Niggas walkin on and xxxx like they free agents
And just leavin when they want to
Nigga this ain't no game, this is a motherfuckin way of life
DPGC, Dogg Pound Gangsta... nigga!
The xxxx wrong with these niggas man?
Niggas be straight tryin to put they little twist down (holla at em)
But you know we tryin to stay two steps ahead of the game baby, y'know?
Let me holler at y'all for a minute, especially YOU
You done stepped in some Dogg Shit, check your shoes
Nigga this ain't Hollywood, the House of Blues
It's the Dogg House, so regroup your troops
And tell em... it's Kurupt and Snoop
Xxxx your crew it's on I take your Brome
It's Don Corleone in the Chronic zone
I turn your dubs into nickels, while I'm chillin
I melt your rhymes into icicles, while I'm killin
Sell em, I tell em, Kurupt, what's up
I know you feel like, givin it up
We can't stop, won't stop, what foe
Cause every other day another nigga tryin to pull a dulo
You know, when I was xxxxxx with the hood
It was all bad, thought it was all good
A nigga had to take a breather
Now I'm Living Single, like Khadijah, cause they'll squeeze ya
Xxxx a feeding fish, I put my dick in your bitch
And make a wish, ha hah
Nigga that's gangsta shit, with the gangsta twist
Yeah, Dogg Pound gangsta...

[Intro]
Now that the love is gone

[Chorus 1]
What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone

What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone

[Chorus 2]
There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that love is gone (Love is gone)

[Post-Chorus]
Now that the love is gone
The love felt so right, so wrong
Now that the love is gone
I feel so hurt inside
Feel so hurt inside
Got to find a reason

[Chorus 1]
What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone

There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that love, now that the love (Now that the love is gone)
Love is gone

[Post-Chorus]
Got to find a reason, got to find a reason
Got to find a reason, got to find a reason
Got to find a reason to hold on

[Bridge]
Love
There's nothing left for us to say
Love
Why can't we turn and walk away

[Chorus]
What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through (Now that the love)
When everything that felt so right is wrong (Now that the love)
Now that the love is gone (Now that the love's gone, oh)

There is nothing left to prove
No use to deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that love, now that the love (Now that the love is gone)
Now that love is gone (Love is gone)

What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong (Yeah)
Now that love, now that the love (Now that the love is gone)
Love is gone
Oh yeah, they tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there

Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
You got me sayin'

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, go, little bad girl

Oh yeah, they tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there
Shaking her ass from the left to the right
Moving it 'round just the way that I like
I wanna see it move like a movie on flight
She got it how I want it and I want it all night

Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
You got me sayin'

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, go, little bad girl

She got my heart jumpin'
And my adrenaline pumpin' and gunnin'
Like ain't nobody ever seen
As a matter of fact I've seen this woman all up in my dreams

Whippin' and flippin' and stackin' and slappin'
I'm attacking after she back it up and make it drop
After I met her, I tell her David Guetta is on the track
Baby girl don't stop
Keep it going, you never know
When somebody gonna throw couple dollars
Got a pocket full of hundred dollars bills
Ludacris, Mr. Make-A-Woman-Holla, sing

And every night on the floor putting on a show
Everybody in the club
There's a little something you should know

Look at her go on the dance floor
She's amazing on the dance floor
When she moves, girl, I want more
Keep it going, girl, like I got an encore
You got me sayin'

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, go, little bad girl

Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, little bad girl
Go, little bad girl, go, little bad girl

[Verse 1]
Do 100 on the freeway
With no seatbelt on tryna get away
But I keep going back to love
Even when you ain't next to me
You're the only one still in my memory
It's like my heart won't let up
So baby here I am

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm on my way, I'm on my way oh
I'm on my way, girl to your arms
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Girl to your arms
And all I want is you

[Chorus:]
When I miss my baby
I can barely breathe
Do it all, I want you next to me
'Cus you're love's like ecstasy
Girl I want you closer
It's the only drug I need
Even your doctor said to stay away
But you're love like ecstasy
Oh no, your love like ecstasy
Oh no, your love like ecstasy

Even when you ain't right at times
Girl you still find a way to stay on my mind
It's like with you I can't wait at all
Ooh no

If loving you was a dead crime
I'd be locked up, doing 20 to life
So much emotions build inside
So baby here I am

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm on my way, I'm on my way oh
I'm on my way, girl to your arms
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Girl to your arms
And all I want is you

[Chorus:]
When I miss my baby
I can barely breathe
Do it all, I want you next to me
'Cus you're love's like ecstasy
Girl I want you closer
It's the only drug I need
Even your doctor said to stay away
But you're love like ecstasy
Ever since a boy I gotta have a steady Shawty
If I could roll up your love I'd smoke all day
And I'll never get dry like the supply
Girl you got me
I need a hit of you so I can start my day
I'm an addict, we handcut it certainly
And I don't care what the haters say
'Cus...

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm on my way, I'm on my way oh
I'm on my way, girl to your arms
Your love, your love, your love, your love
Girl to your arms
And all I want is you

[Chorus:] 

[x2]
When I miss my baby
I can barely breathe
Do it all, I want you next to me
'Cus you're love's like ecstasy
Girl I want you closer
It's the only drug I need
Even your doctor said to stay away
But you're love like ecstasy
Oh no, your love like ecstasy
Oh no, your love like ecstasy

[Intro: Sean Kingston & J.R. Rotem]
I go by the name Kisean Anderson
Born on 2.3.90
And I must say, my life, I've been through a lot
It hasn't been an easy road for me
But one day, Myspace made history
Hooked up with big homie on the west, J.R.
Introducing Sean Kingston
You think you really know?
(Laughs) But you have no idea
It felt great when I met ya, something to remember
Body lookin right, cool like in december
We should take a flight, when wherever
'Cause your eyes take me away

You're like a angel in the sky, you got wings
When you arrive it's like a midnight dream
And I can't lie, you got that tease
And shorty please don't walk away yea
Let's go!

Girl you kiss upon the girls is say
Diamond in the rough, your smile takes me away
So many girls, it's hard for me to choose
No matter where you go I'm stuck on you

Oh it's so hard to look away
'Cause you're no ordinary girl
She got that thing, you can't deny

Something 'bout your aura says
That you're no ordinary girl
Exceptional, one of a kind
And when we wake up in the morning and we look outside
It was the same every day after you walked by
She ain't an ordinary girl, not an ordinary girl

Girl you are the one, I can't tell by over
Girl, you shine bright, brighter than my nightlight
It's magical, the way you make me feel inside
Can't let you go, no matter all I try you stay on my mind
I can hold your hands and you can hold mine

Now we can rock until the morning light
If I could I would change back the hands of time
That we can do everything so right

I'm just a thought away for you, babe
I know we had our ups and downs
But we say it gets crazy
But trust me girl, you can always count on me

'Cause my love, my love, your love, your love
Our love, our love, our love is magical
'Cause my love, my love and your love, your love
And our love, our love, our love is magical, girl

Here we go on a roller coaster to paradise
So let me know what it's gonna take for me to free your mind
Tell 'em who's your man, 3 karats on your hand
Introduce you to a brand new life
They don't understand how we can make it last
We don't care 'cause everything's fine

I'm just a thought away for you, babe
I know we had our ups and downs but we say
It gets crazy
But trust me girl, you can always count on me

'Cause my love, my love, your love, your love
Our love, our love, our love is magical
'Cause my love, my love and your love, your love
And our love, our love, our love is magical girl

Say we don't care how you feel, feel
Our love is magical for real, real
Say we don't care how you feel, oh no, oh no

Say we don't care how you feel, feel
Our love is magical for real, real
Say we don't care how you feel, oh no, oh no

'Cause my love, my love, your love, your love
Our love, our love, our love is magical
'Cause my love, my love and your love, your love
And our love, our love, our love is magical, girl
Everybody say, now can we all say, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Julie McKnight]
After tonight, there'll be no coming home soon
No tears of regret, no smell of her perfume
No more dancing feet, to the beats that go boom
While I watch the sunrise all alone in my room

[Verse 2: Julie McKnight]
Tonight, there'll be no pouring rain
No eyes wide shut to your never ending game
After tonight, there'll be no me and you
No distant memories past for me to hold on to

[Chorus: Julie McKnight]
See, everybody's working to hold on to what they know
So I guess I kept believing my tonight will never go
Some spend a lifetime searchin', trying to figure out
When hell stops and Heaven begins
How soon is now?
How soon is now?

See it started 'round December when we first talked
But then I knew you was fake from the start
Sayin' that you love me, playin' with my heart
Actin' like you cared, just to be around a star
(But oh no)

Me shoulda knew when you take me to the mall
Smilin' at my face but you're buying up a storm
Now I regret it, should I listen to my mom?
To my mom, whoa

Everything good must come to a stop
You played with my head
Now you're 'bout to get dropped
Gimme my ring, gimme my watch and go

So girl, it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over and I don't wanna see your face again, again

So girl it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over and I don't wanna see your face again, again
So girl it's over
Talkin' on the phone like everyday
Sendin' me messages, "Hey baby"
Tellin' me you want me to meet your family
When you really, you just tryin' to go to the Grammys
(Well, oh no)

I shoulda knew you wasn't for me
You didn't like me, you liked by Bentley
All them stories were shady
But baby, don't worry 'cause

Everything good must come to a stop
You played with my head
Now you're 'bout to get dropped
Gimme my ring, gimme my watch and go

So girl it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over, and I don't wanna see your face again, again

So girl it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over, and I don't wanna see your face again, again

Ever since she walked through that door
She left my heart on the floor
And I can't take this no more
I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna see her again
Ever since she walked through that door
She left my heart on the floor
And I can't take this no more
I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna see her again

So girl, just pack your bags and leave my crib
Girl, stop talkin', I'm tired of this
All this fussing, all this fighting tonight

So girl, it's over, O V E R
Over, you tried to come up on a star
Over and I don't wanna see your face again, again
So girl, it's over, hey, so girl, it's over

Not here to pop nobody, not here for no gun play
So flat I got it 'cause the money not tatty

And I mac everybody run away the fly, They godless where they from

[Chorus]
All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life, and it all changed in one day
All my life, it's the moment I been waiting on
All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life, and it all changed in one day
All my life, it's the moment I been waiting on

[Verse 1]
The hood never caused but they all was hard
His kind never represented love at all
Purple hearts in the hood, them ghetto scars
Where every time I see my daddy it was just a mirage
Now my mammy need a mechanic when the car wouldn't start
I couldn't understand it, even told it to god
Now my family in jeans, headed straight to the top
Access granted with this empty can of starch
No not the
Yellow tape was the moon every night on the block
Surrounded by the stars them dirty cars
Dreadlocks in the grill try to camouflage
Gotta make it out for real for I be at large
I wrote XXL in the view of my squad
Got a record on the shelf they say I'm good at the mall
Gotta learn to help myself no sugar to borrow
'Cause...

[Chorus]
All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life, and it all changed in one day
All my life, it's the moment I been waiting on
All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life, and it all changed in one day
All my life, it's the moment I been waiting on

[Verse 2]
A four course meal every first of the month
Everybody in the projects family home
Don't know you till the DJ like I want some
But before thanksgiving, was a catholic nun
Crabs in the bucket dirty eleven to one
Without the struggle probably never woulda heard of lebron
Try and juggle in the casket with ya sister lavonne
Suicide, live lavish at the tip of my tongue
Only thing come to ratchet was the twenty-third song
Yeah, it coulda been tragic for the boy from the scums
Yeah, he got the craftmatic no rest till I won
Life took a stab at him couldn't punch him alone
Born near the savages kinda made me numb
Two doors from where the dope boi magic was slung
It was real not a fancy, they'd kill ya for crumbs
Only reason why I rap, keep from being a bum
'Cause...

[Chorus]
All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life, and it all changed in one day
All my life, it's the moment I been waiting on
All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life, and it all changed in one day
All my life, it's the moment I been waiting on

[Bridge]
Sitting here, reminiscing
Of all the nights I had to grind
Taking chances with the system
I put my whole life on the line

[Chorus]
All my life, know it ain't been sweet
All my life, I been in the streets
All my life, up against concrete
All my life, mama gave me the speech
All my life, somebody died every week
All my life, ducking the police
All my life, without soda I weeped
All my life, no first class seats
All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life, and it all changed in one day
All my life, it's the moment I been waiting on
All my life, had to hustle just to make a way
All my life, riding dirty on the highway
All my life. and it all changed in one day
All my life, it's the moment I been waiting on

Sugar

Flo Rida
Hey, I've got a mouth full of cavities
Sweet tooth, full of mama, like sugar to me
So my love with the lips, put a bug in the ear tone
Shawty gotta kiss, it's an emergency
Spit sprung for the taste, addicted to her gloss
Won't smile this way, baby I rub it off
Put my tongue in your face
A little mistletoe, sippin' Grand Marnier
I’m a fan all day
Do me that favor, cuz I like your flavor
My manage behavior; I'm into your major
Sweeter so flavor, that's good for this player
My hood, now and later, throw back like a pager
Pretty much, you're givin' me a sugar rush
Lil mama, give me high blood pressure when you blush
Lips feel soft as a feather when we touch, Shawty that's what's up
(Chorus)
Flo Rida
Hey, Sh Shawty would you mind, cuz I want me some
Now and later, I don't wanna have to wait, you the one
Yep yep, you're vicious, so so delicious
Can't help my interest, candy addiction
Wanna peace, to a piece gotta get a piece
I don't know a piece, Give me all your sweets
Bottom and top lip, bout to have a sugar feast
Level with our trip, I’m a lip bitin' beast
Smile for them things, all 42 teeth
Squeeze the sugar cane on your mouth, must beat
Ain't your mama syrup, stickin', usin' my tree
Like taffy but classy, get at me
I'll gladly let you know I wanna kiss
But your lips, they'll do me fine
Now baby don't trip with the juicy kind
Get, get on the grip, Girl you ain't lyin'

(Chorus)
Flo Rida
You like my sugar, my sugar
You so sweet, so sweet
Like my candy, my candy
You so sweet, so sweet
I got a good appetite with you on me, on me
I'll wrap you out of them clothes
You my treat, my treat
Girl you my sugar, I call you Candy
And tonight I'm gonna get me some, get me some
Girl you my sugar, I call you Candy
And tonight I'm gonna get me some, get me some sugar
(Chorus)

[Chorus]
When you're gone, it feels like
My whole world's gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now, it's my disease
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?
(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, baby
Am I addicted
When I need you here all the time, oh?
And I'm not sure if this is healthy
Is it a sickness?
'Cause I feel like I'm losin' my mind
And I know that there's no medicine
Nothing I can take, no remedy
Baby, please stay

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're gone, it feels like
My whole world's gone with you
I thought love would be my cure
But now, it's my disease (My disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you? (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
I get a fever
Just the thought of you leaving my side
Oh, and I'm not the same 'til you're back holding me
That's all I need
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
When you're gone, it feels like (When you're gone, baby)
My whole world's gone with you (Gone with you)
I thought love would be my cure
But now, it's my disease (My disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?

[Bridge]
Oh, here's what I'm going through when you're gone
Some serious symptoms of withdrawal
Tossin' and turnin' in my bed
Wakin' up drenched in a cold sweat
Lyin' here longing for you
What am I supposed to do
When I'm stuck and I can't get enough of your love?
Oh, whoa, baby

[Chorus]
When you're gone, it feels like (When you're gone, baby)
My whole world's gone with you (Gone with you)
I thought love would be my cure
But now, it's my disease (My disease)
I try to act mature
But I'm a baby when you leave
How can I ever get used to being without you?
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away, is the bluebird
Here to stay, is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married? We'll say "No man
But you can do the job when you're in town."

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kids come knock him down
When it's cold, ain't it thrilling
When your nose, gets to chilling
We'll frolic and play, the eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland

[Spoken Intro: Alicia Keys]
And the day came
When the risk it took to remain
Tightly closed in the bud
Was more painful
Than the risk it took to bloom
This is the Element of Freedom

[Verse 1]
You could buy me diamonds
You could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
Baby, you know I'm worth it
Dinner lit by candles
Run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last, and last
Baby, you know I'm worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna please, wanna keep, wanna treat your woman right
Not just dough but to show that you know she is worth your time
(That’s right, that’s right)
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
(‘Cause why?)
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth
(‘Cause a…’cause a…’cause a…)

[Chorus]
‘Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman’s worth
Break it down

[Post-Chorus]
Mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm
Mhm, mhm
Mmm
Let’s do it like this, come on

[Verse 2]
‘Cause if you treat me fairly
I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should
Baby, I know you're worth it
And if you never play me
Now, don’t you bluff
I'll hold you down when ish gets rough
Baby, I know you're worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
She walks the mile make you smile all the while being true
(Yeah, yeah, come on)
Don't take for granted the passion she has for you
(What’s that? What’s that?)
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
(You better recognize it)
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth

[Chorus]
Ooh, ‘cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth
Yeah

[Outro]
So I wanna know, do I have some, uh
Do I have some real men out in that audience tonight?
Yeah, don’t be shamed now, you know what I mean?
Gotta give it up—if you real, then you real
So I wanna know, do I have some real women in this audience tonight?
Yeah, yeah
Now I have another question for you
I wanna know, uh, y’all think that, uh, you wanna hear something new?
Let’s flip it around on ‘em, come on…
Sometimes I feel like I don't belong anywhere
It's gonna take so long for me to get somewhere
Sometimes I feel so heavy hearted
But I can't explain 'cause I'm so guarded

But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there

Can you send an angel?
Can you send an angel?

'Cause I don't wanna feel
Like a dove with no wings
And I don't wanna know
What a heart of stone would bring

But that's a lonely road to travel
And a heavy load to bear
And it's a long, long way to heaven
But I gotta get there
Can you send an angel?
Can you send me an angel?
Please, send me an angel
Can you send me an angel?

To guide me, to guide me home

[Incomprehensible] so bad, so bad right now
Oh, won't you be somebody's angel right now
Oh, Holy Night
The stars
Are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear
Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin
And error pining
'Til He appeared
And the soul felt
It's worth a thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new
And glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices

Oh, night divine
Oh, night
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine
Oh night
Oh, Holy night
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
Oh, Holy night

[Verse]
Do you, ooh, ooh
Two hour long conversations on the phone
Can't get you outta my mind
Baby, are you feelin' me, feelin' you?
Everything you say and everything you do
Gets me lost in you days at a time
Tell me, are you feelin' me, feelin' you?
Won't you stop the violence
In the street
He can make the pain go away
He can make the mood change
That's happening every day
People on people crime
Will never slightly change a thing
It's all a state of mind
The situation's got to change

Chorus:
Oh, I know that Your love is real
I can feel the light shining bright
If you want a better deal
Let the people sleep at night
Love is reality
Love is
Love is reality

What about the time
When you were living out on the street
The homeless people everywhere
With not enough food to eat
People on people crime
People all hurt the same
There's peace and deliverance
If you call on Jesus' name
This is something
That I should know
I've been down here before
You can try and try another way
But you're standing right at the door

Repeat Chorus
Akon:
Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down, it's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood whore
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin' I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doing so I can pull up close
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful

Damn, girl!

Don't say nothing
Love in the fall
God saint child
Don't you miss of it all

The Joan of Arc
Kiss in the dark; she's a firestone
Catching all; watch her burn
So so pretty; cutting her hair
Dark star spirit now she's up in the gutter
Kills her feeling; keep us in here
Come out saint, but she called a healing
Don't say nothing; love in the fall
God saint child; don't you miss of it all

(Chorus)
The Joan of Arc
Kiss in the dark; she's a firestone
Catching all; watch her burn
The Joan of Arc
It's such a shock
Watching her getting out
Let it out
Lips are burning (The Joan of Arc)
White heart city, jungle in here
Hang low spinning, now she's lost in the mirror
Heart spits ripping, ....
Strikes up busy bodies suffer the fever
All saints come one you loving the fall
Go my child, look away from it all

(Chorus)
The Joan of Arc
Kiss in the dark; she's a firestone
Catching all; watch her burn
The Joan of Arc
It's such a shock
Watching her getting out
Let it out
Lips are burning (The Joan of Arc)

The Joan of Arc (The Joan of Arc) (x3)

(Chorus)
The Joan of Arc
Kiss in the dark; she's a firestone
Catching all; watch her burn
The Joan of Arc
It's such a shock
Watching her getting out
Let it out
Lips are burning (The Joan of Arc)
The Joan of Arc (The Joan of Arc)
The Joan of Arc (The Joan of Arc)

Every night it's through
I can't seem to get over you, girl

So long, baby
So long
Music is a universal language
That everybody can understand
So, we want to add a few words
To relate a special meaning (Listen)
Well, you've taken everything we've got
Even the guitar and the band
They were makin' the right moves
Playin' in the blues like a light is at hand

Oh, get ready, ready for a one nite stand
(Get ready for a one nite stand
Get ready for a one nite stand)
'Coz my baby loves a one nite stand
So does all the fellows in the band, alright

Don't you wanna go
Well, you've taken a right notion
Enough to fill the world and the ocean

While we're driving in your car
No one knows who you are
Let me know who, big people in power

Oh, get ready, ready for a one nite stand
(Get ready for a one nite stand
Get ready for a one nite stand)
'Coz my baby loves a one nite stand
So does all the fellows in the band, alright
New York City, don't you wanna go, c'mon
Yeah sure, climb on
Don't you wanna go, c'mon

What a Friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit
O what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness:
Take it to the Lord in prayer

Are we weary and heavy laden
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our Refuge-
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In His arms He'll take and shield thee
Thou wilt find a solace there

Can't wait to get home

In our hearts we have the answer
In our souls we have the power
Together we can make a change

Chorus

People

It happened quickly
All of a sudden
I was caught up with another man
Who wanted
To be closer
But now
I know better and I'm
Hoping
We Can
Start Again

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that does not take away what I have
Done So
Let me show you how deep my love goes
For you
'Cause you live and learn and that's how you find out
Who is true
And I found out that you were the one

[Chorus]
I was deceived
Baby, please forgive me
Don't want what we had to change
It's easier for us to get further
Don't look in the rear view mirror

[Verse 2]
Now that we are
Back again together
I want to show you
How I mean forever
I'll do my best to shower
You with love and attention
Don't ever have to mention
A song after it ends

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that does not take away what I have
Done So
Let me show you how deep my love goes
For you
'Cause you live and learn and that's how you find out
Who is true
And I found out that you were the one

I was deceived
Baby, please forgive me
Don't want what we had to change

I can't change what I have done before
But now I know that your love means so much more
Than anything that had ever come my way
Keep your eyes on what we have today

I was deceived
Baby, please forgive me
Don't want what we had to change
(Don't want what we had to change)
It's easier for us to get further
Don't look in the rear view mirror

If we can get past the past (past)
It happened so fast (so fast)
If we don't look back (look back)

(Baby, don't leave)
Baby, baby, baby
Please stay, darlin'
(Don't leave me, baby)
Baby, baby
There's no way
There's just no way
I could leave your love behind

If I could live my life all over, I'd do everything the same
The film in my camera would reveal everything the same
Like kissin' you every mornin', lovin' you day by day
Dreaming dreams of you and every old way will

When the sun peeps through my window
I'll have you on my mind
There's no way, there's no way
To leave your love behind

When you hair turns to silver and I'm old and gray
I'll keep on lovin' you, yeah, the same old way
When you come to the end of your journey
If I'm lucky enough to be around

I'll hold your picture to my chest
But tears will be still falling down, yeah
I'll keep you in my memory for the rest of my days
There's no way, there's no way to leave your love behind
Oh, behind, yeah
If I could walk through the garden again, you'd be the flower I pick
The episode of our love would give my heart a kick, yeah
If I could take the song from the top, one more time
I would sing the same old lines, yeah

I'll tell you there's just no way, no, no
There's no way to leave your love behind, behind
Oh, no, I can't leave it behind, oh

I can leave behind
Behind
Can't leave love, no
Behind
There's just no way

Behind
There's no way, no
Behind
It's still no

[Intro]
God blessed our love
Even in the morning when I rise
I say, God blessed our love

[Verse 1]
And every morning when I rise
I can just see heaven more in your eyes
It makes me know this is not an everyday love, no, no
We've got something, I'm sure we can be proud of

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we've got so much, show much love
We've got so much, so much trust
Can't you see a halo, a halo?
I can see a halo hovering over us

[Chorus]
And oh, I didn't meant it, baby
But God, blessed our love
I have to say it this evening that
God, oh God, blessed our love
If you've got something to be thankful for
You oughta just say, hey
God, blessed our love
I'll have to say this evening
God, oh God, blessed our love
I swear He did

[Verse 2]
Let me say, I could just stand up
And tell the world, oh babe
That you're mine, all mine, all mine
Your love is heavenly desire
And I just have to say, I like kissing you
I like, I like, hugging you
I like squeezing you, wanting you
Holding you, loving you
I'm glad, I'm still loving you, come on, baby
Let me say that when people, yeah
People, yeah, start to criticize, it don't bother me
No, no, 'cause I know God, God
God is on our side

[Outro]
You see and let me just say that
God, God blessed our love
I have to say that, God, blessed our love

[Intro]
My man don't love me no more
He said he needed a little time
To clear his mind
Meanwhile, I'm losing mine

[Verse 1]
We're at the crossroads, my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you will go, maybe you'll stay
Oh, I know I'm gonna miss you either way

[Chorus]
It's such a lonely road (Where do we go from here?)
All I can do is
Follow the tracks of my tears, oh

[Verse 2]
When I cry your name, am I callin' in vain, oh?
Am I waiting only to drown in pain, oh?
Don't you do it, no, said, don't you leave me this way
I don't know if I can lift my head and face another day

[Chorus]
Oh, it's such a lonely road (Where do we go from here?)
All I can do is
Follow the tracks of my tears (Tears)

[Bridge]
Usually not the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
Who could this be, staring at me?
When I'm looking in the mirror tryna find a resolution
Me too far gone, to find my way home

[Outro]
Where do we go from here?
All I can do is
Follow the tracks of my tears, oh
Where do we go from here?
(Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay)
All I can do is
Follow the tracks of my tears (Follow either way)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Lookin' out my window, sun shinin' bright
Birds singin', tryin' to make things right
I've got good music on my radio
How did your love songs play from those doors?

[Chorus]
I don't want no one to come in to catch me sigh
But ever since you left, said goodbye
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me

[Verse 2]
Somethin' 'bout your kiss, gloom all around me
Seem like love is never gonna find me
I keep on looking for a, a brighter day
When all I see is time slipping away

[Chorus]
I've got to stop and get myself together
All I can see is stormy weather
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me, ooh

[Outro]
I've got to stop, get myself together
'Cause all I can see is stormy weather
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here, alright
I just wish you were here with me
Come on and walk with me, oh baby
Hey baby, it's you again
If you're gonna play, you've got to play to win
Hey baby, the time is right
Only tonight he's out of sight

I know it's you, for what I know
Tell all the guys, it's time to go
Your love is all I need
For ever and ever is what I seek

Oh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
We've got love
No money, no diamond rings, ooh baby
We've got love

I know just what I'm sayin'
I ain't lyin' and I ain't playin'
Only the love is what I need
You can see whatever you wanna see

I can't share your love alone
If not tonight, oh baby, then I'm gone
Whatever you say, I know you're right
Only tonight, only tonight
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
We've got love
No money, no diamond rings, ooh baby
We've got love

I know just what I'm sayin'
I ain't lyin' and I ain't playin'
Only the love is what I need
You can see whatever you wanna see

And I can't share your love alone
If not tonight and then I'm gone
Whatever you say, oh, sure you're right
Only tonight, only tonight, only tonight

Ooh baby, oh baby, ooh
We've got love
No money, no diamond rings, ooh baby
We've got love

Ooh baby, oh baby

Hold on, hold on, hold on

(Let's stay together)

I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do is all right with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you

Let me say, since (baby)
Since we've been together
Loving you forever is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Ooh baby, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad
Happy or sad

Ooh, yeah
Whether times are good or bad
Happy or sad
Why, somebody, why people break up
And turn around and make up
I just can't deceive
You'd never do that to me, would you baby?
Staying being around you is all I see

Here's what I want us to do
Let's, we ought to stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad
Happy or sad

Come on, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad
Happy or sad

[Chorus]
There's no one in life quite like you, you, baby
There's no one in life quite like you, you, baby

[Verse 1]
As I sit and wonder, baby, how you do the things you do, yeah
I know deep down in my heart, I never see all the way through

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I smile and I'm glad
You're the best thing that I ever had

[Chorus]
There's no one in life quite like you, you, I love you, baby, girl
No one in life quite like you, you, baby

[Verse 2]
One more thing
Smoke stacks signal your love
Coming from my window pane, yeah
All I need from you, baby, is to take you in my arms again, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
One smile from you is all I need
To see me through my day, hey hey

[Chorus]
No one in life quite like you, you, I love you, baby
There's no one in life quite like you, hold it back there now, you, baby

[Bridge]
Here we go
One word from you is all I need
One, one, one kiss from you
Always set me free

[Chorus]
There's no one in life quite like you, you
You're so unique baby, I can't I can't explain it
No one in life quite like you, oh baby, you, baby
There's no one in life quite like you, you
No one in life quite like you, baby, you

[Outro]
Like you
Like you, like you
Early in the morning, have a smile on your face
Late in the midnight hour, no one can take your place
Even sashay, glass of wine
You're so fine, I'm glad you're mine
I look back now, girl, on tomorrow's dreams
Distant things are happening, not as bad as they seem
Don't put off tomorrow for what today might bring
I'd be satisfied now to gain one single thing

Don't look away now, girl, things are looking bright
Don't put off tomorrow, girl, for what's in store tonight, baby
I want my baby, tonight baby, I can't wait no longer
Here now baby

I give my heart and feeling of distress
Trying to ignore her pain, all the happiness
Anything you want girl, I will give complete
I'd do anything, baby, to overcome defeat

And don't say tomorrow come, it don't belong to anyone
Don't put off tomorrow, girl, for what's in store tonight, baby
C'mon now baby, hey, tonight baby, oh baby, hey, c'mon

I look back now, girl, on tomorrow's dreams
Distant things are happening, not as bad as they seem
Don't put off tomorrow for what today might bring
I'll be satisfied to gain one single thing
Don't look away now, girl, things are looking bright
Don't put off tomorrow, girl, for what's in store tonight, baby
C'mon now baby, hey, tonight baby, baby
I can't wait no longer, comin' over baby
I tried to tell myself, I tried to tell myself
That you would be back
(You would be back)
I tried to tell myself, I tried to tell myself
That you would be back
(You would be back)

Oh, though you said you would
I only wish you could
I know I'm trying to be someone

Say I tried to tell myself, I tried to tell myself
You got to ride
(You got to ride)
Oh, I tried to tell myself, I tried
I really tired to sleep at night
(Sleep at night)

Before the break of day
Turning another page into life's mystery
And the light of day
I can now hear you say
I then take this trip
With me to eternity

Oh, I tried to tell myself, I tried to tell myself
You need a friend
(You need a friend)
Oh and as soon as I wake up
The sun begin to shine, I start to rain
(Start to rain)

I see you finally made it
All the time you waited
I, I could be with you

I see you finally made it
All the time you waited
Now I wanna be with you, oh yeah

I tried to tell myself
I tried to tell myself
I don't wanna ever leave you
I tried to tell myself
I tried to tell myself
I never want you to ever leave me all alone
I tried to tell myself
I never want you to ever leave me away
I tried to tell myself
I tried to tell myself
I don't want you to ever leave me all alone
Since the day I lost you girl
I just can't face the world
I'm kind of feeling kind of small
I let you go one day
But now I'm ashamed to say
I said oh baby I need you
I need your loving
Well I need, said I need
I need you right by my side
I lost my day

A lot of things to make you cry
I made myself a lonely man
But now I have come to understand
I said oh baby I need you
I never need no one
Like I need you girl
Your love is just for me, for me, it's just for me
It's just for me for me for me it's just for me

Just stopped by to say that I love you more each day
When you turn around and you knock me down but I love you still

Why can'tchoo tell that I love you by the way that I smile
Why can'tchoo bring more love to the table you drive me wild

Your love is just for me, for me I can tell oh for nobody but me yeah
Your love for me, it's for me, I can tell its just for me

Just stopped by to say we make a love worth living
And by now I think our love is more its more than giving hey hey

Why can'tchoo tell that I love you by the way that I smile
Why can'tchoo bring more love to the table you drive me wild

Your love is just for me for oh for nobody but me
Your love for me, it's for me I can tell its just for me
Thinking about you everyday this way
Thinking about you what can I say
Thinking about you takes more from me
Ahhhhhhhhh

Your love is just for me, for me it's just for me
Your love is for me, it's for me, for me I can tell its just for me

[Verse 1]
Ooh, baby, now

When you need me, I'm there for you anytime
Ooh, baby, now

I'm runnin' to get ya anything, I don't mind 'cause boy, it's in my nature
I don't care
'Cause that's just the way I am
I don't mind 'cause you're so deserving
Loving you with all that I am
Oh!
After I've give my all
You'll be there to catch me if I fall

[Chorus]
Who's gonna save me
When I'm empty?
I need a someone to fill me
Will you be my saviour?
Rescue me
'Cause when I'm out saving you
Baby, who's saving me?

[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm a special kind

Don't worry, I got ya, I'll hold you down

'Cause boy, it's my pleasure
I don't care
'Cause that's just the way I am

[Chorus]
I don't mind
'Cause baby, you're my treasure
Loving you with all that I am
Oh!

To fill me
Will you be my saviour?
Rescue me
'Cause when I'm out saving you
Baby, who's saving me?

[Bridge]
I'm my number one priority
Ain't nobody takin' better care of me than me
Loving hard
Is my tendency
And I'm hoping that
You are the one who is willing to

[Chorus]
Just save me
When I'm empty
And I need a someone
To fill me
Will you be my saviour?
Rescue me
'Cause when I'm out saving you
Baby, who's saving me?

[Outro]
Will you be my saviour?
Baby, who's saving me?
Saving me
Saving me
Baby, who's saving me?
Life can be hard if you live in vain
Trials can't be hard if you depend on God
I will not worry, I won't be afraid of hope
I'll look to Jesus who says, 'I'm the Way'

Come and go with me to my Father's house
Let's go, let's go
All the road is free, come and go with me
Let's go, let's go, I'm going away, I'm going away

It's nothing but peace
When you're gone away
It's nothing but joy
When you are gone away

Let me tell you
You'd better go this way, if your woman see the day
Let her go, let's go
All the road is free, come and go with me
Let's go, I'm going away, I'm going away
Hey, hey, (Incomprehensible)
And I won't be there, I'm going away
I don't know about you
I find you're nothing but joy, I'm going away

We'll pack my bags up
With the soul that I've had, I'm going away
Nothing but love over there
Sometime I happen to (Incomprehensible)
I'm going away

I'm still way by myself
And I say, I'm going away
I still wait by myself
As I, I'm going away

I'll tell you one thing
There's nothing but love and joy
(Incomprehensible) I'm going away
All the way

I have to love you
I'm going away, I'm going away
Jesus' coming back to take me by the hand
To lead me to the land, I'm going away

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Let's go off the dome, I can't make it home

The time for messin' around children is through
And I ain't got time to wallow in the mire

[Intro]
There we go, ladies and gentlemen
Past all of the technical difficulties
That we have thus forth experienced
I will let you into my laboratory filled with many things
Writing utensils, you see
Such as my typewriter in the corner
Let me show you to the window
So you can see what I see, you know

[Verse 1]
Desperate am I to
Tell you how I feel for you
No sunshine when you're gone
Peaceful sleep, I have none

[Pre-Chorus]
How can I make it better
I'm under so much pressure
Well I know it won't last
I know that this will pass (Uh)

[Chorus]
You're my typewriter (Oh, oh)
I write to you what I am thinking (Hey, hey, I write to you)
Thinking in my head (What's in my head, head)
You're my typewriter (My)
I write to you what I am thinking (What I am thinking)
You capture what I've said (Mm)

[Verse 2]
I don't want to falsify
I want to make it right
Can't you see there's work to do?
I'm trying to write to you

[Pre-Chorus]
How can I make it better
I'm under so much pressure
Problem is, (You know what the) problem is
I'll give you space 'til you get over this

[Chorus]
You're my typewriter (You're my)
I write to you what I am thinking
Thinking in my head (I'll write to you the thoughts of mine)
You're my typewriter (Yeah, yeah)
I write to you what I am thinking (My, my, my, my, my head)
You capture what I've said (Yeah)

[Bridge]
To torture a woman
Is to feed her loneliness
So please don't leave me lonely
'Cause it's your mind that I miss (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You're my typewriter (Can you give me some comfort and joy?)
I write to you what I am thinking (Comfort and joy)
Thinking in my head (I, I)
You're my typewriter (I'll write to you)
I write to you what I am thinking (Tell you what's on my mind, the last time)
You capture what I've said (On my mind, baby)

[Verse 1]
Spending my day, thinking 'bout you, girl
Being here with you, being near with you
I can't explain myself
Why I feel like I do (Like I do)
Though it hurt me so to let you know
That I look in your eyes
To let me know how you feel
Let me know that love is really real
Well, it seems to me
That I'm wrapped up in your love

[Chorus]
Don't you know that I'm still in love
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho'nuff in love with you, yeah, hey

Heaven knows that I'm still in love
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho'nuff in love with you, hey

[Verse 2]
Hey, when I look in your eyes
And all, all the years I see (I see)
Me lovin' you and you lovin' me
Well, it seems to me
That I'm wrapped up in your love

[Chorus]
Don't you know that I'm still in love
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho'nuff in love with you
Hey, ah-ha, ah-ah-ah, ah-ha
Ah-ha
Don't you know that I'm still in love
(Still in love, in love with you)
Sho'nuff in love with you

[Outro]
Hey, I'll try it if you want me to
(Still in love, in love with you)
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ha
Ah-ha
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all
Your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white
Christmas with you
Jingle Bells
All the way, all the way

[Verse 1]
Last night and the night before
Twenty-five robbers at my door
I got up and let 'em in
But I missed 'em all with a rollin' pin

[Pre-Chorus]
Alright they took everything I own
Like a king down from his throne
I can't let it get me down
Yeah-ah-ah-ah
Change my smile into a frown
Oh hey yeah -eh

[Chorus]
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown

[Verse 2]
Just all about to send it southside
Even though I know you are tired, yeah
Now it's time for love again
Pain is found and finally went

[Pre-Chorus]
Took everything I own
Like a king without his throne
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown

[Chorus]
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown

All is fair in love and war
What are you fightin' here for?
Time about to right just one
There's no cost and there's no fun

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah hey hey hey
It'll never happen again
But it has to end
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown

[Chorus]
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown

[Outro]
I'm through

[Papoose:]
Ya wanna go to war lets get it then
If war bring peace im wit it then
I don't start beef i finish it
Ghetto soldiers, we militant

[Akon:]
I dont like to fuss or fight
Just trying to live life rightt
Don't take my kindness for weakness
Cuz i will take your life....
At first i will walk away...
Unless they push me to play
But thats something I know you will regret
So please dont forget

[Akon:]
Im a ghetto soldier, desporatoOoOo
Im a ghetto soldier, (dont man say nooOoo)
Im a ghetto soldIER, (how white say nooOoo)
Yes a ghetto soldier, (black man say nooOoo)
Got an S on my chest hahaha

[Papoose:]
The soldiers get trained by the leutinent
The leutinent get all of his orders from the captain
General, when i was young i got drafted
Sent me to the army of Brooklyn, those bastards
Full of soldiers, my homies lay in caskets
They couldn't survive the heat
Just like the mavericks
And I dont buy wolf tickets from niggas
But niggas be wolfin so i walk around on my clippers
Some of my people was alive from my struggle
But ain't lived to see my success
They wanted to see me make it, but got stripped naked
And layed in the mall cuz of death
So yo now im successful how can i celebrate it?
They died early, so in their eyes I never made it
I ain't goin' give you my life, you gotta take it
Soldier, I'm going out Blazin'

[Akon:]
Im a ghetto soldier, desporatoOoOo
Im a ghetto soldier, (dont man say nooOoo)
Im a ghetto soldIER, (how white say nooOoo)
Yes a ghetto soldier, (black man say nooOoo)
(Big mike, Evil Empire)

[Papoose:]
We said the same thing at the same time
I ain't knock on wood
Black cat crossed my path, my luck still good
Brook a mirror, i ain't get 7 years of bad luck
Nuttin bad ain't even happened, my left eye jumped
Put my hat on the bed when i walked in the room
Swept my feet, and i ain't even spit on the broom
What im try'na say is, Im not supersticious
Akon what am I ?
(Im a ghetto soldier)
My right hand itchin, been havin money kid
I even opened the unbrella in da crib
Bought my girl some shoes, she ain't walk outta my life
No bad luck, I skipped the po twice
No superstition, just wise intuition
On the battle field get killed or do the killin
By the way my good luck charm is a bisquit
Ghetto soldier to the ended

[Akon:]
Im a ghetto soldier, desporatoOoOo
Im a ghetto soldier, (dont man say nooOoo)
Im a ghetto soldIER, (how white say nooOoo)
Yes a ghetto soldier, (black man say nooOoo)
(hey!)

[Papoose:]
No pain no gain
All of the trama is killing me
Pain can't swim thats why I drown in that Hennesey
Tired of the enemy, runnin to your crib
Slumped you in your fireplace and have smoke comin outta
Your chimney
I could see straight through your plast? and your trickory
It dont mean shit to me, im trying to get to the bottom of it
But I lost a whole lot of my energy
Tryna get to the bottom of a bottomless industry
Now-a-days all i got is my pride and my dignity
You ridin with sympathy
They say misery needs company, why people company
You kiddin' me, when I could grab a weapon and put him outta his misery
Says shots asked you to tell you Im not playing!
When you fire back you let me know what chu saying
This gun busting its like an unspoken language
We communicate with our guns, this shit is dangerous

[Akon:]
Im a ghetto soldier, desporatoOoOo
Im a ghetto soldier, (dont man say nooOoo)
Im a ghetto soldIER, (how white say nooOoo)
Yes a ghetto soldier, (black man say nooOoo)
(Ya know)

[Verse 1]
Yield not to temptation, for yielding is sin
Each victory will help you or some others to win
Fight manfully onward, dark passions subdue
Look ever to Jesus and He'll carry you through

[Chorus]
Just ask the Savior to help you
To comfort, strengthen and keep you
He is willing to aid you
And He will carry you through
Ask the Savior to help you
To comfort, strengthen and heal you
Oh, He is willing to aid you
Jesus will carry you through

[Verse 2]
Shun evil companions, bad language disdain
God's name hold in reverence, don't take it in vain
Be thoughtful and honest, kindhearted and true
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through

[Chorus]
Oh, ask the Savior to help you
To comfort, strengthen and keep you
Oh, He is willing to aid you
Jesus, He will carry you through

[Outro]
All I wanna do is ask the Savior to help you
Comfort, strengthen and keep you
He is willing to aid you
And He will carry you through
And I wanna just ask the Savior to help you
To comfort, strengthen and keep you
He is willing to aid you
Oh, I know He will carry you through

[Verse 1]
Here I am
And I been thinkin' about you lately
Hold my hand
'Cause I've been missin' you like crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna go through life every single night
Wishing we could do it, oh, but do it right
Come and hold me tight, we don't need to fight
Rather spend my life with you, every night
'Cause baby...

[Chorus]
This bed is too lonely without you (Baby)
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you
Please be beside me
These king size sheets
Need more than just a queen in between 'em
This bed is too lonely without you (Too lonely)

[Verse 2]
So why don't we go inside where we can be together?
You mean more than anything
Stay with me, wanna be with you forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna go through life every single night
Wishing we could do it, oh, but do it right
Come and hold me tight, we don't need to fight
Rather spend my life with you, every night
Ooh baby...

[Chorus]
This bed is too lonely without you (Baby, baby, baby)
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you (I wanna hold you, hold you)
Please be beside me
These king size sheets
Need more than just a queen in between 'em (Yeah)
This bed is too lonely without you (Too lonely)

[Spoken Bridge]
You know when it starts to get late
And it's time to go to sleep, I
I don't know what to do
'Cause I don't wanna hold my pillow
I wanna hold you

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna go through life every single night
Wishing we could do it, oh, but do it right
Come and hold me tight, we don't need to fight
Rather spend my life with you, every night
Ooh baby...

[Chorus]
This bed is too lonely without you (Baby, baby)
Don't wanna hold my pillow, I wanna hold you (I wanna hold ya, hold ya)
Please be beside me
These king size sheets
Need more than just a queen in between 'em (Yeah)
This bed is too lonely without you (Too lonely, yeah)
Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey, if I get restless
Baby, you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey, when you knock on my door
I gave you my key
Nobody knows it when I was down
I was your clown, nobody knows it
Right from the start, I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
And nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
And now it's up to us, babe
I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
You put the sparks to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights
You've been there from day one
You've been there since my life's just begun
I don't know just how to explain
How I feel about you, I feel about you

Girl, don't get on that train
And don't get on that plane
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight

'Cause I'm in love with you
And I swear, you know it's true
Baby, not tonight

And I'd never go and leave you
That's one thing about me
I'll never go and deceive you
No, no, no

I'd never go and bring you
And then turn and go away from you
Away from you
Don't get on the train
Don't get on the train
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight

Listen, I'm in love with you
And I swear, you know it's true
Baby, not tonight

Take my advice
Don't you never, never
Never, never, never
Think about it twice
All my life, all my life
One more time

Take my advice
Don't think about it twice tonight

Don't get on that train
Don't you dare get on that train
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight

I'm in love with you
And I swear this love is true
Baby, not tonight
Don't get on that train
Don't get on that plane
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight

I'm in love with you
I swear, you know it's true
Baby, not tonight

Don't get on that train
Don't get on that plane
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight

[Verse 1]
I find my way through the five o'clock rush hour
As daylight slowly leaves the sky
I open the door to that little room
That we call home

[Bridge]
And ooh yeah, now
Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there to meet me
At the end of the day
You know it's always been that way
Ooh yeah, now

[Verse 2]
And then I find my way through the early morning traffic
But someone else is heavy, heavy on my mind
I open the door to our favorite little coffee shop
Ooh, y'all, the girl is right on time now, come on

[Bridge]
Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there, always there to meet me
And that's how I start my day
It's just too bad it doesn't end that way

[Outro]
(One woman's making my home)
One woman's making my home
(But the other woman's making me wrong)
The other girl is making me do wrong
Oh, oh, oh, I didn't mean to let it get that strong, no baby
I got to decide where I belong
(One woman's making my home)
Sometimes I get so mixed up inside
(But the other woman's making me wrong)
I wish I could find a place to hide
Oh, oh, oh, I didn't mean, I didn't mean
I didn't mean to let it get that strong, no girl
I got to decide, where I belong, yeah, yeah
(One woman's making my home)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Ow!
Help me out, dig

[Verse 1]
All I do is grunt and groan, hurts me to walk anywhere
Went to see my physician, Dr. Jones

He took my trousers off, told me to cough
Doctor says there ain't nothin' to discuss

He tells me any day, I might have to wear a truss

[Chorus 1]
Living with a hernia, all the time, such aggravation
Living with a hernia, gonna be my ruination
Living with a hernia, got to have an operation
Feel so old

[Verse 2]
Too much bad pain, good gawd, drives me insane
Can't run, barely crawl, got a bulge in my intestinal wall
Walk real funny, bless my soul, can't play tennis
And it's hard to bowl
You can't even do the splits now, say it
Better call it quits now, now I'm sick of all this dancin' anyhow

[Chorus 2]
Living with a hernia, hurts me bad in a tender location
Living with a hernia, had enough humiliation
Living with a hernia, got to have an operation
I live with a hernia, can't get up, can't bend over
Now I live with a hernia, wait a minute

[Bridge]
You may not be familiar with the common types
Of hernias that you could get
So just settle down, let me clue you in there's incomplete
Epigastric, bladder, strangulated, lumbar hernia, Richter's hernia
Obstructed, inguinal and direct

[Chorus 3]
Living with a hernia rupture
I said it's causin' me such irritation
Living with a hernia, have to have my medication
Living with a hernia, I feel bad
Oooh oooh oooh ee-oooh oooh oooh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh-oooh oooh
Oooooh

I'm always thinkin' 'bout it
I don't know what I'd do without it
I love, I really love
My pancreas

My spleen just doesn't matter
Don't really care about my bladder
But I don't leave home without
My pancreas

My pancreas is always there for me
Secreting those enzymes (bap bap bap)
Secreting those hormones too
Metabolizing carbohydrates just for me

Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba ba
My pancreas
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba
My pancreas
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba ba
My pancreas
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba
My pancreas
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba ba
My pancreas
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba
My pancreas
Ooooooh
My pancreas attracts every other
Pancreas in the universe
With a force proportional
To the product of their masses
And inversely proportional
To the distance between them
Woo woo woo woo

Don'tcha you know you gotta
Flow, flow, flow, pancreatic juice
Flow, flow, into the duodenum
Won'tcha flow, flow, flow, pancreatic juice
Flow, flow, into the duodenum
Insulin, glucagon

Comin' from the islets of Langerhans...
(Flow flow, into the duodenum)

Can't you see I love my pancreas
{Lipase, amylase, and tripsin}

[Insulin, glucagon]
(Won'tcha flow flow flow, pancreatic juice)
Golly-gee I love my pancreas
{They gonna help with our digestion}

[Comin' from the islets of Langerhans...]
(Flow flow, into the duodenum)

Can't you see I love my pancreas
{Lipase, amylase, and tripsin}

[Insulin, glucagon]

Golly-gee I love my pancreas

Golly-gee I love my pancreas
{They gonna help with our digestion}

[Comin' from the islets of Langerhans...]
(Flow flow, into the duodenum)
Can't you see I love my pancreas
I know that you don't know me very well
We've barely met but I can surely tell
No one will ever love you like I do
I like to feel the warm spot on your chair
Sometimes I drool and usually I stare
My precious one I saved that gum
That you threw in the garbage

You're the one I dream about
But the only question with me now
Is, "Do I creep you out?"
Everytime I shake your hand now
Wanna stick your fingers in my mouth
Well do I creep you out?

Call you every night and hang up
Gonna carve your name in my leg
In my leg, oh oh!
Somethin' I should ask about
Can I sniff the pit-stains on your blouse?
And do I creep you
Do I creep you out?
(Your restraining order's out)
(Still the only question with me now)
Oh the only question
(Is, "Do I creep you out?")
Is "Do I creep you out?"
Know exactly where you live now
Follow you from work right to your house
Well, do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?
Feat. Bingo Players
His house party is crazy, my crew is hela wavy
Yo, flip the cut, then say what's up, then slide out with your lady
No ifs or buts about it, my style is technotronic
Got grips and models so spin the bottle, girl I'm just getting started
Get up, get up, get up
Pump the volume, feel the base
Get up, get up, get up
Turn me on and let me do my thang
Get up, get up, get up
We in the house and we here to stay
Get up, get up, get up!
We be raging round the clock, feel that base around the block
Fill that red cup to the top, birthday shots
Doesn't matter, who you are, look around, we in the stars
Round the world, we party all
We go all night strong until we drop
Get up, get up, get up
Pump the volume, feel the base
Get up, get up, get up
Turn me on and let me do my thang
Get up, get up, get up
We in the house and we here to stay
Get up, get up, get up!
Put your hands, put your, put your hands up
Put your hands, put your, put your hands up
Put your hands, put your, put your hands up
Get up!
We ain't going home, it's 6 in the morn'
This house is bumping, friction on
We ain't going home, even when the lights come on
This house is bumping, base still go strong
Get up!
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain
You and me together through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
You, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide something so real
So till the end of time I'm telling you

There ain't no one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh) oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh) oh
No no no oh oh
I dated Siamese twins, I slept with Bigfoot, too
Get me on Sally Jesse, put me on Donahue
'Cause I wanna tell the world about it right now
My dog's a narcoleptic, my mom's a circus freak
I gotta get a spot on Geraldo's show this week
'Cause I wanna tell the world about it right now

I'm just an anorexic, codependent, bingo addict
Stripper born without a chin
And I'm only comfortable talking about it
When the whole wide world is listening in

Talk soup
Talk soup
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me

My wife ran off with Elvis, my boss shaved off my hair
I've got a thing for poodles and rubber underwear
And I wanna tell the world about it right now
I had a close encounter, I never chew my food
I got eleven nose jobs, I yodel in the nude
And I wanna tell the world about it right now
I'm just a cross-dressin', alcoholic, neo-Nazi
Porno star, as you may have guessed
And I'm really gonna feel a whole lot better
If you let me get this thing off my chest

Talk soup
Talk soup
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me

I'm just your average schizophrenic, nymphomaniac
Albino go-go dancer, you see
Nothin' so bad that I can't share it
With a billion friends on national TV

I have no genitalia, I sold my kids for cheese
I love my blow up doll, so bring out those cameras, please
'Cause I gotta tell the world about it right now

Talk soup
Talk soup
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me

Talk soup
Talk soup
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me
Talk soup
Talk soup
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me

Talk soup
Talk soup
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me

Oh Africa

[Verse 1: Akon]
I know that we have to take it to the goal
'Cause everyone's depending on we
See we ain't got nowhere to go but up
It's our destiny

[Pre-Chorus: Keri Hilson]
We're choosing to win, we'll do what it takes
To get to the top of the highest mountain
We'll do anything, we got to prove ourselves
'Cause we know

[Chorus]
Oh Africa
Oh Africa
Oh Africa

[Verse 2: Akon]
See we'll never be able to forget this day
'Cause it's the greatest day of our life
See no matter what happens at least we can say
"We came, we saw, we tried"

[Pre-Chorus: Keri Hilson]
We're choosing to win, we'll do what it takes
To get to the top of the highest mountain
We'll do anything, we got to prove ourselves

This is our time to shine, our time to fly
Our time to be inside the sky

Strong as he can be
Ahhh
Watch out for that tree

George, George, George of the jungle
Lives a life that's free
Ahhh
Watch out for that tree

When he gets in a scrape
He makes his escape
With the help of his friend
An ape named Ape

Then away he'll schlep
On his elephant Shep
While Fella and Ursula
Stay in step with

George, George, George of the jungle
Friend to you and me
Ahhh
Watch out for that tree
Watch out for that (Ahhh) (Oooh) tree
George, George, George of the Jungle
Friend to you and me

[Intro: Don Pardo]
Is Don in the booth?
He's ready
Ok. Here we go. Loosen up camera two. Cameras one and three, that's fine. In five, four, three, two...
Cue lights, music
Now entering the studio are today's contestants
This is Mr. Millard Snopkin from Carbondale, Illinois
And this is Mr. Leroy Pinkelstein from Brooklyn, New York
And this is Alfred Yankovic from Lynwood, California
These three people will compete today on...Jeopardy

[Verse 1: Weird Al Yankovic]
I was there, to match my intellect, on national TV
Against a plumber, oh and an architect, both with a Ph.D
I was tense, I was nervous
I guess it just wasn't my night
Art Fleming gave the answers
Oh, but I couldn't get the questions right-ight-ight

[Hook: Weird Al Yankovic]
I lost on Jeopardy, baby
Oooh
I lost on Jeopardy, baby
Oooh

[Verse 2: Weird Al Yankovic]
Oh well I knew I was in trouble now
My hopes of winning sank
Because I got the Daily Double now
And then my mind went blank
I took Potpourri for one hundred
And then my head started to spin
Well, I'm givin' up. Don Pardo
Just tell me now what I didn't win
Yeah, yeah

[Hook: Weird Al Yankovic]
I lost on Jeopardy, baby
Oooh
I lost on Jeopardy, baby
Oooh

[Bridge: Don Pardo]
That's right Al--you lost!
And let me tell what you didn't win: a twenty-volume set of the Encyclopedia International
A case of Turtle Wax, and a year's supply of Rice-a-Roni
The San Francisco treat
But that's not all!  You also made yourself look like a jerk in front of millions of people!
And you brought shame and disgrace on your family name for generations to come!
You don't get to come back tomorrow!
You don't even get a lousy copy of our home game!
You're a complete loser!!

[Verse 3: Weird Al Yankovic]
Don't know what I was thinking of
I guess I just wasn't too bright
Well, I sure hope I do better
Next weekend on The Price Is Right-ight-ight

[Hook: Weird Al Yankovic]
I lost on Jeopardy, baby
Oooh
I lost on Jeopardy, baby
Oooh

[Outro: Weird Al Yankovic]
I lost on Jeopardy

[Verse 1]
Isn't it strange?
Feels like I'm lookin' in the mirror
What would people say?
If only they knew that I was

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Part of some geneticist's plan
Born to be a carbon copy man
There in a petri dish, late one night
They took a donor's body cell and fertilized a human egg and so I say

[Chorus]
I think I'm a clone now
There's always two of me just a-hangin' around
I think I'm a clone now
Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down

[Verse 2]
Look at the way
We go out walking close together
I guess you could say
I'm really beside myself

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I still remember how it began
They produced a carbon copy man
Born in a science lab late one night
Without a mother or a father, just a test tube and a womb with a view

[Chorus]
I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
There's always two of me just a-hangin' around
I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down
I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
And I can stay at home while I'm out of town
I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
Cause every pair of genes is a hand-me-down

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Signing autographs for my fans
Come and meet the carbon copy man
Livin' in stereo, it's all right
Well I can be my own best friend and I can send myself for pizza so I say

[Chorus]
I think I'm a clone now
Another one of me's always hangin' around
I think I'm a clone now
Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down
I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
I've been on Oprah Winfrey, I'm world renowned
I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
And every pair of genes is a hand-me-down
I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
That's my genetic twin always hangin' around
I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down
I think I'm a clone now (a clone now)
Chorus
I can't go no where, unless you're by my side
I gotta have you here, I said right here by my side
I can't roam the town, unless you're by my side
I gotta have you around, Right here by my side
So where's my moonshine, Cos' I'll be all up in the club
With you yeah
So where's my moonshine, Ya know I spend my last dub
For you yeah
So where's my moonshine, I feel so nice with you yeah
So where's my moonshine, Wanna spend my whole life
With you yeah
I snuck into this club when I was 15
And I met my girl at the bar such a sweet thing
Every time I held her she would always kiss me
Every touch of her lips would always make me tipsy
I told her man I love you, pulled her to the dance floor
And that's when she whispered, be careful what you ask for
I grabbed her by the waist and I sat her on the table
Explained how her heartburn she's giving me is painful
And now you wanna leave cause you feel empty inside
Well none of my friends trust me with you to drive
I'm so into you I hope you're feeling it
I need you in my life and the reason is
Chorus
How many times I gotta tell you why you stressing me for
Yeah I see you need attention I ain't tryin' to ignore
I gotta straighten up now I got work to do
You want me to drop everything so it surrounds you
Man I love you so much it makes me sick to my stomach
And I love it how I can vomit and you think nothing of it
I never meant to argue with you, please forgive
Girl I need you in my life and the reason is
Chorus
Ya see my moonshine she keeps me warm when it rains
I forget my problems when she eases the pain
And my friends keep telling me to call it a day
She don't love you savage its all in ya brain
See I don't believe a word that you say to my face
I'm in love and I know she feels the same
I'll buy you all the ice you want, and I'll keep you safe
Man I love my alcohol, what more can I say
Chorus

He was just mad cool, he came up to me
Real big chain, lotta ice on his neck
I thought he was gonna have an ego
"Yo Serch, I'm Big Sean, big fan
I just wanna say, 'What's up'
You know I'm signed to G.O.O.D. Music"
It was mad cool and my wife and kids were with me
And my wife turns to me, she goes, "Who's that?"
I said, "Oh, it's Big Sean, you know, he's signed to Kanye"
She said, "Wow, he's a good kid"
I was like, "Yeah, nah, definitely a grown man"
And then he comes to the show and he's just- he killed it
He kills it off the head, he kills it free-styled
You know, it just shows why he was signed
Why Kanye signed him, man, he's a good dude
And I really hope he has the impact I believe he's gonna have
In upcoming years, in this-this culture
And in hip hop, so make sure you pay attention

[Outro: MC Serch]

Feat. Wiley

[Chorus:]
I'm loving every minute
Loving every minute of this life
I feel so alive
I feel so alive

[Verse 1:]
Put the flag in the sign
Toast of my achievement
I'm turning on the music frequent
So far so good with the numbers and actions
Looking at the figures eastern
Within a hundred 40k in a week
That's the kind of form I was seekin
Bad luck for songs I Was leaking
Now when I eat tell 'em all what I'm peeking
Done the under crown battle and beefing
Burn rays didn't get paid that's free chip
Now I have a tone and the roads look teeth in
Until I thank God that I been here
I ain't given up till I get there
On a beat 2 children and a dead chair
Came back made it I sat down I'm still Wiley
But I got kids now

[Chorus x2:]
I'm loving every minute
Loving every minute of this life
I feel so alive
I feel so alive

[Verse 2:]
Always on the grind no breaks in the 'lac
LA in a dash, pumpin that bass in the back
Lean back, can't believe where we at
Just yesterday, slanging cd's like crack on the streets like rats
Now rats wanna buy my cheese all good, you can eat the jag
I'm bumping my own shit
I still can't believe it
Been winning so hard
My stripes is bleeding my adidas
I'm living all out and I want you to feel it
From the paper to the speakers
To my prayers, Thank You, Jesus

[Chorus x2:]
I'm loving every minute
Loving every minute of this life
I feel so alive
I feel so alive

[Verse 3:]
Round the world then back again
More hits more chicks no accidents
You absent, no access
Here to speak as bleed when I might check
Mic check 1, 2
I bless the beat hot too
As uncle Snoop he was there too
On a world tour, where were you?
Every day I'm trucking promise I won't stop for nothing
My heart beat here like percussion
But I love it all or nothing
Poppin' dish with the wakers
See I went in with the Lakers
Put my dreams down a paper
But paper bring out the haters

[Chorus x2:]
I'm loving every minute
Loving every minute of this life
I feel so alive
I feel so alive

[Hook]
I'm just sittin' watching tv
Who's that looking through my window
Now they knockin' at my do'
I'm not who you lookin' fo'

[Intro]
One two
Trek life y'all
Far East Movement
Damn cops man

[Vers 1: Trek Life]
Man, all I'm trying to do is just drive my car
Turn my beats up and rhyme these bars
But even when I abide by laws
You run my plates just to find my flaws
Now I understand stopping crime's your job
But since I ain't a criminal
And I don't rob or steal from anyone
Don't bother me dawg
Bustin' U-turns to follow me far up the street
With your hand on your heat, now what's that for
I ain't a thug just because I got a hat on
Don't pull me over just to act like an asshole
And if you don't believe my answers what you ask for
My skin color and police are like past foes
When they was hanging us from trees with a lasso
They oversee a steady beat on my ass yo
But when I call y'all in need man y'all react slow, damn!

[Hook]
Im just sittin' watching tv
Who's that looking through my window
Now they knocking at my do'
Im not who you lookin' fo'
Officer get offa' me
Officer get offa' me
I'm just doin' my thing, let me be
Officer get offa' me

[Verse 2: Kev Nish]
It ain't the way I walk, the way I talk
But when it comes to two-eleven I'm the brother they want
I do a record with Trek, I sweat like Mike
I'm the extraordinary type of brother you like
They ain't tryna hear that (Who?), Officer Jack Move
Got me on the hood wanted for something I can't do
'Cause I got a bald head two hands and two feet
Plus the dude was Japanese so it's gotta be me
They toss me in the backseat like a hooker on vine
Yo guess who's sittin' next to me, my man Trek Life

[Trek Life]
Man, this is bullshit dawg, it just ain't right
Both of us locked up on the same damn night
They pulled me over tellin' me I made an illegal right

[Kev Nish]
They told me I'm the guy they looking for because of my eyes
Then they took us to jail saying we all look alike
'Cause we damn good looking and we doin' alright

[Hook]
Im just sittin' watching tv
Who's that looking through my window
Now they knocking at my do'
Im not who you lookin' fo'
Officer get offa' me
Officer get offa' me
I'm just doin' my thing, let me be
Officer get offa' me

[Verse 3: J-Splif & Prohgress]
Ring, ring, pick up the phone
If it's the bill collector tell him I ain't home
I ain't got a bankroll you heard me singin' the blues
But if they really want it, I got I.O.U.'s
You don't really gotta stress about the cash I'm making
Couldn't really get me for no tax evasion
I get letters saying that they need a payment
I write them right back, tell 'em please be patient
You getting what you give, yeah you got what you wanted
None of y'all are fam' I ain't keepin' a promise
What do you expect from a kid who's in college
Ya I got a lotta' credit so you know i'ma charge it
New rims, DVDs, lava lamps
And if I need some weed get a cash advance
Yo I think we hit our limit, man we maxed out
How we gon' pay it off?
Man we assed out

[Hook]
Im just sittin' watching tv
Who's that looking through my window
Now they knocking at my do
Im not who you lookin' fo'
Officer get offa' me
Officer get offa' me
I'm just doin' my thing, let me be
Officer get offa' me

[Outro]

[Cops 1] Yeah it's the wrong fucking guys, we gotta let 'em go

[Cop 2] Awwww, fuck!

[Verse 1]
I can't believe that it's real
The way that you made me feel
A burning deep down inside
(A burning deep inside)
A love that I cannot hide

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's you honey baby, yeah
(I know it's you honey baby)
That makes the world go round
And it's keeping me here loving you, baby
Laying all my troubles down

[Chorus]
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Take me by the hand, baby
Oh, show me, here I am, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh, it always ends up this way
(This way, this way, this way)
Me begging you every day
From love that I cannot hide
(From love that I can't hide)
You broke my heart into half

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it's you and me baby, yeah
(I know it's you and me, baby)
That makes the world go round
Keeping me here loving you, baby
Laying all my troubles down

[Chorus]
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, oh, come and take me

[Outro]
Ooh, come and take me, oh
Ooh
Here I am, baby, baby, come and take me, ooh-hoo
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby
Here I am, baby, come and take me
You did a really rotten thing
And let Scout take all the blame
You wrecked his reputation
And left that poor boy in shame
Yeah, but now I think it's time
To show who really did the crime
Kent Marlow, you're a dirty, lyin', worthless hunk of slime

Kent Marlow, you're a dirty, cheatin'
Lyin', no good, lousy, stinkin'
Back stabbin', scum suckin', worthless hunk of slime
Now, you won't find me braggin'
'Bout my big green station wagon
Or tellin' 'bout the traffic laws I'm breakin'
Everybody knows that I wouldn't dare
Match my wits with a red Corvair
And just the thought of a Pinto leaves me shakin'

Now, I don't think that I could hack
Drivin' a big white Cadillac
With ripped up upholstery and unnecessary frills
No, I don't think that I could bear
Drivin' somethin' other than a Belvedere
In a Belvedere I can really get my thrills

Goin' Belvedere cruisin' tonight
Just watch me pass that Porsche on the right
I can take you anywhere
In my 1964 Belvedere
Goin' Belvedere cruisin' tonight

I don't think that I could cruise
In one of those small VW's
Or zip along the highway in a classy pickup truck
There's somethin' 'bout a Comet
That makes me wanna vomit
And those Datsuns just ain't worth a Fudgesicle, no
Goin' Belvedere cruisin' tonight
You got nothin' to lose but your life
It can take away your blues
All you've gotta do is cruise
In my big black Plymouth Belvedere tonight

With red upholstery
Goin' Belvedere cruisin' tonight, yes indeed
Woo, goin' Belvedere cruisin' tonight
Yeah, goin' Belvedere cruisin' tonight

One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Baby, love never felt so good

Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so fine

Baby, love never felt so good (Oh good, uh-huh, uh-huh, mmm)

[Verse 3]
Oh baby, love never felt so fine
And I’d doubt if it was mine, all mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so good, so good
And I’d doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

[Refrain 3]
And the nights, that feels good
Gotta fly, gotta see
Can't believe
I can't take it

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, every time I love you
It's in and out my life, in and out, baby
Tell me if you really love me
It's in and out my life, driving me crazy
Cause baby, love never felt so good

[Outro]
Got what you got, so good
Oh it never felt so good
Never felt so good
Don't you know, it never felt so good
Never felt so good (Yeah, yeah)
It never felt so good
Never felt so good (Yeah)

We all used to call him, Jimmy the Geek
He was a dumb lookin', scrawny, little four-eyed freak
He never used to hang around with the guys
He'd just sit in the corner, attractin' the flies
He wasn't much to look at, he never was very bright
But at least there was one thing that he could do all right
That boy could dance, that boy could dance, yeah
He was kind of a jerk, he was kind of a bore
But the women would scream when he walked in the door
Cause one thing I could tell you for sure
That boy could dance
Picking teams, he would always be last
He couldn't run very far, he couldn't think very fast
If he was on your side, you'd always lose
That guy had a problem, even tying his shoes
He never passed his drivers test, he was always afraid of cars
And he had a complexion that resembled the surface of Mars
But that boy could dance, but that boy could dance, yeah
Well, his hair was a mess and his clothes didn't fit
He smelled pretty bad and he drooled just a bit
But you gotta admit
Boy, that boy could dance
Now that boy is much older
He got his own dance studio
He got a Teeny Bopper fan club
Yeah, he got his own TV show
Now he owns half of Montana
They all call him 'Diamond Jim'
And you know I'd do anything if I could be just like him
Cause that boy could dance, that boy could dance
That boy could dance
That boy could dance
That boy could dance

(*talking*)
That's what it is, "The Sound of Revenge"
Summer 2005 nigga, whoooooo

[Chamillionaire]
Gimmick rappers, can't lie forever
But as long as I'm here, gimmick rappers gon die together
Told lil' mama I love drama, no one tried to tell her
She shoulda left the club, instead of trying to find a fella
The villain's born, dark storms that's my kind of weather
Sending gimmick niggas to the mall, to go buy umbrellas
Like Eminem was telling them, that they should die it yella
Some of my fans they look like Cham, but say I am better
Picture the though of that, since no one spit a harder rap
I told 'em that I'm Jehova's lil' brother, the God of rap
Don't play me like you a atheist, face it it's more fact
Gimmick rappers have heart attacks, when you tell 'em that God is back
The problem is more than that, like Iraq when the gats in em
You diss me you gon be done, like a snack when the rats get em
After the baptism, the black in the black hit em
No need for that gat, cause fact is the raps kill em
Live your life like a mockery, niggas will see the prophecy
Stare at a flight of stairs, 'fore you ever think you on top of me
Nigga how could you possibly, think that you could be stopping me
Destiny couldn't stop me, I move and that hoe be watching me
Fans are no longer crying to see, Jay-Z throw up the dynasty
Not big as that nigga Jigga, but nigga tell 'em it's time for me
Rap game is dying to me, I'm the rapper they trying to see
I could bring it back, not only force-ably but violently
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing from Houston
The truth and I'm in the booth, and your truth is a big illusion
What you choosing if you're choosing, to jump into the confusion
You losing and end up choosing, and cruise it into a bruising nigga
(*talking*)
I'm peeping out here in these streets, and I see these old
Record labels trying to advance, trying to drop old material
On a nigga, so instead of Controversy Sells we gon switch it up
Summer 2005, "The Sound of Revenge"

[Chamillionaire]
Then they said on the radio, I ain't beefing with rappers no mo'
But tell 'em to go correct it, cause rappers be acting homo
Came in and screaming duo, I'm leaving and screaming solo
Disrespecting the logo's a no-no, I'll leave you rojo
Hey that's red in Spanish, real niggas'll never vanish
We rise up and then we ride up on haters, prepare to panic
Put ya teflon on, you better go get it plant it
Rip off your chest piece, to make niggas remember Janet
Ay log on the net, type in "the villain" and search
And realize why gimmick rappers is hurt, cause the truth hurts
And you jerks (you jerks), is a package of skirts
Put your little advance, back in your purse ha-ha
That nigga say he don't like me, he acting like he a wifey
Ain't held a pistol, acting like he the type that'll snipe me
You don't like me invite me, you don't like me come fight me
And if you can't afford the flight, and you don't like me then write me
I ain't concerned, with any of your concerns
I'm trying to stack, plack on top of plack like gum germs
I got enough tongue twisters, to make the tongue turn
Make the sun burn, I'm so hot I could give it sun burn
So call up, Kay Slay and ask him who is
The trillest to spit it, then call up DJ Whoo-Kid
DJ Drama, Vlad Green, Lantern and Kool-Kid
Tell 'em it's time to switch they playlist up, with the new kid
What's his name, Chamillitary mayn
(*talking*)
Yeah, the hardest rap nigga and if you beg to differ
Step to the mic, and spit some'ing sicker nigga
Ha-ha, Chamillitary mayn
I met her on the walk way
Stared as she walked pass
She looked back at me side ways and said
I can't help but to ask
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

We end up going back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a negligee
We hit off until the mornning
Until you hear her say

(AKON)
Mama se
Mama sa, mama coo sa
Mama se, mama sa
Mama coo sa x10

[Verse 1]
Risin' above the city, blocking out the noonday sun
It dwarfs the mighty redwoods and it towers over everyone
I still remember when that delivery truck came down our block
What a lucky guy, I hear he got the last one in stock
And the neighbors are just green
They say, "That's the biggest screen we've ever seen!"

[Chorus]
It's Frank's 2000" TV (Frank's 2000" TV)

The picture's crystal clear and everything is magnified

Everybody in the town
Can hear those 90,000 watts of Dolby sound
And I'm mighty proud to say
Now I can watch "The Simpsons" from thirty blocks away

Finger food and an ice-cold keg
It won't cost you an arm and a leg
Dance all night to a rotten band
Come on, people, let's give 'em a hand
Well, Saturday night it's the place to be
Everybody cut footloose with me

[Chorus]
At the party at the Leper colony
Oh, there's a party at the Leper colony
Hey!

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 2]
Met a little lady, so pretty and young
She was quite a talker till the cat got her tongue
She oozed up beside me, I turned on my charm
Ooh, pretty soon, she was completely disarmed
I said, "Girl, now don't fall to pieces on me"
But she cried her eyes out literally

[Chorus]
At the party at the Leper colony
Oh, there's a party at the Leper colony
Hey! Hey!

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3]
Hey now, buddy, don't you give me no lip
Sorry I was using your head for dip
There's a guy in the hot tub, I don't know who
Wait a minute, it looks like Stu
Well, hold the phone now, what do I see?
Another pretty mama got her eye on me

[Chorus]
At the party at the Leper colony
Oh, there's a party at the Leper colony
There's a party at the Leper colony
(Party at the Leper colony)
There's a party at the Leper colony

[Saxophone Solo]
Dream when you're feeling blue
Oh, dream, that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream when the day is through
Oh, dream, they just might come true
You know things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream

[Chorus: Alvaro]
Show me love
Show me light
You're everything that I wanna speak

Crawl out make it pop now
Live like EDC

To make it feel like New Years Eve
Dirty bass up, 'till you pass out
Living wild young and crazy

[Verse 2: J-Splif]

[Proghess]
Yo, boomin' is how I bling
She slows right by the beach
This is how I do it
With my low funk sleezy E
Booming is how I live
Not the beach soft ball of shit
Turned up when I'm at the crib
Saw your basses drop to this
Like this

[Outro]
Every night
Every night we goin hard until we see the light
If you sexy you and me tonight

Dirty Bass

[Verse 1]
Found a job in a great big office
And I really love this place
I got my, my very own Scotch tape dispenser
And I got a private parking space, ha
And I got a coffee mug with my, with my name right on it
In big bold letters so everyone knows it's mine
Don't even touch it cause it doesn't belong to you
I'm watching you, so don't get funny

[Chorus]
I'm climbing up, up the corporate ladder
Watch out, it's dog eat dog
Nose against the grindstone, it feels alright
Watch out, well, it's dog eat dog
Here we go

[Verse 2]
I love to watch my boss get angry
So I can count the veins in his neck, ha
Every day is like a picnic
Every Friday, get a check
Well, do I smell jelly donuts? This is my lucky day
I'll have some coffee with a carcinogenic sweetener
Hold on a minute, just one more jelly donut
They'll never miss it, no, they'll never miss it

[Chorus]
I'm climbing up, up the corporate ladder
Watch out, well, it's dog eat dog
Nose against the grindstone, it feels alright
Watch out, hey, well, it's dog eat dog

[Bridge]
Sometimes I can't believe this is all really happening
Sometimes I can't believe that I'm really sitting here
Sometimes I tell myself, "This is not my beautiful stapler"
Sometimes I tell myself, "This is not my beautiful chair"

[Verse 3]
Nobody's sure what I do here
And that's just fine with me
Five o'clock is here much too soon now
Cause I just never wanna leave
I can bend paper clips into the shapes of small animals
Maybe I could get on, on David Letterman
I think I made a big mistake
Where's my liquid paper? Where's my liquid paper?

[Chorus]
I'm climbing up, way up the corporate ladder now
Watch out, it's dog eat dog
Nose against the grindstone, it feels alright
Better be careful now, it's dog eat dog
Watch me work, hey, hey, stand back now
Look out, mama, it's dog eat dog
Nose against the grindstone, it feels real good
Hey, dog eat dog
Here we go, dog eat dog
Say, dog eat dog
Hey, hey, dog eat dog
Say, dog eat dog
Here we go, dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
For strip clubs only baby
Parental discretion is advised
Hahaha
For the strip clubs all over the world
Ladies you know i'ma keep it 100 wit' ya
Fellas you gotta tip the ladies baby, let that money go baby
Toss them 1's in the air
Now you can blame it on the alcohol
You can blame it on your blonde...
Blame it on whatever you want
As long as you end up in the back seat of my car
Cause I already know who you are
You're the neighbourhood superstar
You got nothing to hide
Your dress is so tight
I can see what's up under that bra
You wanna give it to me
But you don't wanna say it out loud
You're talking to me in that body language
And you're telling me to get up out of this crowd
Now lil mama are you wit' it

Cause my main girl is my back up
I ain't here to fall in love
Just tryin' to bust a nut real quick and get back up
I expect to get treated
The same way i'm treating you
Grind all my staff and take all my cash
Spend it all on you
I know how the game goes
Get what you pay for
Got a pocket full of money
Just waiting for you honey
Now go and get your back skirt
Now lil mama are you wit' it

Both leave here happy and we get something from it

Make yourself, don't break yourself

Be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Don't be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Don't be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
Time to face off, B-B-Break you off
From your head to your shoulders you can't shake me off
New kid on the corner ain't the same old song
I'm a punk on the mission just to piss you off
You mad 'cause I exist son, I walk the walk
Hearing the way you talk, bite like a real dog
Struggling half- ass will leave you lined in chalk
I'm giving it all I got, if you step I stomp
I got, nothing to lose but my, 2 pairs of shoes
So I'm, breaking you fools with my S-Sonic Boom!
Wake up the troops, lace up my boots
Shake up the juice, time's up I got a job to do

[Hook]
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Don't be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Don't be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not

[Verse 2: Prohgress]
Things getting heavy these days, I tried to call my mama
But she ain't wanna deal with all the drama
Gotta to get paid, that's the keynote
So I can grab a smoke with my chili cheese fritos
I need to breathe homie, back on up
Independent as what, you can check my trucks
Rolling down the slope going 95
And I ain't need Superman to come and save my life
'Cause I'm free when I'm falling, free for my calling
Grab the microphone and I'm Yiggy-yes ya'll in
For no one else, this is for myself
So raise your damn hands up to the sky like you need help

[Hook]
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Don't be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Don't be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not

[Verse 3: J-Splif]
Final shot, 4th quarter go and give me the ball
It's a mismatch, isolation, clear the floor
With the eye of the tiger, heart of a champion
Step to the clutch when my number is called
I've been grinding on the streets like some worn out breaks
Get my superhero on I done brought the cape
Nonstop evolution got progression to make
And I'm taking your goods, bulldozing my way
Give me this, give me that, with cheese li'l busta
Wrong place wrong time young hustla
Another day I put my life on this game
Do the impossible sit on top of the chain

[Hook]
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Don't be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Don't be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Make yourself, don't break yourself
Be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not
Don't be afraid 'cause I'm somethin' you're not

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Make yaself, Don't break yaself

[Chorus]x2
See im a real G from head to toe
The whole West Coast to let you know
Got a floor that seeks Namonia
Never will i live California

Poppin, scrapes, scrapin, old school swanging, triple gold degons
Hustlers hustle gangsters banging
Whatch fo colour you wear and watch for u hangin
Whatch for you claiming its B's and C's
This is G's is more than palm trees and weed
Is more than movie stars and models
Is more than Holleywood Boulevard and Roscoes
More like east-side browns pat and vato
Take it up north to the bay when we ghosts ride out locs
Your boy flow colder Tahoe then Robie out Roscoes got a pacaralo
Side show 24's on this shure box
Gass stepped brake everybody shake it real lops
And give it up for Mac Dre and Pac

Was the chicken straight without the sauce?

[Chorus]x2
Westside westside G's throw your setzi
And represent from felix midgeon tooky
To my dudes in the pen

[itenciary] to my youngsters in groovy

Ice cubes on my neck pack a mac10 uzzy
Only pussy vertical high like AMG
Cause its funky enough like DOC
Young duzine like Eazy-E
And the whole Cali will love it like Tupac and Dre
Top dog like SN double O P
Daz and Kurupt raised gin like the DPG
I used to pack a hammer tricked crooked eye
Y'all make me a rapper a hammer a crooked eye
I like my mommma new ports banging too shorts
Back in 86' when rappers all new born
Cool man spice one dangerous thing
Richie Rich for them boss
Niggas slanging the cain
But on seat is like keep the sneak
We get that mailman like 40 bleed the streets
Out Cali..

[Chorus]x2
REG IME LBC yeah that's me
I do been high since the day of dust shack
The hood done fashion bricks and big masters
Gone fresh coes got swagged your big dad
Gang bang started with the tribe to plee at
Kicked down at door ripped up the floor
First motherf**kers to rap for Sign Moore
Now be back take a look and face it
The Julio Cezar chapped before this rap shit
To inverce with my toughts i'm a classic
All school rap daddy on your caskets

[Chorus]x2
Potato skins, potato cakes
Hash browns and instant flakes
Baked or boiled or French fried
There's no kind, you haven't tried
You planned a trip to Idaho (Woah-oh)
Just to watch potatoes grow
I understand how you must feel
I can't deny, they've got appeal

Whoa, you like them whether they are plain or they're stuffed
Oh, yeah
Better face the facts, it seems you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to spuds

Your greasy hands, your salty lips
Looks like you found the chips
Your belly aches, your teeth grind
Some tater tots would blow your mind
And you don't mind if they're not cooked
You need your fix, I guess you're hooked
And late at night you always dream
Of bacon bits and sour cream
Whoa, you like them even if they're lumpy or tough
Oh, yeah
Whee, it's pretty obvious to me, you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to spuds

Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, you're addicted to spuds
Oh, yeah

I'm givin' up, it's just no use
Another case of spud abuse
What can I say? What can I do?
Potato bug has got me too, wahoo

I used to hate them, now they're all that I eat
Oh, yeah
Wee, I've often seen them whipped, but they just can't be beat Now I'm gonna have to face it, I'm addicted to spuds

Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Might as well face it, I'm addicted to spuds
Im Facing trouble every day
Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle every day
Trying not to rob G's, Steal or Borrow

Verse 1:
I need to take it slow
My heart is growing cold
I'm trying to hide my feelings
From the people that I know
And everywhere I go I'm trying to lay low
Can't afford to get in no trouble because I'm on parole

I'm trying to live life right
God knows with all my might
But I'm just barely getting by
Cuz money's way too tight
And I can say this right
The struggle and the fight
It's weakin' all the muscles in my body like kryptonite
Making me feel like there is no other way
But the different streets get that dough
Living and praying for a better day…So!
Chorus (2X)
Im Facing trouble every day
Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle every day
Trying not to rob G's, Steal or Borrow

Verse 2:
Streets, I ain't no longer on it
Don't need feds all upon it
I done left that life alone
Cuz all I did was impress, my homie!
And then my conscience told me
"Careful you tendarone!"
Always complaining after I ain't never did
She always lonely. So what am I to do
Gotta get money for food, cuz if she starves to death
Then I gotta deal with her attitude
And I in that type of mood cuz I ain't type of dude
It's bad enough, I gotta deal with all this I'm going thru
It's making me feel like there is no other way
But the different streets get that dough
Hoping and praying for a better day…So!

Chorus (4X)
Im Facing trouble every day
Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow
It's a struggle every day
Trying not to rob G's, Steal or Borrow
Little ditty 'bout Homer & Marge
Her heart was as big as his stomach was large
Oh yeah, they say, "Love goes on
Long after the grilled cheese sandwich is gone"
That's the story 'bout Homer & Marge
Two folks I helped out for a nominal charge
After Homer went gay, they patched up their schism
But the dude never dealt with his alcoholism
Weird Al sayin', "Oh yeah, the credits go on
Long after the viewer's interest is gone"
Oh yeah, Weird Al had fun on this show
Even if it was just a brief cameo
I know you don't really want me to make it
I know you hate the fact that I'm so fly
And I see you like what you see and want to take it
I know you really don't wanna die
So come on and rock, come on and rock
You don't want anything to be your pain
So come on and rock, come on and rock
You got more to lose than you got to gain

I'm trying to understand the reason why you wanna hate Akon
Feel the beat, can't stop now
You trying to get in the way to make a nigga straight slow down
But you know we won't stop now
What about the crooked cops?
What about the liquor shops?
What about the things we do when it comes to holding down the block?
What about the fake ass hoes?
What about them with no clothes?
What about they'll do anything that you want them just show them the doe?
No matter where we go
There's no one above me
Akon and Filapine
We running the country
I know you want to see it
But you can't control us
So take my advice
If you can't beat us, then join us
I know you don't really want me to make it
I know you hate the fact that I'm so fly
And I see you like what you see and want to take it
I know you really don't wanna die
So come on and rock, come on and rock
You don't want anything to be your pain
So come on and rock, come on and rock
You got more to lose than you got to gain

I know they hating on me
Calm when it's plain to see
My enemy is close, used to be my friends
Don't know what to do, the murder's grave to me
But it's OK, I know I got it
Then you can see my style
Asiatic, do it like nobody ever did
I'm crunk, singing, riding in my car
Doing what I like and I don't care what they say
Don't know why they hate like that

Trying to take everything I got
I can see it in your eyes
I'm dancing on your mind
Well come round with me motherfucker can we do or die

[Verse]
Put down your remote control, throw out your TV guide
Put away your jacket, there's no need to go outside
Don't you know, that we control the horizontal
We control the vertical, too
We gonna make a couch potato out of you
That's what we going to do now

[Chorus]
Don't change the channel, don't touch that dial
We got it all on UHF
Kick off your sneakers, stick around for a while
We got it all on UHF
Don't worry 'bout your laundry, forget about your job
Just crank up the volume, and yank off the knob
We got it all
(We got it all)
We got it all on UHF

[Verse]
Disconnect the phone and leave the dishes in the sink
You better put away your homework, prime time ain't no time to think
All you do is make yourself a TV dinner
Press your face right up against the screen
We gonna show you things you ain't ever seen
If you know what I mean, now

[Chorus]
Don't change the channel, don't touch that dial
We got it all on UHF
Kick off your sneakers, stick around for a while
We got it all on UHF
Don't worry 'bout your laundry, forget about your job
Just crank up the volume, and yank off the knob

[Bridge]
You can watch us all day, you can watch us all night
You can watch us any time that you please
You can sit around and stare at the picture tube
'Til your brain turns into cottage cheese, well, now

[Chorus]
Don't change the channel, don't touch that dial
We got it all on UHF
Kick off your sneakers, stick around for a while
We got it all on UHF
Don't worry 'bout your laundry, forget about your job
Just crank up the volume, and yank off the knob
We got it all

We got it all on UHF
(We got it all on UHF) UHF 

[repeat to end]
My love is like footsteps in this snow, baby
I follow you everywhere you go, baby
The pain as light has come to wake you
But you will never realize
That I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby
I follow the winds that bring the cold, baby
I light a fire in your soul, baby
The lightest touch of feathers falling
My love may be invisible
But I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby
You're half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satellite
Your singing satellite
(Your singing satellite)
Your satellite
Your singing satellite
You're a half a world away
I'm stealing time from my own life
All the hours that God sends
I'm flying high on my red eye
And winding down the windows
My future is a Valentine
Stolen in the perfect crime
And I know I'm living out of line
But with a blazing smile I'll die
You're half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satellite
You're half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satellite
You're half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satellite
Feeling like a big dog

Feeling like a big dog
(Hey!) Oh, oh (Hey!)
Feeling like a big dog

[Verse 1]
Oh, I couldn't live a single day without you
Actually, on second thought, well, I suppose I could
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, honey, you're the greatest
Well, at any rate, I guess you're pretty good

[Verse 2]
Now, it seems to me I'm relatively lucky
I know I probably couldn't ask for too much more
I honestly can say you're an above-average lady
You're almost just what I've been looking for

[Chorus]
You're sort of everything I've ever wanted
You're not perfect, but I love you anyhow
You're the woman that I've always dreamed of
Well, not really but you're good enough for now

[Verse 3]
You're pretty close to what I've always hoped for
That's why my love for you is fairly strong
And I swear I'm never gonna leave you, darlin'
At least 'til something better comes along

[Chorus]
'Cause you're sort of everything I've ever wanted
You're not perfect, but I love you anyhow
You're the woman that I've always dreamed of
Well, not really but you're good enough for now

[Outro]
No, not really but you're good enough for now
A man of intrigue
He lives for the thrill
Always has places to go
And people to kill
Danger is the game he plays
And he holds every card
Cause if you wanna win
You gotta spy hard
A man of the world
So suave and discreet
He trips over women
Piled up at his feet
But evil's lurking
So he's always on his guard
Cause if your gonna spy
You better spy hard
He's always there
When the chips are beginning to fall
He wouldn't care if they kicked him and grabbed him and
Shot him and stabbed him and nailed both his ears to the wall
Facing death everyday
Is a tough job for any man
But his hours are flexible
And he's got a great dental plan
By the way if you walked in late
Allow me to reiterate
The name of this movie is
Spy Hard
They call it Spy Hard

Some girls like to buy new shoes
And others like drivin' trucks and wearing tattoos
There's only one thing that they all like a bunch
Oh, girls, they want to have lunch
Oh, girls just want to have lunch

[Crunching Noises]

I know how to keep a woman satisfied
When I whip out my diner's card their eyes get so wide
They're always in the mood for something to munch
Oh, girls, they want to have lunch
Oh, girls just want to have

That's all they really want
Some lunch
Don't ask 'em to dinner or breakfast or brunch
'cause girls, they want to have lunch
Oh, girls just want to have lunch

Girls, they want
Want to have lunch
Girls wanna have

[Squirting Noises]

She eats like she got a hole in her neck
And I'm the one that always gets stuck with the check
Can't figure out how come they don't weigh a ton
Oh, girls, they want to have lunch
Oh, girls just want to have

That's all they really want
Is some lunch
Don't know for certain but I've got a hunch
Those girls, they want to have lunch
Oh, girls just want to have lunch

Ooh, farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh

[Verse 1]
I found my happiest days
When you came to see your grandma in May
I bumped into you at the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now
Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
Bye-bye, don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry

[Chorus]
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget? No
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year when you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye-bye, don't turn around
You might see me cry

[Chorus]
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah

[Bridge]
Ooh, farewell, farewell
Ooh, farewell, farewell
If you remember my name (Drop a line)
Drop a line sometime, yeah, yeah, ooh
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you

[Verse 2 repeated]
When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget? No
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year when you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye-bye, don't turn around
You might see me cry

Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh yeah

Thanks to greta
I eat filet mignon seven times a day
My bathtub's filled with Perrier
What can I say?
This is the life
I buy a dozen cars when I'm in the mood
I hire somebody to chew my food
I'm an upwardly mobile dude
This is the life

They say that money corrupts you
But I can't really tell
I got the whole world at my feet
And I think it's pretty swell

I got women lined up outside my door
They've been waitin' there since the week before
Who could ask for more?
This is the life

You're dead for a real long time
You just can't prevent it
So if money can't buy happiness
I guess I'll have to rent it
Yeah, every day I make the front page news
No time to pay my dues
I got a million pairs of shoes
This is the life

I got a solid gold Cadillac
I make a fortune while I sleep
You can tell I'm a living legend
Not some ordinary creep

No way, I'm the boss, the Big Cheese
Yeah, I got this town on its knobby little knees
I can do just what I please
This is the life

That's right, I'm the king, number one
I buy monogrammed Kleenex by the ton
I pay the bills, I call the shots
I grease the palms, I buy the yachts
One thing I can guarantee
The best things in life, they sure ain't free
It's such a thrill just to be me
This is the life
This is the life
See I met her at club on the Friday
Big booty, small waist
Seeing her coming my way
So I had to bag her
I really had to have her (oh-ooh)
I didn't see a ring on her finger
I asked her have you ever been with a singer before
She said no (oh-ohh)
So let me introduce you to my world
Big diamonds and pearls all of part of being my girl
(I got that paper)
Bet you ain't never seen before
Saw around the world
I got them coming back for more
And that's when I noticed
People are watching!
But we don't care
The way I am touching your body
Cuz we don't care
See you droppin' and poppin'
But we don't care
Makes me want to keep grinding
But we don't care (oh-ooh)
See I bet you're nasty
When you're on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care!

Got shorty right where I want her
Strapped up, hands trapped in the corner
Grinding slow, and I won't let go (no-ooh)
Baby more better than ammonia
Feeling tipsy from the bottle of Corona (oh-noo)
She probably let go (oh-ooh)
She said she wants to bring me to bring me to her world
She whispers some words
That damn near made my toes curl
She said she's got that
That I have never seen before
And if I get the taste
I'll be coming right back for more
And that's when I noticed
People are watching!
But we don't care
The way I am touching your body
Cuz we don't care
See you droppin' and poppin'
But we don't care
Makes me want to keep grinding
But we don't care (oh-ooh)
See I bet you're nasty
When you're on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care!

I'm working your body
Like you are in my bedroom
Yeah…Yea…Uh-uhh…Yeah…Yeah
Everybody in the club got a clear view
But that won't stop us
Cuz we don't care!
People are watching!
We don't care
The way I am touching your body
Cuz we don't care
See you droppin' and poppin'
But we don't care
Makes me want to keep grinding
But we don't care (oh-ooh)
See I bet you're nasty
When you're on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!

Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
Fo Sho! Shawty we don't care!

Cause it's my destiny to be the King of Suede

[Outro:]
King of Suede
King of Suede
King of Suede
I'll always be King of Suede
I'll always be King of Suede
Never can say goodbye
No no no no
Never can say goodbye
Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so
That I never can say goodbye
No no no no
Never can say goodbye
Every time I think I've had enough
I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
That passes me right through the core
It says, "Turn around, you fool"
You know you'll love her more and more
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye
Oo oo, baby
I never can say goodbye
No no no
No no no, oo
Oh, I never can say goodbye
Oo oo, I never can say goodbye
No no no
No no no, oo
Never can say goodbye
No no no no
Never can say goodbye
I keep thinkin' that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And there's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's that same old, 'Did you hang up?
Can't do with you all the time'
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye, girl
Oo oo, baby
I never can say goodbye
No no no
No no no, oo
Oh, I'm never gonna say you goodbye, girl
Oo ho, I'm never gonna say you goodbye
No no no
No no no, oo
Oh no, I'm never gonna say you goodbye, girl
Oo oo, baby, I'm never gonna say you goodbye
No no no
No no no, oo oo

Nigga you don't want it
Cause we ain't the one
Bad men raised around scum
Nigga you don't want it
Illegal alien, and I kill people for fun
Nigga you don't want it I heard you pack a big gun
But when the beef come you run
Nigga you don't want it (cause you ain't a gangsta)
Said that you don't want it (cause you ain't a gangsta)

[Verse 1]
See when I come through niggas never asking "who the fuck's you"
Cause they can recognise bad man and crew
'Bout 50 thugs heat near you to put the dot on your head like a Hindu
White T's and my chicks rockin' short skirts
You can see the handgun through the t-shirt
Don't make me change your name to Joe Dirt
Cause we here to work

[Chorus]
Nigga you don't want it
Cause we ain't the one
Bad men raised around scum
Nigga you don't want it
Illegal alien, and I kill people for fun

Nigga you don't want it (cause you ain't a gangsta)
Said that you don't want it (cause you ain't a gangsta)

[Verse 2]
This nigga think he hard cause he pack a lil' heat
But like the music boy you will skip a beat
Fuck around with the wrong nigga on the street
You will fall asleep never wake up to eat
You don't want it you don't know now
Get the hell up off my ground, ohh
Life breaking out the beat on the next light
19 Gs on the bricks only if you want it
And that's the lowest I go
Get a better price on the dro cause oh
Got niggas from state to death row
Relaxed and waiting for me to blow
Cause you don't need it
The kinda drama we bring, the one that have your mom hiding
Nigga you don't need it
And I can see it in your eyes that you ain't no thug for life

[Chorus]
Nigga you don't want it
Cause we ain't the one

Nigga you don't want it
Illegal alien, and I kill people for fun

Said that you don't want it (cause you ain't a gangsta)

[Intro]
Melanie
What can the problem be?
Sweet Melanie
Why won't you go out with me?

[Verse 1]
She lived across the street
On the fifteenth floor of the Gilmore Building
I saw her in the shower reaching for some soap
I knew she had to be the girl for me
And to think I probably never would have found her
If I hadn't bought that telescope

[Chorus]
Oh, Melanie
What can the problem be?
Sweet Melanie
Why won't you go out with me?

[Verse 2]
I just can't understand it
Why won't you return my phone calls?
Are you still mad I gave a Mohawk to your cat?
If you'd just say the word
I'm certain that our love would last forever and ever
Or are you too dumb to realize that?

[Chorus]
Melanie
What can the problem be?
Sweet Melanie
Why won't you go out with me?

[Bridge]
How can you ignore me when you know
That I can't live without you?
I have to go through your garbage
Just to learn more about you
Melanie, ooh
Oh, sweet Melanie
Why won't you go out with me?

[Verse 3]
You weren't impressed when I tattooed
Your name across my forehead
You wouldn't listen when I promised to be true
I couldn't stand it, so I jumped out
From the sixteenth story window right above you
Now I may be dead but I still love you

[Chorus]
Melanie
What can the problem be?
Sweet Melanie
Why won't you go out with me?
Melanie
What can the problem be?
Sweet Melanie
Why won't you go out with me?

I'm singin' Melanie
What can the problem be?
Sweet, sweet Melanie
Why won't you go out with me?

I'm singin' Melanie
What can the problem be?
Sweet Melanie
Why won't you go out with me?

I'm singin' Melanie
What can the problem be?
Sweet Melanie
Why won't you go out with me?

Yo, I make girls jiggle, right down the middle
My girl's from Assadena, she ain't that ghetto
She likes to sip the pub, VIP at the club
But when it comes to bass, my girl got a banging trunk
Dig the way that you roll (dig the way that you roll)
Put your bass down low (put your bass down low)
You can come to the crib (you can come to the crib)
Leave your shoes at the door (Leave your shoes at the door)
You know what you're here for (You know what you're here for)
Hey girl, what you're here for? (Hey girl, what you're here for?)
Girl, shake that dirty bass 'cause real girls get down on the flow
I love that dirty bass

I'm going HAM when the beat drop
Got beef, eat it like a pork chop
And the bass go pump pump like a Reebok
Sitting so high in the Phantom like a tea cup
Hit thriller bang bang at the stage
Big Willie, chillin' on the big Willah
Your girl icky
Give me lick, licky, licky
No smalls, all biggie biggie
Umm... and she bop to the beat
Ba-back it up, hear the beep beep
Come to L.A., life on the beach
And she give me brain
Screech
Club poppin', dirty bass, girls droppin'
Young Money, cash, got it
And shake that ass, ass, ass!
Dunk it!
I dip low when I feel loco
Don't trip, make a dip like a lolo
Uh, make a dip like a lolo
Then I roll on, roll on
I love that dirty bass

I'll bang that woofer, if she's a looker
I'm cruising Hollywood & Vine, I don't want no hooker
I need a 5'4 freak for the set them free
Let's take it back to the motel, now I'm in too deep
I love that dirty bass
I love that, I love that

Once, not very long ago, I was respected, I was popular (popular, ooh)
But now I hang my head in shame (ahh, ooh)
My life is filled with such regret
A bad mistake I can't forget
And now I'll never be the same

Ringtone
Why did I buy this stupid ringtone?
I just can't imagine now what I was thinking at all (What was I thinking?)
My friends all stare at me whenever I get a call
Well, everybody (everybody)
Everybody (everybody)
Everybody in the world really hates my ringtone

When my phone goes off at work
I look like the biggest jerk
Total strangers wanna slap me around
When it's ringin' on the terrace
My neighbors get embarrassed
They're beggin' me to move outta town
Well, it made my wife so sick
She smashed my iPhone with a brick
But I had it fixed, and now it's just fine
It's a pain, I sure don't need it
And I probably should delete it
But for me that would be crossin' the line
'Cause I hate to waste a buck ninety nine
Hey, I paid good money for this...
Ringtone
Why did I buy this stupid ringtone?
I just can't imagine now what I was thinking at all (Really, what was I thinking?)
My friends all stare at me whenever I get a call
Well, everybody (everybody)
Everybody (everybody)
Everybody in the world really hates my ringtone
Ringtone
Ringtone
Ahh, ooh

Chinese factory workers (they hate my ringtone)
Muslim women in burqas (really hate my ringtone)
Starvin' kids in Angola (they hate my ringtone)
Even folks with Ebola (just hate my ringtone)
All the nuns and nannies (all the welfare mothers)
All the Pakistanis (all the Wayans brothers)
Everyone on the land, everyone on the sea
Every single person everywhere unanimously

Everybody (everybody)
Everybody (everybody)
Everybody in the whole wide world really hates my
Ringtone... ringtone... ringtone... ringtone... ringtone... ringtone...

The white stuff, the white stuff

The first one was a sweet one
Second one was a blast
Soon I finished off the bag, ate 'em up real fast
You can see 'em in my teeth
Tell it when I talk
Had so many my pancreas just went into shock

I love the white stuff, baby
In the middle of an Oreo
I love the white stuff, baby
It's the most delicious thing I know

I've had a zillion or two
In my life, they're so right
My teeth are all rotted clear through
But who cares? What else am I supposed to do?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oreo
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the white stuff
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oreo
What's in the middle? The white stuff
The first time that I tried it
Got a big sugar buzz
Nothing gets me high as that sandwich cookie does
But I love the filling most
I rub it on my roast
Mix it in with my coffee and spread it on my toast

I love the white stuff, baby
In the middle of an Oreo
I love the white stuff, baby
Take some with me everywhere I go

Might get a pimple or two
Well, so what? It's all right
Now Twinkies and Ding Dongs won't do
All I need, you know what it is

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oreo
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the white stuff
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oreo
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, the white stuff
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oreo
What's in the middle? The white stuff

I'd search the world over to find one
That had the exact same circumference as you
Your givin me true love
And everyday i thank the lord
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting so exciting

Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine, still i need a path because
I'm lost in a world
Made for you and me
Oooh...

Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
Ooooh... baby

Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Played sweet and tenderly
Everytime your lips meet mine, my baby
Baby, baby
I feel the joy begin
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now baby

Baby, baby
Those tears that filled my eyes
I cried not for myself
But for those who have never felt the joy of love

Baby, baby
Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Each time you speak of me
I hear a tender note so sweet of love

Baby, baby
As you stand there holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now

Baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
So close to me my baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
I hear a symphony

[Chorus]
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long

[Verse 1]
Couldn't think of any lyrics
No, I never wrote the lyrics
So, I'll just sing any old lyrics
That come to mind, child

You really need words
A whole lotta rhymin' words
You gotta write so many words
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it
To do it right, child

[Chorus]
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long

I know that you're probably sore
'Cause I didn't write anymore
I just didn't get to complete it
So that's why I gotta repeat it

[Bridge]
This song is just six words long

Oh, I make a lot of money
They pay me a ton of money
They payin' me plenty of money
To sing this song, child

I gotta fill time
Three minutes worth of time
Oh, how will I fill so much time
I'll throw in a solo, a solo, a solo, a solo
A solo here

[Chorus]
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long
This song is just six words long

This song's got nothing to say
But I'm recording it anyway
I know that if I put my mind to it
I know I can find a good rhyme here

Oh, you gotta have a music
You really need catchy music
This song's got plenty of music
But just six words, child

And so I'll sing them over
And over and over and over
And over and over and over
And over and over and over
And over, and over
And over again

Where have I been?
What should I be looking for?
What am I gonna be when I come of age?
Will I be strong?
Will I be a mighty man
Climb mountains if I can
When I come of age?

[Verse 1]
Hey y'all I think I'll be a movie star
Or travel to some distant star
Yeah that's it I'm gonna be an astronaut
And rock it to the moon
And then I'll be the captain of a giant ship
I'm gonna take a long, long trip to far off land
When I become a man

[Chorus]
And what about love?
Will you still be in love with me?
I sure hope you will be
When I come of age
And will you be true?
Will you still want to marry me?
I guess I'll have to wait and see
When I come of age

[Verse 2]
My folks say I'm too young for love
But they don't seem to understand
That what I feel is the love for somebody
A feeling I understand
And while I've got this feeling
It's you, girl, you're so grand
And I'll love you girl just as strong
When I become a man


Wait, be patient honey
You've got to believe in me
Wait, wait for me baby
It'll be just you and me
We'll do all the things
We couldn't do before
When, when I come of age
(We're gonna be so happy)
When, when I come of age

When, when I come of age
Ooh when, when I come of age
When, when I come of age
When, when I come of age

From MB
They showed up on my doorstep
Just a couple weeks ago
They looked so sweet and harmless
Tell me, how was I to know
They got a little too close to the microwave
And then much to my surprise
They grew to forty thousand times their original size
They started mutatin' right before my eyes, oh my

Attack of the radioactive hamsters from a planet near Mars
A race from a distant place
They came in UFOs shaped just like Cuban cigars
Man oh man, you oughta hear 'em squeal
Now the whole wide world is their exercise wheel
Attack of the radioactive hamsters from a planet near Mars

The president, he's is a panic
The Pentagon, they're in shock
There's a team of research scientists
They got 'em workin' 'round the clock
Now the National Guard is out in my backyard
And the Marines'll be comin' around
I hope they get this lousy rodents out of my town
Cause the property values are goin' way down now
Attack of the radioactive hamsters from a planet near Mars
They're back and they're lookin' for a snack
And they're not that fond of Burger Kings or salad bars
I hope they're not plannin' to stay
Who invited them here anyway
Attack of the radioactive hamsters from a planet near Mars

Well, well, look at that hamster, he's as big as a blimp
And there's one the size of Central Park
They're using telephone poles to pick their teeth
They're evil and nasty and they glow in the dark
Oh, don't waste any more of your bullets, boys
You know it just makes 'em mad when you shoot
They're gonna stomp us into jelly and conquer the world
But you gotta admit, they're really kinda cute, now

Attack of the radioactive hamsters from a planet near Mars

OC(huh)
Its about to get hot!
US(huh)
Its about to get hot!
All this (huh)
And the beat it don't stop
We keep rockin it
We keep rockin it

Everybody watching her
The way she sway to the beat
From the left to the right
Tryin to see what up with her
Who's the lucky man who gonna have a wild for the night
I wanna say she's eyein me
But I can't really tell cause its dark in the place
So I'm watching shorty quietly
And I'm thinkin to myself should I chill or should I chase

I could tell by the way she looked at me
She was somebody who could be
The type that I need in my world
Let me tell you, sonny. Let me set you straight
You kids today ain't never had it rough
Always had everything handed to you on a silver plate
You lazy brats think nothing's good enough
Well, nobody ever drove me to school when it was ninety degrees below
We had to walk butt naked through forty miles of snow
Worked in the coal mine twenty two hours a day for just half a cent
Had to sell my internal organs just to pay the rent

When I was your age. When I was your age
When I was your age. When I was your age

Let me tell you something, you whiny little snot
There's something wrong with all you kids today
You just don't appreciate all the things you've got
We were hungry, broke and miserable
And we liked it better that way
There were seventy-three of us living in a cardboard box
All I got for Christmas was a lousy bag of rocks
Every night for dinner we had a big chunk of dirt
If we were really good we didn't get dessert
When I was your age. When I was your age
When I was your age. When I was your age

Didn't have no telephone didn't have no FAX machine
All we had was a couple of cans and a crummy piece of string
Didn't have no swimming pool when I was just a lad
Our neighbor's septic tank was the closest thing we had
Didn't have no dental floss had to use old rusty nails
Didn't have Nintendo, we just poured salt on snails
Didn't have no water bed, had to sleep on broken glass
Didn't have no lawnmower, we used our teeth to cut the grass
What's the matter now, sonny, you say you don't believe this junk?
You think my story's wearin' kinda thin?
I tell you one thing, I never was such a disrespectful punk
Back in my time, we had a thing called discipline
Dad would whop us every night till a quarter after twelve
Then he'd get too tired and he'd make us whop ourselves
Then he'd chop me into pieces and play frisbee with my brain
And let me tell ya, Junior, you never heard me complain

When I was your age. When I was your age
When I was your age. When I was your age
Well, I had two weeks of vacation time coming
After working all year down at 'Big Roy's Heating And Plumbing'
So one night when my family and I were gathered 'round the dinner table
I said, "Kids
If you could go anywhere in this great big world now
Where'd you like to go ta?"
They said, "Dad
We wanna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota!"
They picked the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

So the very next day we loaded up the car
With potato skins and pickled wieners
Crossword puzzles, Spider-Man comics
And mama's homemade rhubarb pie
Pulled out of the driveway
And the neighbors, they all waved good-bye
And so began our three-day journey

We picked up a guy holding a sign that said, "Twine Ball or Bust"
He smelled real bad, and he said his name was Bernie
I put in a Slim Whitman tape
My wife put on a brand new hair net
Kids were in the back seat jumping up and down
Yelling, "Are we there yet?"
And all of us were joined together in one common thought
As we rolled down the long and winding interstate
In our '53 DeSoto
We're gonna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
We're headin' for the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
Oh, we couldn't wait to get there
So we drove straight through for three whole days and nights
Of course, we stopped for more pickled wieners now and then
The scenery was just so pretty
Boy, I wish the kids could've seen it
But you can't see out of the side of the car
Because the windows are completely covered
With the decals from all the places
Where we've already been
Like Elvis-O-Rama, the Tupperware Museum
The Boll Weevil Monument and Cranberry World
The Shuffleboard Hall Of Fame, Poodle Dog Rock
And The Mecca of Albino Squirrels
We've been to ghost towns, theme parks, wax museums
And the place where you can drive through the middle of a tree
We've seen alligator farms and tarantula ranches
But there's still one thing we gotta see

Well, we crossed the state line about 6:39
And we saw the sign that said, "Twine Ball exit, fifty miles"
Oh, the kids were so happy
They started singing "99 Bottles Of Beer On The Wall"
For the twenty-seventh time that day
So, we pulled off the road at the Last Chance Gas Station
Got a few more pickled wieners and a diet chocolate soda
On our way to see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
We're gonna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
Finally, at 7:37 early Wednesday evening
As the sun was setting in the Minnesota sky
Out in the distance, on the horizon
It appeared to me like a vision before my unbelieving eyes
I parked the car and walked with awe-filled reverence
Toward that glorious, huge, majestic sphere
I was just so overwhelmed by its sheer immensity
I had to pop myself a beer

Yes, on these hallowed grounds
Open ten to eight on weekdays
In a little shrine under a makeshift pagoda
There sits the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
I tell you, it's the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

Oh
What on earth would make a man decide to do that kind of thing?
Oh
Windin' up twenty-one thousand, one hundred forty pounds of string
What was he trying to prove?
Who was he trying to impress?
Why did he build it? How did he do it?
It's anybody's guess
Where did he get the twine?
What was goin' through his mind?
Did it just seem like a good idea at the time?
Well, we walked up beside it and I warned the kids
"Now, you better not touch it, those ropes are there for a reason"
I said, "Maybe if you're good, I'll tie it to the back of our car
And we can take it home"
But I was only teasin'
Then we went to the gift shop and stood in line
Bought a souvenir miniature ball of twine
Some window decals, and anything else they'd sell us
And I bought a couple postcards
"Greetings from the twine ball, wish you were here!"
Won't the folks back home be jealous?

I gave our camera to Bernie and we stood by the ball
And we all gathered 'round and said, "Cheese!"
Then Bernie ran away with my brand new Instamatic
But at least we got our memories

So we all just stared at the ball for a while
And my eyes got moist, but I said with a smile
"Kids, this here's what America's all about"
Then I started feelin' kinda gooey inside
And I fell on my knees and I cried and cried
And that's when those security guards threw us out

You know, I bet if we unraveled that sucker
It'd roll all the way down to Fargo, North Dakota
Cause it's the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
I'm talkin' 'bout the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

Well, we stayed that night at the Twine Ball Inn
In the morning, we were on our way home again
But we really didn't want to leave, that was perfectly clear
I said, "Folks, I can tell you're all sad to go"
Then I winked my eye and I said, "You know
I got a funny kind of feelin'
We'll be comin' back again next year"
Cause I've been all around this great big world
And I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather go ta
Than the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
I said the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
Minnesota
Minnesota
Minnesota

[Verse 1]
If I had a penny
For every time I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel
For everytime I didn't understand
I'd be the world's poorest millionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you already knew
If I had only reached out
I might still be touching you

[Chorus]
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you

[Verse 2]
I would get embarrased
For every time a movie made you cry
You get sentimental
And I would never know the reason why
I'd hold the world's highest record
For my selfish pride
Is it really over?
Can I get close to you?
I only want to show you
That I've learned a thing or two

[Chorus]
Touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
Where'd you learn how to steer?
You do 80 in second gear
When you drive, I can't relax
Got your license from Cracker Jacks
You just hit another tree
These fender benders are killin' me

She drives like crazy
Like no-one else
She drives like crazy
And I'm afraid for myself

They'll put you behind bars
We're not playin' bumper cars
Did a great figure eight
In the middle of the interstate
Tires squeal wherever we go
Even hitchhikers just say no

She drives like crazy
Her car's a mess
She drives like crazy
She's got a death wish I guess
She's a demon behind the wheel
Thinks she's drivin' the Batmobile
Burnin' rubber in school zones
Runnin' over the traffic cones
Passin' semi's on the right
Now my knuckles are turnin' white

She drives like crazy
She'll break our necks
She drives like crazy
She always gets into wrecks

She drives like crazy
Like no-one else
She drives like crazy
Now I'm afraid for myself

She drives like crazy
Like no-one else
Akon and Shaggy, ooh yeah
Love ain't got nothin? to do with it
Come on now

Nuff man a search for your sign
She say she love me till the end of time
But that a not really have pon me mind
Me waan fi leave you long time
Yuh know enuff a man search fi your sign

What's love gotta do with it
Gotta do with it, gotta do with it?
What's love?
That's it, can't take no more
I'm leavin?, got one foot through the door
(But I love you)
I had my doubts before
I thought it through, now I'm gone for sure
(But I love you)
Can't let you tie me down
I wanna have fun and mess around
(But I love you)
I gotta stand my ground
Though you're the best thing I found
What's love gotta do with it
Gotta do with it, gotta do with it?
What's love gotta do with it
Gotta do with it, gotta do with it?
What's love
I hope for goodness sake
That you would just cheat, make some mistake
(But I love you)
So perfect, 

[Incomprehensible]
You gave me no reason to escape
(But I love you)
Won't hide, I got skirts to chase
Don't wanna be throwin? it in your face
(But I love you)
I pray to God some days
We fight and go our separate ways
What's love gotta do with it
Gotta do with it, gotta do with it?
What's love gotta do with it
Gotta do with it, gotta do with it?

Gotta do with it, gotta do with it?
What's love gotta do with it
Gotta do with it, gotta do with it?
What's love
She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

And so I've learned that love it's not possession
And I've learned that love don't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late

And she's... out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
I kept my love for her locked, deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my... life

[parody of desperado by the eagles]
Avocado
What makes you think you're so holy?
Youre gonna be guacamole before too long

Oh, you're a green one
You know that you're out of season
Youd better let somebody eat you
Let somebody eat you
Ya better let somebody eat you
Before it's too late
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Every night, every night, I'm on a mood
With a super model, you might seen her from youtube
She's got that good love waiting I got it too
Making either one us waking up next to you, right next to you
See I may be rich, and I may have money
There's something missing in my life I always wanted
Had a 1000 chicks, only few I called my honeys
I need to fall in love and I can see it coming
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
True gentleman, super star
You see me rolling in, aha, my fancy car
Sitting ride beside me is a beautiful girl I saw
Take her to the boom boom boom and another one to mark
I got an addiction, that's hard to cure
You got an affliction that keeps me wanting more
Changing my direction so I can fall in love
So hard cause my collection is so out of this world
See I may be rich, and I may have money
There's something missing in my life I always wanted
Had a 1000 chicks, only few I called my honeys
I need to fall in love and I can see it coming
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
I know that you would want to
Have someone in your lifetime love you
If you can show that you really want to
There'll be no limit to what your heart will allow you
When it comes to love, when it comes to love, when it comes to love
I feel empty, still searching
When it comes to love, when it comes to love, when it comes to love
I feel empty, still searching
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love

[Verse 1]
Coming this Christmas to a theatre near you
The most horrifying film to hit the screen
There's a homicidal maniac who finds a Cub Scout troop
And he hacks up two or three in every scene
Please don't reveal the secret ending to your friends
Don't spoil the big surprise
You won't believe your eyes when you see

[Chorus]
Nature Trail to Hell
Nature Trail to Hell

See severed heads that almost fall right in your lap
See that bloody hatchet coming right at you
No, you'll never see hideous effects like these again
Till we bring you "Nature Trail to Hell Part 2"
So bring the kids along, it's good clean family fun
What have you got to lose
If you like the six o'clock news, then you'll love

[Chorus]
Nature Trail to Hell

To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds, or fame
Nor set the pace for style

If I can follow through
On what they gave me as my tools
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart
I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me myself
So he can do the rest

(Law without compromise
Shall follow the feel of constant care)
In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man aware
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared then unashamed
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named
A man and woman's youngest son
While growing still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile
There's something weird in the fridge today
I don't know what it is
Food I can't recognize
My roommate won't throw a thing away
I guess it's probably his
It looks like it's alive...

And livin' in the fridge... livin' in the fridge
Livin' in the fridge... livin' in the fridge

There's something gross in the fridge today
It's green and growin' hair
It's been there since July
If you can name the object
In that baggie over there
Then mister, you're a better man than I

It's livin' in the fridge
You can't stop (dysentery) the mold from growin' (dysentery)
Livin' in the fridge
Can't tell what (dysentery) it is at all (dysentery)
Livin' in the fridge
You can't stop (dysentery) the mold from growin' (dysentery)
Livin' in the fridge
Tell me, do you think it should be carbon dated
Fumigated or cremated and buried at sea?
You try to save a little bit of your home cookin'
Couple weeks later, got a scary-lookin' specimen
It always happens my friend
Again and again and again and again

Somethin' stinks in the fridge today
And it's been rottin' there all week
It could be liver cake or woolly mammoth steak
Well, maybe i should another peek...

Livin' in the fridge
You can't stop (dysentery) the mold from growin' (dysentery)
Livin' in the fridge
Can't tell what (dysentery) it is at all (dysentery)
Livin' in the fridge
You can't stop (dysentery) the mold from growin' (dysentery)
Livin' in the fridge
Livin' in the fridge
Don't know what it is, don't know what it is
Livin' in the fridge
Don't know what it is, don't know what it is
Livin' in the fridge
Don't know what it is at all
Livin' in the fridge, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
You can torture me with Donny and Marie
You can play some Barry Manilow
Or you can play some schlock like New Kids On The Block
Or any Village People song you know
Or play Vanilla Ice hey, you can play him twice
And you can play the Bee Gees any day
But Mr. DJ, please I'm beggin' on my knees
I just can't take no more of Billy Ray

[Chorus]
Don't play that song that 'Achy Breaky' song
The most annoying song I know
And if you play that song that 'Achy Breaky' song
I might blow up my radio

[Verse 2]
You can clear the room by playing Debby Boone
Or crank your ABBA records until dawn
Oh, I can even hear Slim Whitman or Zamfir
Don't mind a Yoko Ono marathon
Or play some Tiffany on 8-track or CD
Or scrape your fingernails across the board
Or tie me to a chair and kick me down the stairs
Just please don't play that stupid song no more

[Chorus]
Don't play that song that 'Achy Breaky' song
You know I hate that song a bunch
And if you play that song that nauseating song
It might just make me lose my lunch
Don't play that song that 'Achy Breaky' song
I think it's driving me insane
Oh, please don't play that song that irritating song
I'd rather have a pitchfork in my brain

[Outro]
Don't play that song that 'Achy Breaky' song
The most annoying song I know
And if you play that song that 'Achy Breaky' song
I might blow up my radio
Say, do you remember that guy Larry next door
Well, he always was the neighborhood clown
Like the time he pulled my pants off
And he took those color pictures
And posted copies all over town

Or the time that he dumped toxic waste on my lawn
Or those wacky prank phone calls from midnight till dawn
What a crazy kid Larry was, always foolin' around

Boy, what a joker
What a funny, funny guy
I'll never forget about Larry
No matter how I try

Say, do you remember when I lost all my hair
Cause Lar' gave me that Nair shampoo
And hey, how 'bout the day he put Bengay inside my jockstrap
And filled my toothpaste tube up glue

All those wedgies he gave
All those shoestrings he tied
All those brownies he made with the Ex-Lax inside
Oh, Lar', I swear, it was a laugh a minute with you
Boy, what a joker
What a funny, funny guy
I'll never forget about Larry
No matter how I try

You know I couldn't help but laugh
Even though he treated me like slime
Remember when he cut my car in half?
Well, he really got me good that time

Say, do you remember when I broke in Larry's house
Late at night and tied his mouth with a rag
Then I dragged him by his ankles to the middle of the forest
And stuffed him in a big plastic bag

If the cops ever find him, who knows what they'd say
But I'm sure if ol' Lar' were still with us today
He would have to agree with me
It was a pretty good gag

Boy, what a joker
What a funny, funny guy
I'll never forget about Larry
No matter how I try

Boy, what a joker
What a funny, funny guy
I'll never forget about Larry
No matter how I try
No matter how I try
(Cha!)
Oh I remember Larry
Oh I remember Larry
Oh I remember Larry
Oh I remember Larry
Oh I remember Larry
("sdnah ruoy no emit eerf fo tol lufwa na evah tsum uoy ,woW")

Yes I remember, remember, remember
Yes I remember, remember, remember
Yes I remember, remember, remember (Larry!)
Yes I remember, remember, remember
Yes I remember, remember, remember

Beverly hillbillies

[Verse 1]
Huh
Now lookie here people, listen to my story
A little story 'bout a man named Jed
You know something? That poor mountaineer
They say he barely kept his family fed

[Verse 2]
Now let me tell you, one day he was shootin'
Old Jed was shootin' at some food
When all of a sudden, right up from the ground there
Well, there came a bubblin' crude

[Chorus 1]
Oil, that is, well, maybe you call it
Black gold or Texas tea
He gonna move next to Mr. Drysdale
And be a Beverly Hillbilly

[Verse 3]
Before you know it, all the kinfolk are a-sayin'
Yeah, buddy, move away from there
That little Clampett got his own cement pond
That little Clampett, he's a millionaire

[Chorus 2]
Now, everyone said Californ-y
Is the place that you oughta be
We got to load up this here truck now
We got to move to Beverly

Y'all come back now, y'hear?
Beverly Beverly Beverly hillbillies
Beverly Beverly Beverly hillbillies
Beverly Beverly Beverly hillbillies
Things just haven't been the same
Since the flying saucer came
Now the aliens are on the loose

Well, we tried to hold 'em back
Tried to ward off their attack
But our atom bombs were just no use

They were ugly, they were mean
Biggest heads I ever seen
They made everybody scream and shout

First they leveled Tokyo
Then New York was next to go
Boy I really wish they'd cut it out

They wasted everybody on my block
There goes the neighborhood
They'll zap you with their death ray eyes
And blow you up real good
Run for your lives
(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)
They're not very nice to the human race
(Slime creatures from outer space)

There's more comin' every day
And they just won't go away
Now they're reproducing in the sewers

They got slimy lizard skin
And an evil lookin' grin
And they sure could use some manicures

They got hands all covered with fungus
They got eyes like some kinda bug
I sure hope they don't come in here
I just shampooed the rug

Run for your lives
(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)

They're really makin' a mess of this place
(Slime creatures)
(Slime creatures)
(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)

(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)

They'll rip your head off just for fun
They'll paralyze your mind
They're wearin' out their welcome

I don't think I like their kind
They'll suck your brain out through a straw
You just can't trust those guys

So hide the children, lock the doors
And always watch the skies
Look out, here come the

(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)
They're an intergalactic disgrace

(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)
I wish they'd just get outta my face
(Slime creatures from outer space)
(Slime creatures from outer space)
They're makin' a big fat mess of this place
(Slime creatures)
(Slime creatures)

Oh, where did they come from?
What do they want from us?
Who do they think they are?
(Slime creatures, slime creatures)

Why don't they leave me alone?
(Slime creatures, slime creatures.)
They're really getting on my nerves
Who ya gonna call?
Slime Creatures!
I don't have a library card
But do you mind if I check you out?
I like your skeletal structure, baby
You're an ectomorph, no doubt
Your face is real symmetrical
And your nostrils are so nice
I wish that I was cross-eyed, girl
So I could see you twice

Girl, you smell like Fritos
That's why I'm giving you this hungry stare
You're so hot, you're gonna melt
The elastic in my underwear
I'll bet you're magically delicious
Like a bowl of Lucky Charms
You'd look like Venus de Milo
If I just cut off your arms
What I'm tryin' to say is...

I wanna be your lover, baby
I need somebody to love
You know I just wanna be your lover, baby
Now I need somebody to love
Do you believe in love at first sight
Or should I walk by again?
My love for you's like diarrhea
I just can't hold it in
Stop, drop, and roll now
'Cause baby, you're on fire
I'll bet your outfit
Makes a lot of noise in the dryer

You're absolutely perfect
Don't speak now, you might spoil it
Your eyes are even bluer
Than the water in my toilet
Say, has anyone ever told you
You've got Yugoslavian hands?
No, of course not, that would be stupid
Just forget I ever brought it up
The point I'm trying to make is...

I wanna be your lover, baby
I need somebody to love
You know I just wanna be your lover, baby
Now I need somebody to love

I wanna be your Krakatoa
Let my lava flow all over you
I wanna be your anaconda
And your heat-seeking missile too
I wanna be your beef burrito
Am I making this perfectly clear?
I wanna be your love torpedo
Are you picking up the subtle innuendo here?
Uh huh
I hope I'm not being forward
But do you mind if I chew on your butt?
You can tell me truthfully
Am I a steamin' hunk of love now, or what?
There just aren't enough o's in "smooth"
To describe how smooth I am
Maybe you've seen my picture
It's in the dictionary under "Kablaam!"
My lips are registered weapons
Can I invade your personal space?
You must have fallen from heaven
That would explain how you messed up your face
Well, how'd you get through security?
'Cause baby, you're the bomb
I'd like to take you home right now
So you can meet my mom
Because I...

I wanna be your lover, baby
I need somebody to love
You know I just wanna be your lover, baby
Now I need somebody to love

Girl, you must be Jamaican
Because Jamaican me crazy
Girl, you must be Jamaican
Because Jamaican me crazy
I wanna be your lover, baby
I need somebody to love
You know I just wanna be your lover, baby
Now I need somebody to love

Oh, Harvey, Harvey
Harvey the Wonder Hamster
He doesn't bite and he doesn't squeal
He just runs around on his hamster wheel
Harvey, Harvey
Harvey the Wonder Hamster
Hey, Harvey!

[Verse 1]
There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you?
Darling, the days I had were cold
Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live

[Chorus]
But if it gets too rough
Call on me

[Verse 2]
Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need

[Chorus]
If you can't get enough
Call on me

[Bridge]
I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna kill me not to be with you
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too

[Verse 3]
So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewhere

[Chorus]
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me

[Outro]
Yes, happiness waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me

Yes, happiness waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me

[Hook]
Give me the love I'm looking fo'
Give me the love I'm looking fo'
Give you the love you looking fo'
The whole world knows the sun is so hot
'Cause you got soul, we got soul

[Verse 1: J-Splif]
Big shouts to the haters on the side steady gabbing
They don't understand I love music with a passion
Made a lot of sacrifices tryna get this cracking
So who the hell is you to tell me what I can't do
What you know about working 9 to 5 to stay alive
Been writing all night, till the moon, sleepy eye
On the bus everyday, face planted in a book
I'ma future rock star, better take a good look
Same thang, different day, I put my all into my songs
Hold it close like a mom with an infant in her arms
Lovin' life 'cause I felt my lights almost turnin' off
But I gotta second lease on my feast and it's drawn
Then I'm straight for my homies always there for support
Plan ahead for tomorrow, pass a blunt back and forth
Sunny days, many more, but first comes the storm
FM here to give you what you lookin' for

[Hook]
You gotta give me the love I'm looking fo'
I wanna give you the love you looking fo'
Give me the love, give you the love
'Cause you got soul, we got soul
Give me the love I'm looking fo'
I wanna give you the love you looking fo'
The whole world knows the sun is so hot
'Cause you got soul, we got soul

[Verse 2: Kev Nish]
Yo, I play the crystals, shoot missles all around the world
Spread the love like heat rash my boys and girls
That's J-Splif, Prohgress is the MC, Kev Nish is the recipe
Baking love in the oven is too hot, but real
Too cold to chill
Three equals one eye open
'Cause my vision is how I want you to feel
Protecting all my humans with a love force field, real
Love uncondional like Grandmama Nish
Fried egg and home potatoes in the morning I miss
My flow is next to zero, but I don't even trip
I work enough for three people and I barely make rent
One love up in Seattle to my parents and sis
LA is where I'm repping with a love and a fist
My heart is for the world, that means all you girls
But I can only give out one kiss, *smooch*

[Hook]
You gotta give me the love I'm looking fo'
I wanna give you the love you looking fo'
Give me the love, give you the love
'Cause you got soul, we got soul
Give me the love
Give you the love
The whole world knows the sun is so hot
We got soul

[Verse 3: Prohgress]
Pops told me that to be a star, you gots to know who you are
I took that, and now I put my focus on rap
And find people who can do what I can't
And that's my heart, yeah my first line of defense
So everday you see me mendin some fences
Just in case you think I'm gettin' pretentious
'cause I forgot to put your name on the guest list
I can't say they accusations are senseless
But understand the fans getting extensive
I feel the pressure and it's getting tremendous
If you could only take a look through my lenses
You see that everything is not what it seems
We got a past and you know what I mean
For right now, I just gotta follow my dreams
I'll be back, you just gotta believe
Trust me

Should I stay or should I go

Oh, this is a story 'bout a guy named Al
And he lived in a sewer with his hamster pal
But the sanitation workers really didn't approve
So he packed up his accordion and had to move
To a city in Ohio where he lived in a tree
And he worked in a nasal decongestant factory
And he played on the company bowling team
And every single night he had a strange, recurring dream
Where he was wearing lederhosen in a vat of sour cream
But that's really not important to the story
Well, the very next year he met a dental hygienist
With a spatula tattoed on her arm (on her arm)
But he didn't keep in touch, then he lost her number
Then he got himself a job on a tater tot farm
And he spent his life savings on a split-level cave
20 miles below the surface of the Earth (of the Earth)
And he really makes a mighty fine jelly bean and pickle sandwich
For what it's worth
Then one day Al was in the forest, trying to get a tan
When he heard the tortured screaming of a funny little man
He was caught in a bear trap and Al set him free
And the guy that he rescued was grateful as can be
And it turns out he's a big-shot producer on TV
So he gives Al a contract and what do you know?
Now he's got his very own Weird Al Show
Gonna tell you a story
About Chuck and Diane
Couple British kids from
The palace at Buckingham
Chuckie wants to grow up
And be a polo star
And ride his little horsies
All around the backyard, oh yeah
You know they really paid their dues
I said, "Hey, lawdy mama
They got them Buckingham blues"
Now Chuckie goes hunting
And leaves Diane alone
So she fixes her hair
And she talks on the princess phone
Chuckie's still tryin' to figure out
What his job's supposed to be
And Diane's the fashion leader
Of the aristocracy
I said, "Hey, Lady Di
Tell me where'd you get them shoes, ah
Well, hey nonny nonny
Looks like you got them Buckingham blues"
Aw, bein' heir to the throne, well
It must be awful hard
Gotta pose for pictures
Out on the front yard
And Lady Di, well
She must have it pretty rough
Gotta hang around the house all day
Makin' babies and stuff
On another game of croquet
Then they're off on a Caribbean cruise
Well, hey bop-a-re-bop
They really got them Buckingham blues
Ah, tell the truth, now, tell the truth
Wow
I got my mojo workin'
Yeah, woo, don't help me now
Ah, hurt me, mama, whoa, ah
They don't serve no Twinkies
With their afternoon tea
Never had a dinner
Made by Chef Boyardee
Bein' in the spotlight
Is a hard life to choose
Diane drops half a pound
It's on the six o'clock news, oh yeah
Those kids have really paid their dues
Oh, what a royal pain it is
When you got them Buckingham blues
Who fixes plumbing problems in a flash?
Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week?

Baby, I sure wish I could lend you a hand
But plumbing's one thing I don't understand
It's true (haven't got a clue)
B-b-b-baby, I can tell you've got a big problem
When I flush the john, then your shower goes on
Baby, now watcha gonna do?
If Drano's a joke and your plunger is broke
Baby, call the mensch with a monkey wrench
Baby, he'll be there for you

Shower's backing up (up, up)
Water won't go down (down, down)

Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Don't forget my plumber
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Sink's been stopped up all summer
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Better call the plumber
He'll know what to do
Pipes been blowing up, pipes been breaking down
And the carpet's soaked right through
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba, ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba, kitchen's flooded too
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba, ba-ba-ba-ba ba ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba, girl, you know it's true

B-b-b-betcha this guy makes more than my lawyer
If he works for one day, costs you half a year's pay
Baby, he can be here by two
So if you've got cash, he'll be there in a flash
Makin' service calls in his overalls
Baby, he'll do his best for you

Sewer's backing up (up, up)
Got you feelin' down (down, down)

Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Don't forget my plumber
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Leaky pipes are a bummer
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Time to call the plumber
Maybe call a few

Got a problem with plumbing?
Gotta blame it on something?
Blame it on the drain, it was cloggin', cloggin'
Blame it on the faucet that drips all night
If hairballs, grease and goo won't let the water through
Blame it on the drain, yeah, yeah
When I flush the john, now when I flush the john
It turns the shower on

(Roto-Rooter 6-5000!)

Ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Better call my plumber
He'll know what to do
Call now, we're in the yellow pages

[Verse 1]
Someday I'm gonna pack up
And then I'm goin' back up
To that place where sentimental feelings arouse
Where the grass is so green
And the air is so clean
That when the wind is right you can even smell the cows

[Chorus]
Take me down (Take me down)
To that good old slow town
Where time shifts into neutral
And idles away
Take me down (Take me down)
To that good old slow town
I've got to get back
To that city today

[Verse 2]
If you're new in town
Then you'll wanna look around
But you don't know where to begin
Well, there's Bubble Gum Alley
And the local car rally
Not to mention the toilets at Madonna Inn

[Chorus]
Take me down (Take me down)
To that good old slow town
Where time shifts into neutral
And idles away
Take me down (Take me down)
To that good old slow town
I've got to get back
To that city today

[Verse 3]
It's not much of a hassle
To drive up to Hearst's Castle
And it's not too far from Pismo Beach or Morro Rock
You can visit downtown at your leisure
Because for your shopping pleasure
The stores never close down until five o'clock

[Chorus]
Take me down (Take me down)
To that good old slow town
Where time shifts into neutral
And idles away
Take me down (Take me down)
To that good old slow town
I've got to get back
To that city today

[Chorus]
Take me down (Take me down)
To that good old slow town
Where time shifts into neutral
And idles away
Take me down (Take me down)
To that good old slow town
I've got to get back
To that city today
Ok I say that shit again, I said it once before

Big behind, bad enough to skip the line
But to me she just a nine

Bitch I am a monster I belong on district 9
Catch me in my office, office, doin business

And by the time u ridin wat I'm ridin on I'm in the air
No wonder why my mind is so cloudy, I'm drowsy

[Intro]
Whoa! I can't believe we're in Japan!
Look at all the lights, the food, the people!
Wow!

[Chorus]
We're three cool white friends in Japan (Japan!)
We've never been to Japan
So we wrote a song about the three of us in Japan
And our label has to pay for it

[Verse 1]
Here we are at our five star hotel
The one from Lost in Translation (in Japan!)
The views are amazing, and there's champagne waiting
Because that's how we wrote it (yummy!)
And now the label has to pay for the video (yay!)
And pay for everything that we say (no matter what!)
For example, I'll be getting a massage right now
And I'll be drinking some sake (so expensive! Who cares?)
Here we are at the most expensive sushi restaurant in Japan (mmm!)
And now we're at Tokyo Disneyland
And now we're in Hawaii for one random shot
That our label has to pay for

[Chorus]
'Cause we're three cool white friends in Japan (In Asia!)
The fact that we're white isn't why we're friends
But we are white, and we're friends (in Japan!)

[Verse 2]
At this point in the video, we'll be super drunk (wee!)
Standing near some kind of dragon (roar!)
And then we'll buy some stinky, used girl's panties (wow!)
Out of one of those pervert vending machines (hehe!)
Now we've seen sumo wrestling live (cool!)
Unless we get dropped by our label

[Chorus]
'Cause we're three white douchebags in Japan (that's us!)
It's all part of our master plan
To get some much needed R&R
At the expense of Universal Records (car possession!)

[Refrain: The Lonely Island & Universal Records]
Wow, look at all this Japanese money
It's called Yen
I heard it's worth more than American money
Let's dump it in the river!
Moshi Moshi
Guys it's the label, this video's really expensive and it—
Bye!

[Bridge]
Pokémon!
Dump it in the River!
Our rental car!
Dump it in the River!
This old guy!
Dump him in the river!

[Outro]
And now we're flying home first class!

How come he don't call you no more? (Alright)
If he don't, I will call you for sure—come on, baby
(Oh boy, you gotta tell me something—alright...oh, hey, oh...)

Fuck nigga tripping, I'll get prison and fuck your father
I'ma tell 'em one time, ain't going farther
I'm doing numbers
If I had wings, I'd fly

Each and everyday, no

And if the Angel of Love
Upon my shoulder
My very least is
To try and fly away, hey, hey

That shines forever, I said forevermore
Makes me fly away, hey, hey
Oh, she will let me fly away, hey, hey

[Intro]
La-da-da-da-da
Your girlfriend

[Verse 1]
Maybe silly for me to feel this way about you and her
'Cause I know she's been such a good friend
I know she has helped you through

[Pre-Chorus]
Talking late on the phone
Every night you've been callin'
Private moments alone
Could your heart soon be fallin'
And I know she's a friend
But I can't shake the feeling
That I could be losing your heart

[Chorus]
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

[Verse 2]
You said thats she's one who helped you see
How deep you're in love with me
And intentions were not to get in between
But I see possibilities

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say that you feel
I'm the best thing in your life
And I know it's real, I see it in your eyes
There's no reason for me to even feel this way
I know you just enjoy her company

[Chorus]
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

[Bridge: Jermaine Dupri & Alicia]
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
You say you're jealous but you can't tell me why
It's enough to make a (nigga) go crazy

[Chorus]
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I'm tired, I'm weak, I'm lone
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When my way grows drear precious Lord linger near
When my life is almost gone
Hear my cry, hear my call, hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When the darkness appears and the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand, guide my feet, hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

Precious Lord, take my hand

'Cause I'm the juiciest baby (Juicy) girl around (Oh)
And I got nine hundred men knockin' down my door (And all my peoples who is juicy I want you to say, "Yeah")
'Cause I'm the juiciest baby (Uh-huh) girl around (He's juicy)
And I don't care if you don't call no more (Now I'm glad that you're gone)

[Outro]
Baby, I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more
Baby, I don't care if you don't wanna call me no more

[Verse 1]
So you're leaving me today
Just because of what they say
You took their word against mine
Friends do lie sometime
Before you walk out the door
Let me say this once more
Girl, you the one for me
Open your eyes, can't you see?

[Chorus]
And now you're leaving me
Hey, baby, now you wanna
Wanna leave me
Yeah, baby, I'll tell you

[Verse 2]
Tryna find a way
That I can make you stay
You won't hear a word I say
Think you wanna leave me anyway
Go on, don't break their hearts
I knew right from the start
If they'll lie on Jesus, can't you see
They'll lie on you and me?

[Chorus]
Now you're leaving me
Hey, baby, oh
Now you're leaving me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I wanna say

[Verse 3]
Why go and take my life
If you can stay and be my wife?
You just feel like mine
And our hearts beats right on time
So, go on, don't break our hearts
And I knew from the start
If they'll lie on Jesus, can't you see
They'll lie on you and me?

[Chorus]
Now you're leaving me
Why you wanna? No, please, don't
Now why you leaving me?

Why you leaving me?
Don't you know I want you? Don't feel bad
It's the best problem that I ever had
Don't you know your love, it could be mine
'Cause I really waited for a mighty long time

And I think it'll be alright
Another day, another day
And I think it'll be alright
Another day yeah

Don't you know this loving is not for free
Thinking someone else and I'm thinking about me
Oh, my baby, don't you go away, yeah
Saving my loving for another day

And I think it'll be alright
If you check with me tomorrow and I
And I think I'll be aright
Another day, another day

And I think got to give it little time now
Another day

Maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow
And I think it'll be alright

And let someone take your place
'Cause you oughta know, you can do it
Tell me that there's nothing to it
Where you going, what do you know

Can you make it by yourself
With the strength that you have left
Why don't you give me your hand
I'll try my best to understand
I don't know about goodbye
But nothing fails but a try

Tell me why
Why can't I hear your answer
Why do I feel so all alone
Tell me why
I'm a believer
Bring me back into Your own
My God, the place I belong

I'm dedicated now
To the place I love
Nothing can hold me back
From the place of heaven above
The question to all these things is

Tell me why, why
How come I feel so
Why don't the moon beam go
Where the sun beam go
Tell me why
I'm a believer
Bring me back into your own
The place where I belong
If you start to try to separate
The light from the darkness
Only my God will know
We shouldn't judge
We should walk our walk
And talk our talk
Nobody knows what God knows

I want to know the answers
To all of these questions
Tell me why, why
Over here, over there
People are waiting
On the wings of a prayer
Their hopes are fading
Well I know He can be
Everything for You
Gotta say what I feel
And you know it sure feels good
To know that He is there for me

I know that He loves me
I know that He saved me
It sure feels good
I gotta peace of mind
That you can't deny
When He turned my life around
Oh I can promise
It ain't no lie
He sent me here just to testify
Oh how He saved me
It sure feels good
Another day, another way
People are dying
But I know there are those
That can stop this crying
You can say waht you will
I won't stop moving
Tell me this, tell me that
Don't plan on losing
'Cause this thing sure feels good

Tell you He loves me
Oh that He moves me
Sure feels good
I gotta love that's divine
That you can't find
Unless your hand is wrapped up in mine
Oh I got a feeling each and every day
This walk gets only sweeter
Day by day
Oh how He saved me
It sure feels mighty good
Haven't you heard
Don't you know, don't you know
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute
Won't you stop a while
There may be something here
That can make you smile
If it feels good
The way it's supposed to feel
Then you should know
That this love is real
Oh how He loves me
It sure feels good
Got a peace of mind
That I can't deny
Turned my life around
I can promise, it ain't no lie
He sent me here
Just to testify
Oh how He loves me
It sure feels good
Hold on forever, hold on forever
'Til I can get everything in place
Well, hold on forever, hold on forever
'Til I can see my shapeless face

I've got to smile on forever
Smile 'cause there's a me for you to joy
That's a smile, smile, smile
Well, this song is for every girl and boy

I've had good times, I've had bad times
I haven't had enough
I have my ups and down, I've been turned around
I haven't given up

Don't you know everybody have to walk the line?
I have had to do my time, it's a shame my song's for free
And everybody knows that's the way it goes
The Lord is watching over me

I think I really better hold on forever, hold on forever
'Cause there's a smile I'd like to wear
I'll hold on forever, hold on forever
'Cause, 'cause there's some joy I've got to share
I wanna thank somebody 

[Incomprehensible]
That may keep on holding on
That may keep on holding on 

[Incomprehensible]
I keep holding on, I keep holding on

I keep on holding on, I keep seeing face
Nothing in the world can take this face
I, I, I keep holding, I'm holding
I'm holding, I'm holding, I'm holding
I'm dreaming tonight of a place do I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know
It's a long road back, I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me, oh
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love lights gleam
I want you to know
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams, oh

Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Oh

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love lights gleam, oh
I want to be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams

[Verse 1]
Oh, ooh, baby
There's something that I gotta tell ya
Baby, you should know
What's on my mind
Now, ooh, baby
I'm feelin' our situation
It's gettin' stronger
How we wanted
But I gotta take my time

[Pre-Chorus]
See, there's so much about you that I want to explore
Physical attraction, we just can't ignore it
But before we go too far across the line
Gotta really make sure that I'm sure, mmm

[Chorus]
Slow down, babe
Let's take our time
Slow down, babe
If you don't mind
Slow down, babe
Before we make this move
Slow down, babe
Baby, slow down
(I think it's really too soon)

[Verse 2]
Ooh, baby
It's like I've known you forever
My medulla oblongata will electrify
Ooh, ooh, baby
Whenever we're alone together
I'm 'bout to explode and it feels so right
But I gotta take my time

[Pre-Chorus]
See, there so much about you that I want to explore
Physical attraction, we just can't ignore it (Nah)
But before we get too far across the line
Gotta really make sure that I'm sure, oh

[Chorus]
Slow down, babe
Let's take our time
Slow down, babe
If you don't mind
Slow down, babe
Before we make this move
Slow down, babe
Baby, slow down
(Baby, it's really too soon)
Soon, yeah

[Bridge]
See, I know what is best 'cause I've been here before
Gave myself to someone for all the wrong reasons (Reasons)
But this time around, I don't wanna do that again
I just wanna make this the way that I've dreamed of
So, baby, you got to...

[Chorus]
Slow down, babe
Let's take our time
Slow down, babe
If you don't mind
Slow down, babe
Before we make this move
Slow down, babe
Baby, slow down
(I think it's really too soon)
Yeah, slow down
You gotta slow down, you gotta slow down
You gotta slow down, you gotta slow down

[Spoken Intro]
To me, it seems like Christmas is lost
'Cause it's not about celebrating anymore
It's just about giving to receive
And the illest thing to me about the little drummer boy
Or the little drummer girl, in my case, I mean
Is that all that shorty had was her drum, that's it
And through her drum, she gave Jesus her soul
And ain't no amount of riches that could ever amount to that
Y'know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
Ba dee ah, ba dee ah
Come on, they told me
A newborn king to see
Our finest gifts we bring to lay before the king
So here we come
Oh, rum pum pum pum, mmm

[Verse 2]
Baby Jesus, I am a poor girl, too
I have no gift to bring
That's fit to give a king
Shall I play for you on my drum?

[Bridge]
Mary nodded
The ox and lamb kept time
I played my drum for him
I played my best for him
Then he smiled at me, me and my drum
Me and my drum

[Outro]
Rum pum pum pum
Pa rum pum pum pum
Pa rum pum pum pum (Oh yeah)
Pa rum pum pum pum (Oh)
Pa rum pum pum pum
Pa rum pum pum pum (Come on, they told me)
Pa rum pum pum pum (A newborn king to see)
Pa rum pum pum pum (Can I play my drum for him?)
Pa rum pum pum pum (Oh oh)
Pa rum pum pum pum (Oh oh yeah)
Pa rum pum pum pum
Pa rum pum pum pum
Pa rum pum pum pum
Pa rum pum pum pum
Can I have a kiss?
Can I have a touch?

I'm wild about you baby
Good God see why
Going wild about you baby
You don't know how I feel
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty I see
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

'Cause I still belong to someone like you
I don't know what to do

Just because, oh baby, just because

[Verse 1]
Have you ever felt so strong
That it made you feel weak?
Long days, long nights and you just can't sleep
Have you ever been so sure
That it gave you cold feet?
That you felt on edge, you can feel your heart beat

[Chorus]
Well, I never knew this feeling, never
Now I hope it stays and lasts forever
I am riding high
Don't wanna come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
If I can touch the sky
I'd risk the fall just to know how it feels to fly

Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Have you ever felt so lost
But didn't know 'til you were found?
Looking everywhere, but you finally see now
In a room full of people
Feel like no one's around
Got your head in the clouds and your feet up off the ground

[Chorus]
Say, I never knew this feeling, never
Now I hope it stays and lasts forever
I am riding high
Don't wanna come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
And if I can touch the sky
I'd risk the fall just to know how it feels to fly

My heart
Disappears
Oh smile & move
Your burning feet
So just smile a little bit more, a little bit more
Hey we just smile a little bit more, a little bit more

Oh dear
Can bring
Sudden rain i can think yea
Our turn to see the winds change
Soo smile
All you gotta do is just smile

In my heart i see the winter
Making me do over but iiiii i don't mind
I just smile a little bit more a little bit more

"still incomplete"
Well, the first time ever I saw you
You were sleeping as the night fell, fell upon us
My soul felt something like a mighty wind
Voice like muddy waters
Surprise attack on my heart
Oh, it freed my soul, oh, it made me whole

Well, it's a high, long way to Heaven
Well, nothing can go up there, but the pure-hearted
They say it's a highway to Heaven
Nothing can go up there, but the pure-hearted

First time ever I saw you
You were sleeping as the night fell, fell upon us
My soul felt something like a mighty wind
Voice like Muddy Waters
Surprise attack on the heart
The way people smile and say
Using me in every way, its okay
Times are changing, life is upside down
No reason to cry now, oh, no reason to cry now

Beware of who you listen to
Beware of what you believe
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love
Friends are the reason for so many breakups and breakdowns
Round town, so many people think that life is so much fun
We've only just begun
Begun to have some fun

Beware of what you listen to
Beware of what you believe
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love me

Beware of who you listen to
Beware of what you believe
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love me, to make you love

[Verse 1]
Try to keep my feet on the ground
But my head is in the clouds
Love's so hard to find
But you know that it's on my mind
Got me in a daze
I don't know how I got to this place
But it's too good to deny
I, so I close my eyes and I fly

[Pre-Chorus]
Come to me, run to me
I'm dreaming that you come to me, baby

[Chorus]
Even when I'm up all day
When I'm asleep at night
Baby, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, dreaming
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
Baby, I'm dreaming

[Verse 2]
Try to keep my feet on the ground
But the feeling knocks me down
I feel so overwhelmed
I'm under your spell
Try to keep coming, stay strong
But that don't last too long
But it's too good to deny
Oh, so I close my eyes and I fly

[Pre-Chorus]
Come to me, run to me
I'm praying that you come to me, baby

[Chorus]
Even when I'm up all day
When I'm asleep at night
Baby, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, dreaming
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
Baby, I'm dreaming

All my life I'll spend it with you
All of my days will be for loving you
Each and every night for the rest of my life
I'd be steadfast, unmovable, unshakable

All my life I'll spend it with you
All my days will be for loving you, one more time
Each and every night for the rest of my life
Will be steadfast, unmovable, unshakable

You're one in a million
(One in a million, one is a million)
A million to one
And you're one in a million
(One in a million, one is a million)
I love you, baby

Oh, each and every night for the rest of my life
I feel steadfast, unmovable, unshakable

All my life, all my days I'll spend with you
All of my days, sweet baby, I'll spend loving you
Each and every night for the rest of my life

In a million, yeah, yeah, yeah

You'll play the part
It's hard to get
You blowing my mind
You blowing my mind
I will never, never, never, never, never play

You're one

In a million, a million to one
You're one

(That's what you are)
(One in a million, one is a million)
I love you, baby, I love you
(One in a million, one is a million)
You don't know me
You don't understand
You don't know me
Just what kind of man
If you love me
Just take my hand
I will help you to understand

I may look the same
Carry the same old name
But a change has come
To make me someone new
I may look the part
But it wasn't from my heart
Quit livin' that lie
When I met Jesus face to face

You don't know me
You don't understand
You don't know me
Just what kind of man
If you love me
Just take my hand
I will help you to understand
I may wear the same old clothes
Lookin' like I haven't been told
I can see Jesus Christ
Right through this veil of tears
You don't know my heart
I'm talkin' about the sacred part
It gets a little better
And better and better
All through the years

You don't know me
You don't understand
You don't know me
Just what kind of man
If you love me
Just take my hand
I will help you to understand

This thing started a long time ago
I'm talkin' back in the Bible days
People thinking they know you
And living a live
And dealing in contrary ways
Don't let it stop your stuff
You gotta be tough
These things will soon come to pass
Keep your head in the sky
You can get by
And come out the victor at last

You don't know me
You don't understand
You don't know me
Just what kind of man
If you love me
Just take my hand
I will help you to understand

[Intro]
This song is dedicated to all the lovers who can't be together Separated by distance and time

[Verse 1]
You are always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now?
I know I'll never let you down
I will never go away

[Pre-Chorus]
I really wish that you would stay, but what would we do?
All the days that you've been gone, I dream about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home

[Chorus]
No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Through distance and time
I'll be waiting
And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time, I'll be waiting, mm-hmm
Distance and time, I'll be waiting

[Verse 2]
Will you take a train, to meet me where I am?
Are you on your way?
And I will never do anything to hurt you
I'll never live without you

[Pre-Chorus]
I really wish that you would stay, but what would we do?
All the days that you've been gone, I dream about you
And I anticipate the day that you will come home, home, home

[Chorus]
No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Distance and time, I'll be waiting
And if you have to walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see you smile
Distance and time, I'll be waiting
No matter how far you are
No matter how long it takes him
Distance and time, I'll be waiting
And you can walk a million miles
I'll wait a million days to see your smile
Through distance and time, I'll be waiting

[Outro]
Oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, whoa
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting (Oh, whoa, whoa)
Oh, whoa, whoa
Through distance and time, I'll be waiting
You are always on my mind
All I do is count the days
Where are you now?

[Intro: Lellow]
It would be
It would be
It would be, so simple

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
What it is ain't what it was
What should it be, when it comes to you and?
How it seems ain't how it is
There's been a change
When it comes to me and...

[Pre-Chorus 1: Alicia Keys]
Oh, baby, you, oh, baby, me
Oh, maybe we
Can try another day, another way
All in my mind
I'm wonderin' why
We cannot find
What was left at the beginning
If I could..

[Chorus: Alicia Keys and (Lellow)]
Meet you again
Kiss you again
Miss you again
(It would be, it would be so simple)
'Cause I would
Love you again
Hold you again
Need you again
(It would be, it would be...
Could it be, could it be so simple)

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Now it's hardly simple
It's just simply hard
When it comes to you and...
I find myself not being myself
Just to avoid
All this confrontation with..

[Pre-Chorus 2: Alicia Keys]
Oh, baby, you, oh, baby, me
Oh, maybe we
Can put this armor down and settle down
Oh, it's off track
That is a fact
Can we get it back
Get it back to the beginning?
If I could

[Chorus-Alicia Keys and (Lellow)]
Meet you again
Kiss you again
Miss you again
(It would be, it would be so simple)
'Cause I would
Love you again
Hold you again
Need you again
(It would be, it would be...
Could it be, could it be so simple)

[Bridge: Lellow]
Don't you know that it would be?
Don't you know that it would be?
Don't you know that it would be?
It would be
It would be
It, it would be
It would be

[Chorus: Alicia Keys and (Lellow)]
Meet you again
Kiss you again
Miss you again
(It would be, it would be so simple)
Cause I would
Love you again
Hold you again
Need you again
(It would be, it would be...
Could it be, it would be so simple)

[Spoken Outro: Lellow]
Yeah, we got the up rock
Do it like this, don't stop, mmm
Yeah, we got it goin' now
Now it's right on

[Verse 1]
Did you hear that lonesome whip-poor-will?
He sounds too good to fly
The midnight train winding low
I'm so lonesome I could cry, cry

[Verse 2]
Did you ever see a night so long
When time goes crawling by?
The moon just went behind a cloud
And I'm so lonesome that I feel I could cry, I could cry, oh, I'm gonna cry, baby, cry

[Bridge]
Did you see, ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
Well, that means he's lost the will to live
And I'm so lonesome I, I could cry, let me cry, said I was holding on now I could cry

[Verse 3]
The silence of (Silence of) a falling star (A falling star)
Lights up a purple sky (Oh)
And as I wonder (Wonder) where you are (Oh)
I'm so lonesome I could cry, cry, I could cry

[Outro]
Oh, and as I wonder (Wonder) where you are (Oh, yeah)
I'm so lonesome I, I could cry (Ooh), if you let me, oh no
Somebody needs to walk on in, and I
As I wonder (Oh) where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry, I said I feel like I could just cry, yeah
It seems to me (Seems to me), as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome, I, I could cry, I could cry, I could cry (Cry, babe)

[Verse 1]
I never thought dreams could happen
Until one came true for me

[Chorus]
Since I met Judy
Since I met Judy
Oh, my life has been one sweet melody
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I never thought I could welcome
Two other hearts as I do

[Chorus]
Oh, since I met Judy
Since I met Judy
Well, it's been a real hip thing, I'm telling you
Oh, I'm saying that I want Judy

[Bridge]
Talking 'bout beauty
She's got it, I know she's got it
And her sweet little ways
Mean so much to me, oh yeah, yeah
I make it my duty to love her, got her, got her, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna keep her right here with me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Now I find it hard to believe that I'm happy, yeah
And all my pains and heartaches are long gone, so glad I can tell the world

[Chorus]
Since I met Judy
Since I met Judy
Well, my life has been one sweet song
And I won't be worried long, and
If you think I'm gonna leave her, man, you're wrong

[Outro]
It's only Judy, I'm telling you you're wrong
'Cause I love Judy, yeah
I'm crazy 'bout Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy
Judy, oh, what a woman, what a woman
I'm free, thank God almighty
Free at last, free, free, free, free
Oh, I give Your name the praise
Free at last
Free, free, free, free
Thank God almighty
Free at last
Thank God almighty, free at last
Let me say I am
Free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Thank You Lord, yeah, yeah, no
Free, free, free, free
Thank You, thank you Jesus, the Lord, oh, yeah
Oh, how You pick me up, turn me around
Place my feet on solid ground
Yes You did and yes You did, yes You did
Hey, took me out of the muddy clay
Set me on a rock to stay
Yes You did, yes You did, yes You did
Oh, You blessed my soul with plenty of love
Gave me wings to fly above
Yes You did, yes You did, yeah
I love Your name, I love Your name
I love Your name, I love Your name
I love Your name, I love Your name
Whoa, I'm free, free
Yes, my love can't justify The King, yes I

[Verse 1]
I'm ridin' full speed, leavin' from the ghetto doin'
A hundred miles an hour, you can barely see me movin'
Gotta shorty waitin' for me that I been pursuin'
And I ain't got far to go
She a bad chick, somethin' I ain't tryna ruin
She's steady callin', so I know she ready to get to it
I'm tryna get there but I just can't
Seem to catch up to her
By the time I got there she was gone
And so I walked upstairs and I heard this sound
So pretty, so gritty, so funny that no one's around
So I locked myself inside and closed the door
But there was this funny feeling inside
That I couldn't get rid of, then I sing it

[Hook]
Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me
All alone with my ears pressed against the wall
Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me
Alone with my ears pressed against the wall

[Verse 2]
Standin' in front of my window pane
The sound got me starin' at the rain
The more she play the more I feel the pain
Why is she doing this, what's it to gain?
Seems like she tryna take my soul away
Startin' to feel I'm under her control today
I can't see her but I hear her from the shades
And it seems like she really knows me
Every fiddle makes me wanna run away
I can't take it no more, gotta get away
Got me talkin' about the dark nights
In the cage while she starin' at me

[Hook]
Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me
All alone with my ears pressed against the wall
Miss melody, who could she be? Describin' me
Alone with my ears pressed against the wall
Miss Melody, is killin' me
Miri Ben-Ari
Who could she be?
I can't wait no more, I'm about to walk the whole door
Miss Melody, why you playing my life with melody?
Answer me, woman!
Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me
All alone with my ears pressed against the wall
Miss melody, who could she be? Describin' me
Well, I'll be damned
It's Miri Ben-Ari

[Verse 1]
You used to be my closest ally (Uh-huh)
In this cold, cold world of deception and lies, oh
We would defend and protect one another (One another)
Now I can't tell if we're enemies or lovers

[Pre-Chorus]
So who's gonna rescue us from ourselves?

[Chorus]
When we gonna wake up, baby?
It's time for lovin'
When we gonna wake up, my baby?
Before it's too late

[Verse 2]
Oh baby, where did we go wrong, baby? (Uh-huh)
Did this cold, cold world turn us into stone?
Well, now all I battle is your ego and your pride
It's ticking like a time bomb ready to ignite
Hurtin' me to fight

[Pre-Chorus]
So who's gonna rescue us from ourselves?

[Chorus]
When we gonna wake up, baby?
It's time for lovin'
When we gonna wake up, my baby?
Before it's too late
When we gonna wake up, baby?
It's time for lovin'
When we gonna wake up, my baby?
Before it's too late

[Bridge]
When the smoke clears
What will be left for us but tears and pain?
Why must we argue over the same things
Just to make up and go back again?
It's never too late, it isn't too long
Can't get it right when no one thinks they're wrong
Gotta get outta bed
And take a look at what's goin' on

[Chorus]
Oh, when we gonna wake up, baby?
It's time for lovin'
When we gonna wake up, my baby?
Before it's too late
When we gonna wake up, baby?
It's time for lovin'
When we gonna wake up, my baby?
Before it's too late
When we gonna wake up, baby?
It's time for lovin'
When we gonna wake up, my baby?
Before it's too late

[Outro]
Oh, baby (Wake up)
Oh, darlin' (Wake up)
When we gonna wake up? (Wake up)
When we gonna take a look and see? (Wake up)
What's goin' on? (Wake up)
Oh, what's goin' on? (Wake up)
'Cause we're wastin' so much time (Wake up)
And we're 'bout to lose it all (Wake up)
Oh, baby, baby, baby (Wake up)
Said, I need you, baby
Oh, I need my baby home
Bring my baby back to me (Wake up)
Oh (Wake up)
Oh, baby (Wake up)
(Wake up)
Call me, call me, call me

[Verse 1]
What a beautiful time we had together
Now it's getting late and we must leave each other, yeah
Just remember the time we had
And how right I tried to be
It's all in a day's work
Call me

[Verse 2]
Losing your love, acting foolishly
Go on and take your time
'Cause you're only losing me
Love is a long ways from here
Tell you, it's all in the way you feel
If your love is real
Come to me

[Chorus]
Call me, call me, call me
Come back home

[Verse 3]
The best thing I can do is give you your love
(is give you your love, baby)
Let you go on your way
Feeling as free as a dove
And if you find you're a long ways from home
And somebody's doing you wrong
Just call on me baby
Come back home

[Chorus]
Call me, call me
Come back home
Call me, call me
Come back home

[Bridge]
When you're worried
Things ain't going right, yeah
It's all in a day's work
Call me
When you're lonely
You can call me
When you're feeling sad, baby
Oh oh oh, yeah
It's all in a day's work
Come back home

[Chorus]
Call me, call me
Come back home
Call me
School days
How I wish for school days
How we used to run and play, oh baby

Now those days are gone
But we keep on going on
Wondering where they're gone
School days

I remember my love
Man, good times were easy all the time
How she really blew my mind

Oh, won't you come back to me
Oh darling, can't you see
I need you here with me always

Oh baby, let me say that it's
Easy together
Loving you whether
Whether you're near or far, oh
Now that we are
We might as well have some fun
Now that you know
Where I'm comin' from

Oh, my life is just your, your
(Incomprehensible) anything

Oh just come back to me
I need you desperately
Honey, won't you stay with me always

Oh, I, I want to, I want to remind her
School days, oh
I want to remind

[Verse 1]
I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
You're my one desire
Babe, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
You can make me cry

I can dance to the music
I can sing all night long
I can play with the band
Until you hear my song

'Cause I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
To see the party light
Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
Think they're red and white

I can dance with the fire
Burnin', burnin' love
I can stay until the party is all over

[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
And I'm over twenty-one
Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
And my life has just begun
Ooh ooh, I can dance to the music
Girl, I can understand
That there must be in life a power
That is holding my hand

[Bridge]
Dance, dance, dance
Oh, I understand
Young lady, young man
I say I understand

[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
And I'm over twenty-one
Hey, I'm full of fire (Full of fire, full of fire)
And my life has just begun

Ooh ooh, I can dance to the music
I, I can under, understand
That there must be in life a power
That is holding my hand, hey

[Bridge]
Dance, dance, dance
Oh, I understand
Young lady, young man
I say I understand

[Outro]
I can dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Hey hey, I understand
Stand, understand, understand
Hey hey, there's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey hey, there's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey, hey, and I can dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Hey hey, I understand
Stand, understand, understand
Hey hey, there's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey hey, there's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey hey, and I can dance
Let me say that I can dance
Hey, I'm full of fire, my heart's desire
Hey hey, I'm full of fire
Now, now that it's over, baby
I can come home to you
Just as I should do

And you're waiting there for me
Just as you should be
I'm hoping to see you soon

Now that you've got all the things
That you need, babe
You're still here waitin' for me

So good to be here
It's so good to see your face
It's so good to be loved by you
In every way

All I can say or do
Is give my love to you
Just as I should do
I can't imagine me leaving you
Wasting my time
When I wanna be with you, babe

So good to be here
So good to see your face
So good to be loved by you

Everyday it's hard to make you stay
But still in your heart
You're gonna run away from me, baby

So good to be here
It's so good to see your face
(Spoken: yeah, well, I don't know)

In the morning (yeah yeah yeah)
When I rise (Lord have mercy!)
Sweet teardrops (and I can't understand that, y'all)
Drop from my eyes (yeah)
About the things (yeah)
That go down (and this is a peculiar thing, but look)
When a guy (Lord have mercy!)
Is not around (yeah yeah yeah)

(But looky here)
About the girl I left behind
Couldn't find no peace of mind (good God!)
Back and forth is a waste of time (yeah)
And I'm broke and I ain't got a dime (good God, good God, good God!)

By the time (yeah)
I get where I'm goin'(and I'm gonna tell y'all one thing, look)
My whole life (my whole life, my whole life)
Is gonna be showin' (yeah yeah yeah)
All the things (yeah)
All the things that I've done (yeah, look, I can't understand that, but look)
And all because (all because, all because, all because)
I'm a foolish one (yeah yeah yeah ... I can't understand that, but look)
About the girl I left behind
Couldn't find no peace of mind
Back and forth is a waste of time (baby baby)
And I'm broke and I ain't got a dime

[Verse 1]
When the wind is blowin' in your face
Sometimes in life, you don't see straight
Pray to him, he will show
When your head is in a certain place
Nobody around to make you say
Stand strong and you will grow

[Chorus]
Oooh, wait 'til you see my smile
Oooh, wait 'til they see your smile

[Verse 2]
Don't they love to see you down?
Kick you while you're on the ground
Don't let emotions show
People always speculate
Don't let it get in your way
They say things they don't know

[Chorus]
Oooh, wait 'til you see my smile
Oooh, wait 'til they see your smile

[Bridge]
Hey
So you're doing better now
Everybody comes around
But you don't really need 'em much
'Cause you're stronger and you're better
And you're ready for whatever, sing

[Chorus]
Oooh, wait 'til you see my smile
Oooh, wait 'til they see your smile
Oooh, wait 'til you see my smile
Oooh, wait 'til they see your smile
Hang on to the world
As it spins around
Just don't let the spin get you down
Things are moving so fast
Hold on tight and you will last
Keep your self respect
Your womanly pride
Get yourself in gear
Keep your stride, mm-hmm
Never mind your fears
Brighter days will soon be here
Take it from me
Someday we'll all be free, yes

Keep on walking tall
Hold your head up high
Lay your dreams right up to the sky, oh yes
Sing your greatest song, mm-hmm
And you'll keep growing, growing on
Take it from me
Someday we'll all be free
Oh, oh, I said just wait and see
Someday we'll all be free
So just you keep walking
And you take it from me
Someday
Someday
You and me
We'll all be. . 
Free. . 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I said you can believe me
'Cause I'm gonna
You're gonna
I'm gonna
We're gonna
We're gonna
Be free, yeah
Oh oh
Yeah, ooh

[Verse 1]
I started to write this song about you
And then I decided that I would write it all about love
And it appeared to me
That you wasn't happy
And that's for sure, positively
That's what the world is made of

[Chorus]
So give me more L-O-V-E, love (Love)
Love is a walk down Main street (Oh love)
Love is an apple that is so sweet (Love)
Love is something that can't be beat (Love)
L-O-V-E is strange to me, Lord

[Verse 2]
I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
It's all in the heavens, can't you see
You can always depend on me

[Chorus]
To give you love (Love)
Love is a flower in my soul (Oh love)
Love is a story that just can't be told (Love)
Can't you feel it burning more and more? (Love)
Stop and look at the big wheel roll

[Verse 3]
I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
I would give my life for the glory
Just to be able to tell the story
About love

[Bridge]
I didn't mean to make you mad
A sweet story, I thought I had
But maybe time will bring us together
And I can be such a happy fella

[Outro]
About love
Love is something that is so divine (Oh love)
Love is a feeling that's a friend of mine (Love)
It can't be measured by no sign (Love)
In your heart or even in your mind, you gotta (Love)
About love, Love is as bright as the morning sun (Oh love)
Where it is, I don't how far, no (Love)

[Intro]
Yeah Mo Bee, drop it on me
Yeah, let's do it like this

[Verse 1]
If I was your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb
If you had the strength to walk out my door
My love would overrule my sense
And I'd call you back for more

[Chorus]
If I was your woman (If I was your woman)
If I was your woman (If I was your woman)
And you were my man, yeah

[Verse 2]
She tears you down, darling
Says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up, darling
When she lets you fall
'Cause you're like a diamond (Shining)
But she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
But me, you won't ask

[Chorus]
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
Here's what I'd do (What would you do?)
I'd never, never, no, no, stop loving you (Yeah, yeah)
Mmm, oh

[Bridge]
Life is so crazy
And love is unkind
Because she was first, darling
Will she hang on your mind?
You're a part of me (Part of me)
But you don't even know it
I'm what you need (I'm what you need)
But I'm too afraid to show it

[Chorus]
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
Here's what I'd do (What would you do?)
I'd never, never, no, no, stop loving you
If I were your woman (If I was your woman)
Here's what I'd do (What would you do?)
I'd never, never, never stop loving you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman
If I were your woman

[Intro]
The sunshine
The sunshine

[Verse 1]
You made my day
You came my way
You heard me every time, every time I pray
You gave me peace
You gave me grace
You put a smile upon my face

[Chorus]
You brought the sunshine
(You brought the sunshine)
In my life
(You brought the sunshine)
You are the lifeline
(You are the lifeline)
Since I have met Christ
There's been such a change in my life

[Verse 2]
He is the answer
Oh, it really doesn't matter
'Cause there's nothing impossible, nothing infallible
Nothing too hard for my God to work out
No matter what the problem
God can always solve them
I can hear Him calling so try Him today
He'll brighten up your day
He'll come your way and you'll hear it when He say

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
He is the answer...
And it really doesn't matter
Try Him today and He'll come your way
He'll hear you when you say, hee-hoo
No matter what the problem
My God can always solve them
If you hear Him call and say try Him today
He'll come your way
He'll hear you when you say

[Chorus]
You brought the sunshine
(You brought the sunshine)
In my life, oh, yes you did
(You brought the sunshine)
Oh, you are the lifeline
(You are the lifeline)
You saved my life
(You are the lifeline)
Oh, since I have met Christ
There's been a change in my life

[Outro]
I'm a witness (Witness), Jesus, yes He can
He will work it out for you
Hey hey, I'm a witness (Witness)
Hey, Jesus (Witness), yes He can

Do you know I'm a witness? (Witness)

Let me tell you, I'm a witness (Witness)
I know that Jesus (Witness)
A long time has come and gone
I've seen more than I should
You know I've seen it all
There's never been lack
For the marks on my back
Said a long time has come and gone
My hope is God for tomorrow
No more tears
Say goodbye to sorrow
In the middle of the desert
Said He would spring forth a well
My hope is in God for tomorrow

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
Once I was lost
But now I'm found
God shed His grace on me

I don't want to cry no more
I pour out my heart
Now I'm walking out the door
I don't want to cry no more
Somebody's got to help me please
For more than twenty years
My eyes been filled with tears
A long time has come and gone
You don't know me well
There are surprises that I keep
I could never tell
You'll never know
A long time has come and gone
Seen more than I should
You know, I've seen it all
Never been lack for the marks on my back
A long time has come and gone
Well, I'm trying Lord, to be full of Your conviction
Sometime temptation has its way
Will You hear my prayer, You don't owe me nothing
I need to feel You again and again, I hear You stray, yeah

When you think you stray too far
And you're afraid to ask once more
Remember child that you are mine
I'll hear your prayer and take you back again

Sometimes I stumble Lord and sometimes I fall
But all my questions Lord, You hear them all
Another day with You by my side
I have nothing to hide from You, You help me through

Come on, my

When you think you stray too far
And you're afraid to ask once more
Remember child that you are mine
I'll hear your prayer and take you back again
Oh, hey Lord, only want Your deliverance
Only time will tell it well
You make me feel, You make me

When you think you stray too far
And you're afraid to ask once more
Remember child that you are mine
I'll hear your prayer and take you back again

When you think you stray too far
And you're afraid to ask once more
Remember child that you are mine
I'll hear your prayer and take you back again

(Incomprehensible)

[Verse 1]
Strong as death, sweet as love
With the grace, of a dove
Oh baby
Let me in your life

We don't have that much time
There's no need in us crying
Hey baby
I'm in the mood for love

[Bridge]
If I could tell a story
Of just how it was
Before there was you and me
Before there was love
It was a sad affair

[Verse 2]
I got to go ahead with myself
Before I find...
Help me off the shelf
Sweet baby
One more thing I got to say
Strong as death
You're a power to be
Sweet as love
To you and me
Hey, hey baby
Take a chance on me

[Outro]
Hey, strong as death, sweet as love
Hey, let me just sing
Strong as death, sweet as love, oh, oh oh oh
Strong as death, sweet as love
Strong as love, sweet as love
Ah, you're playing too much music for me, hey
Nearer, nearer

The minister was preaching
And the crowd was standing near
The congregation sang in a tune
In the hall, it was loud and clear

All of the crowd that stood all around him
They were crying as I could plainly see
Oh, the songs that they sang was so touching
They were singing to my God to Thee

Nearer my God to thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee

Kept on singing
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Sometimes, I like to be in company
But when I get out, I like to stay out for long
Song is the only thing that can control me, Lord
When I know trouble, trouble's about to come

I fall down on my knees and call God late at night
And I know He'll make my, my burdens alright
I tell him, Lord, I have a desire to be
Nearer, nearer my God to Thee, Alleluia

Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee

Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee

I remember I was a little boy
Mother still used to (Incomprehensible)
I used to wonder what my mother was doing, have mercy, Lord
I stepped out one morning found mother all folded up

And mother had to rise up, she was looking towards the sky
And I saw the tears as they fell down my mothers eyes
And I can still hear the song mother was singing
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee
This song if for the people
Those that live in doubt
You won't have to scream
You won't have to shout
We've heard it over
Time and time again
There's someone I want you to meet
He is my best friend

He will bless the right
And condemn the wrong
Come my sisters and brothers
And sing this song

Chorus:
I've got a message for you
Gotta have a positive attitude
Nothing my God can not do
When we have a positive attitude

The time is now
To reach all the people
Now what I'll do
Is keep my mind on You
Blessed assurance
Jesus is mine
Look beyond my faults
Just one more time
Please Lord, forgive me
Try me one more time
Your truth and devotion
I can't deny
Repeat Chorus

Come on
Can you play the solo
So come on people
Give your faith a try
He will never let you down
No His love you can't deny
We have such a blessing
In this opportunity
Of going to our Father
For our joy and assurance
Blessed assurance
Jesus is mine
Want you to forgive me
Just one more time

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 1]
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think
That the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
That life's a bore
So full of the superficial

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Trumpet Solo]

[Verse 2]
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus]
Soy solo para ti
Y nada me hace feliz
Si no estas tu, baby
Si faltas tu, baby
No quiero mas variedad
Si ya, no se de nadie mas
El mundo es un vacio
Si me faltas tu tu tu
Soy solo para ti
Y nada me hace feliz
Si no estas tu, baby
Si faltas tu, baby
No quiero mas variedad
Si ya, no se de nadie mas
Y el mundo es un vacio
Si me faltas tu
Yeah

[Outro]
If I ain't got you with me, baby
Ooh, ooh
Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby

[Verse 1]
Like a damsel in distress
I'm stressin' you
My castle became a dungeon
'Cause I'm longing for you (Longin' for you, babe)
Feeling strong for you
You're my knight in shining armor
See your face in a silver moon
All over the lagoon
And it feels like...

[Chorus]
Dragon days, and the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot, yeah
Dragon days, I need to be saved
I'm missin' you
And the daily drag on, and on

[Verse 2]
Desperate for you, baby
Do you know what that means?
I feel like an addict must feel
When he fiends
In an act of desperation
I get lost in my dreams
'Cause like a lady in waitin', I'm waitin' for you
Like a prisoner tied over alligator waters
Waiting for my prince of paradise to come and
Take me away from these... (Tock, tick)

[Chorus]
Dragon days, and the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot (So bad, baby)
Dragon days, I need to be saved
I'm missin' you, yeah, yeah
And the daily drag on, and on
Don't you wanna play

[Bridge]
D.R.A.G.O.N days
Got me D.R.A.G.G.I.N
'Cause I want you, babe
And I need you, baby, oh

[Chorus]
Dragon days, and the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot (I need you a lot, I need you so bad)
Dragon days, I need to be saved
I'm missin' you, yeah
And the daily drag on, and on
Dragon days, and the fire's hot
Like the desert needs water
I need you a lot (I need you a lot, I need you so bad)
Dragon days, I need to be saved
I'm missin' you
And the daily drag on, and on, drag on

[Verse 1]
Give me a ticket for an airplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone
And I'll be going home
My baby done wrote me a letter
Looka here now, I gotta say
I don't care how much money I got to spend
Gotta get back, get on back to my baby one more 'gain
Lonely days are gone

You know you got it good, yeah
Sing to 'em, girls
It looks good like that
Here we go, here we go, what's up
1, 2, 3, uh...

Toe to toe
Dancing very close
Barely breathing
Almost comatose
(Come on, come on, don't stop)

Wall to wall
People hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture
(I like that, haha, come on)
Back to back
Sacroiliac
Spineless movements
And a wild attack
(1, 2, 3, hit it!)

Face to face
Sadly solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty-four hour shopping in rapture
(Yeah, come on, ladies, let's go!)

Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly
To all my hot girls and my hot guys
You know I'm fresh, you know I'm good
Keep the latest fashion like we always could
There were four friends, in New York they met
And they always stick together in the City of Sex
Me and my girls gonna catch a cab
Up Fifth Ave. with some shopping bags
Wherever I go, two friends behind me
Three's company but four is a party
Turning heads in a cute little cafe
Girls night, conversation getting nasty
Empire State, Emirate State
Me and my homegirls, 'cause they my soul mates
Grown and sexy while you married with kids
'Cause I'm so Carrie and my man's so Big
Hahaha, you like that? 1, 2, 3, go!
Toe to toe
Dancing very close
Barely breathing
Almost comatose

Wall to wall
People hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture
(Fab 5, what's good?)

Back to back
Sacroiliac
Spineless movements
And a wild attack

Face to face
Sadly solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty-four hour shopping in rapture
(Yeah! It's a rapture)
If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?
Was I everything that you were looking for?

If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I've been looking for

I don't want to forget the present is a gift
And I don't want to take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed

So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again

Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Oh oh oh
How many really know what love is?
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it?
That it's everything that we are looking for

When I wake up in the morning
And you're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I've been looking for

I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
The time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed

So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Can you do that for me baby?

Every time you touch me
See we don't really know
Touch me like this is the last time
See everyday we never know
Promise that you'll love me
I want you to promise me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Like you'll never see me again

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Let's have a real good time, yeah, yeah
Some people don't know what it means
To have a real, real good time

Say it son, see I remember long time ago, yeah
My mother told me, she said son, son
She said son, son, son no matter where you go
Try to have yourself a real, real good time

So I thought tonight would be a fine time
For you and I to get together
And clap your hand like this
One, two, three, four

We're gonna have a good time
We're gonna have a good time
Hey, let's have a good time, one time
Hey, let's have a good time, c'mon

All the bad dreams will be comin' up in clover
And we gonna sing with the heavenly choir

We'll have a real good time, let's have a good time
No, let's have a good time

Right up ahead in front of me, yeah but

Clap your hands with me

Everybody in the studio, have a good time
Have a good time
You keep me crying all the time
I have to say that you
Keep me crying all the time

Well, I tried to play my music
But my music was too loud
Well, I pleased all the people
But I couldn`t please the crowd

And I dropped down on my knees
And said, hey, mama
Won`t you clear my head
Don`t you know they
Keep me crying all the time

They keep me crying all the time
Oh, Lord, don`t you know they
They keep me moaning all the time
They keep me burning all the time

Well, I tried
To run my business
But they said I can`t
Just keep it to myself
Not bothering any man
Just as sure as I try
Cause my tears in my eye
Don`t you know they
Keep me crying all the time

They keep me crying all the time
Friends knocking in my door
They keep me crying
Somebody calling on the phone and
They keep me crying...

[Verse 1]
Some people, they call me crazy
For falling in love with you
They can take me and lock me away, baby
'Cause there's nothing those bars can do

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll be the rising moon after the setting sun
Just to let you know, you'll always have someone
I'll be the clearest day when the rain is done
So you'll always know

[Chorus]
Through the shake of an earthquake, I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm, we can risk it all
That's how strong my love is

[Verse 2]
I used to feel kinda lonely
'Cause the world, it can be so fake
And all that matters, I'm telling you, is you and me only
And the fortress from love we make

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'll be the water you need in the desert land
Just to let you know you'll always have my hand
I'll be the woman you need to be a better man
So you'll always know

[Chorus]
Through the shake of an earthquake, I will never fall
That's how strong my love is
Like a ship through the storm, we can risk it all
That's how strong my love is

[Bridge]
Oh, can't nothing break us down
Oh, 'cause we are heaven bound
Like the mountain standing tall
Immovable, we're here to stay
Oh, can't nothing get in the way

[Chorus]
Through the shake of an earthquake, I will never fall
(I will never fall)
That's how strong my love is (That's how strong my love is)
Like a ship through the storm, we can risk it all (We can risk it all)
That's how strong my love is (That love is)
Through the deepest waters
I won't let you drown (I won't let you drown, ohh)
That's how strong my love is
(Oh, that's how strong my love, my love, my love)
'Cause we're the moon in the sky
That will never come down (Never come down)
That's how strong my love is (Oh, that's how strong my love is)
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is

[Verse 1]
I ...(my my my my)
Oh, I can turn a gray sky blue
You see, I can make it rain when I want it to
Oh, I can build a castle from a single grain of sand, yeah
I, you see, can make a ship sail on dry land, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Unhappy am I with all the powers that I possess, yeah
Girl, you're the key to my happiness and I...

[Chorus]
(Can't get next to you, babe)
Ooh Lord
(I can't get next to you)

(Can't get next to you)
I don't know what to do

(Let me say)
I .. (my my my my my)
Oh, I, oh Lord

[Verse 2]
I can fly like the bird in the sky
Oh, I can buy anything that money can buy
Oh, I can turn a river into a raging fire
Oh, I, and I can live forever if I so desire, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Unhappy am I with all the powers that I possess, yeah
Girl, you're the key 'cause I...

[Chorus]
(Can't get next to you, babe)
Baby baby
(Can't get next to you)
I've been trying a long time
(I can't get next to you, babe)
(I can't get next to you)

Oh, come on

[Verse 3]
(Let me tell you that)
I can turn back the hands of time
You better believe I can
Oh, I, you see, I can make the seasons change
Just by waving my hand, let me say
I, I can change anything from old to new, girl
Oh, I, yeah, and all the things I want to do the most
You see, I'm unable to do, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Unimportant are all these things
That I'm trying to do here today
Girl, you see, I...

[Chorus]
(Can't get next to you, babe)
I've been trying a long time
(Can't get next to you)
Oh, somebody oughta help me
(Can't get next to you, babe)
Oh, let me, let me go
(I can't get next to you)
Let me!


I, Lord, I've been working on it, baby
I've been thinking about it
Oh, I, you see, I've been trying to call you all day long
But, you see, I don't have your phone number, honey
I, I've been, I've been thinking about you baby, something awful, you see, I
Oh, I, sometime I feel like I want to moan about it
And I just don't know what to say, and I say yeeeee...
I had a dream
Thinking that you were gone
Leaving me on my own

And you, you was there
In some other`s arms
Giving away all my charms

And when I awake
I want to hear you
Filling my life with cheer

And when I come back
You won`t be alone
Cause I`ll be at home

Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
With you at home with me

I`m so?
It was only a dream
Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
Is all I have to hold
Since you`ve been gone

I can be so good to you
Help me, help me sing

Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
Ever since you been gone
I`m glad it`s only a dream

Let me say one thing
Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
Is all I have to hold
Since you`ve been gone

Come on back home
Sometimes I dream
About you, baby

Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
Ever since you been gone....
If it's love that you're running from, there's no hiding place
You can't run it, you can't hide it, you can't run it
Love has problems I know but there problems, we'll just have to face
If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
We're gonna walk and don't look back
Don't look back
And don't look back
And don't look back, baby
Don't look back

The places behind you let them re-remind you
If your first lover broke your heart
There's something that can be done
You don't run it, you don't hide it, you don't run it
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done
So if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on walking and don't look back
Forget about the past now
Don't look back, baby
Keep on walking and don't look back
The places behind you let them re-remind you
Love can be a beautiful thing
Though your first love let you down
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby
The second time around
So if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on pushing and don't look back
Now, till I say, we won't look back, girl
Keep on walking and won't look back
Forget about the past now, baby
And don't look back
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't look back
Darling you were meant
For me, for me, for me
Whatever you want baby
You know I got it
For you, for you,I want it for you
You make my dreams, you make my life true
Oh babe
You make my life, oh my life's
Gonna be alright too

(Chorus)
Nobody but you, baby
Nobody but you X3
Nobody but you, baby. (Yes sir!)
Nobody but you X3 (yeah)

Darling you, I'm not gonna hurry
To explain (explain)
That you are everything
I can't refrain (I can't refrain)
I can't explain (I can't explain)
Hold my hand, Hold my hand
Please try to understand
You make my dreams, you light up my life
(oh boy!) I'm uhh
I want you, I want you, I want you in my life. (Hey, Hey!)

(Chorus)
Nobody but you, baby. (Hey!)

[Verse 1]
Can anybody help me? I'm outta plans
Guess I left my world in somebody's hands
I don't like to hurt but, but everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on, that's what I really need

[Pre-Chorus]
Now here we stay, it's all that we're worth
I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
Whatever they tell you, we're bigger than words
I've been where you're standing, I know how it hurts
Let this be a song now and this be a day
And we stand together, we'll be okay
'Cause we're survivors, we're making it work
Expecting the best when they hope for the worst

[Chorus]
One love, this is the way we found
One love, even though they'll let you down
One love, nobody's perfect now
One love, don't let that hold you down
One love, let's stick together now
One love, we've got to stand our ground
One love, it's easy to believe in
One love, believe in you and me
One love

[Verse 2]
Now I could try and fix this all by myself
But I know it'd turn out better if u help
No one likes to hurt but but everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on that's what everybody needs

[Pre-Chorus]
Now here we stay, it's all that we're worth
I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
Whatever they tell you, we're bigger than words
I've been where you're standing, I know how it hurts
Let this be a song now and this be a day
And we stand together, we'll be okay
'Cause we're survivors, we're making it work
Expecting the best when they hope for the worst

[Chorus]
One love, this is the way we found
One love, even though they'll let you down
One love, nobody's perfect now
One love, don't let that hold you down
One love, let's stick together now
One love, we've got to stand our ground
One love, it's easy to believe in
One love, believe in you and me
One love
One love, even though they'll let you down
One love, nobody's perfect now
One love, don't let that hold you down
One love, let's stick together now
One love, we've got to stand our ground
One love, it's easy to believe in
One love, hey, believe in you and me
One love, it's one love

[Outro]
O-N-E L-O-V-E

Sing with me, one love
One love to be, oh, one love
That's all we need
One love

[Verse 1]
Seems to me like the days are getting longer
For everyone there's no fun when there's no time to sleep
Working on and on for a day, in the sun
Counting down the days till it stops, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Can you hear us? While the sun on my skin
And the world that I'm in makes me delirious
Can you hear us? With a smile on my face
On a far different place, I'm delirious

Can you hear us? While the sun on my skin
And the world that I'm in makes me delirious
Can you hear us? With a smile on my face
From a far different place, I'm delirious

[Bridge]
Take me away, make me a holiday (Delirious)
Take me away, make me a holiday (Delirious)

[Verse 2]
Under the sun I feel I'm getting stronger
Time to rewind my mind, recharge my batteries
'Cause it takes so long and too soon it's gone
Holding back the days to my reality, yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge]
Take me away, make me a holiday (Take me away)
Take me away, make me a holiday (Delirious)

[Chorus]
Can you hear us? While the sun on my skin
And the world that I'm in makes me delirious
Can you hear us? With a smile on my face
On a far different place, I'm delirious

Can you hear us? While the sun on my skin
And the world that I'm in makes me delirious
Can you hear us? With a smile on my face
From a far different place, I'm delirious

And the world that I'm in makes me delirious
Can you hear us? With a smile on my face
From a far different place, I'm delirious
I spy a girl with a book in hand
Playing games with her body to forget about a man
I spy a man with a book in hand
He's abusin everybody would agree that he can

Is it working?
Is it working for you?
Is it worth it?
Hide the eyes from the truth

I spy a girl with a falling man
Working nights, sleeping days to forget about the past
I spy a man with a twisted plan
Playing love with his body to escape the pain

Is it working?
Is it working for you?
Wooo is it worth it?
Hide the eyes from the truth

Maybe time, can
Fill the empty heart inside
Maybe time, can
Wipe the tears away
Maybe time
Fill the empty heart inside
Maybe time (maybe time) can
Wipe the tears away
I spy a girl with a book in hand
Playing games with her body to forget about a man
I spy a man with a book in hand
He's abusin everybody would agree that he can

Is it working?
Is it working for you?
Wooo is it worth it?
Hide the eyes from the truth

Maybe time, can
Fill the empty heart inside
Maybe time, can
Wipe the tears away
Maybe time (maybe time)
Fill the empty heart inside
Maybe time (maybe time) can
Wipe the tears away

Wooo - ooo

Maybe time, can
Maybe time
Maybe time, can
Maybe time
Maybe time, can
Wipe the tears away
Wooo - ooo

[Verse]
In spite of all the consequence
In spite of all my pride
In spite of little things you said
That hide me deep inside

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe your love, I breathe your love
Like the air in the morning
I sleep your love, I salute your love
And I can't get away

[Chorus]
Baby when the lights go out
I hear you calling, I hear you calling
Baby when the lights go out
I need you
Baby when the lights go out
I hear you calling, I hear you calling
Baby when the lights go out

[Verse 2]
The lights of all you see
You could have overcome all this
And I still can't get over you
Are you someone I'll forever miss?

[Pre-Chorus]
I believed your love, I can feel your love
And that's all that I wanted
I sleep your love, I salute your love
And I can't get away

[Chorus]
Baby when the lights go out
I hear you calling, I hear you calling
Baby when the lights go out
I need you
Baby when the lights go out

And there's the dark, begins to rain
The sound is heavy on me
Baby when the lights go out
I need you

[Bridge]
Under the spell I wanna be under your touch
Under the spell I wanna be under the rush

[Chorus]
Baby when the lights go out
Baby when the lights go out
Baby when the lights go out
I hear you calling, I hear you calling
Baby when the lights go out

They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood ho

When the sun goes down we get up on the floor
When we light it up all you see is the smoke
Got smoke signals in the sky when we burn the club up
Got smoke signals in the sky when we burn the club up

This is going down tonight, make a move and choose somebody
I got the perfect view right now
Them girls be lookin my way
Yea we live a sexy life
Not a bottle will go to waste
When we set the place on fire
It's clear, the lights go red

[Pre-Chorus:]
Shawty you better hold on tight when the bass is into your chest
It goes off like dynamite and when I you blow off that dress
When we party we go hard iladi dadi
You see more explosions than Motley Crue show

[Chorus:] 

[x2]
When the sun goes down we get up on the floor
When we light it up all you see is the smoke
Got smoke signals in the sky when we burn the club up
Got smoke signals in the sky when we burn the club up
Smoke signals in the air, then we taking over this club
Dirty winding everywhere, pretty girls be surfing that crowd
We can dance the night away, we can drink until we lose count
Far many shots we had and not much as let the drink down

[Pre-Chorus:]
Shawty you better hold on tight when the bass is into your chest
It goes off like dynamite and when I you blow off that dress
When we party we go hard iladi dadi

You are the music
You are the reason I believe
You are the seasons
You are the blessing I receive
You are the answer
Lighting the fires of passion burning deep
You are inspiration
Running like a million rivers over me
And you take me
And you take me
To the place I've never been before
Let me hear the beat
It just keeps going, huh?
Oh, it's fast
Can you slow it down, a little bit?
Okay
I could use a little more rhythm
Knock a little louder, sugar
Yeah, that's really bad
Nothing's change, nothing's change, nothing's change
But everything must change!
There we go
Now we're doin' something

A little distortion in my left ear
A little distortion, tell me can't you hear
A little distortion in my left ear
A little distortion, tell me can't you hear

It feels good to me, makes me feel alright
It feels good to me, makes my burdens light
It feels good to me, makes me feel alright
It feels good to me, makes my burdens light
A little distortion in my left ear
A little distortion, tell me can't you hear
A little distortion in my left ear
A little distortion, tell me can't you hear

But it feels good to me, makes me feel alright
It feels good to me, makes my burdens light
But it feels good to me, makes me feel alright
It feels good to me, makes my burdens light

A little distortion

It feels good to me, makes me feel alright
It feels good to me, makes my burdens light
It feels good (It feels good to me, makes me feel alright)
It feels good to me, makes by burdens light

A little distortion in my left ear
A little distortion in me, tell me can't you hear
A little distortion...

What are you trying to do?
Make me deaf or something?

A little distortion in my left ear
A little distortion, tell me can't you hear
But it feels good to me, makes me feel alright
It feels good to me, makes my burdens light
But it feels good to me, makes me feel alright
It feels good to me, makes my burdens light

A little distortion
A little distortion
A little distortion

Oh you can't be recording that one
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Visions in my head would lay
All the plans I had delayed
Tricks on me my mind will play
See you laying next to me

Wind that shakes the barley tree
Kurt, the only friend of me
He prepared me food and drinks
'Cause I will need all my strength

Tomorrow, I'm finally coming home tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey, what's one more day to wait?

Tomorrow, you'll be back in my arms tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey, what's one more day to wait?
(One more day)
I been countin' all the days
Watchin' all the season change
And I no longer have to wait
'Cause I'ma see your pretty face

I meet with this foolish shrink
Tries to tell me what to think
But I'm wiser than he know
In one ear and out it go

How can they say you don't exist?
When I've been branded by your lips
Nothing they can say or do
Will keep me from seeing you

Tomorrow, I'm finally coming home tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey, what's one more day to wait?

Tomorrow, you'll be back in my arms tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey, what's one more day to wait?
(One more day)

I been countin' all the days
Watchin' all the season change
And I no longer have to wait
'Cause I'ma see your pretty face
Tomorrow, I'm finally coming home tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey, what's one more day to wait?
(One more day)

Tomorrow, you'll be back in my arms tomorrow
I just gotta get through today
But hey, what's one more day to wait?
(One more day)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

My niggas so trill, my niggas so trill
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know

[Verse 1]
Why ask a question that already got an answer?
End of discussion, meet the polar bears, you pandas
Rubberband bananza
When I'm in the land of
Twenty grand a standard
Make you understand us
I'm sorry if you ain't got ya stacks up
Tell yo click to patch up
That envy get you patched up
Dog, y'ain't ready for this
Machine thang ready to spit
I ain't just tellin' you shit
Peat game look at my wrist
Flo Rida franchise, I'm like the pizza man
All about cheese, full of dough
Let me

[Mobile?] I ain't local
Ghetto nigga, done wit postal
Stuntin' hard, that's my focal
Now my cash goin' coastal

[Chorus]

The world don't revolve around me
That's what the haters say 'til that revolve around me
Fort Knox, I'm in the spot
Big knocks, right off the block
Closed shop, come in that drop
Hoes flock, givin' me props
I used to be gross, 'til that income grossed
Me enough to toast, like I'm on the sitcoms
Champagne overdose
East Coast, West Coast
Came in the game, wit a remote
Turn on my fame, I got to glow
A project dude? The new dollar signs
All this from on the grind
All this from writing rhymes
Silver shoe boxes, big faces on my watches
Seven figures that's the object
No more 

[carrying a?] sausage

[Chorus]
Ain't no need to ask why
I let them rubber bands fly
I let them rubber bands fly
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know

[Verse 3]
Flo Rida so abusive to them Ben Franks
Rubber bands flyin' like the pilot had too many dranks
Turbulence, she makin' it bounce
I got the best seat in the house
Twerking it, I'm losing count
She workin' for that dollar 'mount
A privilege just to be a prospector, ballin
Mo' issues a pistol fallin'
Official, the shot callin'
Holdin' it down, settin' it off
Money to floss, bitch I'm a boss
Takin a loss, no matter the cost
Women to toss, I live in a 

[loft?]
Carol City, doing big thangs, baby
Them Dade County streets raised me
Ever since the early 80's
APT's, live in the hood
Triple beams, slangin' that good
Krispy Kreme, where I stood
Livin' the dream, just like I should

[Chorus]
Ain't no need to ask why
I let them rubber bands fly
I let them rubber bands fly
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know

Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Hey
Remember those days when we use to be close
Life ain't the same how we use to be known
Out the window...
You letting everything go
I say my whole world use to be about you
Now it's kinda strange living life without you
I can't even think now...
We ain't anything now
Yeah remember them days I was waiting in the rain
Accepted all my fairs and accepted all my pain
We were so close don't let it go nooo
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go, Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
I keep reminiscing how you use to be mine
No other women it was you on my mind
Can't replace it
All I can do is face it
See why would u leave me
You left me to be free
I need you but we don't speak and I hardly see you
We should work it out why you playing these games
You loved me back then but now everything changed
We were so close
Don't let it go no
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go, Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

[Sean Kingston]
I'm losing my mind, 'cause she's one of a kind
Oh, she's so fine, gotta make her mine
Everything I do is only for you, 'cause you're my boo
Yes it's so true

My heart is so broken it's splitting in two
Looking so sad 'cause I'm feeling so through
Missing the days of being with you
'Cause I was stuck to you, girl
Feel like I'm trapped and I cannot get loose
'Cause I'm so lost I don't know what to do
Yeah, I'm so bad and I'm confused, but I'm still stuck to you, girl

[Joel Madden]
'Cause even when I meet you, yeah I knew I couldn't have you
I knew that I would try, and mess it up, what can I do?
And even when you're gone and all my friends all say I'm crazy
Say it ain't right, I want you to have my baby

Oh, Shoulda let you go 

[x3]
Let you go

[Sean Kingston]
Now I'm sitting home, feeling all alone
Wish you had a clone, 'cause girl you got me gone
Here in this chair, wishing you was here
But now it's getting clear, that you don't even care

My heart is so broken it's splitting in two
Looking so sad 'cause I'm feeling so through
Missing the days of being with you
'Cause I was stuck to you, girl
Feel like I'm trapped and I cannot get loose
'Cause I'm so lost I don't know what to do
Yeah, I'm so bad and I'm confused, but I'm still stuck to you, girl

[Joel Madden]
'Cause even when I meet you, yeah I knew I couldn't have you
I knew that I would try, and mess it up, what can I do?
And even when you're gone and all my friends all say I'm crazy
Say it ain't right, I want you to have my baby

Oh, Shoulda let you go 

[x3]
Let you go

But if I walked away, I know you'd come crawling back
You're playing hard to get, and I know it's all just an act
'Cause even when I meet you, yeah I knew I couldn't have you
I knew that I would try, and mess it up, what can I do?
And even when you're gone and all my friends all say I'm crazy
Say it ain't right, I want you to have my baby

Oh, Shoulda let you go 

[x3]
Let you go

Let you go go go go
Wrap you around, wrap you around me
Wrap you around, eh, eh

Come over here and give me
Some of that somethin' that you got, eh
Take my hand, take me heart
Take me anywhere you are
Oh, when I'm losin' my mind
And the madness just won't stop

I think about you, I think about me
I think about us together
I think of your eyes lookin' at mine
And I'm better, better

This world's too much for me to take
Come, give me some, some sweet escape
Get next to me, come close to me, grab hold of me
Wrap you around me, oh, oh, oh, oh
Wrap you around me, oh, oh, oh, oh, eh, eh
Come, take me into that place
Only your love can take me, eh
Come, touch me now 'cause you're the one
With the touch that can save me, oh
When it all gets too much, when it all gets too crazy

I think about you, I think about me
I think about us together
I think of your kiss touchin' my lips
And I'm better, better

This world's too much for me to take
Come, give me some, some sweet escape
Get next to me, come close to me, grab hold of me
Wrap you around me, oh, oh, oh, oh
Wrap you around me, oh, oh, oh, oh, eh, eh

Your love surrounds me on my tender shelter
I know no one could ever love me better
Nothin' could make me feel the way I feel
When I'm beside you

This world's too much for me to take
Come, give me some, some sweet escape
Get next to me, come close to me, grab hold of me
Wrap you around me, oh, oh, oh, oh
This world's too much for me to take
Come, give me some, some sweet escape
Get next to me, come close to me, grab hold of me
Wrap you around me, oh, oh, oh, oh

Snoop Dogg, C-walk to this
Snoop Dogg, yeah, C-walk to this
Snoop Dogg, C-walk to this
Snoop Dogg

Bam, boom, whatchu gon' do, 'cuz?
Guess who rollin' in with them baby blue Chucks?
An' I've still got my khakis creased
I'm still loc'n on these beats an' keep a bad bitch on the streets

It's the S N double O P'n
Biggest dog of 'em all an' you'se a flea'n
An' since I got time to drop it for you, I guess I must
An' give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust

I keep the heat on deck but in God we trust
An' can't none of y'all fuck with us
But you can run up on the G but that's not thinkin' wisely
These thrillers are 'Contagious', just like Ron Isley

What the hell is goin' on?
Someone's sleepin' in my home
Snoop to the D O double G
Get in where you fit in, follow me
Who's the man with that dance? Snoop Dogg
Who keep the khakis for all his pants? Snoop Dogg
Keep the low-low in a three wheel stance, Snoop Dogg
Still got the 'Gin and Juice' in hand, Snoop Dogg

I do it for the G's an' I do it for the hustlers
Here to annihilate you mark-ass busters
Eff the police 'cause all they wanna do is cuff us
The world is fuckin' Chilly as if his name was Usher

But I'm still ridin' them 'Lacs, makin' them G stacks
An' got them cornrows to the back
I ain't really tryin' to be picky
But if you give me somethin', it's got to be the sticky

Green by the ounces, low-lows bouncin'
Sandy Fay an' Annie Mae kissin' on my couch
An' ooh to the ouch an' Moet fountain
That's how we get down at the Doggy Dogg House'n

This year we ain't fuckin' with thousands
We clean with millions that get fly as a falcon
Pull up to the Doggy Dogg Palace
With a car full of bitches cookin' grits like Alice

Who's the man with that dance? Snoop Dogg
Who keep the khakis for all his pants? Snoop Dogg
Keep the low-low in a three wheel stance, Snoop Dogg
Still got the 'Gin and Juice' in hand, Snoop Dogg
Three 14 inch rims is runnin' on the side
They're ridin' on the side? Yeah, they runnin' on the side
Three 14 inch rims is runnin' on the side
They're ridin' on the side? Yeah, they runnin' on the side

Three 14 inch rims is runnin' on the side
They're ridin' on the side? Yeah, they runnin' on the side
Three 14 inch rims is runnin' on the side
They're ridin' on the side? Yeah, they runnin' on the side

Take two an' pass it, it will not burn you
From the Long Beach Chronicles to the Wall Street Journal
They all know the G with the Cutlass Coupe
Ask Bill Gates, "Yeah, I know the homie, Snoop"

Yeah, I'm straight loc'n, hangin' wit my folk
An' follow Rakim 'cause 'I Ain't No Jokin
An' cuz, I done seen so much, like what?
Enough to have your feelings touched

When the gunshots rattle, all your boys scatter
Check up on your homies but they gave ya bad data
Make a nigga stop breathin', have his soul relievin'
An' now you niggas believin'

In what I say 'cause what I say is so real
Homie, you don't wanna see the steel
You don't wanna catch a body, you came here to party
Now that's what you should do, now where's my baby boo?
Who's the man with that dance? Snoop Dogg
Who keep the khakis for all his pants? Snoop Dogg
Keep the low-low in a three wheel stance, Snoop Dogg
Still got the 'Gin and Juice' in hand, Snoop Dogg

Yeah, no introduction is needed
But for those who still refuse to accept
The readin' on the wall for the new Mack-Allenium
This is the Archbishop Don Magic Juan
Chairman of the Board of famous players everywhere

An' I'm puttin' it down with Big Snoop Dogg, the legend
The king player, my friend, yo' friend, the L.B.C. savior
Also known in this new Mack-allenium as 'Da Boss'
Akon and Elvis white Yay

Na,na,na; I Love U; na,na,na; I Love U; and only U
(Fade) Im so lost girl without you

Its just not the same without you

[Verse 1]
Down in the workshop, all the elves were making toys
For the good Gentile girls and the good Gentile boys
When the boss busted in, nearly scared them half to death
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath
From his beard to his boots, he was covered with ammo
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo
And he smiled as he said with a twinkle in his eye
"Merry Christmas to all! Now you're all gonna die!"

[Chorus]
The night Santa went crazy
The night Saint Nick went insane
Realized he'd been getting a raw deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain

[Verse 2]
Well, the workshop is gone now—he decided to bomb it
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger
And he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen
And he took a big bite and said, "It tastes just like chicken"!"

[Chorus]
The night Santa went crazy
The night Kris Kringle went nuts
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole
Without stepping in reindeer guts

[Bridge]
There's the National Guard and the FBI
There's a van from the Eyewitness News
And helicopters circlin' 'round in the sky
And the bullets are flyin', the body count's risin'
And everyone's dyin' to know ... oh Santa, why?
My, my, my, my, my, my
You used to be such a jolly guy

[Verse 3]
Yes Virginia, now Santa Claus is dead
Some guy from the SWAT team blew a hole through his head
Yes little friend now, that's his brains on the floor
I guess they won't have the fat guy to kick around anymore
But now there's no more presents for children's enjoyment
And the Elves gotta stand in line to file for unemployment
And they say Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night
With her lawyer, negotiating the movie rights

They're talkin' 'bout

[Chorus]
The night Santa went crazy
The night Saint Nicholas flipped
Broke his back for some milk and cookies
Sounds to me like he was tired of gettin' gypped

Wo-oh, the night Santa went crazy
The night Saint Nick went insane
Realized he'd been getting a raw deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain
Wo-oh, something finally must have snapped in his brain
Tell ya, something finally must have snapped... in his brain

Love is for all, for all, for all, for all

I spend a lot of time looking for a better day
Changing looking like it's many years away
Slowly, slowly getting closer as my hope takes over for all
La-la-la-la
I'm pushing to the limit through the pouring rain
I see my parents work hard through the tears and pain
I guess we all do the same, let your dreams lead the way for all
La-la, yeah

I wear my heart on the sleeve and I'm not the only one
(I'm not the only one)
I always get back on my feet and I'm not the only one
(I'm not the only one)
I learn to cherish every moment now, I'm not the only one
(I'm not the only one)
As long as we're together, you'll never feel alone, at all

Love is for all
Life is for all
Dreams are for all
Hope is for all
Fell the love from everybody in the crowd now
This is for y'all, this is for all
Love is for all
Life is for all
Dreams are for all
Hope is for all
Fell the love from everybody in the crowd now
This is for y'all, this is for all

Sometimes I sit back, relax and enjoy the feeling
If I'm living, oh I'm barely living, oh I'm still breathing
Today is something different, I woke up on the good trip
But the next part of my life where I could flip the world I live in
And now the sun is shining in my face
The doors are all well opened, will never close again
I do it for the love and let my dreams lead teh way for all

I wear my heart on the sleeve and I'm not the only one
(I'm not the only one)
I always get back on my feet and I'm not the only one
(I'm not the only one)
I learn to cherish every moment now, I'm not the only one
(I'm not the only one)
As long as we're together, you'll never feel alone, at all

Love is for all
Life is for all
Dreams are for all
Hope is for all
Fell the love from everybody in the crowd now
This is for y'all, this is for all
Love is for all
Life is for all
Dreams are for all
Hope is for all
Fell the love from everybody in the crowd now
This is for y'all, this is for all

Dancing 'til we up to the top, you get up
We're strong enough that nothing will stop, now get up
Don't ever let your energy drop, get up
And everybody throw your hands up

Dancing 'til we up to the top, you get up
We're strong enough that nothing will stop, now get up
Don't ever let your energy dro?, get up
And everybody throw your hands up

Love is for all

Hope is for all
Fell the love from everybody in the crowd now
This is for y'all, this is for all

Love is for all
Life is for all

Fell the love from everybody in the crowd now
This is for y'all, this is for all
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so, I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came

You know how I feel this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer

I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart at your call
I hear harps and angels sing

You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on and I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you

You know how I feel, I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying 'I do'
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop, then tell me, just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, hey farewell to sorrow
This is my life and I want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you
(No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you
(If I can't stop)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you
(Know I do girl)
I just can't stop loving you
(You know I do)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
Next week on U-62, he's back
And this time he's mad
Gandhi II
No more Mr. Passive Resistance
He's out to kick some butt
This is one bad mother
You don't wanna mess with
"Don't move, slime ball"
He's a one-man wrecking crew
But he also knows how to party
"Gimme a steak, medium rare"
There is only one law, his law
Gandhi II

[Verse 1: Aretha Franklin]
My Lord, I have read this book so many times
But nowhere can I find the page that says
What I experienced today has any grace

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Now I know that life is meant to be hard
That's how I learned to appreciate my God
Though my courage may be tried, I can tell you I won't hide
Because the footprints show you were by my side

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin]
You can lie to a child with a smiling face
Tell me that color ain't about a race
You can cast the first stone, you can break my bones
But you're never gonna break, you're never gonna break my faith
Faith and hope ain't yours to give
Truth and liberty are mine to live
Steal a crown from a king, break an angels wings
But you're never gonna break, you're never gonna break my faith

[Verse 2: Aretha Franklin & Mary J. Blige]
My Lord, won't you help them, help them, help them to understand
That when someone takes the life of an innocent man, woo
Well, they never really won because all they've really done
Is set the soul free where it's supposed to be

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin]
You can lie to a child with a smiling face
Tell me that color ain't about a race
You can cast the first stone, you can break my bones
But you're never, you're never gonna break my faith
Faith and hope ain't yours to give
Truth and liberty are mine to live
Steal a crown from a king, break an angel's wings
But you're never gonna break, you're never gonna break my faith

[Bridge: Aretha Franklin & Mary J. Blige]
For those we lose before their time
I pray their souls will find the light
I know that the day will surely come
When his will, His will will be done
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, it will be

[Outro: Aretha Franklin & Mary J. Blige]
You're never gonna break my faith
Oh yeah
He will, He will, He will
Never gonna break my faith
You're never gonna break my faith, never, never
I'll keep holding on, I'll keep holding on
Never, never, never
Never, never
Never, never, never, never, never, never
You're never gonna break my faith
Oh yeah, ain't gonna break my faith
Never, never

[Hook: Mary Jane]
These eyes never lie
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
No time, to say goodbye
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me

[Verse 1: Prohgress]
People say that I should've be chasing papers
The ones who say it claim they ain't movers and shakers
I mean, I feel the principle, but back to reality
What's the point of me working if I can't feed my family
Strategy? I got none, and that's abundantly clear
So I take pride to be the new pioneer
And I'm living moment to moment hoping someone will notice
Then go back for my folks and everybody support us
Bought us a couple minutes 'cause they knew that we finished
We winners, we had it in us ever since we beginners
Visions of gettin' money, that's the new frontier
But I ain't gettin' no money, I'm making income here

[Hook: Mary Jane]
These eyes never lie
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
No time, to say goodbye
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me

[Verse 2: J-Splif]
How to make mistakes, I apologize
Got my hands dirty, chasing devil's pie
Through the ups and downs I learned to realize
Don't ever take for granted people close in your life
I'm broke in my pockets but love I got plenty
Blessed with good people, you couldn't pop a pennies
We in this thing together, no weather's gonna stop this
Trains left their station and breaking's not an option
Times gettin' difficult 'cause people tryna cross me
Whisper this and that behind my back, killing me softly
But my skin's thick, that nonsense doesn't hurt
I'm 'bout to be major before I leave Earth

[Hook: Mary Jane]
These eyes never lie
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
No time, to say goodbye
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me

[Verse 3: Kev Nish]
New suit (Right), clean shoes (Right)
Make sure my tie's right and my fade is tight
It's been a long time comingfrom rags that feel drumming
Different strokes introducing Asian folks
Blues I'm still humming, birds I'm still wantin'
Freestyle's back on the curb, I'm still bussin'
Can I get a little bitty of time
You know I earned it, puttin' in work like my granddad first did
My man Catch birthed it, innovated a purpose
Power to the people no matter the surface
When we rise together you gon' say it's worth it
And if time is money, I got seconds to earn it
Without you, there's nothing like an empty bucket
Without you, I'd say "Bucket? Who that?"
You was the fans, the homies and fam
I wouldn't lose you for nothing, love

[Hook: Mary Jane]
These eyes never lie
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
No time, to say goodbye
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me

[Outro]
I say farewell
I hope all is well
Yeah yeah yeah
Say I don't care
I throw my hands in the air
I do it my way
I got no fear
Say I do what I want
Yeah I do what I want
You know I do what I want
I do what I want

Because I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Man I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want

Wild out stylin', I came to get down
And ya can't believe that FM on your dial
Hatin' on my crown 'cause the kicks stand out
When I kick the raw sound, then I make ya walk it out
Yeah critics try to test the best
I'm flippin' nose at shows 'cause i dress the best
FM on my chest, I rep the west
I'm world-wide, haters on house arrest
So when they tell ya how to do yo thang
You tell em step off 'cause the kicks so clean
I got no shame, I'm proud like a champion
I'm at the top of my game
Because I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Man I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want

Yo, why you on my grill?
Homie fall back, just tryna chill with my Pontiac
Pick up a girl, maybe pick two
Im'ma big deal and I'm from a sick crew
It's the 18, we get the job done
It's 24/7 always on the run
Reppin' LA, that's where I'm from
Aim for the top, coming straight from the slums
Sick of the hate that's pointed to my dome
Quiet all the yappin', you fake Jenny Jones
How can you doubt me, I got to much passion
Reppin' FM till they drop in my casket

Try and tell me this and try and tell me that
But I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
It goes in one eat and right out the other
'cause I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't

Yeah yeah yeah
Say I don't care
I throw my hands in the air
I do it my way
I got no fear
Say I do what I want
Yeah I do what I want
You know I do what I want
I do what I want
Workin' 9 to 9, I'm just tryna sing it live
Is it really any different that I'm wokin' on my rhymes
'cause my swagger to sick, all my flows too cool
Or the fact that I wear my shades in the early afternoon
Really buggin you? Sorry I didn't know about the rules
But I'm pretty sure that mama didn't raise no fool
You can say watchu will, but it ain't no use
Im'ma still low ride, throwin' up the double u
I got my vans on they cost a billion
I do what I want and there ain't no stealin'
Flow so cold 'cause ya boy is chillin'
Haters can't fight the feelin'

Because I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Man I do, what I do, what I do what I want
Yeah I do, what I do, what I do what I want

Yeah yeah yeah
Say I don't care

[Verse 1]
Who's that waddlin' down the street
It's just me cause I love to eat
Fudge and Twinkies and deviled ham
Who's real flabby?  Yes, I am
Every picture of me's gotta be an aerial view
Now my doctor tells me, there's just one thing left to do

[Chorus]
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
Throw out the pizza and beer
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
Now get those jelly donuts out of here
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
Might seem a little severe
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
I'm gettin' tired of my big fat rear
Blow, fatty!

[Verse 2]
Well, I used to live on chocolate sauce
Made sumo wrestlers look like Kate Moss
Walked down an alley and I got stuck
I got more rolls than a pastry truck
When I'm all done eating, I eat a little more
When I leave a room, first I gotta grease the door

[Chorus]
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
Can't have another eclair
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
I gotta decrease my derriere

I'm on a grapefruit diet
I'm on a grapefruit diet
I'm on a grapefruit diet

[Bridge]
No more pie now
No more creme brulee
Lay off the gravy
And souffle
No French fries now
No ice cream parfait
Mr. Cheese Nacho
Stay away

Oh, I think I'd sell my soul for a triple patty melt
But I need a boomerang when I put on my belt

[Chorus]
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
Lay off the 3 Musketeers
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
Until my big booty disappears
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
I eat 'em till they're comin' out of my ears
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
'Cause I haven't seen my feet in years
I'm on a grapefruit diet
I'm on a grapefruit diet
I'm on a grapefruit diet

[Outro]
I think I'm about ready for a Quarter Pounder with extra cheese, and maybe a side order of onion rings and-oh, don't forget to super-size that, yeah!

She might be with him but she's thinking 'bout me, me, me

[Verse 3]
I was all in da club, havin' a drink, blowin' on a sweet
When I peeped this little freak out
I was all in the bar, wind drift up, Shawty Redd came on
Then she hit the floor, now
With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home, with them real big hips
You so right I'm gon' beat
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say shh"
See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it was no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have an eruption

[Chorus]
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, whoa
Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, whoa whoa

[Outro]
Sexual eruption
All the time, anytime
Sexual eruption

[Snoop]
Ya,uh
I was once told
You get your freedom
By letting your enemy know that
Youll do anything to get your freedom
Then youll get it
Its the only way youll get it
When you get that kind of attitude
Theyll label you as a crazy negro
Or they just call you a crazy nicca
They dont say negro
Or theyll call you an extremist
Or a subversive
Or a setatus
Or a red or radical
But when you stay radical long enough
And get enough people to like you
Youll get your freedom
So dont rum around here
Tryin to make friends
With somebody whos deprivin'
You of your rights
Their not your friends
NO.. they ya enemys
And treat them like that
And fight them
And youll get your freedom
And after you get your freedom
Your enemy will respect you, and will respect you
And i say that with no hate
Cuz i dont have no hate in me
I have no hate at all
So i say to you, Big Man
Im the man you think you are
If you want to know what ill do
Figure out what youll do
And ill do the same
Only more of it NICCA
(damn... shit)
Oh it ain't over muthafuccaz

[Chorus]
I wanna go study, baby would you be my buddy?
And help me with my project, cause you are who I roll with
Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with
Five days out the week, my stay's out the street
It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet

Honeydew, money do
But this ain't about no money, this about me and you making ooh
Take it from me, first day of school I'm looking cool, I got my clothes pressed
I'm a senior but I'm seeming like an old vet
Time will pass me by if I don't graduate this time so I expand my mind
Find ways, to elevate it, motivate it, calculate it, reinstate it
Look at you girl, you got me dedicated

[Chorus]
Uh, put me on the game
Though I keep my head in these books, I'm not a lame
Usually kinda square, I'm trying to use it for a change
Telling bitches things, like if wanna get with me you gon need a lot of brains
And just cause I don't play, who say I can't ball?
My nigga Mac, dude me and him is in the same hall
So don't get mad if I relax and get my bake on
Just promise that you'll try to catch me if my grades fall

[Chorus]
Devin there you are, look at my repertoire
Spitting game, you know for reppin hard
Change that perspective, that's my objective
Cool and oh so collective, connected
Check this, I need you more that you could know
See you the seed in my weed, baby help me grow
Let it go, let me know where to meet at
Student of the week, baby I will be that, you know I need that

[Chorus]
Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at
Call you on your phone and never come see you, darling I will never do that
I'm roaming through the halls and asking people who be with you just to try to know where you at

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

[Chorus, snoop singing]
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
Yeah
Don't do it

Fell off into a party in the cpt
Niggas looking at me strange
But I'm up on the game
I ain't f**king with them niggas no mo
Shit, I feel the same way y'all feel
Nigga, f**k death row (ha ha)
I cut em loose, send em juice
With visine in their cup
Catch em slipping, all my homeys get em stuck
It's the tale of a whale locked in a cell
On the streets he was the heat cause 'cause had major mail
Had his homeboys plugged, wearing gold chains
Hanging at the studio, splurging and thangs
Nigga f**king off money, saving them hoes
F**ked off some money of mine
And bought me a white rolls
Living on wilshire in a penthouse suite
F**king bad bitches seven days a week
Colder than a motherf**ker but now I'm hot
Floss me a brand new suit from dionne scott
I guess I'm balling now
Money falling down
I can hear them movie star bitches calling me now
Doggy dogg come and get with the pg
Mr. calvin broadus could you please come and see me
But I ain't tripping, I'm just dogg pound cripping
Talking big shit and in a bulletproof dipping
Make my own beats, so f**k y'all too
And I'm down with the niggas from the you know who
We get to the point
Blaze the joint
Step into the party and holla at everybody
As long as the gin get mixed with juice
And the five on the crap game gon hit with deuce
Shit niggas gon be niggas so nigga, nigga what
Just because I'm having paper don't mean f**k
I once was in the same predicament you was
Thinking to myself "damn should I kill 'cause? "
But I know deep in my heart
Two wrongs ain't right
And it started from a fist fight
I only got one life to live
I'm trying to see a grandfather with some grandkids
You dig?
I'm trying to live long like my hair
Put the shit down, like fred estaire
I want to share my world
But how the f**k can I share it
Everytime I throw you something
You look at mine and compare it
Man, it's a cold shame
But it's a cold game
I ain't make the rules to this game
Look, all I know and all I do
Is try to come through with something new
Banging for you
So whatever you do, you like it or not
Because when your shit play out
I be back on the dope spot
My grandpappy once sat me in his lap and he said
"son get your money like that" (get your money, man)
I sit alone in the zone
Face of stone
Live the live of al capone
A don corleone
Casually casualties, fatalities
And all kind of funny looking niggas coming after me
Funny, it's got me dodging, dipping, slipping, and sliding
Eastside up, eastsiders cause we riding (eastside up)
This is portable something to f**k with your ear
Doggy dogg will appear to make it sound so clear
I f**ks it up, like I always do
And that's a trick
I'm saying some shit
To make the bitches want to suck my dick
See it's an everyday thang
Communicating to y'all with the dogg pound slang
Back up in the house and we just don't stop
Call ya mama, f**k her fat, call the motherf**king cops
Hit roccs, yeah, you know what? you know what
They told me like this

I've been trying to develop an alternative fuel from a mix of all natural substances
But the mix was highly volatile until we found a catalyst
To help stabilize the compound and supercharge the fuel
I'm sorry, what was this magical catalyst?
Marijuana motherfucker

Ladies and gentlemen, players and playettes, teachers, staff, and students
I am very honored to welcome you to the high school annual talent show
Brought to you by the makers of Wiz Khalifa premium rolling papers
And the qualified growers of Snoop Dogg master Kush
So without further a due let's get this show on
First contestant bring your talent to the foreground and let your smoke be the background

[Chorus]
Every time I go out, I'm goin to smoke out
I buy it don't even know the price
As long as I live it, come pay me a visit
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky
My nigga it's 'bout to go down, oh
We fly, it's not lie, that we high, 'til we die, oh
?
Got a joint filled with quality shit
My bottom bitch smokin' with me niggers talk shit, all of 'em shrimp
I'm a big fish, roll a joint lick it once tell you hit this
Rubies on my dick, several cushions on my hit list
In and out these niggas bitches
Smokin' tree and not to mention hustlin' tryna mount my business
You probably went to class while I was in the hallway skipping
Yeah I hear what they sayin', just be too high to listen
Got my money trippin' if I even fold it wrong
You ain't smokin' this good, if it's fire I tell you I sold it all
Or wait 'til one of my hoes come 'round and roll it all
Or say fuck it, and cuff it till I roll with dog
I show up, I show up, I show off
Car push to start, hit the button once it go off
Keep the money comin' in and the papers rolled up
We ain't worried 'bout a hatin' nigga they get no love

[Chorus]
I go green like I was the Archbishop Don Juan
And blow circles 'round you suckers like a marathon
My gym teacher told, but I didn't listen
My bitch did my homework, and now I'm in detention
It sure beats suspension, this is my audition
So play your position, get the picture I envision
Did she mention? Snoop Dogg was made for kissing
A barracuda fishin', she on a mission for me
Pleasure, pain, and glory, and my inventory
My SAT's, my lil' bitch she did 'em for me
And now we prancin' on stage at the talent show
We flossin' my clothes my chains and my knapsack
Full of that, hand me that, can't you see my telescope?
Principal said she wanna see me 'cause she smell my smoke
'Bout my money trippin' even if I fold it wrong
Blowin' zones with Wiz 'cause this is the protocol

[Chorus]

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
You got beef then go and run on up
We ain't worried about nothing
Half of y'all doing nothing but nothing
You got beef then go and run on up
We ain't worried about nothing
Half of y'all doing nothing but talking
Ain't it man?

[Warren G]
I'm strictly to street with it, listen to me
They speak it but we did it, they hated on my "Ghetto Village"
But if Stevie can see it, it must mean that I'm real with it
Corporate America gotta deal with it
I'm riding this 'til the finish line
213 still in this 'til they give me mine
Rewind the show and watch the movie
I'm mad as fuck I let this industry use me

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm a low-key OG which is well known
Snoop Alfons Capone Corleone
In the streets with the elite my rap sheet is hella long
Let it go, naw let it 'lone
You wanna battle when the shadows are creapin'
And if you talking about beef then nigga ain't no sleepin'
The hood ain't got no Geneva either
If you run off at the mouth then I'm gonna leave you breathe-less
Breathless, chestless, best list' ya bastard
Looking at my homies like you wanna slide past them and get with me
Need I warn you I'm from Dogg House motherfucking California
Now if you want it like you think you do
We can set up a head up and I bank ya boo
Don't underestimate, a lot of suckers player-hate
They know about the big D-O-double, Warren G and Nate

[Nate Dogg]
Too much talking shit
Let's get down to this list
If you got beef go and run up
I'ma bust him in his lip
I'm gonna shoot through that dude vest
Shut the fuck up and run run up

[Hook: Daylyric]
Baby please take your time

When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know

All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she cryin' for

Hand on my Nina, leanin' in my beamer

Put the kids to bed, take a bleezy to the head
Yea, that's what the homie said

Back up on my good foot, feelin like an actor
Back in '88, sold yogurt out the wrapper
Then I became a rapper
Money up front but I guide it up to back er
New shoes, new clothes
All for the fuck of it
Played my cards right so it's safe to say I struck it rich
Givin back, takin care of everybody
I'm doin bad, homie don't you worry bout it
Walk the walk and try to talk the talk
I'm tryin to give you more than just food for thought
If you movin while you grooving
Hopin' that you won't get caught
Never let em know about it
Only let em hear about it
Hit that paper, read about it

Word of mouth, the streets talkin
I'm in the D-Town, droppin' off a sea hawk
Hit her with some G talk
And slide off with that east side long beach sea walk, ya dig?

That's my work
I'm in overtime mode
You call this time and a half

[Verse 1]
Me and my partner in my Impala
Poppin our collars, tossin' up dollars
A truck on the side of us with hoes that wanna follow
Bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna swallow
Doggy Doggfather
I do it to you real hard then it gets harder, it's not a
Thang on mine, bang on mine
I smoke a ounce and bounce at the same time
It's off the limbo with Timbo, you motherfuckin' bimbo
So quit knockin' at my window, you nympho
Maniac, bring it back, now shake it up
Put it on the table, now break it up
Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it
It really don't matter what you spent on it
As long as you're gettin' what you paid for
That's what it made for, ain't that what you stayed for?

[Chorus]
Who that dippin' in the Cadillac?
Snoop Dogg
Smoke 'til your eyes get cataracts
Snoop Dogg
Who got a girl layin' on her back?
Snoop Dogg
Who that makin' that paper stack?
Snoop Dogg

[Verse 2]
You play me and I'll play you
You pay me and I'll pay you
Hold on, boo, you got the game all wrong
This ain't your thang, this my song
Move on, we in the club at the Shark Bar
Valet my keys and park my car
No snapshots, 'cause I might get popped
As I slide by security, givin' 'em props
First thing I do when I get in
Let me take you back to when I first slid in
Grab my gin, get my Pit in
Put my bid in, no bullshittin'
We'll be sittin' in the corner
With smoke comin' from up under us like we sittin' in a sauna
Burnin' up the charts, break a bitch heart
Little mama, don't you start

[Chorus]
Who that dippin' in the Cadillac?
Snoop Dogg
Smoke 'til your eyes get cataracts
Snoop Dogg
Who got a girl layin' on her back?
Snoop Dogg
Who that makin' that paper stack?

[Verse 3]
Tick-tock the ice on my watch
Slapped me 'cross the face 'round two o'clock
But the party don't stop 'til we blow up
Now every little bitch wanna show up
Maneuverin' to this, groovin' to this
Dippin' to this, flippin' to this, trippin' to this
Ain't no skippin' to this, trust this
Bust this, it's too hot to touch this
He say, she say, I say "no way"
Don't need foreplay, okay, obey
Everything that I say
And every day'll be like a holiday
I'll put you in the front seat of my car
And roll you 'round town like a superstar
Recline your seat and turn up the beat
Number one with a bullet rollin' down the motherfuckin' backstreets

[Chorus]
Who that dippin' in the Cadillac?
Snoop Dogg
Smoke 'til your eyes get cataracts
Snoop Dogg
Who got a girl layin' on her back?

Feat. T.I

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Hard times and good times... when they're mixed together
It can only make you stronger... even live a little longer
I see the Gs on the corner, holding steel, think they're real
But oh, it's only a short life...
Pennies on their eyes cause they won't see tomorrow

[Hook]
Sometimes, I wanna run away, but I'm holding on to what I feel
In this life, we don't crush no deals, back in the day
Back in the day when I used to be a mindless kid
Now I'm on that holy bid, no regrets for the things I did
It's the only way, only way, only way...
To live with no regrets...
You know you'd better live with no regrets

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You can roll up your problems, smoke 'em like a champion
You can pray for a miracle, and still nothing can happen
I ain't never bid us over, and I'm no predictor of the future
But I know, it's a short life...
Pennies on their eyes cause they won't see tomorrow

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
15 with kingpin, kilogram dreams - money talks
You ain't talkin' money, G,? Well we ain't talkin' 'bout a damn thing
(You know) Whip it 'til it's hard, serve it to the dope fiend
(You know) Or bring me 21-5, get a whole thing
On triple-beams they weigh up
You owe me, homie? Best pay up
Don't make me raise this AK up
You and your homie get sprayed up
My lifestyle wild - he ain't got a clue
Don't let this smile fool you, bruh, this what you'd better do:
Give me my R-E-S-P-E-C-T
'Fore I leave you D-O-A, you won't need no D-O-C
About my D-O-G, I swear to G-O-D
I push that line with no regrets, I won't lose one night's sleep

[Hook]

[Chorus]
I'm not trying to be right try to be wrong
I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably never change
I'm not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably be the same

Every time I try to get my life to get to someone it seems
What you are doing try to ruin my hopes and my dreams
Push away and always go get away
Keep some grams in my pants have a hit a day
Am I wrong am I right
Do I care living life
On my own papa's home what am I feeling like
Musician premonition what you call it...
Do your thing with... back upon it
Lucky... oh how I used to be I am probably the same way cook
As I will probably keep the g secretly you all are backing with me
So we... expecting to get their photo come back stage and hit my...
Cool individual I am never too good... is from hood
Never from hollywood

[Chorus]
Growing up I don't know as much
I was too busy chasing money and all the stuff till I was old enough
Getting every dollar before... so they could know it's us
Every party we are showing up bagging full of... never too long nigga
Matter of fact you can have it the one in rotation my motivation is savage
... and nigga think they are but they ain't no comparing
And they are not doing no harm but I think there is no comparing
I keep making deposits and no way no interference
I am your broadcast I just... just smell... when I go past
... I am kind of hot but you should know that

[Chorus]
It's the big mack, yeah
I got this new shit right here man
You might wanna hit this

[Chorus: x2]
You can put it in a zag, I'ma put it in a blunt
You can sit in the back I'ma sit the front
No stunt no punk it really don't matter
'Cause I got what they want

They say all day we play n blow
See this is the only thing we know
I blow kush again, on the push again
With a bad lil' cute lil' Mexican

Uh, zigzag how I roll mine
You can tell I be a G how I hold mine
I ain't into loanin' shit, I'ma own mine
Bitch fuck with me, stumble on a gold mine

Break bread or fake dead, punk bitch this is real life
Executive branch, what it feel like?
Catch me if you can I'm your local kush man
Sittin' in the stairs what a hundred grants in my pants
And I blow so much smoke
Pure OG hit it once might choke
See I'ma go kick it bitch I can poke
And you can ride too, high school take a toke

[Chorus: x2]
No stems, no seeds
Mac gave me all the class that a nigga need
Just taught my old bitch how to roll weed
And the nigga ridin' wit me gettin' high with me

? to my young nigga Devin
Got to hangin' wit Mac and now we twenty-four seven
On the go smokin' dro, deep on the west side
Bangin' where it's hood at
Yep, you gotta love that

Yep, I love that
Niggas used to offer but I wouldn't
Now I'm all askin' where the bud at
Makin' it happen me and Mac just got two bitches
Crackin' ? tryna smoke weed all night I'm down for getting tatted

Spat it up and tat it up
Suit it up and boot it up
Pioneers baby ain't nothing that you can do to us
Inhale, that's the high school
Dev and Mac, we known to act a damn fool, you dig?
You know what
It may sound crazy but uh
Yeah, Dev and Mac
High school
It may sound crazy but uh
It may sound crazy but uh
W-Balls, it's your main man DJ E-Z Dick
About to unleash another one of those platinum plus hits
And the word is on the streets, and the word is the streets
We gon' go to a live remote, licking wit' my main man Mr Doggy Dogg
A day in the life, of a Rollin' 20 Crip
I'm just a stuburn type of fella with a head like a brick
And just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc'ness
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip
I bust a funky composition that's smooth as a prism
Now check it as I kick off in this funky ass rhythm
It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww nah, Dogg ain't this y'all
I got couple relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all
I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs
Like K-Dub, Top Cat, B-Reel, E-Rock, Boo-Lay Face
And the homie Har'ron rest in peace
Big Jay from Cappinella Park
He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on, rocking big neck bone
Mauseberg I had to put you on my song
It's so real, I had show some love
Now back to the scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood
It's about you being jealous bout what I does
'Cos I does it the most, the King of The Coast, in a Pink Plaint Pos
I back ya down like Shack Daddy and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up Wiltshire Boulevard
I'm not Xzibit, you can't pull my hoe card
I fucked all your groupies, when you was doing time and kept Snoopy
With the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches
And you was paying niggas off of all my riches
You so hard caught, why ain't you go to level four? Oh, I know
(Bitch)
But I walk the main line every time I go down
You can check my G Files, I do it LBC style
I got the word on ya Simon, you need to just start rhyming
(Simon)
'Cos you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggas just crumbs off my table, you're not able
To compete with the heat that I drop
And I still ain't been paid, for One-Eight-Seven On A Cop
I started yo shit and I'll end yo shit
If you keep talking shit on Crip
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous of my paper stack
(Jealous ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous of my paper stack
(Gon' get pimp slapped)
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous of my paper stack
(Jealous ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous of my paper stack
(Gon' get pimp slapped)
Money, I get it, paper I got it
Heaters, I keep 'em, bitches, I got 'em
Money, I get it, paper I got it
Heaters, I keep 'em, bitches, I got 'em
If I shoot you, I'll be brainless and you'll be famous
And I'll be spending money out the anus
Your only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level
Man you worser than devils
A lotta niggas should've said it, fuck 'em
But I'ma say it for 'em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for 'em
This nigga's a bitch like his wife
Suge Knight's a bitch and that's on my life
And I'ma let the whole world see
'Cos you fucked up the industry and that's on me
We can go head up, nigga, set it up
Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up
Your rappers and artists, tell 'em, shut it up
'Cos I'll fuck every last one of 'em up, especially Kurupt
See that's my lil' homeboy, so he knows what's up
He better keep it Crippin' and slip his clip in
'Cos these niggas trippin', this is official business
Do the same way, leave no witnesses
This is that unexpected diss directed, sprayed, covered and protected
Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it
It's all to the good again
You can catch Snoopy Dibby Double in the hood again
Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit
To make the whole world feel it
So put the bacon in the skillet and try to peel it
'Cos Doggy style Records is the realest, nigga
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous of my paper stack
(Jealous ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous of my paper stack
(Gon' get pimp slapped)
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous of my paper stack
(Jealous ass nigga)
It all boils down to the fact that you're jealous of my paper stack
(Gon' get pimp slapped)
Money, I get it, paper I got it
Heaters, I keep em, bitches I got 'em
Money, I get it, paper I got it
Jealous ass nigga

Behind some bitch-ass nigga with a whole lot to say
Man fools is confused ain't no rules to this game
Niggas be telling the feds where a nigga lay his head
Giving them niggas code names
Cold game, but I can't even say shit about it
Cause if I catch you slipping, dipping tripping I'm getting rowdy
Kill a snitch fuck a bitch I throw 'em both in a ditch
Cause they can't stand to see a young nigga getting rich
I'm destined for fame
Oh bitch-ass niggas putting salt in the game
Put a stain on your brain cause I shall remain
And I know longer dwells in the cocaine game
It's a shame the way the game has switched
And the police man trying to take my shit
I caught a nigga one day jumping out of a cop car
I ain't saying no names but this nigga's a rap star
Walking real fast then he dashed in my backyard
Buff ass nigga perpetrating to act hard
In the front seat with no cuffs on
I ask him bout the discussion he say the wrong thing I rush him
Dust him, cause I can't trust him
Plus he working with the boys we bring the noise so fuck 'em
I tuck him in the trunk, I ain't fuckin' with no punk
Nigga snitching nigga missing cause we twisting

And 17 nails Cause bitches talk shit and snitches get killed
Snitches, snitches, snitches Niggas that run they muthafuckin' mouth like bitches

You can walk on the left on me
Baby girl you know you bring out the best of me
I don't know, just might be destiny
But I'm haste to see how the rest will be
Love has a recipe, and this is just a test for me
To see it... you're sweeter than sweet ...you're just like juicy fruit
Lady you looking like a tasty pizza, candy
Let me get you in the mood, and get gangsta in the room
And we can stay a while and make sure you understand me
Stop playing girl, show me some love, that's what's up
Let me holler at you
I got something to say to you, the way you move
It's like chronical...
And if you play it smooth I'll show you how a gangsta do

My Cadillac...
Stacking up the revenue, and if you ready Boo

[Bigg Snoop Dogg]
You'z a fool fo' dis, yeah

Eastside shit, y'all know how we get down
7 dizzles a wizzle, Bigg Bow Wiggle's, up in the hizzle
Fo' shizzle bizzle, here we go again

Freshly dressed, I jump up in the mo'nin' tryna find some Zest
Psyche, we like the Bom, somebody betta ring the alarm
And hit the folks at the forum
Let my homies off the yard
I shall see the head nigga in charge
Push... Bush outta office, dump 'til they get off us
Make them offers, that leave niggas in coffins

[Goldie Loc]
Can you feel it my nigga, I'm 'bout to kill it my niggas
Sound like guerillas, fo' real'a off gangsta government millas
Coke killas, when it comes to off mic'n wit me
I was branded in a gang, f**k havin' techniques
Just ride, not a damn lettin' these fools breathe
Pop peas, push keys, find a stash fo' yo cheese
Is it possible that laws might get jealous
Hell yeah they be hatin' on the 3 Good Fellas

[Tray Deee]
Over-dosage of ferocious, WestCoast in effect
Bang straight gangsta shit, so you know it's on deck
Hold and respect, cold as it get, don't wanna test
Kidnap ya wife and ya kids, you get the message
Insanity, commanded me to savagely spit
Suffer casualties, challenge me, I handle it quick
No talkin', C-Walkin', we chokin' the block off
Lettin' the Glock off
And throwin' up DoggHouse

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
WestCoast niggas and we all in yo house
Gang bang niggas we gon' turn this bitch out
Eastside ridaz and we all in yo mouth
Dogg Pound Gang we let the mothaf**kin' doggs out
Nate Dogg, Goldie, Snoopy, Tray Deee
Never loved a ho and run the "G-A" in me
Always got a bitch, but never in the front seat
Still the same let the mothaf**kin' doggs out

[Goldie Loc]
Yeah! it's about to get Crip'd out crazy
Blast on all you suckas with the throw away to daily
Don't you shoot that little mothaf**ka no mo'
That ain't what he said when he hit the chest went through his heart, came out his elbow
You shouldn't have been talkin' that shit bitch boy
Sayin' the wrong thing against the real McCoy
Didn't know I was a cold-blooded gangsta
If you ain't ridin' wit us fool, we'll catch ya lata

[Tray Deee]
We exploded, reloaded and sewed it up
Sprayed shots to the crowed, like a loaded pump
Keep this mothaf**ka jumpin' 'til they close it up
Then we dippin' wit a sip and some hoes to f**k
Pour late, the hard way, ain't no bustas here
So explict you can only get it once a year
Eastsidaz, the ridaz, they change the game

And let you know from here go, we straight came to bang

[Bigg Snoop Dogg]
Put me on a leash if you dare and I doubt you
Ever see someone here, who gave a f**k about you?
Niggas on the streets gon' keep talkin' shit about you
As long as you clap fool, it's bigger than 'bout too
F**k wit fools, that ain't never paid us
And try to turn the homies into traitaz
Blue rags with blue balls, fo' all you hataz
I shoot a shout out to the killas
Yeah them stealas and Raiders

[Soopafly]
It's them D-O double G'z
Ain't nobody really f**kin' wit deez

[Bigg Snoop Dogg]
Who let the mothaf**kin' doggs out?

[Soopafly]
DoggHouse in ya mouth
We them niggas people talkin' about

[Bigg Snoop Dogg]

[Soopafly]
Niggas betta run and hide, we about to ride

[Bigg Snoop Dogg]

[Goldie Loc]
Now all the locs and doggs, who roll in big balls, say chips! (Chips!)
And all the women wit extensions in well fed conditions, you bitch! (You Bitch!)

[Bigg Snoop Dogg]
Hey! who let the mothaf**kin' gate open?
Police comin' and we still smokin'
What you drinkin' on Loc'y, Loc'y?
Doggy wo'gy, got his fo'gy while we tokin' on the wo'gy, doggy

[Goldie Loc]
Say woof mothaf**ka!, woof mothaf**ka!
Mighty mowed his ass, take his block fo' the hustlas
Post up, make about a million a month
Hittin' Bloods!, switchin' guns!

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
WestCoast niggas and we all in yo house
Gang bang niggas we gon' turn this bitch out
Eastside ridaz and we all in yo mouth
Dogg Pound Gang we let the mothaf**kin' doggs out
Nate Dogg, Goldie, Snoopy, Tray Deee
Never loved a ho and run the "G-A" in me
Always got a bitch, but never in the front seat
Still the same let the mothaf**kin' doggs out
There is still a little love left for me in your heart
Even though it seems to you that we are far apart
You can turn your eyes to other guys, ignore me on the street
But don't forget it's bound to show if we should ever meet

And there is still a little love left for me in your heart
You can use a little love to make a brand new start
For no matter how you try
You just cannot deny
There is still a little love in your heart

But you're far too proud to say what's on your mind
I can read you like a story book, do you think I'm blind
For every place I seem to be, you seem to be there too
Standing in the wings of love and waiting for your cue

[Kokane]
Life is much mo' precious
Than you'll think
Like a game'll make yo chips sink
It's so hard
Hard to trust a smile and face
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place
Keep my head up and stand tall
If I stumble, then I'll fall
Will you pick me up at all?
Will you pick me up at all?
I'm a keep it gangsta till my end
Cause some people do pretend
And ain't too many of us that we can call friends
That we can call friends
Ohhhhhhh

[Goldie Loc]
Now all I gotta do is keep my head up
And walk a straight line when fake friends won't mind
But I'm kind-hearted
And don't like being stepped on
If I wasn't real, I wouldn't be in this position
Like that, dogg, I got a whole lot to say
I'm by myself with my rhymes when we kick it all day
Lil' Jay used to say I'd never be nobody
But you know what I never do?
Smoke it off like Gotti
Five million dollar hits puttin in saxophones
Tray Deee & Snoop, we sound good on this microphone
I never threaten nobody to make it happen
Let me show you how we eat a full meal off this rappin'
But if I had a chance to give it back
I'd give it to the ones who helped me do that
Do that, straight from the heart
Eastside till I die
We ain't no contract friends, we doggs for life

[Tray Deee]
It's a trip how we Crip
Suppose the enemies still
With both sides ride causing plenty of tears
Insane's and 20's both from the same city
A bunch of down niggas and it ain't that many
Me, C, and the G can think back to the start
Homies chillin', getting high, shooting craps in the park
And having a heart
To get 'em up if it was beef
Head up like G's, take it out in the street
Hold ya own was the code that I growed to view
So I fucked with and stuck with a chosen few
But Snoop Dogg, you can call me, whatever the case
And homie that ain't nothing that the set could erase
You put me with the homie, Goldie, though we never had spoke
A Insane with a 20, now we hell of a close
And y'all kids, my kids, so we family now
Cause I could never see you doing bad without
And that's real

[Kokane]
Life is much mo' precious
Than you'll think
Like a game'll make yo chips sink
It's so hard
Hard to trust a smile and face
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place
Keep my head up and stand tall
If I stumble, then I'll fall
Will you pick me up at all?
Will you pick me up at all?
I'm a keep it gangsta till my end
Cause some people do pretend
And ain't too many of us that we can call friends
That we can call friends...

[Dialogue]

[Man 1] Excuse me, Doggfather, um, Bookalots is here to see you and he doesn't have an appointment or nothin', but he just wanted to stop by and show some respect and say a few words. What do you think?

*gunshot*
Ahh-haaa
Get your motherfuckin' glass
Cus it's a blast from the past
You didn't think would touch it two times nigga
Gin and Juice up in this bitch, yahhh
Some of that Beats By the Pound flavor, you feel me (you heard me)
Get your ice, get your cups, Cus we about to get fucked up in here
Yah (yah), Straight up, Uhmm (uhmm), Yah (yah)

I'm still smokin', driftin', swifta than a mothafucka
Twisted off a cup of that 'ole ignat juice
Heated in the seat cup fulla drank
Beatin' up the block in the dark blue tank
Bullet proof vest on my chest for the cause
Diggin' in my draws for dem muthafuckin' laws
Harrassin' a nigga, blastin' a nigga
I ain't seen shit, so why you askin' nigga
To fucked up off that G-I and juice
C-I get loose, nigga what chall wanna do
I got a crew, but I choose to roll solo
Especially on Sundays dippin' in my low-low
??? Spot for the Glock, I ain't fuckin' with the hen dogg
So toss out the ???
Put my shit on three wheels for thrills
I hit a corner and make sure my drink don't spill, that's real

[Chorus]
Rollin down the street, smokin indo
Sippin' on Gin and Juice
(Laid Back) With my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Now trip dis', I'm on Interstate 10 fuckin' with this Creole
She said she knows NINO, now stop me loc
Cup of that Gin and Juice, I blank a bitch out
Then turn the bitch out, look here
There ain't no need for you to be wastin' my time
See I picked you up, now I'm gunna stick you up, And dick you up!
Give you what you need, then bring you back down to reality
With that California weed, she seemed trouble at first
And then it got worse, cus now I got my hand up and down her mini-skirt
Twerkin' that shit while riddin' up the highway
Doin' it my way, hella highway, the fly way
Swervin' in another lane, tryin' to maintain
And baby girl steady takin' dick to the brain
Now it ain't no thing, cus she swallowed it up
Then she wanted to take a puff, I said "Look here bitch you've had
Enough"

[Chorus x2]
Somebody say, I wanna get fucked up
(Say What, Say What)
Come on, Now
Everybody say, I wanna get fucked up
(What Chew Say, What Chew Say) YAH
I'm hopped by the ice cream shop, The cops saw me, stopped me, heard me
Were's Serv-D, well serve me, since you got that big bad ass dangle
Nigga you know I'm know for havin' that big ass bank
Tryin' to find all your dope, cus your a smoker
I'll find that indo weed even when I'm on the East Coast
Cus times gettin' hard on the boulevard, but I refuse to loose ?!?!?!
Lil' Jimmy's sent me something, I need to cop something
Got Some (Got Some), I know you got some
Nigga stop frontin', get at your boy
Hook it up like Master P (Ughh)
Would it be a tragedy to fill me the best weed

[Chorus x2]
I see your lips quivering
But you ain't saying a motherfucking word
Now, what you need to do

Baby just take them panties off
Let me get inside that pussy slow
Give it to you with an understanding so you know
I love stroking with big daddy
I leave that pussy wetter than the ocean
I'm drinking, smoking with that potion bust that pussy open
I notice how she shiver I deliver her the dick
She get inside that thing
That's when she gag it
Fucking with the baddest bitch
With super ass and lips
With them birthday suit
See now what the birthday is?
Lead to orgasm the three and me
Lights on, lights off, fuck her in the dark
Never stop, stop, stop
A five hour in train
Bout time that I be finish that motor be on E tank

You ain't never fucked this way before
Cuz ain't nobody put that dick up in you nice and slow?
You ain't never fucked this way before

Yeah, man
You know it's easy to talk about doin' somethin'
But when it comes down to the action part
The most folks take a little light vacation
I was just thinkin' to myself, man
You know, this 'Blue Carpet Treatment' record is deep to me
And I need to let my peoples know how deep it is to me
On some real talk like
It's like lookin' and poppin' and seein' whoppers and movers
Despite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low
Nobody's guidance, so I decided to sleep by the do'
Open my mind, try to slip inside my grandpa's fo'
Driftin' off into another stage of life
*** paid you price and big homies made you fight
*** ain't wanna see ya *** bebop, no
Toe for toe, I beat a *** down to the flo'
Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past to move the mind
Many men were eradicated by music minds
Open your eyes and take ya time to visualize
And once you decide to move ya mind in due time
It's so erotic, even exotic, it's gettin' naughty
Freeze and groove your rowdy, rowdy, girl, move your body
It's melodic, I'm bein' honest and modest
You done *** off my whole rap flow, think about it
*** that ***, I'ma do it right
Thangs ain't movin' right, I don't think that you would like
For me to be mad, sayin', "*** can't stand me"
Sittin' at home, watchin' muh'f*** at the Grammy's
Wishin' I was there? Naw, *** I don't wish no more
I'm the big cat, fish in the bowl
Basically you hear these rappers out here usin' my flow
They need Snoop on they song to make they *** official though
Indismissible, police a ***, modern day KMI
Takin' my time, chronolizin' my rhyme
Writin' my rhyme, tryin' to get intellectual
Directin' the weather, makin' my negative records more intellectual
Tryin' to change the direction of flowin'
And sayin', born sayin', "You know I get liver when I get fluent"
Ain't been nobody to change game since King came
Same thing, same lane, biggie biggie bang
Word to Rob Bass, just make the music dope
Thangs don't change man, it's so remarkable
And they don't know how to do it 'cause they don't flow that way
Go that way, roll that ***
Roll my tape and take me back the day you were phony
You're so into what you doin' but you can't get into it
You can't talk and now ya ruined but you know I'ma do it
And now you doin' it, they booin' like, "You blew it, blew it"
I'm dippin' through the universe, make 'em move the verse
Through the Luda-verse, hit the b*** first
You can never beat a ***, lemme show you how to treat a ***
If you likin' me, follow me, you so believable
Got a way to get his own music out
Record executive, bounce ballin' and actin' bad
Take my time, great mind, break mind
Take 'em out, make mine, kicked about it
Thanks to *** who might make it illegal
And not rival the Beatles and rock rockin' my peoples
And fly, fly like eagles, been doin' this *** like liters
And hittin' y'all with h*** and walkin' in my Adidas
I continue to bust, then I switched up to Chucks
Givin' *** a puff, still givin' it up
Beanie Sigel, what up? Real *** is up
On the scheme with my team, yeah, Daz and Kurupt
Incredible, forgettable, better blast, past to move the mind
Many men were eradicated by music minds
Open your eyes and take ya time to visualize
And once you decide to move ya mind in due time
It's so erotic, even exotic, it's gettin' naughty
Freeze and groove your rowdy, rowdy, girl, move your body
It's melodic, I'm bein' honest and modest
You done *** off my whole rap flow, think about it
We bust 'til we buss 'em up
'Lay Low', I know they told you not to *** with us
Layin' and playin' and sayin', man, walkin' in vain
Anxious for fame, my *** tryin' to walk in my lane
And tryin' to walk in my shoes but they just don't fit
You couldn't spit the *** that I spit 'cause I'm the ***
And this is it, legit, let's split the chips
And fix and move the work and hurt that ***
I'm through with this

[Verse 1]
RMM, we so fresh
We well known when we out in the West
RMM, we so fly
We them niggas that your girl wanna try
RMM, we get cash
Put you in a video quick, so fast
RMM, that's that shit
'Cause me and Big P, you see, is all on a bitch
That's RMM, we so crazy
RMM, that's somethin' for the ladies
RMM, sign on the line
And if you ain't a dime, get the fuck up out of mine
That's RMM, blowin' like the Internet
Fuck with me, baby girl, shit, bitch, I've been a vet
RMM, give you what you're missin'
No tongue kissin', just some direction, attention
Head to the skeezigh, look at how we ease by
Shots of Patron for the fleezigh
RMM, back on the block
Take you out the neighbourhood and show you how we really rock
RMM, see we ain't playin'
The sales're on our face so you can see what we sayin'
RMM, draped to a T
Happy C Day to my nigga Big Percey
RMM, down with Tha Pound
In other words, nigga, we don't really fuck around
This is RMM, we so fly
We them niggas that your girl wanna try
RMM, somethin' for the ladies...

[Chorus]
Me and my homies tho
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday

[Nate Dogg]
But I'm alone in my room
And I don't have no one to talk to
I catch a girl with my phone
And cause some folks who know what I go through
After I smoke a joint, come on
To keep my temper low
I parlay with my friends
There's really no where else to go

[Chorus: x2]

[2 Pac]
I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried, then see us party
Keep it close to my heart
Cause we the ones that got the shit started
You recollect, we used to bust on snithces
Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self sufficient
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police taking our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die
For each other, cause we closer than brothers
Its like you came in, no forgetting the party popping
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, ducking bullets
Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me
But I ain't shit without my fucking homies
Me and my fucking homies

[Chorus]
(Me and my homies)
Constantly we mash
(Me and my homies)
Gotta make that cash
(Me and my homies)
There's no need to ask
(Me and my homies)
We are still the best

[Repeat: x8]
(thats my homeys)
Thats my homeys
DPGC homeys

[Chorus]
Leaving on a Mayday, fine summer pain
In his heart on his tounge, the taste is sweet again
Leaving on a Mayday, fine summer pain
But he said a feather, and his mind can take all, his feet are moving again

Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Let it rain, on me, let it rain

Morning comes, wakes him up, he looks out at the parking lot
Sees the house, he was born, almost 57 years ago
Where his brother lives, where his sister moved, and all three went to unfinished school
Where the father died, in '59, and mother did in 63'
He's reminded of her when he looks at me

Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Let it rain, on me, let it rain
That's how, that's how all things grow
That's how, that's how all things grow
I've been waiting for the noosy set, 20 years I've been waiting
For the last pages in a book I read, of love, death and endless need
About you, your sister your mother and me, even the happiest families bleed
I want to get even, making it last, get every bastard from the past

Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Let it rain, on me, let it rain
Oh let it rain, on me, that's how
That's how all things grow, that's how
That's how all things grow, that's how
That's how all things grow, that's how
That's how all things grow

Want to get even, making last, get every bastard from the past
Want to get even, making last, get every bastard from the past
Want to get even, making last, get every bastard from the past

Poppin' on collars tossin up dollars
A truck on the side of us but who wanna fuck with us
Bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna smoke with us
Doggy Doggfather
I do it to you real hard then it gets hot it's nada
Thang on mine bang on mine
I smoke an ounce and bounce at the same time
It's off the limbo with Timbo, you motherfuckin bimbo
So quit knockin at my window, you nympho
Maniac, bring it back, now shake it up
Put it on the table, now break it up
Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it
It really don't matter what you spent on it
As long as you're gettin what you paid for
That's what it's made for, ain't that what you stayed for?
-Chorus-
Who's that dippin' in the Cadillac?

You play me and I'll play you
You pay me and I'll pay you
Hold on boo, you got the game all wrong
This ain’t your thang, this my song
Move on, we in the club, at the Shark Bar
Valet my keys, and park my car
No snap shots, cuz I might get popped
As I slide by security, givin 'em props
First thing I do, when I get in
Let me take you back to when I first slid in
Grab my gin and, get my woman, put my bib in, no bullshittin
We be sippin, in the corner
With smoke comin' from up under us like we sittin in the sauna
Burnin' up the charts, break a bitch off hard
Little mama don't you start
-Chorus-
Who's that dippin' in the Cadillac?

Smoke till your eyes get cataracts

Tick tock, the ice on my watch

But the party don't stop till we blow up
Now every little nigga wanna show up
Manuev'in to this, groovin to this
Dippin to this, flippin to this, trippin to this
Ain't no skippin to this, trust this
Bust this, it's too hot to touch this
He say, she say, I say no way
Don't need foreplay, ok, obey
Everything that I say
And every day'll be like a holiday
I put you in the front seat of my car
And roll you round town like a superstar
Recline your seat and turn up the beat
Number one with a bullet, rollin down the mothafuckin backstreets
-Chorus-
Who's that dippin' in the Cadillac?

His buddy tried to peel back, but I had to kill that
Real niggas from the turf, shit I know y'all feel that
We won't talk, ain't no need for that (fuck that)
The word on Snoop is I'm a G for that
A 'G' for what? Fuckin niggas up with no talkin
See the best way to leave a nigga's off in a coffin
And now I'm back on the set and I'm walkin

[50 Cent]
Nigga now gotta let me break it down for you how it's gon' be
You don't wanna fuck with Snoop cause then you gotta fuck with me
G-Unit, DPG - go 'head
Start some shit, I got my strap with me
Watch how niggas get to duckin when I get to bustin
It's nothin, I'll touch him for talkin too much I'll cut him
Push my knife in then fuck him
Man, pussy niggas don't deserve to breathe
The strong survive, the bitches perish nigga you'll see

[Young Buck]
Ain't nothin like the smell of gun powder, the shells hittin the pavement
Even the paramedics couldn't save him
I gave him one to the chest, and sixteen to the face
Got knocked then call Cochran to get me off the case
We on deadly grounds, I done been to hell and back
I had to stand out in the rain just to sell my pack
Hangin outta the back of the black Cadillac window
Adrenaline pumpin, the infra-red on his temple

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg] + (Daz)
Doggy struck a match and the match went out
G-Unit is in the motherfuckin house (Motherfuckin house!)
You keep talkin shit I'll put my gun up in your mouth
My gun up in your mouth, I'll show you what I'm 'bout

[Lloyd Banks]
I'm straight outta Southside Jamaica nigga
I'm 'bout my paper nigga, your words won't make or break a nigga
I'll put yo' bitch on a track, make her break a nigga
Got rings like a Los Angeles Laker, nigga!
We smoke more than you can handle
So on my regular day I burn longer than a Rest In Peace candle
And my neck piece is a anchor
A G-Unit gorilla's equivalent to a Dogg Pound Gangsta

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg] + (Daz)
Doggy struck a match and the match went out
G-Unit is in the motherfuckin house (Motherfuckin house!)
You keep talkin shit I'll put my gun up in your mouth
My gun up in your mouth, I'll show you what I'm 'bout

[Chorus - Wiz Khalifa]
I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)

I'm rolling every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that fire, that good, that good, that

[Snoop Dogg]
Concentrated, every day I'm faded
Tree's prepared and properly cultivated
I nursed 'em, sprayed down, no chemicals
Just me and my buddy, ya hear me now

Never treat ya wrong, to each his own
Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong
We up in smoke, making street schemes
Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams
Break it down, put it in the zig zag
And pull the top back and let the ass drag
Hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch
Executive Branch, get a whiff of this

Black car, sack a dank
High school nigga what the fuck you think
I'm passing all my classes with flying colors
And every day I'm high as a muthafucker

[Chorus]
I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)

I'm rolling every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that fire, that good, that good, that

[Wiz Khalifa]
Sun roof open, smoking while I'm rolling
My bitches only notice it if it's potent
Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean
Get in between your legs
Join roaches and ashes all in your bed
You calling her babe, she calling me instead
Cause I put that game all in her hair
She saw the crib, she know that I'm balling
When he ain't have nothing he used to stall 'em
Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him
And my pockets on swole, I'm talking Rick Ross big

And now when we shop we don't care what the cost is
Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit
Blow a whole OZ, nigga that's boss shit
Now she all fuck her man, rubber bands in my pocket
Getting money, going hard for my profit
Bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings
Young nigga getting bread, why knock it?

[Chorus]
I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)

I'm rolling every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that fire, that good, that good, that
In high school, we do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
We welcome you to high school

We do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
Get high to it

[Chorus]
I'm smoking everywhere I go
(No stick, no seeds, just Al Green)
I always gotta keep one rolled
(I keep that, need that, got that)

I'm rolling every gram I own
(That purp, that bomb, that kush)
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that fire, that good, that good, that
Yes
Imma do me
Imma do me
You gon do you
You gon do you
Imma do me
Imma do me
You gon do you
You gon do you
Imma do me
Imma do me

I'm the most underrated rapper of all time
So why do you accept those that bite my rhymes
Me and eminem rhymed for d are e
Me and x was in da club bout to blast off heat
Quik told me to be all I can be
Nate is my dogg him and warren g
They recognize the ridah in the drivers seat
And even 50 cent said he'd ride with me
We sumthin like gangsta rap cousins
On my daughter imma die before I let you touch em
You know I like livin'
Enjoyin myself and I ain't bullshittin
You don't move me with fat mouth and lippin
And you don't want to see me out of retirement trippin
I got a lot to live for
And id be damned if I change one bit

I like the way I am
You understand

[Chorus]
Put your hands up come off them grams
I ain't trippin that's the way I am (the way I am)
And if you see me with heat in my hand
Then you better duck that's the way I am (the way I am)

I can't believe ya got up in them pants
Sexy lady gon do that dance
Come on over when ya sick of ya man
And we can chill that's the way I am (the way I am)

I don't know that girl I just met her
Sippin on sour amoretta
She gon do her thing a five letter
But imma bounce cause her friend looks better
I like the way she knows me
I like the way she got herself in v I p
If she sees k n o see
She gon chill
And wait out front for me
Who do you know that rides for the coast
With a new breed and style of rap like me
I had the patience to study the game
Dr Dre made two chronics and this is chronic three
I make classic hits and buy classic cars
And see classic tits at classic bars
Knoc steps in the spot and the girls all pause
Magic stick ill break down walls
Got my heat as shit jumps off
Really you stepping to me is a lost cause
Party animal here since a quarter to ten
Baby phase 16 with an LA brim
I got shell toes on I don't wear them tims
Got niggas got hoes in the gaggle of gin
Ain't no telling what I might get in
The first night
Do it right
Imma do it again
C'mon

[Chorus]
You know where we be
In da club
Come find me
I ain't trippin'
Air is free so what ever you want to do
For real though
Its just the way I am

[Chorus]
Everytime we touch
Emotions that I can't contain
Are sweeping over me again
Everytime we touch
Sensations I can not explain
Are washing all away my pain
Everytime we touch
A magic spring from deep inside
Comes into me like breathe of light
Everytime we touch
Something takes a hold of me
Everytime we touch

Everytime we touch
Heaven and Earth collide
Everything feels so right
Everytime we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes over me

Everytime we touch, yeah
Heaven and Earth collide
Everything feels so right
Everytime we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes over me
Everytime we touch
Oh yeah
Everytime you're near
And I feel so good inside

Everytime we touch
The secrets of my beating heart
Are breaking free out of the dark
Everytime we touch
All the things I can't express
Feel me with such happiness
Everytime we touch
All the changes that helped me father
Broke and crumbling to the ground
Everytime we touch
Something takes a hold of me
Everytime we touch

Everytime we touch
Heaven and Earth collide
Everything feels so right
Everytime we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes over me
Everytime we touch, yeah
Heaven and Earth collide
Everything feels so right
Everytime we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes over me
Everytime we touch
And it feels so good inside
And I feel it, so alive and
Everything that feels so right
And I feel it so alive
Everything that feels so right

[Intro]
Sticky kush, sticky kush
Tell me your name
Wheezy Beats

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Nigga have you ever dreamed?
I was the man and you a thing
One and two
Anytime I get mad, I can goodbye to you
God damn, who the hell let rats in the house?
King of lions, who let these cats run out of the house?
Houston, Texas when I'm on land, I lean back like a couch
I'm not playin', I want it bad, call shots like a spouse
We roll that kushy up, we eat that pussy though
Suck it til you're throwin' up, my Phantom grey, no hound
I lost a Lear, no bucks, still waitin' on that Bentley truck
Stop playin', lil' bitty boy, you a duck
He ain't YSL, nigga, he ain't in the hut
I might stop by and let that little bitch lush
I pull up and chop at your cousin, your bus
Little nigga, you know what it was
You know what it is, you know what it does
I'm makin' your old lady shake it
She suckin' too slow, I'm impatient
My diamonds so wet like a basin
Don't know where to go, I'm amazin'

[Chorus: Jacquees]
What's amazin'? I don't know
What's amazin'? I don't know
What's amazin'? I don't know
What's amazin'? (Amazing is a grateful thing)
I might accept your apology
I mean you throw L's up if you ain't followin'
I am a beast, your life I'll be swallowin'
And I've been drinkin', I need to bottle this

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Man I'm so tired of these niggas man
I am so tired of these bitches
I'm so magnificent, studio workin'
I'm wearin' a top like I'm pimpin'
Your bitch want my milk
I'm sittin' at the top lookin' down at these wimps
These hoes just roll me a blunt
And you know that they stuff it, it cannot be imps
I never had cutlass and donks
I based up my bankroll then based out my trunk
I might fuck that lil' bitch in the mornin'
I might put her out and call Tyrone
Snoop Dogg, I might go ahead and bone
I'm big ballin', bitch put me inside the dome
I'm wearin' Maison Margiela (The tight way)
I'm wearin' Maison Margiela (The right way)
I'm wearin' Maison Margiela (The scary sight way)
I'm wearin' Maison Margiela (The goodnight way)
Take some sand to the beach
Party with a couple foreign freaks
Kim K lookin' ho, Yeezy
Florida livin' nigga, Pork N Beans

[Interlude: Jacquees]
Yeah, and I'ma ride this bitch tonight
And I just might ride this bitch tonight
Pork N Beans where you at baby?
Pork N Beans where you at baby?

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Brown sugar on that bitch
Pull up with a ho and she know I'm ready to
Bust her, pay her, leave her, fuck her
I don't wait up, hold up, let me check my mail
He broke, he servin' his squad with a scale
I make it rain, I hope all is well
I pull off deep like what in the hell?
Ho give all my niggas some bails
Wait I'ma lay down 'fore I'll tell
Pull up in old school Chevelles
I don't save pictures, they might get revealed
How many times have I asked are you well?
How many times have I popped a perc pill?
How many homies at home on the bail?
How many times have I told you you shell?
How many meals have I ate until I burp?
Dropping the top on the Mulsanne ain't no hot top on merchs
Hey I worked so hard to get out that dirt
Hey I was thinking this is not that work

[Chorus]
Left ring 10 hundred cash
Neck piece 30 grand
Whip cost 300 grand
God damn I'm on a shopping spree
Bracelet 20 bags
Rims cost me 5 grand
House cost 500 cash
God damn I'm on a shopping spree

[Soulja Boy]
Lying in a whip that don't release until 2010
50 thousand dollars spent just to make my rims spin
Half a million dollars spent on the house I live in
Even more spent on the seat I sit my ass in
Soulja boy tell em a.k.a the assassin
Prises cuts in my watch like I threw sum glass in
Damn exclusive shit sent from china
If you looking for me I'm probably in yo girls vagina
I'm looking in the mirror tell me who's finer
Bought a Lamborghini didn't need to cosigner
Hey what I spit is just minor
Every cut served soulja boys headliner
Damn now tell me you don't feel this
Hey you can't say I'm just one hit
Hey are you bitch niggas serious
I'm quick on track like fast and the furious

[Chorus]
I'm on a shopping spree 

[Repeat: x6]

[Gucci Mane]

Chain worth a millie you sill wille a millie and 20
Uh man I pass out 50s an 20s

Chemist the doctors the lawyers ye money together couldn't getcha

[Chorus]

[Yo Gotti]

[Chorus]
I'm on a shopping spree 

[Repeat: x6]
Never thought I'd fall, but when I hear you call
I'm getting sentimental over you
Things you say and do just thrill me through and through
I'm getting sentimental over you
I thought I was happy I could live without love
Now I must admit, love is all I'm thinking of
Won't you please be kind, and just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet and gentle, be gentle with me
`Cause I'm getting sentimental over you
I know some niggas that'll merk ya for a quarter birdy
You bitch ass niggas just be lucky that the boy ain't hurtin'
I got the money to lag and I got that swagger workin'
I'm smokin' somethin' I can't pronounce behind them phantom curtains
What is you hollin' bitch, I'm on some gangsta shit
She wanna make me dinner, I tell her make me rich
You fuckin' with a winner but I come from a little
Hoe but bet I can take that dirt and turn that shit to glitter
I leave the work with her, yeah, she my baby sitter
And if I find out she stealin' for realer I'ma kill her
I'm just a money man so where the dollars at

[Incomprehensible] beat that until them flowers black
She wanna ride on this I make her ride with that
Her pistol in the ceilin' that's her survival pack

Getcha hustle up, the money's what you make of it
These niggas want it cooked and I done closed down the bakery
So stop stuntin' homie, false promotin'
It ain't about whatcha makin', it's about what ya totin'
Burn him up and leave him naked, bring him back to his wife
The bitch ain't even cry 'cause he was livin' that life
These niggas think I'm slippin' 'cause I'm fallin' back
Bitch I got money in the walls for that
Youngin' get it from the ground homie hold the hood down and
Don't make a sound if them people swing around this bitch

Y'all niggas ain't eatin' how we eatin' B
Fuck how we used to be, now we how we need to be
If they ain't with us they must be against us
We shoot 'em in the head 'cause they act like they senseless

We sharks over here nigga keep on fishin', okay
OK, money, money, money is my intuition
Money over bitches such an easy decision
Young money, money men monster militia
Hard body, these niggas boxes of tissue
That Nina will kiss ya, that chopper will twist ya

Hollywood, welcome to Hollywood
KW: All it takes is 2 hearts that care
MG: Sprinkle just a little tenderness there
KW: & like the tiny grains of sand that build a mountain so high
MG: Each tender moment builds love between a girl & guy
BOTH: It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
KW: Take a boy like you & a girl like me
MG: 2 lonely people we used to be
KW: We shared a little time, tears & laughter
MG: It seems that we will be happy ever after
KW: All it takes is 2 arms that know
MG: They gotta hold you, baby, & never let go
KW: Throw in a lover's quarrel & it's sealed with a kiss
MG: We know that heaven must be like this
BOTH: It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
KW: I used to wander, I used to roam
MG: Like a ship in a stormin' sea, tryin' to get home
KW: When we found each other, heaven found a way
MG: 'Cause you were the dawn of a bright sunny day
(instrumental)
KW: All it takes is just a little time
MG: 3 little words, baby, that mean "Will you will be mine?"
KW: Add a few tears 2 lovers will shed
MG: & every sweet word that's ever been said
BOTH: It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
KW: Take a girl like me & a boy like you
MG: Long lonely hours we once knew
KW: We have each other & live what life's worth
MG: All love is strong enough to move heaven & earth
(repeat & fade):
BOTH: It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
MG: I used to go my way all by myself, me, my shadow & I
Happy-go-lucky, nobody else but me, my shadow & I
One day out of the clear blue skies
I dared to look in your eyes
So tenderly, that's how love fell on me, yes indeed
KW: I used to laugh at all my friends
Gettin' ready for Valentines Day
Givin' candy & kisses & friendship rings
"Sweets for the sweet," they say
One day when the sun was warm
I couldn't help but take you in my arms
So tenderly, that's how love fell on me
MG: Listen, Kim: it didn't hit me like a ton of bricks
But I felt it just the same
KW: Marvin, love came creepin' right into my heart
When you whispered my name
So sweet & tender, I had to surrender
I knew I had really been hit
BOTH: So tenderly, that's how love fell on me
So tenderly, that's how love fell on me
MG: I couldn't help myself at all
KW: You know, you came along & I had to fall
(repeat & fade):
BOTH: So tenderly, that's how love fell on me
I'm just sitting counting all the cobwebs
And wondering just when you'll come along
You said that you'd be here an hour ago
But an hour ago is hours ago from then

No, and I don't know what to do
I'm drawing crazy patterns on my shoe
And the sand in the hour glass slips on by

Light another cigarette, watch the burning glow
Catching spiders in my hand, and then I let them go
Imagine pictures on the wall, watch the insects where they crawl
They don't care about you and I've nothing to do

Maybe the bus didn't get there on time
Maybe the train doesn't run on that line for some reason
And she might not come
Because she doesn't want to see you again
No no no, that can't be true
And I've got nothing to do
HER: One can have a dream, baby
HIM: Two can make that dream so real
HER: One can talk about bein' in love
HIM: Two can say how it really feels
HER: One can wish upon a star
HIM: Two can make that wish come true, yeah
HER: One can stand alone in the dark
HIM: Two can make the light shine through

It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you, just takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
To make a dream come true, just takes two

HER: One can have a broken heart, livin' in misery
HIM: Two can really ease the pain like a perfect remedy
HER: One can be alone in a car, on a night like these all alone
HIM: Two can make just any place seem just like bein' at home
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you, just takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
To make a dream come true, just takes two

Just takes two, just takes two

HER: One can go out to a movie, lookin' for a special treat
HIM: Two can make that single movie somethin' really kinda sweet
HER: One can take a walk in the moonlight, thinkin' that it's really nice
HIM: But two walkin' hand-in-hand is like addin' just a pinch of spice

It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you, just takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
To make a dream come true, just takes two
Are you gonna be?
Say that you're gonna bee

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross

(Well, well, well, well)

She said she wants some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton, will definitely set this party off right

Then you is my new chick
So we get our grind on
She be grabbin'
Callin' me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine, homes
Why she always lying though
Tellin' me them diamonds
When she know they rhinestones

She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready For the World, she was ready for some action
My dawg said, "You ain't no freak, so you 'bout to prove my man wrong."

I'mma play this Vandross
You gon' take your pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight
Me and you gon' get it right

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross

Got you lookin' at the gliss, at my hands and wrists
While I'm likely at smokin' on my canibus
When it come to rockin' original like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain' no messin' with Kan-man and Twist
From the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy
Twistin A-marie
Try'na Smoke a B
Lookin' properly
Feelin' on a G
And always (well, well, well, well)

Come with me and sip on some regular champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving, so I'm bumpin' a little Spinners

While I'm smokin' On a B
Dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got to leave
On the 23's
And I do it (well, well, well, well)

When my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let my get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze For Maze
Fulfilling our every sensation, slow jammin', having deep sex

You Ready For the World girl
Come on over, make me touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every moment you controllin' me, I'm lovin' the way you be
Holding me when I been listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last

No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, o to the club with me
And with some Luther Come On and Hope
You finna and stilla be in love with me

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, gonna Be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be
(Well, well, well, well)

She said she wants some Ready For the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, gonna Be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be

Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up on my Brougham

You gots ta roll with the plan

'Cause after that then I

Then I got to bone
Stay up in the zone
Got to get you home
Gotta run up on
And I do it (well, well, well, well)

Baby drop another slow jam

You gots ta roll with the plan

'Cause after that then I

And we could get it on
Whisper on the phone
Just to get you goin'
Try'na make you moan
And I do it (well, well, well, well)
BOTH:

HER:

What good is a wedding if no one says "I do"?
Tell me, baby what good am I without you?

BOTH:
Wo oh wo oh, wo oh wo oh

HIM: I'm no good without you, and there's one thing I know
HER: I just got to have you, darling, 'cause I love you so

[Outro: Dario G Instrumental]
You're a stranger to me
Then you give me your life
I toss it to one side
Still you're sweeter to me
When we lie on the shore

It's warm where you are
But my lips just don't burn
I feel so insecure
When you try to be kind
Could I ask for more

Looking at you now I know you only want to find me
Still I need a reason to leave the past behind me
Behind me
There ain't no easy way
To learn how to fly
I hope that I can kill
When I turn around you're there
Should I ask for more
I feel like sugar on the floor
I feel like sugar on the floor

[Intro - Casey Veggies]
The moment you've all been waiting for–

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Uh, say hello to the great one
Mixtapes for free homie, here take one
It might come in handy, a record deal was the best thing
Y'all can hand me, my squad, the new Grammy family
Uh, but they ain't feelin' it, oh well, more bars, I'm spillin' it
Every time I touch a mic they be like yo, your touch is tight
Y'all's focus (?) slow shots, bash so hard and slow
Just like a robot, you not hot man
I'm sorry for the truth, Customized Greatly, killin' shit
Casey feels sorry in the booth, uh
Flow's so sweet they put fillings in my tooth, yeah
Fillings in my teeth, they see Creator on the beat
Casey Veggies on the vocals got you niggas in a chokehold, uh oh
Yeah, yeah, he's at it again, spread the word tell your moms and your friend
Yeah, because I'm

[Hook]
Back for another one (Goddamn)
Back for another one (Yeah, because I'm)

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
The difference between me and them rappers
Is I wear clothes fresh out the wrapper
Undivided attention, the show's on
And no cancelled shit, it must go on
Nigga, volume, too, uh, turn up the volume, too
I'm crazy lyrically, come get at me seriously
Niggas know I kill 'em mentally and spiritually
I hope you're hearin' me, uh
First mixtape was hot, I hope you fear me
Believe that, y'all niggas didn't believe that he rap
And now y'all bob your heads to the things that he rap
Uh, y'all niggas didn't believe that he rap and
Now y'all bob your heads to the things that he rap
This nigga hated and she clap, no handshakes leave daps

[Hook]
Back for another one (Goddamn)
Back for another one (Yeah, because I'm)

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
Damn, back for another one with robots
I'm so hot, you're cold, now here's a fucking sweater
Look, I can't have no other fun
With my pops probably cause he out with his other son
But, I'm super steezy like my last beat
My bitch super greezy like her lunch be granola bars
I spill healthy verses, call 'em granola bars
Now every bitch wanna eat her Casey Veggies with no salt
Now it's so crazy, other people than my moms is callin' me baby
My nigga get ya hopes down, you couldn't persuade me
To collaborate with you niggas, ya lyrics is lazy
I'm undefeated, but the suede shoes is Puma
I'm the cancer and the tumor with the drums and the tubas blastin'
I'm a crook and it's a castle
If I am the shit, then I'm guessin' my mom's a asshole

[Hook]
Back for another one (Goddamn)
Back for another one (Yeah, because I'm)

[Verse 1]: Tyler, The Creator
My window is a book and I'm a fuckin' crook
Stealin' phones to call home but the line is off the hook
And if my mother answer, I'll ask her
What she wants on 25th because I'm chillin' with Prancer
Rudolph, Adolf, Hitler
Rollin' with nineteen 88's like it's 1988
But my speakers are bleedin', the doctor's in uniform
Fuck cars I have a damn unicorn
That flies me to places, with spaceships, that don't need money
Where I can free at hand, eat candy with Easter bunnies
Where donuts equal water, inhalers and mushrooms
And we don't have cars, we have balloons and we zoom through
Sound and the bass is astoundin'
The snare plays square no roundin'
Major ninth chords tower synth like it's Yao Ming
Kobe, imaginary friends, fuck homies (They don't know me)
The tooth fairy blow me, swallow don't shit this
With my Donald Trump hair piece you're an apprentice
You're fired and tired, you can't stay up like a limp dick
If you think you can spit then I am the fuckin' dentist
My visions that I record, the instruments I adore
The happiness that I hoard (can't be bought) at liquor stores
You faggots can buy chains but Utopia can't afford
And they sore on hatin' reality that I ignore
You can try to walk inside my brain but I close the door
Fuck dogs, I roll around with my pet dinosaur
Yeah, Hodgy Beats (Drop it)

[Verse 2]
Fuck dogs, walk around with a pet dinosaur
Wing flaps on the back of my pet rhinosaur
Gold chains, 24, niggas must be shinin' more
The money gets closer when you seem to be grindin' more
And it feels better than a tongue-kiss
Carbonated with the flow, orange-flavored Sunkist
We musically grow unto the world like a fungus
Amongst this, playin' the piano like a trumpet
Little guy, but his words sound so humongous
Eat 'til you obese, arteries clot, need lunges
MellowHype from Ralph Lauren to the Hundreds
My crew cliqued up like Brady Bunch is
The captain that crunches, invitin' you to lunches
My nutrition have robots malfunction
I suggest you stay away from the factory
My breath chemical, I don't know how you'll react to me
It's a dog-eat-dog world so I double doggy dare it
Hold it in my hand as I stare it
Down, like a magnifyin' glass to a diamond with a karat
I read through niggas that bluff like a tarot
They copy my actions, I call them fools parrots
I'm the pyro with one eyelid that weareth
Long hair for wisdom while bitch mades nair it
I don't care if the heat I throw is unbearable
Just know, it's shareable, and there I go, where I go
I don't know, obviously I disappear
Close your eyes bitch, I'm all in your ear
I have your hearts as if I stabbed it with a spear
And wrote my flows with your blood smears
If you can't see a legend, I'mma make it clear: nigga I'm right here

[Outro]
Golden grill, Cadillac Deville (Drop it) nigga we pimp
Grill golden, chain frozen, we pimp, we pimp, we pimp

[Intro]
What's your life like? 

[3X]
What's your (put you in place)

[Casey Veggies]
CV... just fine with this
Uhh, stay alive with this - yeah
They say I rap it like, I had an afterlife
And came back, while these lames speakin the same raps
I give the same daps, to the same homies
Cause I can tell most of these niggas phony
So I relax and rap for another one like I relapsed
I got the crowd up on him while you cats didn't even get 3 claps
So what my life like?
It's like two kites, but one of them is longer than the other
With one big sister and like one older brother
A narrow-minded father and a hard working mother
You can catch me writin raps and kickin rocks with my lover
And Rock is her name
And don't forget to eat cause she make you see things
I would, never believe in the things I achieve
But my brain leaves a stain on my heart
And I thrash hard from the start

[Chorus]
What's your
Life, life, life, life like 

[3X]

[Casey Veggies]
I'm just tryin to pass go
Arrogant asshole, what I need class fo'?
But I still attend it, cause that's what my mom recommended
Big boss lookin for an apprentice
Fresh as the sentence, best men I been this
You one on one, I'm on some {her and her friends shit}
She say girlfriend and I ain't lookin for her friendship
I told her I'm just a young nigga there miss
And don't talk, I get straight to the point like a toothpick
I'm too sick, throwin up, gang signs, throw 'em up
I'm hardheaded but at the same time, don't know enough
AWOL told me I'm blowin up
Shaun DT until I'm blowin up - so what the fuck is up?

[Chorus - 2X]

[Casey Veggies]
It's a long time comin now, thinkin 'bout the future
A BlackBerry messenger beach cruiser
Administrative user; usin his thoughts to make sure that
Booty is bond, man this food for your thoughts
So don't waste it, young Veggies hit the taste
You blind niggas get maced, chillin with my nigga Ace
That's Tyler, the Creator give a damn about a hater
This my city, I'm the Mayor, the world spins cause that paper
I'm the King like layers
So when you talkin money make sure you talk layers! Layers
Layers, so what's your life like?
Life, life, life, life like
Huh, please don't you rock my boat
'Cause I don't want my boat to be rockin' anyhow
Please don't you rock my boat, no
'Cause I don't want my boat to be rockin'

I'm tellin' you that, oh, ooh-aah, I like it a-like a-this
Can you miss?
And you should know, ooh-aah, when I like it a-like a-this
Am I really it? Ooh yeah
You satis- satis- satisfy my soul, morning time
Evening cold, -fy my soul

And I said, oh, ooh-aah, I like it a-like a-this

If ever I treated you bad, make it up to me one time
'Cause I'm happy inside all the time
I want you beside me, yeah, to be mine
One thing you've got to do, is when a-we holding hands together
You've got to know that we love, a-love each other, yeah
And if every time you should walk away from me now
Uh, you'll now I need your sympathy, yeah

Can you see? Do you believe me?
Oh, darlin', darlin', I'm callin', callin'
Satisfy my soul, satisfy my soul

Rockin' on the same route

To have you all, my dreamland
Would be like heaven to me
To have you all, my dreamland
Would be like heaven to me

We'll get our breakfast from the tree
We'll get our honey from the bees
We'll take a ride on the waterfalls
And all the glories, we'll have them all

And we'll live together on that dreamland
And have so much fun
We'll live together on that dreamland
And have so much fun

Oh, what a time that will be
Oh, just you, wait, wait, wait and see
We'll count the stars up in the sky
And surely we'll never die
And surely we'll never die, oh no
And surely we'll never die
Thank you, Lord, for what you've done for me
Thank you, Lord, for what you're doing now
Thank you, Lord, for ev'ry little thing
Thank you, Lord, for you made me sing

Say I'm in no competition
But I made my decision
You can keep your opinion
I'm just calling on the wise man's communion

Thank you, Lord, for what you've done for me
Thank you, Lord, for what you're doing now
Thank you, Lord, for ev'ry little thing
Thank you, Lord, for you made me sing

Sing along, sing along

I don't fear their humiliation
Just to prove my determination
I don't yield to temptation
I haven't learn't my lesson in Revelation
Thank you, Lord, for what you've done for me
Thank you, Lord, for what you're doing now
Thank you, Lord, for ev'ry little thing
Thank you, Lord, for you made me sing

Sing along, sing along

Say I'm in no competition
But I made my decision
Lord, in my simple way
Comin', comin', comin', comin'
I love to pray

Thank you, Lord, for what you've done for me
Thank you, Lord, for what you're doing now
Thank you, Lord, for ev'ry little thing

Money is good, but it can be evil

And them lames still tryin to get the number of phone
All up in MySpace tryin to get in my space

Same asthma, different flare; same inhaler, different air
Same truth, a different dare, same club it's billionaire

So much to share, we just don't care
Ain't goin nowhere, we right here
Got a knife for spare, don't want to share

[Tyler, the Creator]
I got a couple bucks, what the fuck should I buy for lunch?
Donuts? 'Preme beetle? I'm Billie Holiday's needle
Shoot that shit, your armor's great
That rock's bitch, you got a date
It starts at 8, a one night stand
Your dinner's here (cut the steak)
Remember Sh'quanda? Team, we mob deep
Couple (Odd) niggas just trollin down your street
Hell hath no fury when me and the devil meet
Does he remember me? (Does he remember me?)

[Chorus 1 + Chorus 2]

[Casey Veggies]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, I said
Hold on, press flash, had dreams to get cash
That shoebox is my, stash, my first thought never comes, last
So when you see me, make sure that you wear your 3D's
This the CD; who you? Beats me
Homey you can't beat me, I'm gone you can't see me
(You can not see us) I'm gone you can't see me
I said, I'm gone you can't see me
When I pull up homey, I'm gon' fly off in that G3

[Outro]
Yeah; yeah man
See we the same, niggzs you knew
The only difference is
Got a little more money in our pockets
Couple more friend requests
Couple handshakes.. nothin major but
We got smiles on our faces.. remember me?
(Remember me? Remember me? Remember me?)

[Verse 1: Hodgy]
Save all your letters and drop your tomatoes
Hodgy Beats, where he? Looking for a large payroll
Not dimes, nickels, pennies, pesos
I'm tryna stack chips nigga, peelin' my potatoes
If I'm not the biggest boss that you've see thus far
Take a look at the exquisite luxury cars
Big ponts being stuck into a Cuban cigar
Promethazine on the leaf only to get bizarre
We don't go to the club nigga, we post at the bar
Have conversation with girls that don't know who we are
With diamonds in our ears, looking like cube stars
I live a Matrix life and we cruise hard

[Hook: Casey]
And I swear I'm a fiend, dope fiend, I'm an addict
Crack music going hard, Odd Future got a bag it
Yeah, make it stretch like bubble gum
Eh, all the little females like yummy yum

[Verse 2: Tyler]
Now ugly girls get out, the light skinned girls about
Without a doubt you niggas don't amount to shit, no need to count
Now bring the ruler out like Rick the Ruler paid in full
I'm cooler than your cooler, got these hoes, now where's my garden tool
Fuck 'em all, all them fuck with the Future
I back with Thrash Hard backyard beach cruiser, look
You niggas can't contain the thoughts that's flowin' in my brain
It synthesizes skits oh neutron from steering paper plane
And the white girls love me and the haters shove me
And push me until I beat the pussy up like it was ugly
And that's without the loot, niggas take the time to tune
The diamond dolla's, bitch I'm complex like Einstein's Rubix Cube
Look, I'm the truth, now stop daring me
Niggas kill yourself and decide to go back to therapy
And my right is right, my right is left, my left is wrong
Now bitches throw your fucking bras off while I'll be writin' my songs

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Gimme a couple commas while I abreviate
The war between the pen and paper I aleviate
Alexander is Hodgy, cause I can be the Great
As long as I have a hundred mill' in the cheese steak
In a big breifcase like I won a sweepstakes
Odd Future got money out the ass for G's sakes
I feel like I can fly without wings on my back
This is crack with me, but this crack ain't whack
I got niggas hooked, yeah, the stadium packed
And I flip that like a gymnasium mat
His grind time, and I'm making it stretch
Why get less for more when you can get more for less
Pure for less, down, five three 18 thousand impression
If you comprehend what I recommend press send
If you comprehend what I recommend, Odd Future

[Hook]
What am I to do, my dear

Ooh, old Mr. Joe he build a house, yeah
On top of some hill
Old Mr. Joe knew he had to go, so
He got right down and wrote a will

He say now here is to mother hen and her chicken
Lord have mercy now
Master will you take a roll in the mud
Like he know he should

The old barnyard, the old barnyard, birds and the chick
Ooh-ee, who's got to watch out for brother mongoose
With his top hap and walking stick
It's just the poor's brainwashing

They told me a long time gone
It's just the poor's brain washing
The old brain washing

Now look at a thing like this
Cinderella and her long lost fellow, in the midnight hour
She lost her silver slipper
Humpty dumpty sat on a wall, while Jack and Jill
Had themselves a fall
It's just the poor brain washing and I don't need it no longer

It's just the poor's brain washing
Coming through to a poor man's child
Ooh, look at this

Little Miss Muffet she sat on her tuffet
While Little Red Ridinghood delivered her grandma's food
Ooh-ee, ooh-ee, ooh-ee

Look at one more thing like this
The cow jumping over the moon, while the dish got jealous
He grabbed the hand of the spoon

It's just the poor brain washing and I don't need it no longer
I don't want it no longer
I don't need it no longer

And I don't care for no more brain washing
It isn't good for my soul
Craven a go choke puppy
Craven a go choke puppy not

Grafting after something else

They'll take it for themselves alone

The old time people say, want it, want it can't get it

I don't know just what to do
To see if you could love me too

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love
Why must I be a teenager in love

[Chorus]
The lord made Adam and Eve to live a happy life
In the garden of Eden, but they disobeyed
I wanna know why they sin in the Garden of Eden
It's a devilman's affair in the shape of a serpent

[Verse]
And they broke the fruit of life
And everyone of us is living in sin
Any anywhere you go
Woman is the root of all evil
Eve was the first one to break a fruit
And everyone of us is living in sin

[Chorus]
The lord made Adam and Eve to live a happy life
In the garden of Eden but they disobeyed
I wanna know why they sin in the garden of Eden
It's a devilman's affair in the shape of a serpent

[Verse]
And they broke the fruit of life
And everyone of us is living in sin
Any anywhere you go
Woman is the root of all evil
Eve was the first one to break a fruit
And everyone of us is living in sin

[Verse1]
Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
From a stray bullet
Woman hold her head and cry
Explaining to her was a passerby
Who saw the woman cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Wondering how can she work it out
Now she knows that the wages of sin is death
The gift of Jah is life
She cried

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, all-la I know
Johnny was a good man
Ah-la I know
Johnny was a good, good, good, good man
She cried, She cried

[Verse 2]
Woman hold her head and cry
As her son had been shot down in the street and died
Just because of the system
Woman hold her head and cry
Comforting her I was passing by
She complained, then she cried

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, oh, ah
Yeah, I know now
(Johnny was a good man)
Said I know
(Never did a thing wrong)
Ah ah
(Johnny was a good man)
Can a woman tender care?
She cried
(Never did a thing wrong)
Cease towards the child she bear
(Johnny was a good man)
Oh, woman cried
Woman, she cried, oh, she cried, yeah
Can a woman tender care
Cease towards the child she bears
Woman cry

[Verse 1]
Don't you look at me so smug
And say I'm going bad
Who are you to judge me
And the life that I live?

[Verse 2]
I know that I'm not perfect
And that I don't claim to be
So, before you point your fingers
Be sure your hands are clean

[Chorus]
Judge not
Before you judge yourself
Judge not
If you're not ready for judgement (Woah, oh-oh)

[Verse 3]
The road of life is rocky
And you may stumble too
So, while you talk about me
Someone else is judging you

[Chorus]
Judge not
Before you judge yourself
Judge not
If you're not ready for judgement (Woah, oh-oh)

[Verse 4]
The road of life is rocky
And you may stumble too
So, while you talk about me
Someone else is judging you

[Outro]
Someone else is judging you
Someone else is judging you
Someone else is judging you
Why.. why.. why.. why..

Feeling so high

Feeling so high

So come and turn me loose
Ain't got no time to lose
Chasing a wild goose
Feeling groovy
Let's make our home movie
I'll be the picture
You can be the show
From the screen our love will glow
You got your love, I got mine
Put them together and they'll work fine
Ease this pain of mine
Ease this pain of mine
Ease this pain of mine
And turn me loose

And on the screen our love will glow
You got your love, I got mine
Put them together and they'll work fine
Turn me loose, ain't got no time
Chasing a wild goose
Feeling so high, I wanna touch your sky...
Until the philosophy which hold one race superior
And another
Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited
And abandoned
Everywhere is war
Me say war
That until there no longer
First class and second class citizens of any nation
Until the colour of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes
Me say war
That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Dis a war
That until that day
The dream of lasting peace
World citizenship
Rule of international morality
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued
But never attained
Now everywhere is war - war
And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes
That hold our brothers in Angola
In Mozambique
South Africa
Sub-human bondage
Have been toppled
Utterly destroyed
Well, everywhere is war
Me say war
War in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south
War - war
Rumours of war
And until that day
The African continent
Will not know peace
We Africans will fight
We find it necessary
And we know we shall win
As we are confident
In the victory
Of good over evil
Good over evil, yeah!
Good over evil
Good over evil, yeah!
Good over evil
Good over evil, yeah!
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
Of the same philosophy
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
And, the people, they still can't see

Why do they fight against
The youth of today?
And without youths
You'd be gone, all gone astray

Come on, let's make a move
(Make a move, make a move)
Now that the time, the time has come
Fools don't see
(Fools don't see, fools don't see)
But I know, the weak is strong

So, come with me
To a land of liberty
Where we can live
Live our lives and be free
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
Of the same, the same philosophy
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
And my people, still cannot see

Come with me, you black and you brown
You got to be free
Stop sittin' down on your pride
Just can't hide


400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
Same, same philosophy
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)
Why do Black people close their eyes?
Come to reality
(400 years, 400 years)
You've got ability
Just can't see
400 years
(400 years, 400 years)

Why should I bend down my head and cry?
Why should I bend down my head and cry?

The old world has ended (who's got the whole world now)
The new world has just begun
And all them people that live therein (still in the new world now)
Shall live on and on
One more thing:

Got to get what I need
Got to get what I want
Got to get what I need
Got to get what I want

Got to get satisfaction
Got to get the action
Got love and affection
One more thing:

Once there was two roads before us (who's got the whole world now)
To pick our choice
But good has overcome bad
The sheep has heard their master's voice
So tell me why:
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
No reason why
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
Got to move, got to groove

Got to get what I want, what did you say?
Got to get it
Got to get what I need
Got to get what I want
Like I say, got to get it
Got to get what I need...satisfaction

The old world has ended (who's got the whole world now)
The new world has just begun
And all them people that live therein (still in the new world now)
Shall live on and on
One more thing:

Why should I bend down my head and cry?
My father is a king
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
All the riches in the earth
So tell me why
Why should I bend down my head and cry?

Now you can swallow that or you can suck a dick
Okay, tell me shit, Lil Wayne fuck a bitch
Lil' nigga, big money, big gun full of that shit

Nigga I'm a young king, nigga I'm a Bun B

The rest goes without me having to say
I say, go, go, go, go (DJ)

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
Holla at me, what it do, what it is
You ain't never seen a playa like this (Holla at me baby)

You can see me from a far I'm the shit
Scream at me what it do, what it is (What It Do)

[Paul Wall]
It's Paul Wall baby, Swishahouse club rocker
Chunk a deuce, sip a deuece, pourin up big goose vodka
Lone star beast straight up out the H
Sure stoppin all the hate, sippin on the ski taste
I got the I-N-S on my tail, immigration still harass
Cause they see me in a foriegn ridin on a pointed glass
Gettin cash is my number one task
Until I'm under the grass, that's why I'm top of the class
I'm a grit boy lookin for an ass like Ketoya
Leave a bitch back all nutty like Almond Joy
My boy Toy I E got to sleep
And we got to see and who got the freaks?
Beat it up like an ass whipping
The album dropped and there's been a lot of ass kissing
But I ain't trippin, I'm trill
That's why I'm posted with Khaled cause he real one
A hundred baby like a bill, Holla at me baby

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe]
Nah homie, you done got it fucked up
You ain't got as much money as us (Nope)
We sent Campbell in cause he got goggles on
And he's pushing something far and it's fucked
Now all I gotta do is push a little button quick fast
And the chopper come out of the stash
Yeah money ain't jewels motherfucker you lose
I'll make you do the Fuck Sean Comb dance (Follow me now)
Who wanna come test the kid
Have your baby mama bless the team
Shit, I ain't even know she could twerk it like that
She a motherfuckin sex machine, Holla at me baby

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Stuntin in a magnum ridin with my hat low
Forty-five magnum, barrel full of air holes
Dade County, represent, Dopeboy ever since
Know that I'ma veteran, Million dollar president
Rick Ross, big chips, AK's, flip clips
Off set rims on a rear six inch lips
Started on the benches, rose through the trenches
Now I'm the shit bitch, go and check your senses
Known for the benz's, Chrome on the bentleys
Smokin on the mentleys, Dade county, big cheese
Flip soft, whip that, Rick Ross rip that
Khaled go hard dawg, talk to 'em Paul Wall

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
Aiyyo

Mr. Snort yay, spit rocks, made in day

Last name Campbell, first name Luther
The gun shine stayed, well that suit ya
Bought him the crib, what it do, what it is
Bust a clip, flip a brick, hey buddy where's the lick?
That's all we talk about, well welcome to the south
We in, get our bread then we out, no doubt
Palas and Caprices
These boys dirty, they'll fuck your mother, sister, daughter and nieces
Ahora loca mueva la cadera, abre la boca aye viene la madera

[Chorus]
Yea, quit bullshittin and hit him man
Hit the shit man

I'm sayin to her, "come over to the car" and she said...
"You some kind of star", I'm like "naw naw naw, chill chill"
K'naw sayin, that's that name, figured I'd put a little bit of this game all in her brain, told her i ain't gone hold you
Damn sure ain't tryna control you, but I'll mold you
Ya dug?
She looked at me like she ain't believe me, so i figure I show you

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, said she never felt like this before
When I'm home we get it on. I'm on the road, she miss the ball
And you thick for sure, know how to work them hips right
Level with my swisher says, I show her how to twist right
And when I gotta make moves, she keeps her lips tight
Know that money gotta stack, so she let me get right
And that sex get good on the late night
Nothin but thumbs up like a hitch hike
Yes I'm the shit like you ain't never heard of
And you know how I do, act like you don't but now i learn ya
I'm talking about teaching ya, how about schoolin ya
Go and do your thang, gimme brains, I'll tutor ya
Fuckin' wit them lames, a real nigga's somethin new to ya
Now you tellin all your friends what I do to ya
But it's cool, ya know? I leave her spine broke
When I'm up inside, make her breath and hit a high note
Like...

[Interlude: Kev da Hustla]
Yeah
So I'm standin on the corner
Shorty ride through
She pushed the whip, like ya know?
Me and my nigga Wiz
Blowing on that good, I'm like...
"We gotta stop shawty"
See... jump out
Yeah

[Verse 2: Kev da Hustla]
And now I approached her, like "what's your name?"
You get the picture shawty, I really like your frame
That Coke bottle shape and them Asian eyes
You half black, half you ain't gotta tell the guy
You shouldn't wonder why I approached ya
I wanna get to know ya but i ain't tryin to hold you
Back from all your dreams and high hopes
You smell that mami, yeah that's real smoke
Listen i got plans too, you know how your man do
I'll get ghost before I try to cuff hands boo
You in the latest, yeah, that's my favorite
Room lit like Vegas, he point like painting
Mami body amazing, lights off, no cable
I found out she a mind freak like Criss Angel
Bed, broken tables, giving her all she handles
I swear to God, the room sounded like this damn sample

[Interlude: Wiz Khalifa]
Yes, so I seen my man Kev Tha Hustla over there on somethin' bad
I mean bad
So I mean, I finish rollin' up my ray
Hop out the car, I see a couple of little ones over there lookin' kind of lonely
Ya dug?
I'm sayin' I catch me one, she looking at me
I see her smilin' and all that
Like she know who a nigga is
So you know what i do, I walk straight up to her like...

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Ay ay, shawty I just wanna talk to ya
Usually keep it moving but I had to stop for ya
And let you know anything less than me is not for ya
No time to waste but got patience like a doctor do
And this may be a lot for you
So why don't you fall in, hit some of this weed and soak it all in
Got game like the ball in
And we ballin, goin state to state call me Rawlings
Look darling, I ain't tryna start nothing
She laughed and said "ain't you some kinda star or somethin?"
I'm like nah, I'm playin with you, ma, I'm frontin
They call me young Wiz, now get up in my car or somethin
We could talk about your day while I'm cigar stuffin
Here's my phone, give me a number that I can call or something
Get you back to your crib and have them walls jumpin
Screamin' at the top of your lungs like...

Ain't nothing like it (word up)
Yo, remember last year
I think we was on tour last year
I ain't tryin' to be (word up) in the city
That's what I want
Christmas in the city

Christmas jams at the tunnel
Chop through hustle and bustle
Snow and lights make wonderland
Out of this concrete jungle

There's a miracle on 34th Street
On a train, yeah, that lady
With all them bags, you see

Radio City for the Christmas show
We making Angels in the snow
Giving honey lots of kisses under Mistletoe
Snowball fights at courtyards
See Spanish Harlem sing Feliz Navidad
New York state of mind
At Christmas time
In the city

All the children showing
Their new clothes and toys and things
That they got for Christmas, this year
Their full of happiness and cheer

On Christmas in the city
I'm so glad I'm living
To see another Christmas Day
Got to show the Lord I appreciate
His blessings on this special day
It's Christmas in the city (hey)

CHORUS:
Christmas in the city
(Christmas in the city)
Ain't no place I'd rather be (yeah, oh)
Out of all the places I could be
I'd rather be
(I'd rather be)
In New York, chilly
Rockefeller Center
Has the biggest Christmas tree of all
You can go downtown and see it all
I guarantee you'll have a ball
On Christmas in the city

Something about this atmosphere
Makes me want to stay right here
I can see the city lights
Watch the cab drivers fuss and fight, on Broadway
And it's Christmas, Christmas, yeah

CHORUS

CHORUS

I want to be chilly
La, la, la ,la ,la
La, la, la, la, la
Out of all the places I could be
I'd rather be home, chilly

I want a new duck
One that won't try to bite
One that won't chew a hole in my socks
One that won't quack all night

I want a new duck
One with big webbed feet
One that knows how to wash my car
And keep his room real neat

One that won't raid the ice box
One that'll stay in shape
One that's never gonna try to migrate or escape
Or I'll tie him up with duct tape

I want a new duck
A mallard I think
One that won't make a mess of my house
Or build a nest in the bathroom sink

I want a new duck
One that won't steal a beer
One that won't stick his bill in my mail
One that knows the duck stops here
One that won't drive me crazy waddling all around
One who'll teach me how to swim and help me not to drown
And show me how to get down
How to get down baby

Get it?
Quack quack quack quack
Quack quack quack quack

I want a new duck
Not a swan or a goose
Just a drake I can dress real cute
Think I'm gonna name him Bruce

I want a new duck
Not a quail or an owl
One that won't molt too much
One that won't smell too foul

One that won't beg for breadcrumbs
Hangin' around all day
He'd better mind his manners
Better do just what I say
Or he's gonna be duck pate, duck pate, yah, yah

Quack quack quack quack
Quack quack quack quack
(lots of quacking sounds)
Here's Johnny

There he goes, he drives me crazy
When he says...(Hee-eere's Johnny!)
That's his job, it's so amazing
All he says is...(Hee-eere's Johnny!)
I never miss a moment when he's on the tube
His being there has made my life worth living
The chills run down my spine
Each time he says that line

"Here's Johnny!" He says, and laughs in his special way
"...Johnny!" he says, you know I love him
"Here's Johnny!" he says, and "second fiddle" is his game
Ed McMahon's his name...all right

Dressed so fine, he's such a cool dude
Hear him say...(Hee-eere's Johnny!)
Watch him selling beer and dog food
Hear him say...(Hee-eere's Johnny!)
I got a letter from him just the other day
He said, "You may already be a winner!"
A trouper to the end
A Clydesdale's best friend
"Here's Johnny!" he says, and laughs in his special way
"...Johnny!" he says, you know I love him
"Here's Johnny!" he says, and that's the way he gets his pay
What a living

Oh...(Here's Johnny! Here's Johnny!) Wo-o-o, no
(Here's Johnny! Here's Johnny!) No no no no no no, I don't believe it
(Here's Johnny!) he says, and everytime it's just the same
Ed McMahon's his name

A very special guy...all right
He's on every night
Can't change the channel
When he's sitting on the panel
(Hee-eere's Johnny!)
There he goes, he gives me goose bumps
When he says...(Hey-O-Hey-Hey-O!)

"Here's Johnny!" he says, and laughs in his special way
"...Johnny!" he says, you know I love him
"Here's Johnny!" he says, that seems to be his claim to fame
Ed McMahon's his name
You know my baby likes burping
You know my baby's kinda nauseating

[burps]

My little vulgar one is so gross
'cause when I hold her in my arms so close she goes

[burps]
And out in public it's embarrassing
She'll burp at anyone or anything
She's so revolting and disgusting
And repulsive to me, yeah

My little lady's so obnoxious
Today she walked onto a Greyhound bus goin'

[burps]

And then a couple hours later
My baby's in a crowded elevator

[burps]

That little filthy pig is so obscene
I'm really glad she doesn't like beans
She's so revolting and disgusting
And repulsive to me, yeah

Oh, I wonder what's her trip
Oh, she'd better can it quick
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick

If baby does it anymore
I think I'll just pretend like I don't know her

[burps]

You know my baby likes burping
You know my baby is really sickening

[burps]

That's enough, that's it

[record scratch]
I used to think my life was so empty
I used to think life was passin' me by
Well, I was just about ready
To curl up and die
But then one day I got a visit
From the cable company

[Verse 1]
It took a lifetime, but I finally found
The perfect waffle recipe
You'll never find a batter any better in this whole stinkin' town
One little bite and I'm sure that you'll agree

Your eyes roll back and your knees get weak
Aw, you're gonna lick your plate clean
People come from miles around just to study my technique
I make the best darn waffles this world has ever seen

[Chorus]
I'm the Waffle King (Waffle King)... Yeah
Waffle King (Waffle King)
That's what they call me!
Waffle King (Waffle King)
Hey, I'm the Waffle King

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go now, the people cheer
I never have to wait in line
People say, "Right this way, sir, your money's no good here."
Some day I betcha they'll build me a shrine
And everybody say, "Well, I'm your biggest fan!"
"I seen your picture in People Magazine!"
Folks come from around the world just to shake my hand
If you don't believe in the power of the waffle, lemme show you just what I mean

[Chorus]
I'm the Waffle King (Waffle King)
Make you wanna scream and shout
Waffle King (Waffle King)
That's my name, don't wear it out
Waffle King (Waffle King)
Make no mistake about it
I'm the Waffle King... Yeah

[Bridge]
Roll out the red carpet, cause here I come
All you peons better scram
Out of my way now, you worthless piece of scum
Don't you know who I am?
Hey!

[Verse 3]
I wanna see you grovel, you waffle-eatin' fools
Everybody, on your knees
You wanna buy a waffle, you're playin' by my rules
Go on, beg me... Lemme hear you say "pretty please"
Can't you tell the universe revolves around me?
Don't you know you suckers owe me everything?
And can't you see, that I'm the highest form of life that there could ever be?
Everybody all around the world, stand up and sing
Come on now

[Chorus]
Waffle King
Hey, batter-batter
Waffle King
Hot on your platter
Waffle King
Say, what's the matter
Don't you know who I am?
Don't you know who I am?
Tell 'em, girls!

(He's the Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waffle King)
Yeah, yeah
(He's the Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waffle King)
Tell the truth now
(He's the Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waffle King)
Don't you know who I am?
Don't you know who I am?

I'm the Waffle King (Waffle King)
Step aside, I'm coming through
Waffle King (Waffle King)
Hey! What's the matter with you?
Listen, pal, (Waffle King) you can kiss my royal butt!
Don't you know who I am?
You've got to be kidding me!
Well I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?

Well it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled King composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

Now she tied you to a kitchen chair;
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew "Hallelujah."
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you

And it's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah...

Hallelujah...
It's true that I used to be crazy
And harder to love than most men
And the blood that ran in these tired hands
Was harder and wilder back then
And I don't feel as tall as I used to
Maybe it's just that I've grown
You're the one that held my hand when I fell
If I just couldn't make it alone

We've lived out all the stories
Sang all the old songs
It takes one to know me
I guess you're the one

Your daughters are ladies of fortune
And your son an heir to the throne
And though this crown that I hold is
Tarnished and cold
It's a symbol of all that we own
Sometimes I wish I was younger
And could pick up the pieces and run
But then I look back on the matter of fact
And it's a race that we've already won
We've lived out all the stories
Sang all the old songs
It takes one to know me
I guess you're the one

We've lived out all the stories
Sang all the old songs
It takes one to know me
And you knew the one
Go jack-rabbit running through the wood
You had a good night and you feel real loose
Heard they got you going round the goosecreek shed
Trying to fill your belly full of buckshot lead

Go jack-rabbit get the cabbage patch
Farmer left the back porch door on the latch
Heard you coming and he got his gun
Better go jack-rabbit better start to run

Go jack-rabbit running through the wood
You had a good night and you feel real loose
Gunfire breaking up the peaceful night
Jack-rabbit lying in the cold daylight
Maybe I don't want to know the reason why
But lately you don't talk to me
Darling, I can't see me in your eyes

I hold you near, but you're so far away
And it's losing you I can't believe
To watch you leave and let this feeling die

You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow, if I'm here without your love
You know I can't survive
Only my love can raise you high above it all

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

We can take the darkness, make if full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die?
This happy room would be a lonely place when you are gone
And I won't even have your shoulder for the crying on
No other woman's love could be as true , I'm begging you

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

We changed the world, we made it ours to hold
But dreams are made for those who really try
This losing you is real, but I still feel you here inside

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

(repeat last verse at least twice more and fade out)
I found my thrill
On Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill
When I found you
The moon stood still
On Blueberry Hill
And lingered until
My dreams came true

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be

Though we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill
On Blueberry Hill

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
Though we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill
On Blueberry Hill
(Choir:)
Respice, quaesumus, domine
Famulam tuam evita
In infirmitate
Et animam refove, quam creasti
Ut castigationibus emendata
Se tua sentiat medicina salvatam
Per christum, dominuum
Qui vivit et regnat
Per omnia saecula saeculorum
Amen
(Translation:
Look with favor, we beseech thee, oh lord
Upon thy handmaid evita
In her weakness
And refresh the soul which thou hast created

That being corrected by thy chastisement
She may find herself cured by thy healing
Through christ, our lord
Who lives and reigns
Forever and ever
Amen )
(Che:)
She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the casa rosada crying, eva peron
But that's all gone now
Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
Giving all your love to just one man
Oh, you have bad times, and you have good times
Doing things that you don't understand

Hey, but if you love him, you'll forgive him
Even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him, be proud of him
'Cause after all, he's just a man

Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And someone warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely

Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can
You know it, it is only true
That you could be the best of you
How I wonder miles away
Tying horshoes by the bay

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Many say and lucky do
My own fire once said it too
Leave the ocean live and play
Door on sockets yesterday

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Is it fair or nestled sorrow
You could be there tomorrow

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso
Whooo ...

Whooo ...

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso
If you love me
You will give your heart
Why should be apart
If you love me

If you love me
You will know the truth
I wasn't born to lose
And I love you

Affinity and communication
That makes reality
Understanding is the first thing
It means so much to me

If I love you
I will find the key
If it's meant to be
'Cause I love you

Affinity and communication
That makes reality
Understanding is the first thing
It means so much to me
If I love you
I will find the key
If it's meant to be
'Cause I love you

[Verse 1]
I've tried so hard, my dear, to show
That you're my every dream
And yet you're afraid each thing I do
Is just some evil scheme

[Chorus]
A memory from your lonesome past
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind
And melt your cold heart?

[Verse 2]
Another love before my time
Made your heart sad and blue
So my heart, my heart is paying now
For all of the things I didn't do

[Outro]
In anger, unkind words are said
And these are, these are the things that make the teardrops start
Why, oh why can't I free your doubtful mind?
Ooh honey, I'd really like to melt your cold, cold heart
Why, oh why can't I free your doubtful mind?
And I'd really, really like to melt your icy heart, mhm

[Speaking: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, Jae Millz

I'll just go without you knowing
I won't come back to you again
I'll leave right now and catch the train

Don't you wait for me anymore
I loved you then and then I was sure
Our love was something at the start
You killed the sun and you broke my heart

Why oh why did you do it
I thought I'd never get through it
While you were telling me lies
You were taking the sun
Taking the sun from my eyes
Taking the sun from my eyes
Taking the sun from my eyes

So just listen to me while I say
Forget all the love of those days
They're only empty and they're gone
Oh! Oh! Oh! Come fill my glass up a little more!

[Chorus]
Dopeman, please can I have another hit?
Dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman

[Verse]
Ayo, once upon a time, there lived a little bad bitch
I just press the buttons on my little gadgets
Born in December, so I am a Sagittarius
Maybe just a little bi-curious
Yo, miney-mo-to-eenie-meenie
Your wish is my command
I mean I really, really mean it
'Cause I am the lady that was on I Dream of Jeannie
They call it spaghetti but I call it linguini
Coke fizzles if you wanna get the sniffles
I got that wet-wet, it could get wetter than a drizzle
Plus I got plenty, no seeds in my twenty
And I just got them peanut butter crack sandwiches
You need a dopeman, oh, you need a snowman
I got that Lohan, weight like Rosanne
But fuckin' with my money is a no-no, man
I got them Bar-billions, they call me Cole-man

[Chorus]
Dopeman, please can I have another hit?
Dopeman, please can I have another hit?
Dopeman, please can I have another hit?
Dopeman (Nicki Minaj)
Dopeman, dopeman (Beam Me Up Scotty)
Dopeman, dopeman please can I have another hit?
(King Pen Pusha)
Dopeman, please can I have another hit? (Gang Records)
Dopeman, please can I have another hit?
Dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
I hope the day will be a lighter highway
For friends are found on every road
Can you ever think of any better way
For the lost and weary travellers to go

Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then everything's all right

It seems to me a crime that we should age
These fragile times should never slip us by
A time you never can or shall erase
As friends together watch their childhood fly

Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then everything's all right

Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then everything's all right
Warm the wine and give it to me one more time again
I'm just a rolling stone who needs a drop of rain
And to taste your honey, Mona is like licking on the sun
My truck's hid in the back yard so come here and give me some

Said lady, that's the way
You've gotta rock me when he's gone
You make me feel like a diesel train going home
We got so much to give each other
And we've only just begun
So take me baby, break me lady
Gotta rock me when he's gone

Break the bread in two and you can give me half
I've ridden hard and fast just to make you laugh
To make you laugh I've stood knee-deep in mud outside your door
Clutching in my hand a border rose from Baltimore
See my eyes and I see my arms
The seagulls say you've gone
It was just a game of let's pretend
And I whistle to the waves that lend me tears

Purple clouds, golden rain
Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the wind

If you're quick enough to rise
With the sleep still in your eyes
You'll see the shadow of the sun above my mind
I know that only you can help me now

Purple clouds, golden rain
Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the wind

But a dandelion sighs
And it tries to tell the wind
That crying's not a bad thing
Worrying is a sin
If they sent a cloud from heaven
I would ride into the skies
To escape all of my troubles
And to cast away your lies

Purple rains have turn to gold
The clouds of yesterday
And a dandelion dies in the wind

I see my eyes and I see my arms
The seagulls say you've gone
It was just a game of let's pretend
And I whistle to the waves that lend me tears

Purple clouds, golden rain
Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the wind
Music by elton john
Released as a uk b-side in 1981

At last i'm over losing you
I've cried so many tears it just ain't true
My eyes are red, my heart is blue
I can't get over getting over losing you

I can't turn back the hands of time
I've come so far, i have to see it through
The trouble is that i still find
I can't get over getting over losing you

I hardly ever think of you
Except in the morning and then in the evening, again in the afternoon
I guess it's true, i'm over the worst
But living's the one thing that ain't rehearsed

But i know that's all behind me now
I'm learning how to live my life anew
And as soon as i discover how
Then i'll get over getting over losing you
I hardly ever think of you, i roll with the punches
I'm taking it easy, i don't play hunches like i used to do
I'm over you now
Still tying to forget you but i don't know how

But at least i'm over losing you
There's only one thing left for me to do
Oh my eyes are red, my heart is blue
I draw the lone on you and me, forget how fine it used to be
And i'll get over getting over losing you
And i'll get over getting over losing you

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, Aretha Franklin
Thank you very much
I wanna take you back to 1968

[Verse 1]
Lookin' out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired

[Pre-Chorus]
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But you're the key to my piece of mind because

[Chorus]
You make me feel (You make me feel), you make me feel (You make me feel)
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman

[Verse 2]
When my soul was lost and found, yeah
A lot of good men came along to claim it, oh, ooh
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
'Til his kiss helped me name it, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm livin' for
Because if I make you happy I don't need to do more

[Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel (You make me feel)
You make me feel like a natural woman

[Bridge]
Feel like a natural woman, yeah
Oh, baby (Oh, baby)
What you done to me? (What you done to me?)
You make me feel so good inside (You make me feel so good, so good inside)
And I just wanna be close to you (I wanna be close to you)
You make me feel so alive (You make me feel so alive)

[Chorus]
You make me feel, you make me feel (Oh, you make me feel)
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman (Yeah, yeah)
You make me feel (You make me feel)
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman (Baby, oh, yeah)
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman (Yeah, yeah)
You make me feel (You make me feel)
You make me feel

[Outro]
Like a natural woman
Oh, baby, you make me feel
Feel like a natural
Feel like a natural
Feel like a natural
Woman, woman, woman
Woman

[Verse 1]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

[Verse 2]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

[Pre-Chorus]
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

[Pre-Chorus]
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waitin' to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Oh, Lucy)
Ohh

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Ohh

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Ohh

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Lucy in the sky with diamonds (Lucy, oh, Lucy)
Ohh

[MEREB]
There is a time, there is a place
When love should conquer all
The rest of life is pushed aside
As truth and reason fall
But only if that selfishness
Can lead to something good
I thought I knew you, princess
But I never understood

I don't know you
I don't know you

[Verse 1]
You are my weakness
You are my friend
Nothing I have in the world
Makes better sense
'Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea
When we're together
Or when we're apart
There's never a space in-between
The beat of our hearts
'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree

[Chorus]
One day at a time
Is all we do
One day at a time
Is good for you, you, you (wooh)

[Verse 2]
You are my woman
I am your man
Nothing else matters at all
Now I understand
That I'm the door and you're the key
And every morning
I wake in your smile
Feeling your breath on my face
And the love in your eyes
'Cause you're the honey and I am the bee

[Chorus]
One day at a time
Is all we do
One day at a time
Is good for you, you, you
One day at a time
Is all we do
One day at a time
Is good for you, you, you (wooh)
Abide with me, fast forth the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord abide with me
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, O abide with me
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting, where, grave, that victory
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me
Hold Thou, thy cross, before my closen eyes
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's, morning breaks, and earth's, vain shadows flee
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me
Ooh she said, "The crowd just loved you
My name's Angel and I'm sixteen
I really love your band and your funny accent
Sure would like a cruise in your limousine."

Then she said, "How about a rubdown?
You're so cute and I'm so mean
The way you hold your guitar really gets me
I can show you tricks that you ain't never seen."

Sick City, nobody to love you
Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh, Sick City

"Hey man, how's about a handout
All you dudes just loaded down
Just a little sugar man, makes me sweeter
I like to sit at home and watch the world go 'round."
Stage door monkey's on my back
Begging me to save his life
Can't he understand we're not a healing show
We're just here to play some music for the kids tonight

Sick City, nobody to love you
Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh, Sick City

Stage door monkey's on my back
Begging me to save his life
Can't he understand we're not a healing show
We're just here to play some music for the kids tonight

Sick City, nobody to love you
Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh oh, Sick City

Sick City
Sick City
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick City
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick, Sick City (ah)

Sick City (Sick City)
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick, Sick City (ah)

Sick City (Sick City)
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick, Sick City (ah)

Sick City (Sick City)
Sick City (Sick City)
Sick, Sick City (ah)
Two people caught on a string
A high-wire act above the center ring
While the audience is wondering
If we'll make it back

Two people up on a wire
Overhead and under fire
While the audience enquire
If it's just a knack

Strangers, after all, we find we're strangers
After all this time
We've made the long and the lonely climb
And now we've reached the part
Where we find we're strangers
We were strangers from the start

Two people caught in the tide
On the edge of love and pride
And both afraid to approach the side
And fall again
Two people playing the part
But which is life and which is art
And isn't it a little late

[Verse 1]
Baby, so they give you anythin'
Darlin', all the joy money can bring
Baby, do they bring you happiness
Darlin', you're no different from the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you see that it's love you really need
Take my hand, and I'll show what a love could be
Before it's too late

[Chorus]
Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

[Verse 2]
Baby, fancy friends show you a smile
Darlin', rich relations for a while
Baby, I can only give you love
Darlin', a-this old heart should be enough

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need is a chance to make you mine
Let me in, oh, I'll change the way you feel inside
Before it's too late

[Chorus]
Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

[Chorus]
Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

[Chorus]
Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

[Chorus]
Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love

[Chorus]
Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
I came down here just to waste some time
To get a little rest and to ease my mind
I didn't calculate it when I walked in the door
I only thought I'd stay for a minute or more

First I saw the lights on the ceiling dim
The stale perfume yeah, and the beer canteens
My first impression was to get outside
But then I saw you crying, crying by the fireside

The pendulum swings
Going to and fro
And the clock goes round
Says it's time to go
And the clock goes round
And the hours fly past
Slow down pendulum you're moving much too fast

Now it's gone kind of quiet but I seem to see
That the only people here in the room are you and me
But I don't mind girl, girl that's all right
As long as you're gonna be with me, gonna be with me all night
Well, she was just seventeen
And you know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
How could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long, I fell in love with her
How could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
How could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
How could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there
When I saw her standing there
If your life is dull and dreary
And you're feeling rather weary
Of the mundane things that clutter up one's life
Drive your roller up to Bond Street
Where royalty and Sheiks meet
Make your day
Here's the thing to do
Spend a grand or two at Cartier

[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a young boy, I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played them all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Verse 2]
He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
He plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus 1]
He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

[Post-Chorus]
(How do you think he does it?) I don't know
(What makes him so good?)

[Verse 3]
Well, he ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see lights a-flashin', he plays by sense of smell
Always has a replay, never tilts at all
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus 2]
He can't beat me now, I've always been the champ
I know every trick, no freak's gonna beat my hand

[Bridge]
(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)
(Oh, can't explain)

[Verse 4]
Even on my usual table, he can beat the best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, I've never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus 1]
He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

[Chorus 3]
He's a pinball wizard, he scores a trillion more
A pinball wizard, the world's new pinball lord
He's scoring more, he's scoring more

[Chorus 4]
I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him
To him, to him
Like I said baby
If you go astray
Well then go on
Go your own sweet way
I thought you knew by now
You do just what you please
And here's to the next time
Here's to the next time

How many times
Have you gone before
And how many times
Have I forgiven you once more
Never had to wait
Like I waited for you
And here's to the next time
Here's to the next time

When you're gone
The time drags by
I wish you'd learn
Not to make me cry
To make me cry
So if you're gonna leave me
Never to come back
Break it to me gently
Or my world will crack
So be sure to let me know
That I'll never say
Here's to the next time
Here's to the next time
Here's to the next time
Dear Billy
I must seem a distant memory
Which is probably a good thing
And it will have been a long, long time
And I will have missed you growing
And I'll have missed you crying
And I'll have missed you laugh

Missed your stamping and your shouting
I have missed telling you off
But please, Billy, know that I was always there
I was with you through everything

And please, Billy, know that I will always be
Proud to have known you
Proud that you were mine
Proud in everything
And you must promise me this, Billy
In everthing you do
Always be yourself, Billy
And you always will be true
Love you forever
Love you forever
Mam
I don't make the rules around here
A tear starts at the edge
It takes two hands to rip it
It takes a lot more than either one of us has said

But I come from indecision
A place you ain't never been
Living in the state of confusion
On a map that runs like the veins under your skin

We got Miss Communication kicking out the stool
We got mass determination making up the rules
But saving us is something that we can't do
And it's easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool

And love is just another means
By which we hang ourselves
It takes two to execute
One to leave with innocence and one to leave with guilt

But I just see no reality
Just shades drawn on remorse
We've whipped this beast beyond the limit
Staggered out of breath along this course
It's easier to lose a rope around a fool
Easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool
A ring of your indifference thrown anywhere you choose
Easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool

[Verse 1]
Hey there
Look in the mirror
Are you afraid you might see me looking at you
Waiting, waiting at windows
Oh it's me that you need
Yes it's me and I'm waiting for you

[Pre-Chorus]
But I remain silent
Oh I won't say a word
I leave you to realise I'm the light in your world

[Chorus]
And it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you're needing
It's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you need
Yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
If you want to be living
I'm the one who's forgiving
Admit that it's me that you need

[Verse 2]
Watching, watching the swallows fly
It all means the same
Just like them
You can fly home again
But don't, no don't forget yesterday
Pride is an ugly word girl
And you still know my name

[Pre-Chorus]
But I remain silent
Oh I won't say a word
I leave you to realise I'm the light in your world

[Chorus]
And it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you're needing
It's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you need
Yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
If you want to be living
I'm the one who's forgiving
Admit that it's me that you need
Take a look at me now and take a taste of the money
I'm not in it for the bread I'm in it for the gravy, honey
Step on the thin ice lightly
And check out the show twice nightly
'Cause I'm on the stage tonight
And if the price is right
I will amaze before the light I crave the light
Blinding white I need the light tonight

Take a look at me now and take a look at my billing
I'm not in it as an extra, I'm in it for the killing
Inflate my ego gently, tell them heaven sent me
'Cause I'm so expressive and I'm so obsessed with my ego
My ego and it's message
Oh inform the press, invite the guests
I need the press tonight

Do you remember acting out your youth
A Romeo resplendent on an orange case
Do you remember how I would recite
And how I'd blow my lines and hide my face
Well maybe it was childish, foolish, before schoolish
Immaturish, lose your coolish
But I had to grow and prove my ego

Take a look at me now and take a taste of the money
I'm not in it for the bread I'm in it for the gravy, honey
Inflate my ego gently, tell them heaven sent me
Oh 'cause I'm so expressive and I'm so obsessed with my ego
My ego and it's message
Oh inform the press, invite the guests
I need the press tonight

Do you remember acting out your youth
A Romeo resplendent on an orange case
Do you remember how I would recite
And how I'd blow my lines and hide my face

Well maybe it was childish, foolish, before schoolish
Immaturish, lose your coolish
Childish (childish), foolish (foolish), before schoolish
Immaturish, lose your coolish
But I, I had to grow to prove my ego
White man danger
He's come to stay
Red man, it's all over
You're in the way

White man danger
Time on his side
Red man, you don't know it
But your world just died

Let's hear it for the white man
He feels no pain
Let's hear it for the white man
He feels no shame

White man danger
His day has come
Red man got two chances
Slim chance and none

White man danger
He's come to stay
Red man, it's all over
El Dorado, queen of cities
Paradise so wisely hid
Overshadows Barcelona
Aragon, Castle, Madrid
Where on Earth can match your riches
Match your people fine and free
Why return to old world values
This is how the Earth should be

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

El Dorado, queen of cities
Overflowing with excess
Every turn exotic, lavish
Prescious wonders numberless
Lead me now into temptation
Surely you would not deny
One who's come so far to find you
All your blessings save goodbye
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, (she could be the death of me) El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

El Dorado, golden prison
Sheer perfection, sheer despair
How can one who knows such splendour
Feel the answer lies elsewhere
All I know is I must leave her
Or she'll be the death of me
Put my trust in poorer places
Let the queen of cities be

El Dorado, (must leave her) El Dorado (queen of cities)
El Dorado, (sheer perfection) El Dorado

El Dorado, (or she'll be the death of me) El Dorado
El Dorado, (queen of cities) El Dorado

(Must leave her) El Dorado, (queen of cities)
El Dorado, (sheer perfection) El Dorado

El Dorado, (or she'll be the death of me) El Dorado
El Dorado, (queen of cities) El Dorado
There isn't much I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
Ask no questions, take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
Still we are, have always been, will ever be as one

What is done hath been done for the best
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose
But if I started over I know I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
I would choose
The same joy, the same sadness, each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye

[Verse 1]
He's so sophisticated
In a critic's eye
He needs a change of habit
But then so do i
He's all Zeffirelli
In cool loose clothes
He needs to be rewired
He's plugged on overload

[Verse 2]
So crisp and new
Well it had to be
I guess he needs a change
From the likes of me
If he should lose some color
When he leaves the sun
I'm sure a little braggi
Wouldn't hurt no one

[Chorus]
'cause when the fool's in fashion
He's attracting everyone
He'll be the head of your list
He'll be your dinner guest
If he's the center of attention
Looks like the fool's in fashion

[Verse 3]
You had your pound of flesh
You got the driver's seat
Well you can keep the car
But I'd like the meat
'cause there must be plenty
Down in the cutting room
It's so tough to suffer
When you want the moon

[Chorus]
'cause when the fool's in fashion
He's attracting everyone
He'll be the head of your list
He'll be your dinner guest
If he's the center of attention
Looks like the fool's in fashion

[Chorus]
'cause when the fool's in fashion
He's attracting everyone
He'll be the head of your list
He'll be your dinner guest
If he's the center of attention
Looks like the fool's in fashion
(ahhh ahhh)
Looks like the fool's in fashion
(ahhh ahhh)
Looks like the fool's in fashion
(ahhh ahhh)
Looks like the fool's in fashion
(ahhh ahhh)
Looks like the fool's in fashion
(ahhh ahhh)
Looks like the fool's in fashion
(ahhh ahhh)
Looks like the fool's in fashion
When I was a boy I had a lot of fun
I lived by the sea, I was a fisherman's son
My mother she was a fisherman's wife
She was scrubbing floors most of her life

They said screw you
I ain't got nothing to lose
I could paper a matchbox
With the money I use

At the school I attended I got into fights
I was beaten in an alley on a cold winter night
The teachers cared less for the blood in our veins
They got most of their thrills out of using a cane

They said screw you
Oh you bloody young fools
I could get more sense
Out of the back end of a mule

So you see there's man who get paid for being slaves
And men who get paid for being free
And there's men behind bars who pray for the light
And men in the suburbs who pray for the night
And they're all trying to climb to the top of the mine
And all of them say most of the way
Screw you
I worked in the mill from seven till nine
Tears in my eyes nearly drove me half-blind
Trying to make wages that weren't even there
Taking hell from a foreman with the build of a bear

He said screw you
This is all you'll ever do
It's the only existence for someone like you
Sitting here on Christmas Eve with a brandy in my hand
Oh I've had a few too many and it's getting hard to stand
I keep hearing noises from my fireplace
I must be going crazy or the brandy's won the race

And I keep hearing ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise, surprise
The bearded weirdy's just arrived

Ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise surprise
The bearded wierdy's just arrived

On my roof there's snorting sounds, and bells inside my head
My vision's blurred with colour, and all he sees is red
There's a pair of large sized wellies coming down my flue
And the smell of burning rubber, oh is filling up the room
This year, next year, sometime, never
Will we ever get together
I keep hoping things are gonna change
Colours changing red to yellow
Yesterday you said hello
And from now on I'll never be the same

Annabella Umberella
Standing on the corner when the rain comes down
That's the way I'll always think of you
When I first met you
Annabella Umberella, child

I wanna get to know you better
Get to know your name
And yet I know to me you'll always be the same

Sunshine sunshine go away
Come again another day
Raindrops fall, us both together
How I love the rainy weather
They're barring the doors at the back of the hall
It's cold in the winter, some freeze in the fall
The banquet's the supper that's set for the swine
If you're not at the gathering, and you've gone down the line

You're the last to arrive, you're the first one to leave
You don't give us the time, you don't drop us a line
Well a dime in the phone is the best way I know
You're the last to arrive, my friend you're the first one to go

The truck picks you up on your front porch at night
And you're back before sundown if you don't get blind
We're not chaining you down to your castle tonight
We're just trying to make you see some sort of light

They'll all drink your health out of pewter and wood
Get drunk in the hayloft playing dirty and good
There's ten pounds of oxen were skewered on spit
There'll not be an ounce if you don't make it quick

[Verse 1]
Catch a star if you can
Wish for somethin' special
Let it be me, my love is free
Sing a song to yourself
Think of someone listenin'
One melody, you're all for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll write a symphony just for you and me
If you let me love you
I'll paint a masterpiece just for you to see
If you let me love you, let me love you

[Chorus]
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
(Love)

[Verse 2]
You're the one like the sun
Shine your love around me
You'll always be the one for me
Say the word, I'll be there
Lovin' you forever
Don't let me go, just say it's so

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll hear the music ring from the mountaintops
To the valley below us
We'll serenade the world with a lullaby
So the angels will know us, angels will know us

[Bridge]
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am
Yes I am
Yes I am
Yes I am
Yes I am

[Chorus]
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you

[Chorus]
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love?

[RADAMES]
To sail away to half discovered places
To see the secrets so few eyes have seen
To see moments of enchantment on our faces
The moments when we smile and those in between

[AIDA]
If I could leave this place then I'd be sailing
To corners of my land where there would be
Sweet southern winds of liberty prevailing
The beauty so majestic and so free

[RADAMES, spoken]
I will take you sailing, South.  You can be my guide
(sung)
There'd be no ties of time and space to bind me

[AIDA]
And no horizon I could not pursue

[RADAMES]
I'd leave the world's misfortunes far behind me

[AIDA]
I'd put my faith and trusting in something new

[BOTH]
But why should I tell you this

[AIDA]
A stranger I just met

[RADAMES]
A woman whom I hardly know at all and should forget

[BOTH]
A journey we can only dream of
Enchantment passing through
And how is it I say these things
So easily to you

[RADAMES, spoken]
I'll never take you sailing!  I might never  leave Egypt again!

[AIDA, spoken]
You talk as though you've been enslaved!  If you don't like your fate, change it!  You are your own master, there are no shackles on you!  So don't expect any pity or understanding from this humble palace slave!

[RADAMES]
And why did I tell her this?
A stranger I've just met
A woman who I hardly know at all and will forget
Anonymous and gone tomorrow
Enchantment passing through
And all I've done is tell her things
She already knew
She knew ...She knew....
I lived in a tenement six floors above
I lent you my records and I lent you my love
But you left me on the weekend without a by-your-leave
That's a dirty and a low-down trick
My folks all think you're mean

But I don't mind, that's kind of nifty
You always set those break-ups in the movies
And just like a light honey you put me out
Now I'm gonna do my best
To get you back in the nest you came from

You can erase me if you want to
Turn your back in other men
But whenever you're ready
Honey, we'll go steady again

It's nasty without you in my little room
I miss you like crazy, please come back soon
I was joking with those things I said
I couldn't have been thinking
If you don't come back I think I'll crack
Just like my old ceiling
Fat boys cry when ugly girls sing
About the way the world would be if they were thin
And ugly girls turn their heads when fat boys laugh
About the handsome kid next door who broke their heart
Who broke their heart
Broke their heart

And fat boys lie when ugly girls ask
About the size an apple pie looks through a magnifying glass
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep

But it's the fat boy's world for an ugly girl
And ugly girls love that fat boy joy
Who needs the worries of a perfect world
Hear the early birds make that spring time come
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
Fat boys dance when ugly girls shout
That a waltz is not the dance for the boy who's stout
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep

Fat boys and ugly girls

Steal away child into your dreams
Where nothing is ever the way that it seems
I gave you your life, you gave me your trust
I've no wish to hurt you but hurt you i must
Steal away child, turn down your light
Steal away into the night

Steal away child to the land of the lies
Where love lasts forever and hope never dies
Sit safe for a place peaceful and calm
Where no one and nothing can harm you

Steal away child, you'll be alright
Steal away into the night
Once more goodnight, one last goodbye
Trying hard not to show how i'm making what it's taking not to cry

Steal away child, sleeping so still
Our love is too precious for distance to kill
But when you awake, morning has come
I won't be the one you turn to
I'll do what i must before it gets light
I'll steal away into the night
Steal away child
Steal away into the night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Way behind the water hole
A little down the line
The jungle and the plains and peaks
Are scheduled to be mine
I'm gonna be the ruler
Of most everything around
From the grandest of the mountains
To the humble common ground

[Chorus 1]
My reign will be a super awesome thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna be a noble king
And scrupulously fair
I only need a little time
Perhaps a little hair
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar

[Chorus 2]
The fauna and the flora gonna swing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

[Verse 3]
No one saying do this
No one saying be there
No one saying stop that
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day
I'll be free to do it my way (eheeee)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
No one saying do this
No one saying be there
No one saying stop that
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day
Free to do it my way (eheeee)

[Verse 4]
The time has come as someone said
To talk of many things
May be true
But I would rather stick to talking kings
It's easy to be royal
If you're already leonine
It isn't just my right
Even my left will be divine

[Outro]
The monarchy is waiting to go zing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king (oh ooh, oh ooh)
Oh, I just can't wait to be king (oh ooh, oh ooh)
(oh ooh, oh ooh) (oh ooh, oh ooh)
Got this bug-eyed girl
Cold hand on my knee
Frozen teeth chitter, chatter
She's dressed up like a cemetery
Like a cemetery

Snowbound all winter
Blue lips on my cheek
Little tongues prattlin', rattlin'
Talkin' about them hometown geeks
Them hometown geeks

Wake up Wendy, smell the coffee
Help me into your custom kitchen
Gimme a cup of that old black magic
I want to get me some of that old home cookin'
Can you feel it, it's chilly and freezin'
Wake up Wendy, moods a changin'
I got a reason, and you got a feelin'
Wake up Wendy, love's in season
Feels like a steam clean
When she washes me
Clouds a bustin', pumps a hissin'
Just peel me off the ceiling
Off the ceiling

Oh, chill out, bug-eyed-girl
Zap me into cinders
Pop the thermal mumbo jumbo
Melt me with your little fingers
With little fingers

Wake up Wendy, smell the coffee
Help me into your custom kitchen
Gimme a cup of that old black magic
I want to get me some of that old home cookin'
Can you feel it, oh, it's chilly and freezin'
Wake up Wendy, moods a changin'
I got a reason, and you got a feelin'
Wake up Wendy, love's in season
Wake up Wendy, love's in season
Wake up Wendy, love's in season

[ZOSER]
While you've been away cavorting
Matters here have moved apace
Now I need you home supporting
All the plans I've put in place

First of all this means your wedding
You'll recall your future bride
For the way that Pharaoh's heading
Time's no longer on our side

According to the hawk god, Horus
Our most regal invalid
Is not that much longer for us
Build another pyramid!

There are many who'll be tearful
As our leader fades away
But our architects are cheerful
And each dog must have its day
If our country is to flourish
Then my son must take the lead
Be our inspiration, nourish
All our hopes our dreams our creed

Soon our monarch will have filled a
Tomb just like his fathers did
Summon Egypt's greatest builders
Re: another pyramid

[MINISTERS]
Build it, build it
Another pyramid

[ZOSER]
There will be a time for mourning
But for now put plans on hold

[MINISTERS]
Hold

[ZOSER]
For I give the nation warning
That before the corpse is cold

[MINISTERS]
Cold

[ZOSER]
We'll extend fair Egypt's power
Egypt's glory strength and style
We shall have our finest hour
Far beyond the mighty Nile

He must have a vault that's grand by
Any standards, floor to lid
Put five thousand slaves on stand by
Build another pyramid!

[MINISTERS]
Build it, build it
Build it, build it
Build it, build it
Build it-

Build it, build it
Build it-

[ZOSER]
He must have a vault that's grand by
Any standards, floor to lid
Put five thousand slaves on stand by
Build another pyramid!

[Verse 1]

(Yeah, come along with me)
(Ah)
When I can't find words and wisdom in my life
And barriers abound
Should I feel blinded by the light
Knee deep up to my neck in heavy water
I conjure up my muse
She's my means to achieve a simple quota

When it's make or break
Make no mistake
She appears like lightning in a bottle
I catch the spark
Oh she lights the dark
The knot's undone the ideas come
Like two hands on a throttle

There's a place of one way streets and doubt
No red lights ever change
We wind up with no exit out
Facts are facts and stumbling blocks delay the mind
That's when my muse arrives
I've been blown away like a printed page
That reads "you're lovesick"
Headline news had me so abused
But I was lovesick

You never tried although I sacrificed
My weaknesses for you
I could have understood, I could have read your looks
I should have known better too

I've been holding out but it's time to shout
You know I'm lovesick
A helping hand for a dying man
Who says he's lovesick

I can't explain why I'll never change
This sickness deep inside
I've been doctored down, I've had the nurse around

[Verse 1]
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

[Verse 2]
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch, we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

[Verse 3]
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed yourself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you will ever know

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

[Outro]
Your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

[Verse 1]
If anyone should see me making it down the highway
Breaking all the laws of the land
Well, don't you try to stop me, I'm going her way
And that's the way I'm sure she had it planned

[Chorus]
Well, that's my rock and roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, and no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows

[Verse 2]
Well, if she would only slow down for a short time
I'd get to know her just before she leaves
But she's got some fascination for that two-wheel combination
And I swear it's gonna be the death of me

[Chorus]
Well, that's my rock and roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, and no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows
(Rock on, baby!)
(Whoo! Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Well, that's my rock and roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, and no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows

[Bridge]
Let's get a little bit lower
Let's get a little bit lower
Oh, you're standing alright
Single, baby? Ah, yeah, that's pretty good
Now, is everybody gonna rock on with me?
One more time

[Chorus]
I said, that's my rock and roll Madonna, aw, everybody
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, but no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows, yeah
Looking back in anger
On this dirty little town
It stained your dress carved up my face
Put a wedge between our state of grace

Somethings so young and pretty
Should never be released
We place our bets we take our pick
They wind up in the belly of the beast

And when you can't get what you want
You take anything you can
So I wear this suit of wolves at night
I slip it on how come it feels so right

I get a hungry man
When I can't get what I want
I take anything I can
I wear a suit of wolves

Just across from Friday
The weekend circus rolls
I cross my heart turn on the charm
I say my prayers between two hungry arms
There's a string of dangerous flowers
All around my bed
There's some want rings and some just want
And those who'd like to see me dead
Come back baby
Come back to me yeah
And you will see yeah
How I've changed
'Cause you're the only love that I ever had
You're the only love that I ever had
Come back to me

Come back baby
I did you wrong yeah
And this is the song I sing
I hope will bring you back to me
'Cause you're the only love that I ever knew
You're the only love that I ever knew
Come back come back

Come back baby
Come back and treat me right
Come back baby
Come on back, I'll hold you tight
Come back baby
Come back I'll treat you right
Come back baby
Come on back
Come back and hold me tight

Come back baby
Everything's gonna be fine right now
It's gonna be fine right now
It's gonna be fine right now
'Cause you're the only love that I ever had
Yeah you're coming back and I'm so glad
You're coming back to me

[Verse 1]
I looked up from my glass into the sky
There's no one in my comic book to buy
Calendar swung on the wall held by a rusty nail
Down came the strange rain and washed my thoughts away

[Pre-Chorus] 

[x2]
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

[Chorus]
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain

[Verse 2]
Still I sit beside the fire and watched as it fell
Come in colours from above into my citadel
My eyes are all embroidered with the rainbow you have made
And now it seems as though it's just, just like strange rain

[Pre-Chorus] 

[x2]
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

[Chorus]
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain

[Pre-Chorus] 

[x2]
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

[Chorus]
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Just like strange rain
Suzie walks her dog but it don't solve
All the mysteries
Hanging with the guys, making with the guys
Playing hard to please

Back in '63, she was made for me
We were having fun
Wasn't long before I could not ignore
She's about hanging out
Campus queen dreams shattered years ago
And I'm the one who knows

It's the same country love song
Different words, a different melody
It's the same country love song

Mama said to me, John you got to be
Honest to yourself
Keeping up the pace, losing in the race
Further on the shelf
I want to write a country love song, tell them nothing's wrong
Suzie did my heart
There is nothing more, something said before
C'est la vie, mon cherie
Lady Luck, me and sexy so-and-so
And I'm the one who knows
If you want a lover
I'll do anything you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you

If you want a partner, hold my hand
If you want to strike me down in anger
Here I stand
Baby I'm your man

If you want a boxer
I will step into the ring for you
And if you want a doctor
I'll examine every inch of you

If you want a driver, climb inside
Or if you want to take me for a ride
You know you can
Baby I'm your man

The moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through these promises to you
That I made and I could not keep
But a man never got a woman back
Not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby
I'd fall at your feet

And I'd howl at your beauty
Like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart
And I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please
I'm your man

And if you gotta sleep a moment on the road
I will steer for you
And if yo want to work the street alone
I'll disappear for you

If you want a father for your child
Or only want to walk with me a while
Across the sand
Baby I'm your man
I'm your man

If you want a lover, I'm your man
If you want a boxer, I'm your man
If you want a doctor, I'm your man
In the heart of every girl
There's a woman waking up
Like sunlight spreads across the world
A smile for us is just enough
But in the heart of every girl
There's a homespun family dream
A light that's filled with so much joy
From a curly-head beauty to a teenage queen

And honeymoons in summer prove
We'll always love a bride
The gift you give us all
Is the one you hold inside
This lucky life, this crazy mixed up world
Is all because we love what lives
In the heart of every girl

In the heart of every girl
There's always room for Valentines
And boys to kneel and tip their hands
With words as sweet as summer wine
And in the heart of every girl
There is a rose for every spring
A peach that's fragrant and divine
She shines just like a wedding ring
And honeymoons in summer prove
We'll always love a bride
The gift you give us all
Is the one you hold inside
This lucky life, this crazy mixed up world
Is all because we love what lives
In the heart of every girl

Eyes can light up any room
The moment she steps in
Intoxicating everyone
A life alone should be a sin

And honeymoons in summer prove
We'll always love a bride
The gift you give us all
Is the one you hold inside
This lucky life, this crazy mixed up world
Is all because we love what lives
In the heart of every girl
Music by elton john
Never released

I've served upon this railroad for longer than i know
My father and his father did the same thing long ago
To keep the western union rolling down towards the sea
The benefits of this great line built for you and me

So rolling western union, you can roll on to the sea
Ten thousand miles of beatin' steel has made a man out of me
In every state i've driven home a rivet with my hands
Oh it's rolling western union rolling onward, onward through our land

It's friends of mine who died upon the building of this line
Irishmen and chinamen and some from the british isles
I've even seen the convicts come to work here for a while
Before the law caught up with them and sent them back to trial

I had a wife while on the job a hundred miles on back
She died in oklahoma and i laid her by the track
All that's left is a wooden cross upright on a mound
And every time the train rolls past, it rumbles in the ground
Every time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time I look away
I find a hiding place

If you knew me like you knew him
You would know just how I feel
Slipping through someone's fingers
Falling under someone's wheels

It's easier to walk away
Better off to face the facts
When love holds you up for ransom
Walk away and don't look back

Never seen you looking back through
Smiling eyes and tears
Never knew you holding on to
Memories and fears

Just release me I can't take it
Can't you see a change has come
Strangled by infatuation
Buried under someone's thumb
It's easier to walk away
Cover and fade to black
When love scars and leaves you branded
Walk away and don't look back

Every time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time I look away
I find a hiding place
A material girl in her own world can't even see the things she's missing
Right in the curve, a little girl wanting to grow up and be a star
Take a look around without looking down
All these things have blurred your vision
Material things don't amount to nothing

But I know how you feel
It's hard to see who's real

It takes time living in a world
When you don't know who to trust
Next time slow it down
And don't feel you don't have to rush
It'll be fine, it takes time, takes time to love

Know I'ma tell the truth when it comes to you my lady
And it's miracle you have found a conscience baby
I hadn't planned on leaving you can't even give a reason
Now I know the reason why, why

But I know how you feel
It's hard to see who's real
It takes time living in a world
When you don't know who to trust
Next time slow it down
And don't feel you don't have to rush
It'll be fine, it takes time, takes time to love

No, love ain't in the money, love ain't in the cars
Love ain't in the jewellery, love ain't in the Mars
Perfect place to start searchin' is your heart
Just have patience

It takes time living in a world
When you don't know who to trust
Next time slow it down
And don't feel you don't have to rush
It'll be fine, it takes time, takes time to love

It takes time to love
It takes time to love
It takes time to love
You're too low to see me smiling
When I'm flying in the air
But you're too high to frighten me
Pretend you didn't see me
Pretend you didn't need me
Pretend you didn't see me
Pretend you didn't need me

To frighten away all the lost and the lonely
The sacred forgotten of yesterday's problems
Your wooden construction was meant for infliction
To penetrate pain with the thoughts from my mind

Can you see me scarecrow
Can you still feel free
For all your love scarecrow
And will you still be there tomorrow
And will you still be there tomorrow

Like moths around a light bulb, your brain is still bleeding
From visions and pictures of nature's young raincoat
If only my eyes were not pinned to your table
My arms would be grasping the lilies of summer
It's no good to be a scarecrow post
And I've said it before, and I'll say it some more

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm...

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Chilling in my four point six at the light
'Bout to be VIP for the night
Shorty in the drop top V made a right
Pull up to her bumper, baby beeped twice
Jumped out the whip like I was the police
Didn't have a gun, but my wrist said freeze
Got Friday on a DVD
She's a baller and I'm a baller
Wha-what?

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
To all my hot girls living fiesta
To all my hot boys living fiesta
To all my Chi-town niggas, fiesta
And all my uptown niggas, fiesta
To all my players and my hustlers, fiesta
And if you sitting on them blades, fiesta
To all my honies in the club, fiesta
And if you rolling with a thug, fiesta

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
We be off in the club sipping lot
Red-eye deep in the club puffing lye
Strippers in the back of the club showing live
Soon as I get a buzz I'm showing out
House on top of the hill, counting what?
Who's gonna buy the bar? Got enough
Take the haters out in the back, rough 'em up
I'm a baller, now where's my ballers?
Wha-what?

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
To all my hot girls living fiesta
To all my hot boys living fiesta
To all my Chi-town niggas, fiesta
And all my uptown niggas, fiesta
To all my players and my hustlers, fiesta
And if you sitting on them blades, fiesta
To all my honies in the club, fiesta
And if you rolling with a thug, fiesta

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
We pop Cris' on a daily base
Plus we got honies all up in the place
Bout to wild out in a major way
So put your hands up if you made your pay
Add a little juice to the Tanqueray
And let the ice show 'til it blind her face
Rockland sitting on Capitol Hill
Trackmasters make capital deals

[Verse 3: Gotti]
Now look at Gotti iced out with the blingy-bling
And a big body sitting on them gleamy things
Now Rockland niggas know the means of cream
Kelly, R&B Thug and it sings to king
Got PJ niggas in Cabrini–Green (thugged out)
Hot chicks down to do anything
Cop them mo' chicks
Cop mo' bricks, pop mo' Cris'
Ay Kelly drop mo' hits

[Verse 4: Boo]
What you know about them cats that be spendin' the dough
Every day drink Henny and a bottle of Mo'
Ride whips, hitting chicks, blowing twenties on 'dro
To the club thirty deep, plenty of ice to show
Mami say she never rolled in a six before (fiesta)
Never seen a young cat this rich before
Yeah Kelly made the way for these niggas to blow (fiesta)
Thugged out, 2G, Rockland for sure (fiesta)

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
To all my hot girls living fiesta
To all my hot boys living fiesta
To all my Chi-town niggas, fiesta
And all my uptown niggas, fiesta
To all my players and my hustlers, fiesta
And if you sitting on them blades, fiesta
To all my honies in the club, fiesta
And if you rolling with a thug, fiesta
To all my hot girls living fiesta

To all my Chi-town niggas, fiesta
And all my uptown niggas, fiesta
To all my players and my hustlers, fiesta
I wake up and I look at the clock
In the middle of the night my heart stops
When I see you in the moonlight
I know why I'm in love

Peace will come I promise you
I wish you success in all you do
And when I think about the rest
I know why I'm in love

It's hard to find the kind of thing
You've searched for all your life
Someone bright and crazy
With a little soul inside

And looking at you fast asleep
I thank the stars above

And what more can I say
I've said it all in different ways
The bottom line, the simple facts are true
I know why I'm in love with you
I only hope you know I love you too
I kiss you and I melt inside
What you mean to me I can't describe
And if seeing is believing
You'd know why I'm in love

[Aretha Franklin]
Trey, this is Aretha
Believe in yourself
Believe in your dreams
Don't let nobody tell you what you can't do
Your sure gonna make it, yeah
Spring is here, the sky is blue
Birds will sing as if they knew
Today's the day, we'll say "I do"
And we'll never be lonely any more

Because we're going to the chapel
And we're gonna to get married
Going to the chapel
And we're gonna get married
Gee I really love you
And we're gonna get married
Going to the chapel of love

Bells will ring, the sun will shine
I will be hers, and she'll be mine
We'll love until the end of time
And we'll never be lonely any more
I may not seem your ideal when you look into my eyes
I don't smoke, I don't tell jokes, I'm not the custom made size
But baby let me take you out on the highway for a while
I'll show yow where the man in me is when he doesn't hide
Well he's cruising in the fast lane, stuck behind the wheel
Jekyll and Hyde going on inside when I'm your automobile

Let me be your car for a while child
Shift me into gear and I'll be there
Fill me up with five star gasoline girl
I'll be your car, I'll take you anywhere

Let me be your car, come on and drive me
I'm a speedy little boy down deep inside
I got bucket seats and two speed window cleaners
Just let me be your car, oh come on and ride

I can't dance, I don't dig it, I can't see it at all
You say I'm just a specimen, and baby I can crawl
Well my physique don't look the way the physiques really should
But then again I've got an engine underneath my hood
When I'm cutting up the road with a sports car on my tail
Frankenstein's inside my mind, and the wind's inside my sails
Dada dum-da dadada dum-da
Where it's at
Dada dum-da dadada dum-da
Where it's at

He's a man who knows most everything
Of anything at all
Tells a story of psychology
And his story never falls
He's a man who wears a portobello yellow bill-bob hat
He's a man who knows exactly where it's at

He's a man who draws illusions
And he carves them on a tree
Including all the love he found
He gives to you and me
And I don't even know his name
But I surely promise that
He's a man who knows exactly where it's at

Roaming around from place to place
He takes in all that he sees
He notices the good things that please him
He watches all the bad things that grieve him
But he loves everybody and he knows just where it's at
He was born of Gypsy parenthood
And he's always lived the land
And if people who would talk to him
Just cannot understand
But no matter what they say of him
They'll always tell you that
These battered hands are all you own
This broken heart just turned to stone
Go hang your glory on the wall
There comes a time when castles fall
And all that's left is shifting in the sand

You're out of time, you're out of place
Look at your face
That's the measure of a man

This coat that fits you like a glove
These dirty streets you learned to love
So welcome back my long lost friend
You've been to hell and back again
God alone knows how you crossed that span

Back on the beat, back to the start
Trust in your heart
That's the measure of a man

It's the fire in the eyes, the lines on the hand
It's the things you understand
Permanent ties from which you once ran
That's the measure of a man
You've come full circle, now you're home
Without the gold, without the chrome
And this is where you've always been
You had to lose so you could win
And rise above your troubles while you can

Now you can love, now you can lose
Now you can choose
That's the measure of a man
Music by elton john
Released as a uk b-side in 1980

It looked a lot like the same old thing
I've seen so many times
She was aging fast like a bandit
Born to a life of crime
Meanwhile he held his crown and watched her fall
Just bouncing her around like a rubber ball

Through her washed up eyes she could see
That the ties on her prince were gone
He turned the radio off when they played
What he once had called their song
Well the crystal didn't clink but they drink up more
And when he stayed out late she knew what he stayed out for

Love's so cold when you're growing old and your looks are gone
Love's so cold when your hands don't dance where they once belonged
If he's heading down to the red light and the local bar
Love's so cold when he shoots an arrow through your heart
Love's so cold when he shoots an arrow through your heart
Due to natural causes she became distorted and she tried to leave
But the winning team had an ace or two up a crooked sleeve
For he knew that her age wouldn't help her get along
And that's what made his hold on her so strong

[Intro]
It's Mr. Steal Your

[Chorus]
Ladies go, ladies go, ladies go wild

Ooh the way she dance, got every man eyes
Zoomed in on her body, bet every man tried
To have her heart, but she ain't feeling 'em
I got her heart, she's killing 'em

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Now the ladies go wild

Throw that body all around
Yeah the ladies go wild
Now the ladies go wild
Now the ladies go wild
Throw that body all around
Yeah the ladies go wild
Cast a pebble on the water
Watch the ripples gently spreading
Tiny daughter of the Camargue
We were meant to be together
We were made for one another
In a time it takes to grow up
If only we were old enough
Then they might leave us both alone

So take my hand in your hand
Say it's great to be alive
No one's going to find us
No matter how they try
No one's going to find us
It's wonderful so wild beneath the sky

Sleeping in the open
See the shadows softly moving
Take a train towards the southlands
Our time was never better
We shall pass the sights of splendor
On the door of a new life
It had to happen soon I guess
Whether it is wrong or it is right
We learned to be so graceful
Watching wild horses running
And from those agile angels
We knew the tide was turning
For we watched as on the skyway
The herons circled slowly
While we mere mortals watched them fly
Our sleepless eyes grew heavy

[Chorus]
It ain't about the rims on ma truck
Ain't about the ice on ma watch
Ain't about the coup on ma truck
Baby, it's about the game

Ride and low
(Ride and low)
Lay back in the seats and creep
That's just how I roll

With some fresh nice ones on ma feet
This is how we go
(This is how we go)
And I'm tryin' to find a chick who ain't about the duo
'Cause it ain't about that no more

[Chorus]
It ain't about the rims on ma truck
Ain't about the ice on ma watch
Ain't about the coup on ma truck
Baby, it's about the game
It ain't about the shows that I f***
Ain't about the duo or ma rocks
And am lyf that I live it don't stop
Baby, it's about the game

Look at me
(Look at me)
When u ask why I sit in the streets, that's who I be
Yo, I live for the duo for feelin' free

They are too many other dudes
You can choose that got this luxury
But without it all
(All the haters want to hate me)
But just nuthin'
(But the ladies just want to luv me)
And they luv me for what I do

[Chorus]
It ain't about the rims on ma truck
Ain't about the ice on ma watch
Ain't about the coup on ma truck
Baby, it's about the game
It ain't about the shows that I f***
Ain't about the duo or ma rocks
And am lyf that I live it don't stop
Baby, it's about the game
Ride and low
(Ride and low)
Lay back in the seats and creep
That's just how I roll

With some fresh nice ones on ma feet
This is how we go
(This is how we go)
And I'm tryin' to find a chick who ain't about the duo
'Cause it ain't about that no more

[Chorus]
It ain't about the rims on ma truck
Ain't about the ice on ma watch
Ain't about the coup on ma truck
Baby, it's about the game
It ain't about the shows that I f***
Ain't about the duo or ma rocks
And am lyf that I live it don't stop
Baby, it's about the game

[Verse 1]
Oh, pity me
I'm so alone and so blue
My friends have all gone away
Their friendliness too

[Pre-Chorus]
It was I on my own
With no need to belong
And I wanted to die
That's when you came along

[Chorus]
And thank you for all of your loving
Thank you for all of your tears
Thank you for all of your kindness
Thank you for being here

[Verse 2]
What a difference it made
My life has started again
And if you go away
It just won't be the same

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard to say what I feel
When I'm by your side
You're there when I'm worried
All my troubles, in you I confide

[Chorus]
And thank you for all of your loving
Thank you for all of your tears
Thank you for all of your kindness
Thank you for being here

[Verse 1]
Oh, pity me
So alone and so blue
My friends have all gone away
Their friendliness too

[Pre-Chorus]
It was I on my own
With no need to belong
And I wanted to die
That's when you came along

[Chorus]
And thank you for all of your loving
Thank you for all of your tears
Thank you for all of your kindness
Thank you for being here

[Outro]
Thank you for all of your loving
Thank you for all of your loving
Thank you for all of your loving
Thank you for all of your loving
Thank you for all of your loving

[AMNERIS]
It's so strange he doesn't show me
More affection that he needs
Almost formal, too respectful
Never takes romantic leads
There are times when I imagine
I'm not always on his mind
He's not thinking what I'm thinking
Always half a step behind
Always half a step behind

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[RADAMES]
I'm in every kind of trouble
Can't you tell? Just look at me
Half ecstatic, half dejected
All in all I'm all at sea
Easy terms I thought I wanted
Fill me now with chilling dread
You could never know the chaos
Of a life turned on its head
Of a life turned on its head
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[RADAMES, AMNERIS]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[AIDA]
I am certain that I love him
But a love can be misplaced
Have I compromised my people?
In my passion and my haste?
I could be his life companion
Anywhere but where we are
Am I leader? Am I traitor?
Did I take a step too far?
Did I take a step too far?

[AMNERIS]

Always half a step behind

Of a life turned on it's head

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Did I take a step too far?
Take me down to the water
Take me back to the source
Call the meeting to order
And let it run its course

Take me back to my childhood
When I was so alone
Let me feel like a child would
Looking out across the great unknown

Take me down to the ocean
Take me down to the sea
Set the feeling in motion
Forget the tied up time and let my spirit free

Take away the illusion
Of the man, of the king
Help me lose the confusion
So I can breathe again

Take me down to the ocean
Take me down to the sea
Set the feeling in motion
So you can just be you and I can just be me

I watch the raindrops falling on my window pane
All the bloomed forget-me-nots won't falter in the rain
Electric light bulbs cannot replace the sun
And picture postcards can't reveal all the things we've done

And the flowers will never ever die
And the flowers will never die
And autumn in the country cannot withhold the sky
And the flowers will never die

He spreads his cloudy blanket on a raging sea
And calms the cruel waves with the help of powers that be
The hours fly by, the clock ticks on maneuvering its hands
While the autumn leaves fall from the trees and return into the land
We follow the dog who follows the cat
We swallow the chain if they don't fight back
We come and go, just getting by
We got a flag on the moon, we got a hole in the sky

And each man kills the things he loves
It's an edible romance we all dream of
And love eats love, eats love
Love is a cannibal
Woman is a criminal
She have the hunger
But man is the animal
And love eats love, eats love
Love is a cannibal

We live in the woods but we hate the trees
We kill off the jungle but we save the leaves
The family face is painted grey
If I wasn't born to love you, why was I born at all
If I wasn't meant to hold you, what are these two arms for
If I can't protect you, what are these muscles for
If I can't enrich your life, I might as well be poor
If I couldn't see you naked, I might as well be blind
If I couldn't treat you right, wouldn't I be so unkind

And you were made for me
You were made for me
You weren't born to be alone
And you were made for me

You were made for me
You were made for me
Flesh and bone, it's etched in stone
That you were made for me

If I couldn't translate fantasy, imagine how I'd feel
If I couldn't hear your secret, my ears would both be sealed
And if I can't make love to you, this body has no use
If you believe I loved you, you wouldn't need no proof
And if I can't return to you, I wouldn't need my legs to run

[AMNERIS]
How have I come to this?
How did I slip and fall?
How did I throw half a lifetime away
Without any thought at all?

This should've been my time
It's over, it never began
I closed my eyes to so much for so long
And I no longer can

I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of shift in the stars
But I know the truth and it haunts me
It's flown just a little too far

I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
It's flown just a little too far

Why do I want him still?
Why when there's nothing there?
How to go on with the rest of my life
To pretend I don't care
This should've been my time
It's over, it never began
I closed my eyes to so much for so long
And I no longer can

I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of twist in my fate
But I know the truth and it haunts me
I learned it a little too late

I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
I learned it a little too late

Too late
Every single day, girl, I wanna
Get away, If your love's, gonna
Come along, girl, when we together
I be feeling so strong
But when we're apart
I don't know where to start

You've been nothing short of perfect
Baby, I've been trynna make it worth it
When you say, that you love me
Girl, you make me feel invincible

Baby, you know my love ain't gon' go no where
And I know the only thing thats pumping through my veins, is you
You know I'm only living for your love
You see I hit the ground runnin'
Searchin' for your love
And I'll never run from it, I promise
I won't survive, without it
I'll flatline
'Cause girl my heart beats for you
I won't survive (for you)
It beats for you (I won't survive)
(for you) Girl my heart beats for you
I won't survive
And I will never run from it, I promise
It beats for you
Ohhh
My heart only beats for you
Only for you, girl, ohh

Eh, Eh, Eh, Girl
Just the thought of you leavin'
Makes me feel the pain, girl
And no medication can make it go away, girl
My body's feeling cold
My heart is feelin' froze
Need your healin', here we go

You know, my love ain't gon' go no where
So beautiful, hold me tight, don't ever let me go

'Cause, you know I'm only livin' for your love
I hit the ground runnin'

Searchin' for your love
And I'll never run from it, I promise
I won't survive,(without it)
I'll flatline
'Cause Girl, my heart beats for you
I won't survive (for you)
It beats for you (I won't survive)
(For you) Girl my heart beats for you

And I will never run from it, I promise, It beats for you
You see, I hit the ground runnin'
Searchin' for your love
And I'll never run from it

Cause, Girl my heart beats for you
(I won't survive) (for you) It beats for you
(I won't survive) Cause girl my heart beats for, (I won't survive), for you
It beats for you, I won't survive
And I will never run from it, I promise
It beats for youuu
It beats for you, (only you)
Your love runs through my veins
Girl, it is not a game and I won't be the same
If you would go away
And your love wasn't here to stay
Down on my knees I pray
That you wait for me

Hit the ground runnin'
Searchin' for your love
And I will never run from it, I promise
I won't survive, without it
I'll flatline
'Cause girl, my heart beats for you
(I won't survive) for you
It beats for you
I won't survive (for you)
It beats for you, (I won't surive)
And I'll never run from it, I promise
It beats for you
Can you hear the floorboards crying
In a room on the second floor
That used to be owned by someone who's no one
But he don't live there anymore

Only Rebecca clasping her head in her knees
Trying to work out what it's about
And why someone had to leave

But dry up your tears
Stop counting the years
Don't worry what's coming
Forget all your fears

And the tide will turn for Rebecca
And the tide will turn for Rebecca
Her life will change
Her hopes rearrange
Into something that might really matter

She's all alone in a world of her own
With a key that fits her lonely world
You won't need a crowd to shout out aloud

[AIDA]
Take me in my dreams recurring
Cheerful as a childhood dance
Into one more taste of freedom
One more longing backward glance

In the sway of somber music
I shall never, never understand
Let me slip into the sweeter
Chorus of that other land

The gods love Nubia
The beautiful, the golden
The radiant, the fertile
The gentle and the blessed
The pain of Nubia
Is only for the moment
The desolate the suffering
The plundered, the oppressed

[NEHEBKA]
The gods love Nubia
Their glorious creation
Its songs roll sweetly
Across the harvest plain

[AIDA, NEHEBKA]
The tears of Nubia
A passing aberration
They wash into the river
And are never cried again

[NEHEBKA, AIDA, MEREB, NUBIAN WOMEN]
The gods love Nubia
We have to keep believing
The scattered and divided
We are still its heart
The fall of Nubia
Ephemeral and fleeting
The spirit always burning
Though the flesh is torn apart

[ALL]
Take me in my dreams recurring
Cheerful as a childhood dance
Into one more taste of freedom
One more longing backward glance

The gods love Nubia
The beautiful, the golden
The radiant, the fertile
The gentle and the blessed
The pain of Nubia
Is only for the moment
The desolate the suffering
The plundered, the oppressed
The gods love Nubia
We have to keep believing
Though scattered and divided
We are still it's heart
The fall of Nubia
Ephemeral and fleeting
The spirit always burning
Though the flesh is torn apart
My spirit will keep on burning
Though the flesh is torn -

[AIDA]
- Apart

[ALL]
Take me in my dreams recurring
One more longing backward glance
Often these days
And always these nights
I find I'm afraid
Of the turbulent heights
No matter how crazily
No matter how far
The moments of tenderness
Are those where you are

For when you are laughing
Like silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to calm down
Oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
Once in a while
I slip back to my past
Where I long to remain
But the dream
